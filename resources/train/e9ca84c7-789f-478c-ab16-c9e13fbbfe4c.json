[{"section_title": "", "text": "The Humboldt Bay Stewards hosted a one-day public symposium titled, \"Current Perspectives on the Physical and Biological Processes of Humboldt Bay,\" on March 15, 2004. The meeting was held in the Wharfinger Building on the Eureka waterfront. The purpose of the symposium was to examine biological and physical processes to gain a better understanding of Humboldt Bay. The need for the symposium was clear, as there were many plans, projects and studies ongoing at the time. The symposium included 19 presentations and a panel discussion. Ten of the presentations are included here as papers or in the appendices as a report or plan. A major topic addressed in several papers was sediment sources and transport. Sediment was addressed historically (Tuttle), oceanographically (Crawford and Claasen), in the watershed (Barrett), relative to eelgrass (Shaughnessy et al.), fouling communities (Boyle et al.), and management (Davenport). Though Davenport did not submit a paper on the California Sediment Management Plan, Appendix A includes a copy of this important and innovative plan that was completed in 2006. Other management topics included an overview of the Humboldt Bay Management Plan. Since the symposium, this plan has also been completed and can be found at http://www. humboldtbay.org/. From the biological perspective, papers are included on marine invasive species, eelgrass, fish and fouling communities. Worldwide, increasing attention is directed towards aquatic invasive species and their impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. The presentation on invasive species at this symposium showed their occurrence around Humboldt Bay. The purpose of the study was to provide reliable baseline information for further studies and monitoring. The \"Non-indigenous Marine Species of Humboldt Bay, California\" is included in Appendix II. This study was part of a program funded by the California Department of Fish and Game that included most of the bays and estuaries in California. The full report and list of all species found during the statewide study is at http://www.dfg.ca.gov/ ospr/about/science/misp.html. The innovative fish habitat paper, (Gleason et al.) uses a novel GIS approach to the study of Humboldt Bay fishes. Eelgrass provides a major habitat in Humboldt Bay. Summarizing what we know, don't know and need to know about Humboldt Bay eelgrass provides a fruitful source of many possible studies. Fouling communities have not been previously studied in Humboldt Bay. The study presented here is the beginning of a longterm project that we can expect to hear more about at future symposia."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Major developments to Humboldt Bay over the last 125 years have resulted in a change in erosion rates of various shorelines, deepening of the bay's main channels, decrease of the tidal prism, and variations in the velocity and direction of tidal currents.\nCoastal inlets are by nature dynamic, continually shaped and reshaped by hydrodynamic forces. Waves and tidal currents may cause erosion, picking up sediment for deposition elsewhere. Channels may fill and sandbars may develop, increasing local wave steepness and refocusing wave energy that, in turn, increases risk to ships using the inlet. Expensive engineering projects, such as jetty construction or dredging, are often undertaken to maintain or increase both the safety and the accessibility of an inlet. A detailed understanding of the physical processes provides the basis for design and construction of stable navigation channels, which increases the usefulness of the adjacent harbors. Waves and currents at coastal inlets interact. Inlets concentrate tidal currents, resulting in strong currents and strong interactions with waves. In the presence of a current, waves can refract, steepen, or even break (e.g., Thompson 1949;Wright et al. 1999) and if the current is strong enough, it may even lead to wave blocking. A detailed review of the subject is provided by Jonsson (1990). Currents are also modified by the presence of waves. Waves can generate mean horizontal stress, referred to as radiation stress; gradients of the radiation stress generate mean currents and modify background flows (Longuet-Higgins and Stewart 1964). Much of our understanding of these processes is based on straightforward, idealized models, but the relative importance and consequences in real-world environments are not always obvious. In practice, most efforts to understand the dynamics of a particular coastal inlet revolve around numerical models of waves and tides. Such models, in principle, adequately describe the specific geography and bathymetry of a region, as well as forces and dynamics. Historically, model applications have been limited by computational speed, which in turn limited spatial and temporal resolution and required parameterization of the dynamical terms. In the last decade, advances in computing power and model formulation have allowed numerical simulation of complex wave-current interactions on the scale of coastal inlets (Zhang and Wu 1999;Li and Davies 1996). Such models are still computationally expensive and, in many practical engineering applications, wave and current models are run either independently or with limited interaction (Kraus 2000). The present study is based on the application of specific wave and tide models (STWAVE and ADCIRC) at Humboldt Bay, California. The energetics are relatively strong in this region: tidal currents through the inlet average 2.1 m/s for peak ebb near the entrance (Costa and Glatzel 2002); monthly-averaged significant wave heights, H s , vary between 1.7 and 3.1 m throughout the year (Harris 1999), and large wave events with H s > 7 m are observed during most years. In such a location, wave and current interactions might be expected to be substantial. The goal of the present study is two-fold: using these models to examine predicted wave and current patterns in and around the bay entrance; determining how well the simpler model coupling options (uncoupled and one-way coupled) reproduce the full twoway coupled model runs under various conditions. We define one-way coupling to refer specifically to the case of wave radiation stress fields applied to the circulation model. The two-way coupled models were considered to represent \"reality,\" since they have the most complete modeled physics; uncoupled and one-way coupled models represent simplified (less complete) models. All three modeling approaches were tested under a variety of climatological wave-and tidal-forcing conditions; key fields of interest were currents and significant wave height. Results from the uncoupled and one-way coupled runs were contrasted against the two-way coupled runs to determine how well these simpler models performed.\nThe Humboldt Bay Symposium was organized, in part, to develop a better understanding of how the bay is being managed, and to identify potential new directions for that management. A key issue in the bay's management is the annual dredging conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to maintain the system of navigational channels. Several companion studies within this symposium examined the effects of in-bay currents on sediment movement and accumulation, the potential effects of the Eel and Mad Rivers, located south and north of Humboldt Bay respectively, on sediment delivery to the bay, and evaluations of the biological effects of sediment accumulation and dredging. This study reviews information collected during watershed analysis studies of the Freshwater Creek and Elk River basins to derive some understanding of the quantity and types of sediment being delivered to Humboldt Bay from upland areas. Specific questions examined in this study include: (1) What natural and anthropogenic factors are most important in determining sediment delivery rates to Humboldt Bay? (2) What are the total rates of sediment delivery from these basins to Humboldt Bay? (3) What size sediment is being delivered to the bay, and what is the relative mobility of those sediment fractions? (4) How does yield in Freshwater and Elk compare to other watersheds on the North Coast of California? (5) If the sediment yield from Freshwater and Elk is extrapolated to the entire watershed area of Humboldt Bay, what is the total estimate of sediment delivery from upland areas and how does this compare to sediment amounts being removed from the bay by annual dredging?\nSeagrass communities, such as the eelgrass beds in Humboldt Bay, California, have multiple functions within bays and estuaries including trophic support, nursery and refuge functions and the improvement of water clarity (Fonseca et al. 1982;Williams and Heck 2001). Many of the animals that rely on seagrasses are commercially important and the habitat has high recreational value. These communities and their functions are vulnerable because many beds are comprised of only one seagrass species and so, if natural or anthropogenic stresses reach a lethal threshold for that species, the entire system can collapse. Resource managers charged with preserving these seagrass functions not only need to know the spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of the seagrasses and their animal occupants, but also understand the ecological forces that cause members of the seagrass community to fluctuate in distribution and abundance. There is a reasonable understanding of the location and abundance of eelgrass in Humboldt Bay due to a variety of studies. Most of these have focused on the geographical and temporal variation of eelgrass abundance (Waddell 1964;Harding 1973;Harding and Butler 1979;Shapiro and Associates Inc. 1980;Moore 2002;Moore et al. 2004;Keiser 2004;Rumrill and Poulton 2004;Schlosser, unpub. data). Others have described vertical and/ or geographical eelgrass distributions (Keller 1963;Keller and Harris 1966;Western Ecological Services Company 1990;Miner 1993) and there has been one study of eelgrass primary productivity (Bixler 1982). However, as is the case for many other regions, there is less of an understanding of the mechanisms causing variation in the abundance of eelgrass community members. Research groups and agencies often focus on a subset of mechanisms, in particular the effects of light and nutrients on eelgrass abundance and the oceanographic and land-use practices that affect the light and nutrient environment. This perspective is essential and has improved our understanding of the mechanisms affecting seagrass communities (Hemminga and Duarte 2000), but this focus is also incomplete (Valentine and Heck 1999;Heck et al. 2000). Seagrass productivity, habitat complexity and consequently habitat function could respond positively or negatively to grazing as is the case for terrestrial systems (McNaughton 1985;Belsky 1986;McNaughton et al. 1989McNaughton et al. , 1991 and seagrass systems also benefit from epiphyte grazers (Jernakoff et al. 1996). Many of the people living around Humboldt Bay are engaged in trying to ensure that eelgrass bed functions are maintained. In order to achieve this goal, it will be necessary to keep both perspectives in mind and thus, the overall goal of this study is to bring together in one conceptual model what is known about how these different groups of mechanisms affect eelgrass in Humboldt Bay and to identify what types of information are still lacking. There are a variety of simple to more complex conceptual models of how the abundance of terrestrial or aquatic community members is regulated. When applied to Humboldt Bay, these models provide a less myopic framework for helping us link mechanisms affecting eelgrass distribution and abundance and the same models could be applied to mudflat or high marsh communities. The purpose of these models is to predict the relative number of trophic levels and biomass within each of those levels, as well as the relative importance of mechanisms (i.e., physical processes, biotic interactions) regulating the community. Collectively, they are known as \"top-down, bottomup\" models (Power 1992) and have undergone a series of changes (e.g., Hairston et al. 1960;Oksanen et al. 1981) in order to make them more general. Menge and Sutherland's (1987) environmental stress model (ESM), which is another version of these models, has been useful in understanding community regulation in marine systems and is what we apply to the eelgrass in Humboldt Bay in the present analysis. In the ESM the x-axis is environmental stress instead of productivity, as is the case for earlier bottom-up and top-down models (e.g., Hairston et al. 1960;Oksanen et al. 1981). The y-axis is the relative importance of physical factors and biotic interactions in regulating the community and the z-axis is recruitment (Menge and Sutherland 1987). Stress in the ESM model refers to those physical factors that weaken organisms (Menge and Branch 2001). At their highest levels, these physical factors (e.g., wind-induced breakage of eelgrass shoots, dredging, desiccation) will be the most important in regulating the trophic structure of the community because they cause the rapid loss of biomass or disturbance. At slightly lower levels some of these same physical factors and others (e.g., light, nutrients) result in a bottom-up physiological limitation of productivity. In the absence of disturbance and bottom-up limitation, stress is very low and top-down biotic interactions (e.g., competition, predation) become relatively more important. Neither physical factors nor top-down interactions are important if recruitment of new individuals is very low. Recruitment is considered by this model to be a process independent of the factors that affect environmental stress (Menge and Branch 2001), although this assumption is more valid for animals with well-developed dispersal phases than it is for seagrass seeds. Seagrass communities are generally considered to be on the low end of the environmental stress continuum relative to other terrestrial and aquatic systems, but they still experience physical factors that can be intense enough to result in high stress. Recruitment of seagrasses and especially the animals in these communities can be highly variable (Orth et al. 2000;Williams and Heck 2001). The objectives of this review are: (1) to assess what is known about eelgrass recruitment in the bay, (2) to use a combination of existing and new data presented herein to assess the importance of light, nutrients and other physical factors in affecting the amount of stress experienced by eelgrass in the bay and (3), to emphasize the potential importance of eelgrass grazing by Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) and eelgrass epiphyte grazing by the opisthobranch Phyllaplysia taylori. Since even with the new data presented herein there are still large gaps in our understanding of eelgrass regulation in Humboldt Bay, our last objective is to (4) suggest studies that would make it possible to make the ESM model more complete and thus useful for developing management policies.\nThe intentional or accidental introduction of \"exotic\" species by humans is one of the leading causes of the biodiversity crisis (Wilcove et al. 1998). The release of larvae from the hulls and ballast tanks of ships from distant ports, the dumping of algal \"packing material\" (with associated species) when shipping live organisms for human consumption, and the deliberate introduction of non-native shellfish species for aquaculture have all contributed to an accelerated homogenization of species in coastal marine habitats. As a result, estuarine habitats such as San Francisco Bay (Carlton 1979) are among the most threatened ecosystems in the world (Carlton and Geller 1993). Further knowledge of the mechanisms used by exotic species to invade new locales, and whether particular types of communities repel or facilitate their arrival, is clearly needed. The functional role that successful invaders have on future ecosystem function in marine habitats has been largely unexplored. Invasive species can potentially out-compete native populations and drive them to local extinction. This may in turn affect higher trophic levels (e.g., commercial or sport fisheries), as witnessed by the collapse of the anchovy fishery in the Black Sea from the introduction of an exotic comb jelly (Kideys 2002). Likewise, sessile marine invertebrates attached to ship hulls, docks and other man-made structures often feed on suspended plankton during both their larval and adult phases, and therefore their growth and/or survivorship may reflect changes in planktonic communities within a bay. Benthic-pelagic coupling of communities could have implications for commercial operations, such as the rearing of oysters for human consumption. A baseline study of marine \"fouling\" communities, for example, might establish important biological indicators of early changes in the \"health\" of a bay or estuary. In this study we report on preliminary data from an ongoing effort to monitor the settlement, growth and subsequent establishment of \"fouling\" communities under the Woodley Island Marina in Humboldt Bay, California. Because of Humboldt Bay's location between San Francisco Bay and Coos Bay, Oregon, it receives substantial shipping traffic from fishing vessels traveling up and down the U.S. West Coast, as well as larger, ocean-going vessels traveling from ports as far away as Japan. A study by Boyd et al. (2002) has shown that a substantial number (97) of exotic species currently reside within Humboldt Bay. These exotics represent several major phyla ranging from vascular plants to fish. The largest numbers of invasive species, however, are from various invertebrate taxa including polychaetes (24 species), amphipods (20 species) and bryozoans (8 species). Some of the invasive species identified by Boyd et al. (2002) were likely to have been introduced long ago, from dry ballast or \"shingle\" on wooden ships in the mid-1800s. The most abundant salt marsh cordgrass, Spartina densiflora, was probably introduced in this way to Humboldt Bay from South America sometime in the 1860s. Since its introduction, S. densiflora has become the dominant cordgrass species within Humboldt Bay. For the majority of introduced marine species living in Humboldt Bay, little is known about their natural role within the bay ecosystem. Our work represents one of the first attempts to record the presence of native and exotic species under docks in Humboldt Bay, and to investigate their relative ecological role within fouling communities on man-made structures within the bay. Man-made structures are increasingly common elements along the shoreline of bays and estuaries and may even represent novel habitats for marine invertebrates (Connell 2000). Many of them, including pier pilings and floating docks, have a luxuriant growth of marine invertebrates on them. These systems are relatively easy to study because of their ease of access, and deployment of experiments and data-gathering methods do not require SCUBA gear. Field experiments can address the ongoing debate concerning factors governing time-dependent patterns of succession, such as whether succession leads to alternative stable states or \"climax\" communities (Sutherland 1974;Petraitis and Dudgeon 2004). More applied concerns, including whether exotic species affect local fisheries and other commercial activities, can be examined. Specifically, the goals of this study are to: (1) describe the pattern of settlement and succession in invertebrate \"fouling\" communities within Humboldt Bay, (2) evaluate the relative importance of native and exotic species as space occupiers within this system, and (3) determine the variability in community structure through time. Long-term goals include (1) identification of water-column factors that might influence community structure and perhaps reflect the \"health\" of the bay, (2) establish methods for the early detection of exotic species introductions, and (3) field test recently developed theory on the mechanisms of succession in epifaunal marine communities.\nSome members of California's \"restoration community\" believe that the efforts and costs required to secure authorization from the California Coastal Commission (Commission) to enhance seasonal coastal wetlands are so onerous and the process so obscure that many people do not pursue grant funding to enhance seasonal coastal wetlands in the Coastal Zone. The restoration community has identified four factors that contribute to this dilemma. (1) The California Coastal Act (Act) places priority on \"recovering\" tidelands that were diked, drained and filled more than a century ago (whenever feasible and when it is the least environmentally damaging option) rather than on improving existing freshwater wetlands on land created by dikes. (2) The Act places priority on re-establishing former wetlands rather than on improving the quality of existing wetlands. (3) The Commission requires compensatory mitigation for wetland-enhancement projects that are proposed solely to increase the quality and/or quantity of wetlands. Such projects are \"self mitigating\" and should not require compensatory mitigation. And, (4) the Commission narrowly interprets the state and federal \"no-net-loss\" of wetland areas policies, which severely limits opportunities to enhance the functions and values of existing wetlands. The requirement to reduce wetland habitat area by placing fill, when the sole purpose of the project is to enhance wetlands, should be balanced against improving habitat functions and values. A primary goal of this paper is to help project proponents of seasonal freshwater wetland-enhancement projects understand the Act's regulatory and the Commission's administrative priorities and constraints that may affect approval of applications for Coastal Development Permits (CDP). Members of the Northern California Component of the Pacific Coast Joint Venture (PCJV 2004) hope that if project proponents have such knowledge when applying for wetland-enhancement projects, it will assist Commission staff in their evaluation of and recommendations for Commission approval of such projects.\nAs California's second largest natural bay, Humboldt Bay is a valuable resource to both California and the nation because it offers natural resources, aesthetic appeal, commercial and recreational opportunities, as well as transportation links. Visitors and Humboldt County residents alike value Humboldt Bay for the various attributes that we, as human beings, cannot replicate or replace. The growing number of users and uses, as well as the intended and unintended impacts on the bay's ecosystem, potentially strains its ability to meet ever-changing needs."}, {"section_title": "Diking Off Salt Marshes", "text": "The first diking in Humboldt Bay began in early 1892 when Thomas Bair started reclamation work on 320 acres located 2 miles west of Arcata. The Harpst and Spring Dike was built in 1892 from Butcher Slough (lower Jolly Giant Creek) to Jacoby Creek and upstream to the extent of the highest tides. In the fall of that year, J. Harpst, O.H. Spring, M.P. Roberts, Flanigan, Brosnan & Company, M.B. Morton, and E. Mason petitioned the Humboldt County Board of Supervisors to organize a reclamation district. The Arcata Land Improvement Company was incorporated in 1893 and began ditching and dredging the marshland from the Arcata railroad westward to McDaniel Slough. The diking activities continued for two years and in 1895, the Arcata Land Improvement Company sold the dredger to Dr. Gross who used it to reclaim land on Freshwater Creek. In 1904, E.G. Jackson, R.W. Bull, L. Pacheco, J.C. Bull, A.C. Noe, M.P. Hansen, L. Peterson, and P.J. Peterson, owners of reclaimed land on the Arcata Bottom, petitioned the Board of Supervisors to create a reclamation district for the purpose of operating and maintaining the dike. That reclamation district continues today as District 768. The dike extended mostly along the northern edge of Humboldt Bay. Before the dike was constructed, Humboldt Bay extended up to the corner of Fourth and D Streets in Arcata."}, {"section_title": "Mad River Canal", "text": "The history of the Mad River Canal and associated booms are important because of the significant impacts they had on Humboldt Bay."}, {"section_title": "Proceedings of the 2004 Humboldt Bay Symposium \u2026 9", "text": "The first efforts at connecting the waters of the Mad River with Humboldt Bay were initiated by the incorporation of the Humboldt Bay and Mad River Canal Company. The intent was to divert the Mad River through the Mad River Slough to transport logs into Humboldt Bay. In 1854 a small canal, one-half mile long, was dug from the Mad River to the upper end of Mad River Slough;and, in May 1858, the canal was used for the first time to float logs to the head of Humboldt Bay. The timber was most likely spruce logs from the Arcata Bottoms headed for Humboldt Bay mills. The canal was 8-feet wide by 10-feet deep. Due to its small size, the canal was not very effective for floating logs from Mad River to Humboldt Bay as they could only be floated during high winter flows. The small dimensions of the canal required a catching point and holding area so that a few logs at a time could be moved through the canal. In November 1872, a boom on Mad River holding 100,000 board feet of logs broke during high-water flows. In 1873 the canal was enlarged and in 1874 another boom 600-feet long was constructed to catch and hold 1-2 million board feet of logs at low water; the plan was to float logs through the canal to the head of the bay during high flows. This boom broke and was carried away within a month of its construction. The Mad River Boom Bill was introduced in the state legislature in 1876; and, despite strong arguments against the booms on Mad River, the \"boom to end all booms\" was built in the fall of 1877. Within a few years, Arcata Bottoms farmers were complaining to the Harbor Commissioners about the damage to their lands from sediment and debris deposited from the canal. During a flood event in December 1881, the boom broke, ending efforts to drive logs on the Mad River. In 1886, the Arcata Union declared the canal a \"nuisance\" and wrote that as a \"commercial enterprise it has been a failure.\" The Harbor Commission ordered the canal closed in 1888, but the Mad River continued to break through during winter high water; and it was not until 1890 that efforts were successful in shutting off the river's flow into Humboldt Bay. The impacts of this canal on Humboldt Bay are demonstrated somewhat in the history of the Arcata Wharf, completed at a length of 11,000 feet into the bay in 1855. With the construction of Jolly Giant Mill in 1875, the owners reached an agreement with the Union Wharf Company to extend the wharf another 600 feet, as 20 years of running the Mad River into the bay had silted up deep water. In 1881, when a gale toppled the old warehouse on the wharf into the bay, the editor of the Arcata Leader observed, \"where the old depot stood admonished us how rapidly the channels in the bay are filling up.\" He recalled seeing steamers discharging freight at that old depot, but now \"the channel is so filled as to be useless for all boating purposes.\" By 1883, logging and milling were booming on the Mad River at Blue Lake and North Fork. The Arcata Wharf was handling the export of these products, now moved by rail; and with increase in business, the wharf was extended another 600 feet to \"enhance shipping.\" Lumber continued to be shipped from the wharf into the 1920s; but rail connections to San Francisco, completed in 1914, and sediment accretion in the channel significantly reduced the wharf's commerce. In time, the channels were too shallow to accommodate ocean-going vessels and the wharf was abandoned."}, {"section_title": "Early Dredging", "text": "Humboldt Bay has been maintained for commercial shipping since 1881. One of the earliest dredging projects by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) was along the Eureka waterfront where the water was only 8-9-feet deep at low tide. During the period September 1881 through May 1882, 80,000 cubic yards were dredged to create a channel 10-feet deep, 4,100-feet long and 240-feet wide. In the following years, the channel leading to the south end of the Arcata wharf was initially dredged to a depth of 10 feet, then to a depth of 13 feet and a width of 150 feet. Dredging of the channel to the Arcata Wharf by the USACE ended in the 1930s. In the USACE dredging plans for 1930 and 1938, the spit at King Salmon was designated as a dumping ground for dredge spoils. Other dredging plans designated the south end of Indian Island as a spoils dumping ground. These relatively small dredging projects may have had a minor effect on bank sloughing at the edge of the newly created channels. of only 18 feet at low tide. In 1851 the depth was only 20 feet. In 1853-1854 it was only 16 feet at high tide, and in 1857 it was only 13 feet at high tide. This caused great delays in exporting products and importing supplies. Therefore, after several years of studies by the USACE, it was concluded that several jetties 7,000-8,000 feet in length should be built roughly one-half mile apart in a northwesterly direction. Construction began in May 1889 and was completed in 1899. By 1904, the jetties were in dire need of repair and were rebuilt from 1911 to 1917, again from 1925 to 1927, and repairs made in the 1930s, 1963, 1972 and 1985. Following construction of the jetties, impacts on the bay just inside its entrance were fairly dramatic. Because of erosion, currents associated with the jetties removed what was known as breaker flats just west of the north end of the South Spit, which had absorbed much of the wave energy. Once these breaker flats disappeared and the harbor entrance deepened, wave energy came into the bay and eroded what was known as the Middle Ground, which had protected the shoreline from King Salmon-Buhne Point north to Elk River. The Buhne Point Ranch lost 188 acres in 101 years. The shoreline retreated one-quarter mile. From 1891 to 1929 the beach along the Northwestern-Pacific Railroad eroded landward 600 feet, requiring the company to install 3,000 linear feet of rock revetment in 1930. In 1952 Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) bought the Buhne Point Ranch and immediately lost 50 acres, thereby requiring them to install 3,000 linear feet of revetment. From 1952 to 1954 the railroad, just north of PG&E property, had to place 4,500 linear feet of revetment. These revetments reflect waves that travel northwesterly across the bay and erode the eastern shoreline of the southerly end of the North Spit. Additionally as Buhne Point eroded, it created a sizable sand deposit south of Buhne Humboldt Bay jetties in 1954."}, {"section_title": "Jetties at the Entrance to Humboldt Bay", "text": "Prior to the construction of the jetties, the depth over the bar at the entrance to Humboldt Bay changed drastically from year to year. On September 25, 1850, measurements showed the entrance to be one-half-mile wide with a depth Point and a new spit at the mouth of Elk River. The Elk River spit grew in length by 6,000 feet from 1897 to 1954 and in width by 700-800 feet from 1931 to 1954. The spit deposited at King Salmon attracted the eye of developers; and in 1947 it was acquired, canals were dredged, and 25-foot lots were sold for recreational fishing. Over time, houses were built on those lots. Because of continuing wave action entering through the entrance to Humboldt Bay and the removal of the source of sand following placement of the revetment, the sand spit protecting the community slowly disappeared and by 1982 was completely gone. Groins were installed by the USACE after 600,000 cubic yards of sand and silt were dredged from the entrance of Humboldt Bay and pumped over to King Salmon to replace the sand spit that had been lost due to erosion. The results of the reflected wave generated by these new groins, along with the revetment placed along PG&E's property and the railroad, accelerated erosion along the east side of the North Spit. The eroded areas immediately north of the Samoa Boat ramp and the Coast Guard groins are good examples, and this erosion continues to this day. The jetties were rehabilitated in 1972 with the placement of dolosse on their westerly heads. Following the construction of the jetties in 1899, the width of the south end of the North Spit grew in a westerly direction 3,400 feet. The width of the north end of the South Spit grew 2,600 feet."}, {"section_title": "Construction of the Samoa Bridge 1970-1972", "text": "The bridge approach required some filling that narrowed the width of two of the bay's three main channels. The west channel width at high tide was reduced from 3,000 to 2,000 feet. The middle channel was narrowed from 1,450 to 900 feet; however, the width of the east channel remained unchanged. The velocity of water in the west channel was increased significantly, especially at extreme high tides, because 3,000 linear feet of fill was required for the road across Indian Island and the bridge approach."}, {"section_title": "Harbor Deepening Project", "text": "In 1999 the Humboldt Bay Harbor District undertook a $15-million dredging project to deepen the bay's main navigation channels by 8 or 10 feet. Since that time, local commercial fishermen have noted erosion of various parts of the bay's shoreline or signs of lowering. Continuous monitoring will need to be done to check on the severity of this effect. In 1997 the USACE began to monitor sand erosion and accretion on the west (ocean) side of the North and South Spits. The beach south of Elk River spit along the rock revetment that protects the railroad has dropped significantly in the last few years. Appropriate maintenance will be required to retain the integrity of the railroad bed."}, {"section_title": "Impacts of Developments in the Watersheds Around Humboldt Bay", "text": "This paper concentrated mostly on effects of developments that have occurred on and in Humboldt Bay. Tributaries to Humboldt Bay"}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "Humboldt Bay is the only naturally enclosed, deep-draft harbor between Coos Bay, Oregon, and San Francisco, California. The section of coastline that contains the bay runs in a relatively straight northeast/southwest line from Cape Mendocino in the south to Trinidad Head in the north (Figure 1). Key geological features around the bay entrance are identified in Figure 2. Extensive and rapid shoaling occurs at the Humboldt Bay Bar, Entrance Bay, and Arcata and South Bay Channels as a consequence of natural sediment transport processes. Shoaling is an ongoing problem, restricting safe navigation of deep-draft commercial vessels. To mitigate these influences, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has conducted annual (and occasionally semi-annual) maintenance dredging of the bar and entrance and several navigational channels within Humboldt Bay. In June 2000, the USACE completed a project in Humboldt Bay to deepen the navigational channels from an initial 12 to 15 m to improve deep-draft navigation safety and to maximize the efficient use of the bay and harbor by commercial deep-draft vessels. The bay watershed encompasses about 570 km 2 , with no major rivers in the area emptying directly into the bay. The annual freshwater input to the bay is estimated to be on the order of the tidal prism, 7.4 x 10 7 m 3 (Costa 1982). Humboldt Bay is made up of three subbays, Arcata Bay (or North Bay), Entrance Bay, and South Bay. Both Arcata Bay and South Bay consist of a series of channels and large areas of intertidal flats. The long thalweg between Arcata Bay and Entrance Bay contributes additional complexity to tidal circulation near the entrance. At mean lower low tide, the total area of the bay is 21 km 2 while at mean high tide, the bay area averages 67 km 2 (Costa and Glatzel 2002). Circulation in Humboldt Bay is tidally dominated, which makes for generally wellmixed marine water within the bay. Tides are mixed semi-diurnal, with a mean range of 1.51 m and a diurnal range of 2.11 m at the entrance. About 50% of the tidal prism volume flows to North Bay and 30% to South Bay (Costa and Glatzel 2002). Peak currents at the Humboldt Bay entrance exceed 2.1 m/s, with average peak velocity on ebb tide of 1.0 m/s and 0.82 m/s on flood. The wave climate at Humboldt Bay is extreme in comparison to most U.S. inlets, with waves from the northwest being commonest and waves out of the southwest having the greatest energy (Costa 1982). Significant wave heights up to 7 m can occur annually and swell wavelengths as long as 1,000 m have been observed. The highest energy waves acting in the inlet are thought to significantly influence currents in the bay itself. The convex nature of the bar, the incident wave direction, and the alignment of the jetties tend to focus wave energy into Entrance Bay, causing erosion and influencing sedimentation, mixing, flushing and circulation within Entrance Bay (Costa and Glatzel 2002). Sources of sediment to the entrance are the Eel River, 14 km to the south, and the Mad River, about 24 km to the north. Sediment coming from the Eel during winter months is thought to travel northward, providing material for the ebb shoal as well as depositing in the bay (Costa 1982). In summer, longshore transport may rework some coastal sediments, but the bay sediments remain. Maintenance of the navigational channels continues to be an expensive and time-consuming process. As a preliminary step towards assessment of sedimentation processes at the entrance and within the bay, and to examine alternative approaches to channel maintenance, we have applied wave and tidal circulation models to the Humboldt Bay region. Ultimately these models will be coupled with a sediment transport model to examine erosion and deposition at the bay.\nThe Pacific Lumber Company (PALCO) owns approximately 91,000 hectares (225,000 acres) of coastal redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests in northwestern California approximately 160 km (100 mi) south of the Oregon border ( Figure  1). Company lands are zoned for commercial timber production as their sole use. Although water quality research and monitoring are being conducted across the ownership, this paper focuses on efforts in the two largest basins that drain directly to Humboldt Bay, Freshwater Creek and the Elk River, which represent roughly 25% and 42% of the 324 km 2 (125 mi 2 ) drainage area of the bay, respectively. The Freshwater Creek watershed is a 81 km 2 (31 mi 2 ) drainage basin located approximately 5 Creek, and North Branch North Fork. The Elk River is managed for timber largely by PALCO, which owns approximately 66% of the watershed. Remaining portions of the watershed are parklands owned by the Bureau of Land Management, commercial timberlands owned by Green Diamond Timber Company, and a number of small residences and large cattle and dairy operations."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "STWAVE is a steady-state, finite-difference, spectral wave transformation model developed by the USACE (Resio 1988a,b;Smith et al. 2001). This model is used to quantify changes in wave parameters as waves propagate from deep or intermediate water to the nearshore. STWAVE simulates depth-induced wave refraction and shoaling, depth-and steepnessinduced wave breaking, simplified diffraction, wind-wave growth, and wave-wave interactions and whitecapping that redistribute and dissipate energy in a growing wave field. Influences of depth-averaged currents are also incorporated. The STWAVE model is driven with a two-dimensional wave spectrum at the offshore boundary of the model grid. For the studies described here, offshore wave conditions are based on climatological observations of significant wave height, H s , dominant period, T p , and an assumed dominant wave direction. These quantities were used to generate two-dimensional wave spectra for the outer boundary using the TMA one-dimensional shallow-water spectral shape, a spectral \"peakedness\" coefficient, a directional distribution function, and a directional spreading coefficient (Smith 2001;Smith et al. 2001). Choices for coefficients were based on the recommendations of Thompson et al. (1996); details are provided in Claasen (2003). The tidal circulation model used, AD-CIRC (Luettich et al. 1992), is a finite element, depth-integrated, ocean circulation model. The model included Coriolis force, advection, mixing, and wetting and drying parameterizations; wind forcing is also an option but was not included in the work discussed below. Quadratic bottom stress was used, with a default friction coefficient of 0.025. Forcing data were provided at the outer edge of the model domain using tidal constituents (K1, O1, M2, N2, S2, K2, P1 and Q1) derived from a global tidal model (LeProvost et al. 1994). Bathymetric information represented a blend of data from the STRATAFORM project (Nittrouer and Kravitz 1996), a local high-resolution survey done by R. Flood 1 (pers. comm.) and supplementary data from the GEOphysical DAta System (GEODAS) compiled by the National Geophysical Data Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Development of bathymetric grids for ADCIRC and STWAVE was undertaken using the Surface Modeling System, SMS (Zundel et al. 2002). For ADCIRC, the domain ranges from Baja California to the Alaskan border and extends as far as 400 km offshore. The grid comprises 30,165 elements, 16,174 nodes, with resolution in the surf-zone and the entrance channel on the order of 35 m. The STWAVE domain extended from just south of Trinidad Head to the Eel River mouth and out to roughly 4 km offshore, at water depths of approximately 40 m. The grid for the wave model comprises 218 x 806 points, with a horizontal resolution of 40 m (Claasen 2003). The models were run and most of the postprocessing and data visualization were conducted using SMS (Surface Modeling System, developed by Environmental Modeling Systems, Inc.); additional analyses were developed using Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.). user to control the extent of coupling between the wave and circulation models (Zundel et al. 2002). Water level variations were included in some coupling options by changing the bathymetry of the STWAVE grid according to calculated tidal heights from ADCIRC. The ADCIRC time step was 1.5 s, while the ST-WAVE model was updated every hour. The ADCIRC tidal model was validated against tidal height observations made at the NOAA tide gauge located on the north spit of Humboldt Bay (40\u00b0 46.0 / N, 126\u00b0 13.0 / W) during August 2001. Wave conditions were generally low, with mean H s = 1.5 m (maximum 3.5 m) and mean T p = 9 s (maximum 20 s). Performance was very good, with all model values within 6% of observations and a majority of the model values within 4% of observed water level. Mean difference between modeled values and measurements at the tide station for the month was 0.04 m with a standard deviation of 0.017 m. A 36-hour segment of this comparison is shown in Figure 3. As mentioned previously, we considered three types of model coupling: uncoupled, in which STWAVE and ADCIRC were run independently of each other; one-way coupling, in which STWAVE radiation stress gradients were input into ADCIRC; and two-way (or full) coupling, in which ADCIRC currents were input to STWAVE and radiation stresses from STWAVE were input to ADCIRC. We have conducted wave and tide model runs corresponding to 36 combinations of offshore wave forcing and model-coupling conditions. Tidal conditions for all of these cases corresponded to the spring tides sequence from January 1 to 3, 2002, which allowed us to look at a wide range of tidal currents. Results are discussed extensively in Claasen (2003). Here we present a few examples to illustrate some of the circulation and wave-field patterns predicted by the models, as well as some of the differences in results based on the choice of model coupling. In particular, we will focus on some results for \"large\" and \"small\" offshore waves, defined by climatological conditions for January (H s = 3.1 m, T p = 13.2 s; hereafter referred to as large wave conditions) and August (H s = 1.7 m, T p = 8.9 s; hereafter referred to as small wave conditions, although we note that such waves may be considered moderate or large in some areas of the world). We consider two dominant offshore wave directions: 308\u00b0 (waves roughly from the northwest, and approximately parallel with the jetties and entrance to the bay; hereafter referred to as down-jetty waves) and 253\u00b0 (waves roughly from the west-southwest, at an angle of about 55\u00b0 to the jetty orientation; hereafter referred to as cross-jetty waves). We also focus primarily on conditions during peak ebb. Claasen (2003) discusses a variety of other model runs, spanning different climatological conditions, wave directions and coupling conditions. For each model run, forcing in the AD-CIRC model was ramped over a two-day time interval (Zundel et al. 2002). Both tidal and wave forcing were scaled from zero to full strength using a hyperbolic tangent function over the first model run day, with the second day included to allow for any additional model adjustment. Results for the third day were archived at half-hour intervals for subsequent analysis. The ramping period was necessary for the ADCIRC model as sudden, strong forcing can shock the system, producing instability in the solutions (Zundel et al. 2002). A few additional model runs were extended to a fourth day to confirm model behavior. The third and fourth model days were generally nearly identical (except for the phase shift in times of high and low tides due to the lunar day), which helped to validate the use of model calculations from the third day. In other words, differences among model runs on day 3 were not merely due to model spin-up.\nThe Elk River and Freshwater Creek watershed analyses were prepared in conjunction with PALCO's Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). Under the terms of the HCP, a team of state, federal, and company scientists evaluated watershed conditions in Freshwater and Elk from 1999to 2003and 2003to 2004, respectively, following methods in PALCO's HCP (2000. These, in turn, follow the general approaches contained in the Washington Department of Natural Resources Methodology (WDNR 1997), but with modifications more appropriate for locations within the redwood zone. With respect to sediment budgets, these watershed analyses included landslide inventories, modeling of surface erosion from roads us-ing SEDMODL (WDNR 1997), modeling of surface erosion from hill slopes using the Water Erosion Prediction Project (Elliot et al. 2000), and in Freshwater, estimates of bed load and suspended sediment transport rates. The results of these watershed studies have been published and distributed to the public (PALCO 2003(PALCO , 2004b. Estimates of sediment production used here are from the period 1987 to 1998 (Freshwater) and 1987 to 2000 (Elk). These dates correspond to aerial photographic surveys, and are generally coincident with the use of contemporary state forest practice rules, although the periods almost entirely precede implementation of more protective practices associated with PALCO's HCP. Each sediment budget allocated sediment sources to natural or management-related sources, thereby allowing some estimate of the degree to which management has increased sediment inputs in these basins. Similarly, soil surveys for Humboldt County (McLaughlin and Harradine 1965), and site investigations in the Elk and Freshwater analyses were used to estimate the grain sizes of sediments being delivered from the watersheds. Sediment transport studies were conducted as part of the Freshwater analysis, extrapolated to Elk River, and used in both basins to make estimates of the mobility of sediments entering watercourses and, qualitatively, of sediment mobility within Humboldt Bay.\n"}, {"section_title": "Proceedings of the 2004 Humboldt Bay Symposium \u2026 19", "text": "Because the ADCIRC output was archived at half-hour intervals, estimates of the timing for maximum ebb and maximum flood were considered to be \u00b1 15 minutes. We note, however, that both wave-generated currents and the particular choice for coupling mode could modify the circulation patterns. Thus a \"true\" definition of higher high water (HHW) and peak current times depended on the particular model run and coupling conditions. Given these issues, it was considered most useful to compare different model results at the same time step and to base the definition of maximum ebb and maximum flood on the uncoupled ADCIRC model run. Figure 4a, b and c displays the circulation pattern near the bay entrance for small waves oriented down-jetty at peak ebb for the uncoupled, one-way coupled, and two-way coupled model runs, respectively. (We note that Figure  4a corresponds to the predicted flow at peak ebb for all uncoupled model runs.) Without coupling, the ebb jet at Humboldt Bay fills much of the space between the jetties, narrowing as it approaches the jetty tips ( Figure  4a). Offshore, the model predicts the ebb jet to remain relatively narrow and to sweep from south to north over the course of the ebb cycle. A large, low-velocity circulation cell appears in the middle of the ebb cycle and spins off to the northwest as slack tide approaches. Current velocities reach 1.8 m/s over most of the width of the entrance. Peak velocities of 2.3 m/s were obtained."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "\n\nThe mean grain-sizes of the surface sediments (upper 5 cm of sediment) in Humboldt Bay are shown in Figure 3. In general, the mean grain size decreased with increasing elevation and distance landward from the ocean inlet, as Thompson (1971) noted previously. The sample with the largest mean diameter was obtained from the bay inlet, between the two entrance jetties. The trend of decreasing sediment size with distance from the inlet was not followed in areas where: 1) the main channel constricted and coarsergrained sediments were encountered, or 2) dredging had widened the channel and finer-grained sediments were sampled. The break in trend can be easily seen in a graph of mean sediment size of channel sediments versus the distance to the bay inlet ( Figure 4). Other statistical parameters such as median, dispersion and, to a lesser degree, kurtosis show similar trends with variations occurring in the up-channel direction and laterally from the center of the channel up onto the tidal flats.\nWater Clarity: Turbidity Versus Tides, Precipitation and Wind Turbidity values greater than 50 NTU occurred throughout the year but were more common during the fall and winter months ( Figure 3A). Changes in turbidity less than 50 NTU correspond to the rise and fall of the tide, with peak values (usually from 10.0 to 20.0 NTU) occurring at the lowest point of the ebb tide ( Figure  3b). Each day, the lower of the two low tides is when the greatest turbidity value occurred. Turbidity values from 50.0 to 200.0 NTU occurred at multiple times throughout the tidal curve ( Figure 3c). Salinities dropped to almost 15 ppt during the late fall and winter when precipitation, mostly in the form of rain, occurred ( Figure  4). Salinities always decreased on the ebb tide and increased on the flood tide ( Figure 5a). From 24 to 48 hrs following a precipitation event, such as those that occurred on February 6, 16, 18 and 24, 2004, there was a larger drop in salinity than occurred during times of no precipitation (Figure 5a). Turbidity events from 50.0 NTU to 200.0 NTU occurred during or just after precipitation events. Following periods of precipitation, it took more days for turbidity values to diminish to less than 50.0 NTUs when total precipitation was greater (e.g., February 17, 2004-February 21, 2004) than when total precipitation was lower (e.g., late February 24, 2004-early February 27, 2004; Figure 4a,b). Specific turbidity spikes during these same periods of precipitation occurred during ebb tidal stages (Figure 5a,b). Peaks of monthly precipitation during 2004 when this comparison to turbidity was made were about half of those recorded for 1997 and 2003 and about 2.5 times greater than 2001 values ( Figure 6). Wind velocities recorded by the offshore Eureka NOAA Buoy did not show a relationship with turbidity events in the bay, especially those events greater than 50.0 NTU. The largest cluster of high turbidity values occurred during September and October 1993, which was one of the calmest periods for wind speeds (Figure 7). Wind velocities during representative summer and early fall periods were lower than during the winter, and wind directions during the summer were primarily out of the northwest. During the fall, winds were from all directions except the west and southwest and the winter was dominated by east and southeasterly winds (Figure 8 a-c). Increases in turbidity values during these same three periods, especially those greater than 50 NTU or 200 NTU, occurred across the full range of wind speeds and directions. Turbidity values greater than 200 NTU during the early fall corresponded to low-wind velocities (i.e., 2.0-3.0 mph) out of the southeast and east; and although high-wind velocities (i.e., 15.0-20.0 mph) during mid-February 2004 are followed by increases in turbidity, prolonged high-wind velocities out of the same direction at the beginning and end of the same month do not show this relationship (Figure 8 b-c).\nPoint and line coverages were created to depict sampling locations in Humboldt Bay (Figure  7). Before the marine, palustrine and riverine habitat types were condensed into one, the Humboldt Bay coverage contained a total of 89 habitat types, under the five major headings: estuarine, marine, palustrine, riverine and uplands (Table 1). For a complete description of habitat types, see Gleason, Appendix A. For a specific example, the first habitat type in Figure  7, E1AB3L, describes a habitat type where E = Estuarine, 1= Subtidal, AB = Aquatic Bed, 3 = Rooted Vascular, L = Subtidal. Upland habitat made up most of the area of the coverage, followed by the three marine habitat types. There were 1,022 palustrine habitat polygons making up 60 different habitat types. The entire coverage was made up of 19 estuarine habitat types. Within the coverage, Humboldt Bay and immediately surrounding wetted areas contained 16 estuarine habitat types (Table 2). Of these estuarine habitats, 12 were sampled during the study. A total of 67 identified fish species from 25 families were collected in Humboldt Bay using all methods between September 15, 2000 and November 30, 2001 (Table 3). The ten most abundant species accounted for 94.75% of the total catch; the three most abundant made up over 55%. The threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, was the most abundant species collected, with 15,655 individuals captured at 108 separate sites. Shiner surfperch, Cymatogaster aggregata, and topsmelt, Atherinops affinis, were the second and third most abundant, respectively. The seventh most abundant species, the Pacific staghorn sculpin, Leptocottus armatus, was collected at 60.44% of the sites, the most of all species. Similarly, the fifth most abundant species, surf smelt, Hypomesus pretiosus, was collected at 38.32% of all sites. Topsmelt, the third most abundant species, was also the third most commonly collected species, closely following surf smelt with 38.01%. Juveniles of the family Osmeridae were not identified to species. In the results, these are counted as a separate species. One green sturgeon was collected in Samoa Channel outside these survey dates. Eight of the survey points fell within the upland polygons, and 12 fell in palustrine. All but two of these points were actually in a narrow drainage ditch that runs alongside a diked area of North Bay. Based on personal observation, the habitat type of this channel is most likely E2US3N, as it is: estuarine (E), intertidal (2), with an unconsolidated shore (US), made up of predominately muddy sediment (3), and is regularly flooded (N). Therefore, the 18 sample points within this channel were assigned habitat type E2US3N. The other two points were assigned to habitat type E2EM1N, where E = estuarine, 2 = intertidal, EM = emergent, 1 = persistent, meaning emergent vegetation that remains, rather than falls to the surface at the end of the growing season, and N = regularly flooded. All trawls were focused within the deeper portions of the bay. Therefore, the majority of lines fall within the habitat E1UB2L, where E = estuarine, 1 = subtidal, UB = unconsolidated bottom, 2 = sand, and L = subtidal. However, two trawls entered more than one habitat type while sampling. It is impractical to separate the catch of these trawls by habitat type because the particular habitat where the species were collected is unknown. These two trawls and resulting fish collected are listed at the end of this section. The following results are listed separately by habitat type in order of area, largest to smallest. A short description of species collected by subbay, specifically North Bay, Entrance Bay, and South Bay, is also presented.     This habitat type has the largest area of estuarine habitat in Humboldt Bay at 32.81%. Twenty-five percent of the sampling points fell in this habitat type (Table 4). A total of 19,425 individuals from identified species including juveniles from the family Osmeridae were collected; nearly half of these were threespine stickleback (48.93%). Northern anchovy and Pacific staghorn sculpin followed in abundance. Forty plainfin midshipman, Porichthys notatus, averaging 36.60 mm in size were also collected at three points. Eighty-six leopard sharks, Triakis semifasciata, were also collected at two points in this habitat type. The largest was approximately 1,219 mm. Seven tidewater gobies, Eucyclogobius newberyi, and three unidentified juvenile rockfish were also collected in habitat type E2US3N. Eighteen points that fell in both upland and palustrine habitat polygons on the map were assigned this habitat type for purpose of analysis. These fish were collected in a narrow channel that parallels the contour of the bay along both the northern and western border. The map depicts this slough as a line, and therefore has no associated habitat data. A total of 3,532 fish were collected (Table 5). Threespine stickleback were collected at 12 points, Pacific staghorn sculpin were collected at 11 of the points. However, threespine stickleback made up 86.66% of the total catch. Pacific staghorn sculpin and topsmelt each made up less than 5% of the total catch. The remaining 3.74% included 14 other species, including juveniles of the family Osmeridae.\n"}, {"section_title": "Circulation Patterns at Peak Ebb", "text": "For the small, down-jetty wave conditions, the current fields are deformed significantly near peak ebb in both the one-way and twoway coupling cases ( Fig. 4b and c). Both of these coupled cases show a slight, southward deflection of the ebb jet over the Humboldt Bar, a narrowing of the current stream in the entrance channel, and a net current into the channel along the north jetty. The one-way coupled case ( Figure 4b) produces a maximum current speed of 2.2 m/s in the entrance channel with mean current rate over the navigation channel 1.5 m/s. The two-way coupled case ( Figure 4c) shows a maximum current rate of 2.1 m/s in the entrance with a 1.5 m/s mean current speed in the navigation channel. Although the one-way and two-way coupled cases are similar, the one-way case deflects the current stream southward just offshore of the entrance as compared to the two-way coupled case. In addition, the one-way coupled case generates stronger currents (by as much as 0.3 m/s) than the two-way coupled case along the north jetty and over the channel shoal. For the larger, longer waves typical of winter conditions, the effect of coupling on the current field becomes much more evident. For the one-way coupled, large wave, downjetty model run (Figure 5a), the basic shape of the current fields remains the same as for the similar small wave case (Figure 4b), but the maximum currents in the navigation channel exceeds 4.1 m/s. Mean speed in the navigation channel are 2.1 m/s and currents into the bay along the north jetty are as high as 2.4 m/s. Compared with the uncoupled model output ( Figure 4a), offshore currents in this case reach higher speeds, and are confined to a 300-m-wide channel along the south jetty; the ebb jet is also deflected southwards relative to the uncoupled case. In the two-way coupled, large wave, down-jetty case (Figure 5b), currents differ significantly from the one-way model output over the entire entrance area. In the navigation channel the two-way coupled model predicts peak currents of 2.2 m/s, with a spatially averaged current of 1.6 m/s and the main portion of the ebb jet is diverted north 170 m compared to the one-way case. In the one-way coupled case, extremely high currents are predicted at the inside tip of the south jetty, whereas in the two-way case these currents are not apparent. From the difference in current magnitude between two-way and one-way models (Figure 5c), the one-way solution predicts up to 50 cm/s lower currents within the navigational channel than the two-way coupled solution does, and up to 50 cm/s higher currents to the north of the channel. Both of these models predict a flow into the entrance towards the north jetty during this strongly ebbing flow, presumably driven by radiation stresses. Figure 6a and b shows the current fields at peak ebb for the \"cross-jetty\" (253\u00b0) case of large waves (H s = 3.1 m, T p = 13 s) arriving at an angle to the jetties, corresponding to the one-way and two-way coupled runs respectively. For the one-way coupled case (Figure 6a), ebbing currents are concentrated in the navigation channel and peak there at 2.1 m/s. Mean ebb current in the navigation channel is 1.8 m/s in this case. Along the inside of the north jetty, currents are directed into the entrance and reach 1.9 m/s. Offshore the ebb jet is deflected northward by the radiation stress gradients over the Humboldt Bar (compare to Figure 4a). For the two-way coupled case (Figure 6b), current patterns are much the same within the entrance, although slightly higher in the navigation channel (2.3 m/s peak and 1.9 m/s mean). Onshore currents along the inside of the north jetty in the two-way coupled case are typically 0.1 m/s less than in the oneway case. Currents over the channel shoal in the two-way case are also less than in the one-way case. The largest differences between the oneway and two-way cases are seen outside the entrance, over the Humboldt Bar (Figure 6c). In the two-way coupled case, the ebb jet is turned sharply northward at the western edge of the bar, while in the one-way coupled case, the deflection is much less significant. In addition, just south of the south jetty, a very well-defined clockwise eddy with currents on the order of 1 m/s is present in the one-way solution. In the two-way solution, the flow is more erratic and generally slower, although a distinct eddy can be seen in roughly the same location. Figure 7 displays the significant wave-height fields for small, down-jetty waves at peak ebb for both one-way and two-way coupled runs (by our definition of one-way coupling, the wave fields for uncoupled and one-way coupled runs are the same). Within the navigational channel, the mean difference between the two runs was 0.5 m. Over the channel shoal, the two-way coupled case predicts waves up to 1.1 m higher than the one-way coupled case. Over the whole Entrance Bay, the two-way coupled solutions are at least 0.25 m larger than the one-way coupled solutions. Over the Humboldt Bar, the two-way case is up to 0.9 m times higher than the one-way case."}, {"section_title": "Wave-Height Patterns at Peak Ebb", "text": "For the large wave, down-jetty runs, the difference in wave-height fields near peak ebb tide is even more dramatic. Figure 8 shows differences of up to 2.8 m in significant wave height between two-way and one-way coupling cases. On average, over the navigation channel the two-way coupled case predicts waves that averaged 2.1 m higher than the one-way coupled case. The two-way case also shows increased wave heights over the Humboldt Bar relative to the uncoupled case. Waves in the Entrance Bay average 1.0 m higher in the two-way solution over the one-way solution. Wave-height fields for large, cross-jetty waves near ebb tide ( Figure 9) show similar results as those from large, down-jetty waves. The two-way coupled model predicts significantly higher waves in the navigation channel, over the channel shoal, and in the Entrance Bay than did the one-way model. The peak differ-ence in wave height in the navigation channel is 1.7 m; and over the channel shoal, the peak difference in wave height is 1.9 m."}, {"section_title": "Circulation and Wave-Height Patterns at", "text": "Peak Flood Here we consider a few cases of circulation and wave heights at peak flood for comparison. Figure 10a, b and c shows the current patterns at peak flood for large, down-jetty waves (uncoupled, one-way coupled and two-way coupled, respectively). For the uncoupled case, currents average 1.1 to 1.3 m/s across the width of the entrance. For the one-way coupled run, currents are spread over 80% of the width of the entrance and averaged 2.2 m/s. Large circulating current fields both to the north and to the south of the entrance are predicted in both one-and two-way coupled model runs but not in the uncoupled case, indicating these flows are all wave-driven. In the two-way case, higher currents funnel into the navigation channel near the channel shoal ( Figure 10c). Overall, the average current speed within the entrance is 2.1 m/s, about 0.1 m/s less than in the one-way case. The uncoupled case shows higher currents over the shallower north side of the entrance channel than the one-way case, while the oneway case showed higher currents in the navigation channel. In general, the two-way case shows higher currents in the navigation channel than the one-way case, particularly near the channel shoal and into the turning basin, while the one-way case predicts higher currents along the shallower north side of the entrance and over the channel shoal (Figure 10d). Differences in current magnitude between one-way and two-way coupled cases in the navigation channel at this time average 0.54 m/s and are as large as 0.78 m/s. Associated wave heights at peak flood are shown in Figure 11. The wave heights for these one-way and two-way cases are similar up to the channel shoal, at which point the two-way coupled solution predicts significantly larger waves than the one-way coupled case for the whole Entrance Bay. These larger waves presumably break, because within the bay we see larger waves in the one-way case. The mean difference in wave height for the Entrance Bay is 0.54 m."}, {"section_title": "Time Series Along Transects", "text": "Given the potential complexity associated with the nonlinear interaction between waves and tides, we compare time series from one-and two-way interactions at fixed locations. In particular, time series data are examined at specific nodes along three distinct cross-channel transects ( Figure 12). Wave height and current velocities are extracted at these points for each of the cases presented above. One and two-way coupled model solutions and differences are plotted as time series for the five nodes nearest the navigation channel for each transect. Under the highest energy wave spectra, differences in wave heights and currents are observed at transect nodes for all tide stages. Further differences are brought to light with the time series plots. Figure 13 shows time series of vector velocities along Transect 2 for oneway and two-way coupled models under large, down-jetty wave conditions (additional information on Transect 1 and 3 can be found in Claasen 2003). Current differences are greater between coupling cases for the first 12 hours of observation and lesser beyond that time. In addition, there is a substantial phase difference in the first part of the day that disappears in the second half. To determine whether or not these results are a consequence of the coupled models still approaching a stable solution, these model runs are extended out an additional day. The same results are observed: larger model differences earlier in the day and smaller differences later in the day. At this transect location, the peak difference is 2.11 m/s and the mean rms* difference is 0.63 m/s. Over the second half of the observation day, the peak difference between velocities along transect 2 is reduced to 0.24 m/s. Mean rms* differences for the last twelve hours are also reduced to 0.09 m/s and 0.11 m/s for Transect 1 and Transect 2, respectively. Further back in the entrance, at Transect 3 ( Figure 13), the peak velocity difference is 0.09 m/s with the mean rms* difference of 0.04 m/s. Phase shifts among the two model runs are much less obvious. Our interpretation is that the flow patterns within the entrance can be very complex in space and time under strong wave and tidal flow conditions, but the effects are much less as one moves further into the bay."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The entrance to Humboldt Bay is, as expected, a place where waves and flows can interact with each other to a significant extent. Examination of the above climatological cases showed that differences in current fields between model coupling cases increased as the wave energy increased. For the lowest wave conditions, oneway and two-way coupled current magnitude fields shared the same basic features. For the 1.7-m waves, the maximum difference in current velocity for all cases was 0.31 m/s. Mean differences in current speeds were 0.08 m/s near slack tide, with the greatest disparities concentrated around bathymetric features such as the channel shoal. For both of the larger input wave cases the basic shape of the current field changed between coupling modes. The wave-height fields were most affected by bathymetry, current velocity (for the two-way coupled model), and offshore wave direction. Both wave height and current fields showed significant differences in solutions between model coupling modes near bathymetric features, such as the entrance to the navigation channel and the channel shoal for the larger input wave energies. Applying the above information to the Humboldt inlet, it was clear that the two-way coupled model was required for greater accuracy under most wave conditions. The largest wave climatology cases discussed in this paper were less than one-quarter as energetic as some of the waves observed regularly near the Humboldt Bay entrance (although some of this energy may dissipate due to wave breaking before the waves reach the entrance). The large tidal prism and narrow entrance at Humboldt Bay combine to produce high-velocity currents in and out of the bay's mouth. Based on the results of this study and the more detailed analysis of Claasen (2002), we recommend that the two-way coupled model be used at Humboldt Bay when the wave conditions are comparable to spring or winter climatology (H s > 2.4 m; T p > 11 s), or when moderately large waves (H s~ 1.8 m) arrive at significant angles to the entrance (> 20\u00b0 away from channel alignment), or in the presence of moderate tidal currents (> 1.5 m/s).     5.

Second, yields from Elk and Freshwater were averaged, and this average yield rate was then applied to the total area draining to Humboldt Bay. Due to changes in the dominant geologic formations, this likely results in an overestimate of sediment yield rates for areas in the northern portion of the drainage basin of the bay (e.g., Jacoby Creek) and an underestimate for lands located in the south portion (e.g., Salmon Creek). Thus, the analyses of sediment yield presented for the entire bay are illustrative, but should be viewed with an appropriate level of caution. The resulting estimate of total sediment yield was then compared to the total amount of sediment being dredged from the bay each year, and the amounts being removed from just the interior channels of the bay. These dredging figures were derived using data presented at the symposium by the USACE on the volume of sediment that has been dredged annually from Humboldt Bay (Connor 2004). After deleting the outlying years of 1999 and 2003, figures for the period were used to estimate an approximate range of total sediment removal for the period 1993-2003. Due to high variance among years, a range was selected. For interior channels the average volume dredged was estimated for the period 1991-2003. All volumetric estimates were converted into estimates of mass using a conversion of 2,600 kilograms/cubic meter (4,382 pounds/yard 3 )."}, {"section_title": "Natural Factors Affecting Sediment Yield", "text": "The watershed analyses found large differences in sediment yield, sediment transport rates, and sediment grain sizes associated with the major geologies in the upslope area. In particular, the Wildcat formation, which is composed predominantly of poorly consolidated mudstones and siltstones, had high surface erosion rates, numerous mass wasting-related sediment sources, and delivered primarily silts and clays to streams. Wildcatderived soils can be thought of as consisting almost entirely of silts and clays with relatively low amounts of sand and almost no gravel or cobble ( Figure 2). Wildcat-derived streams are generally low gradient and have bottoms composed of sands, silts and clays. Because the majority of the sediment yield to streams is composed of very small particles, it is likely that most sediment is transported predominantly as suspended sediment or \"wash load\" during high flows from the watersheds and into Humboldt Bay. By contrast, the Franciscan sandstone and Yager formations in Elk and Freshwater had lower rates of surface erosion. Franciscan-and Yager-derived soils also contain a high proportion of silt and clay, but have much higher levels of sand, gravel, and cobble-sized material ( Figure 2). Accordingly, stream reaches underlaid by these formations often contain gravels, cobbles and boulders, and have higher gradients. Although a majority of the sediment from these formations is fine grained, and therefore has high transport rates, the larger clast sizes (i.e., gravel and larger) have much lower sediment transport rates and may require decades to be transported to Humboldt Bay."}, {"section_title": "Freshwater", "text": "Creek aptly demonstrates the effects of geology on sediment yield. The Freshwater fault approximately bisects the basin, with Wildcat formation geologies and soils to the west of the fault, and Franciscan and Yager geologies and soils to the east of the fault (Figure 3). Given its more poorly consolidated and fine-grained nature, areas underlaid by Wildcat geology were estimated to have much higher rates of potential surface erosion than areas underlaid by Franciscan and Yager formation ( Figure 4). By contrast, hill slope landslide rates were often similar (e.g., 5.19 landslides/km2 in Freshwater) on both Wildcat and Franciscan sediments. However, areas underlaid by Wildcat formation generally consist of low relief, rolling terrain, while the Franciscan and Yager formations are associated with much steeper and higher elevation typography with stream channels frequently having higher gradients and \"v-notch\" shaped drainages. Therefore, based on typography, one would expect higher hill slope landslide incidences in areas underlaid by Franciscan and Yager formation geologies. Thus, the relative parity of landslide rates among the geologic formations demonstrates the relative susceptibility of Wildcat formation geologies to mass wasting processes."}, {"section_title": "Anthropogenic Influences", "text": "The Freshwater Creek and Elk River watershed analyses both found that the anthropogenic activities associated with timber harvesting had increased sediment yields over naturally occurring levels. Anthropogenic sources of sediment represented approximately 70% of total sediment yield in Freshwater, and approximately 55% of sediment yield in Elk River. Thus, in both basins management activities have approximately doubled to tripled total sediment delivery to Humboldt Bay. The particular sources of sediment differ by basin, however. In Freshwater Creek roadsurface erosion was, by far, the most important source of management-related sediment ( Figure  5). The second most important management source was landslides associated with roads. Together, roads represented more than 88% of all management-related sediment delivery in Freshwater. All other management-related sediment sources, including hill slope landslides and erosion from harvested areas, were relatively unimportant. In Elk River, by contrast, landslides were the most important source of managementrelated sediment ( Figure 6). Landslides from harvested areas and from roads and management features alongside streamside areas were all approximately of equal importance as management-sediment sources in Elk. Road surface erosion, however, was a relatively unimportant sediment source. As in Freshwater, surface erosion in harvested areas and other sediment sources were relatively unimportant. In evaluating anthropogenic influences then, it is clear that roads are a significant sediment source, even if the particular mechanism of sediment generation and delivery differs by area. Given that timber harvesting has occurred in the Elk and Freshwater basins for over 100 years and that, consequently, many of the roads were constructed with little or no environmental consideration, this finding is not surprising. Somewhat differently, landslides from hill slope and streamside areas do not appear to be important within Freshwater Creek, nor from certain portions of the Elk River basin dominated by more stable geologic types. Thus, although the sediment yield from hill slope and streamside landslides is important in Elk River, and by extension is likely to be important within other upland areas of Humboldt Bay, the watershed analyses indicate that its importance may be relatively localized to particular geologic or topographic conditions."}, {"section_title": "Estimates of Sediment Yield", "text": "Estimates of total sediment yield (i.e., natural and anthropogenic sources combined) for Freshwater Creek and Elk River are available from a variety of sources including suspendedsediment studies from Salmon Forever and PALCO, and from the sediment budgets in the Elk River and Freshwater watershed analyses. In common with many estimates of sediment yield, these values differ significantly from year to year, and from one another (Table 1). In part this is to be expected given differences in storm frequency and intensity from year to year, and due to differences in the natural and anthropogenic conditions already discussed. Still, the majority of estimates of sediment yield are in the range of 131-295 metric tons/km 2 /yr (375-843 tons/mi 2 /yr) ( Table 1). A simple averaging of all the estimates produces a value for sediment yield of about 192 metric tons/km 2 / yr (550 tons/mi 2 /yr) for the Elk and Freshwater basins. The entire upland area draining to Humboldt Bay is approximately 324 km 2 . The product of this area and the average sediment yield given above provides an estimate of total sediment delivery from upslope areas draining to the bay of 62,532 metric tons/yr (68,750 tons/yr)."}, {"section_title": "Comparison to Other Sediment Yields", "text": "The EPA has estimated natural sediment yields of 40-137 metric tons/km 2 /yr (115-390 tons/ mi 2 /yr) for a variety of North Coast watersheds as part of its ongoing program of developing TMDLs. The CGS reanalyzed these data (CGS 2003) and concluded that the estimated natural sediment yield for the watersheds covered by EPA was more likely to be within the range of 105-1,051 metric tons/km 2 /yr (300-3,000 tons/mi 2 /yr). The Freshwater and Elk estimates of total sediment yield exceed most of the EPA's estimates of natural sediment yield, which could be expected, given that the comparison is of total yields versus only natural yields. By contrast, the higher values of natural sediment yield calculated by CGS exceed all estimates of total yield for Elk and Freshwater. A different estimate of sediment yield comes from records of the annual amount of sediment dredged out of Humboldt Bay by the USACE. Because this dredging is designed to restore the depths of navigation channels to fixed levels, this dredging is a de facto estimate of the amount of sediment entering Humboldt Bay on a yearly basis. When volumes are converted to mass, these records (Connor 2004) indicate that annual dredging in Humboldt Bay ranges from 1.2 to 2.4 million metric tons (1.3-2.6 million tons). Some caution must be accorded the higher values, as they are affected by efforts in the past few years to increase the depth of several navigation channels. However, only twice in the past 13 years has dredging removed less than 1.2 million metric tons. The USACE records separately list the subset of sediments removed from interior channels of Humboldt Bay (USACE 2006*). These estimates are affected to a far lesser degree by efforts to increase the depth of navigation channels because the majority of this effort was focused on the bar and entrance to Humboldt Bay. For the period of 1991-2003 dredging of interior channels has removed as little as 60,000 metric tons (66,100 tons) and as much as 695,800 metric tons (767,000 tons). An approximate average over the period is 348,053 metric tons (383,664 tons)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The Humboldt Bay Symposium included a variety of speakers addressing sediment management within the bay, and the effects of sedimentation and sediment management on various biologic and ecological components of the bay. These presentations made it clear that there is a great deal of interest in sediment inputs to *Paper was reviewed and updated since presentation to include relevant citations. Humboldt Bay, and how those sediment inputs might be better managed to support the various natural resource and commercial qualities of the bay. The work presented here documents several general patterns of sediment input from the Freshwater and Elk watersheds, many of which are likely applicable to most or all of the upland areas draining to Humboldt Bay. First, \"geology is destiny;\" sediment yields and the relative importance of specific sediment-generating processes are affected by the types of soils and geology that are present. The relative proportions of the dominant geologic types varies by location, with more northern areas such as Jacoby Creek underlaid primarily by Franciscan and Yager formation sediments, and more southern areas such as Salmon Creek dominated by Wildcat formation. Thus, a corollary is that one should expect heterogeneity in total sediment yield, grain sizes of delivered sediment, and sediment transport rates to and through Humboldt Bay from the different watershed areas. The second general pattern is that management activities have increased sediment yields. This is an intuitively obvious result, but the work here does offer the advantage of estimating the magnitude of this increase; management activities have roughly doubled to tripled sediment delivery rates over natural levels. The third general pattern, like the first, relates to watershed heterogeneity, in this case to the relative importance of different management effects on sediment yield. In Freshwater, road surface erosion was by far the most important management-related sediment source. Yet in Elk, which lies immediately adjacent to Freshwater, road-surface erosion was unimportant as a sediment source. Instead, three types of mass failure, only one of which had any importance in Freshwater, dominated managementrelated sediment yields. This pattern, in turn, has broad implications on the adequacy of any regulatory or management approach that assumes uniformity across the landscape. It also supports the value of watershed specific studies. A final thought relative to watershed patterns of sediment yield can be posed as a rhetorical question: \"Is this a lot of sediment?\" Certainly on a more global perspective the answer would be yes, as the North Coast of California is widely recognized as having some of the highest natural rates of erosion in North America. When anthropogenic sediment is added to these naturally high rates, the resulting values would be large compared to most landscapes. However, relative to the North Coast, the estimated yields do not seem especially high. A yield rate of 193 metric tons/km 2 /yr (550 tons/ ml 2 /yr) falls well within the range of natural sediment yield for North Coast watersheds calculated by CGS, and is only 40% greater than the upper estimate of natural sediment yields from the EPA. And other watershed studies conducted by PALCO but not discussed here (PALCO 2002(PALCO , 2004a have estimated sediment yields many times larger than those for Elk and Freshwater. Thus, although the watershed analysis studies in Elk and Freshwater both suggest that total sediment yield has been doubled or tripled by management activities, those total yields are still relatively low compared to the yields of some of the other watersheds on the North Coast. Moving on to Humboldt Bay, the focus of the symposium in which this paper was presented, at least two major conclusions can be made. The first, stated above, is that sediment delivery to the bay has been increased over historic levels, with all of its attendant potential effects. The second, which counters the first, is that this increase may have few physical effects on the bay. Two lines of evidence support this. One is the size of sediments being delivered from upslope areas; all of the major geologic types draining to Humboldt Bay produce soils that are dominated by silt and clay-sized particles. In addition, many management-related sediment inputs, for example road surface erosion, consist almost entirely of silt and claysized particles. Silts and clays being small and light are generally carried as so-called \"wash load\" during high-flow events, and have a strong tendency to remain in suspension upon entry into Humboldt Bay. In other words, a very large proportion of the material entering Humboldt Bay from upslope sources is probably transported by floodwaters as suspended sediment out of the watershed and into the bay. And, recalling that Humboldt Bay has one of the highest tidal volumes of any estuary on the West Coast, nearly 40% per tidal cycle (Costa presentation, this symposium), silts and clays transported into the bay are likely to be rapidly flushed to offshore areas during normal tidal exchange. Indeed, the talk by Don Tuttle at the symposium contained an aerial photograph demonstrating such flushing-in that case a turbidity plume extending from the mouth of the Elk River and out of the bay. The second line of evidence comes through comparison of total upslope sediment inputs to the quantity of sediment that must be dredged annually from the bay to maintain navigation channels. Total sediment yield from upslope areas to Humboldt Bay is estimated in this paper as 62, 532 metric tons/yr (68,750 tons/yr). The analysis of dredging records by the USACE demonstrates that a total of 1.2-2.4 million metric tons (1.3-2.6 million tons) are removed from Humboldt Bay by dredging each year. Within interior channels of Humboldt Bay, dredging has averaged 348,053 metric tons (383,664 tons) annually over the past 13 years. Thus, even if all sediment from upslope areas to the bay was retained within the bay, it would constitute only 2.6-5.2% of the total sediment removed by dredging, and an average of only 18% of the sediment dredged from interior channels. Thus, it is clear that sediments entering from the oceanic environment overwhelmingly dominate sediment inputs to Humboldt Bay. By extension, increases or decreases in sediment inputs from upslope areas are likely to make little difference in the physical conditions or morphology of the bay. None of this is meant to support the conclusion that management-related sediment sources should not be controlled in upland areas. One reason is that, even if upland sediments are unlikely to have physical effects on Humboldt Bay, they may have important biological effects, both by reducing light transmission within the bay, and through effects on the production and export of biota from upland areas to the bay (e.g., salmon smolts). Indeed, for PALCO's lands the entire motivation for conducting the watershed analyses covered by this paper was to determine significant management-related sediment sources, and to then develop specific prescriptions to reduce those sediment sources. Subsequent studies by PALCO indicate that management-related sediment yields are declining as these measures are implemented (K Sullivan, PALCO, pers. comm.). It appears that it is feasible to reduce management-related sediment inputs from upslope areas, which will benefit not just Humboldt Bay but also the stream ecosystems within these watersheds. Similarly, other upland landowners, including Green Diamond Timber Company, the City of Arcata, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Jacoby Land Trust, are conducting their own efforts to reduce management-related sediment delivery into Humboldt Bay. Collectively, there is reason to believe these efforts will yield a more natural sediment delivery rate to Humboldt Bay over the years and decades to come.       The bay is of vital importance to the economy of the region and is the largest commercially important harbor between San Francisco to the south and Coos Bay, Oregon, to the north. To facilitate safe navigation of large commercial vessels, the bay has been subject to several modifications over the years, including the construction of jetties, maintenance dredging, and the deepening and widening of portions of the tidal channels through engineering practices conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The surface sediment distribution in the bay was previously studied by Thompson (1971). He noted that the general pattern for sediments in Humboldt Bay was for grain size to decrease with increasing elevation and distance landward from the ocean inlet. Dredged channel sediments were found to contain greater percentages of gravels and muds than their undredged counterparts. The focus of this paper is to compare and contrast the sediment size distribution seen in 2000-2001 with the sediments sampled by Thompson (1971) 30 years earlier.\n\nThe ESM model uses environmental stress and recruitment to determine whether or not physical factors or biotic interactions are relatively more important in regulating biomass and trophic structure of marine communities (Menge andSutherland 1987, Menge andBranch 2001). This study has analyzed some novel data and combined it with existing information in order to determine how physical factors could be changing levels of stress (sensu Menge and Branch 2001) experienced by eelgrass within Humboldt Bay and how, under conditions of low stress, grazers could be affecting eelgrass primary productivity. This effort also highlights how much is unknown or needs to be more rigorously tested and so our final objective is to suggest studies that would make the ESM model in Humboldt Bay more complete and thus useful to managers. Physical factors and biotic interactions are both relatively unimportant to community regulation according to the ESM if recruitment is minimal. Although rhizome-shoot fragments are capable of establishing new patches (Ewanchuk and Williams 1996), they are positively buoyant and not considered as important as the negatively buoyant seeds in establishing new patches (Orth et al. 2000;Bintz and Nixon 2001). There are no studies of flowering, seed bank or seedling dynamics of eelgrass in Humboldt Bay, so it is not possible to evaluate the importance of recruitment to the spatial and temporal variation in eelgrass abundance that have been described. Flowering for Pacific Northwest eelgrass is from March through July. Seeds are released from late July to October; the seed bank can last up to 12 months and most seedlings appear in the spring (Phillips 1984;Orth et al. 2000). Except for some patches in North Bay, it is currently assumed that eelgrass occupies most of its potential niche in Hum-boldt Bay, which suggests that the vast majority of new shoots are likely to be asexually produced and not recruits. Since the repeated sampling of eelgrass in Humboldt Bay (Schlosser, unpub. data) indicates that most beds are perennial, an assessment of the relative importance of physical factors and biotic interactions is the most relevant for understanding the variation of eelgrass distribution and abundance in the bay. The seagrass literature indicates that, of the physical factors that increase levels of environmental stress (sensu Menge and Branch 2001) for eelgrass, light limitation is preeminent followed by nutrients and other physical factors. Despite the large number of adaptations to an aquatic existence, eelgrass and seagrasses in general are particularly vulnerable to light limitation. The minimum light requirement for seagrasses is high (i.e., 10%-22% of surface light; Gallegos 2001; Duarte 1991) relative to microalgae (i.e., 1% of surface light) because seagrasses are comprised of so many nonphotosynthetic cells that can only respire. Capturing the light necessary is also problematic because their aquatic environments are dominated by green light and they don't have the accessory pigments to capture these wavelengths; and, while they can photoacclimate to low light by increasing levels of chlorophyll pigments, there is an upper limit to this response because these pigments eventually shade each other within the chloroplast (i.e., the packaging effect; Cummings and Zimmerman 2003). Even if seagrasses are not light limited, that is, when the amount of light for saturating photosynthesis (E k = 100 \u03bcE m -2 s -1 ) occurs for a minimum of six hours during a day (H sat ; Dennison and Alberte 1985; Dennison 1987), seagrasses are restricted to even shallower depths by low amounts of dissolved CO 2 and inefficient carbon uptake (Beer and Rehnberg 1997;Zimmerman et al. 1997). The form of inorganic carbon required by photosynthesis, CO 2 , is 150 times less available in seawater than bicarbonate (HCO 3 -); and the plant's enzyme (carbonic anhydrase) for converting bicarbonate to CO 2 is not abundant. Thus if the level of CO 2 in the water is experimentally increased, then seagrasses can potentially grow in deeper water, since, being able to fix carbon at a faster rate by direct uptake of CO 2 , it will take them a shorter period of time to surpass the amount of carbon used during 24 hours of respiration (Zimmerman et al. 1997). This light and carbon physiological Achilles heel of seagrasses is why management strategies are generally so focused on preventing degradation of the aquatic light environment. If seagrasses die, the entire community will collapse since there are no other similarly productive, large, soft-bottom macrophytes to replace them. How could stress from light limitation be affecting eelgrass distribution and abundance in Humboldt Bay? Typical fall-winter declines in light availability are not a proximate driver of biomass declines at this time of year since eelgrass has already adapted to the seasonal availability of this resource. However, large interannual and spatial differences in the aquatic light environment, especially when they occur during the spring and early summer when net primary productivity is highest, will affect the abundance of seagrasses (Bulthius 1987;Dennison 1987;Thom and Albright 1990;Duarte 1991;Vermaat and Verhagen 1996;Moore et al. 1997;Hemminga and Duarte 2000;Hauxwell et al. 2006*). There is no spatially complete sampling of water quality or the aquatic light environment in Humboldt Bay so, for now, inferences must be made from CICORE's time series turbidity data from Dock B. The turbidity readings from Dock B provide a description of water clarity and hence an indirect measure of the relative availability of light for eelgrass growth. Turbidometers optically measure the relative amounts of suspended solids in the water by recording the amount of incident light that is scattered when encountering suspended solids such as silt, clay, detritus, algal cells and large molecules such as tannins (Sadar 2002). Direct measurements of the downward attenuation coefficient (K d ) for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) are preferred for describing the light environment of aquatic photoautotrophs (Kirk 1994). Since the relationship between K d and turbidity in Humboldt Bay has not been established, this part of our study can: (1) indicate the times when turbidity is attenuating light and potentially limiting eelgrass growth; and, (2) compare turbidity patterns to mechanisms that cause it to vary in order to understand how turbidity could temporally and spatially vary in the bay. Patterns of turbidity increase at Dock B fall within three groups: those that remain below 50.0 NTU with most peaks in the 10.0 NTU-20.0 NTU range, those from 50.0 NTU to 200.0 NTU and an anomalous group with dry season values greater than 50.0 NTU and wet season values greater than 200.0 NTU. The first group of values is produced by ebbing tidal currents; and the greater the tidal amplitude, the more turbidity is generated. The ebbing tide had the same effect on aquatic PAR at eelgrass and oyster mariculture sites in North Bay (Rumrill and Poulton 2004). The second group is produced by increases in watershed discharge during and following winter rain events. As the tide ebbs during a winter storm, the freshwater from the Freshwater watershed coming out through the Eureka Slough causes salinities to drop and turbidity levels to increase by the Dock B sonde. This is interpreted to mean that in this part of the bay, the primary source of the turbidity is from the Freshwater watershed and not from flooding waters that could be carrying Eel River or Elk River sediments. Since monthly precipitation is so different for Humboldt County watersheds during El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a years, the frequency and intensity of rain induced turbidity events presented in this study are likely to be intermediate between the extremes of the ENSO cycle. The third group of turbidity values at Dock B cannot presently be attributed to any mechanism(s) of sediment suspension. Despite the common observation that summer afternoon wind waves over the mudflats in North Bay result in visibly turbid water, this study found no consistent relationship between wind and turbidity as has been documented in other bays (Nichols and Thompson 1985;Banas et al. 2005 ). This was even the case for winds out of the northwest that produce relatively long fetch waves that break on mudflats adjacent to Eureka Slough, and water from this slough is mixed into the water that moves by the Dock B sonde on the ebb tide ( Figure 1). However, during lower tides, the majority of wind-generated turbid water may be blocked from entering Eureka Slough and the channel along the Eureka waterfront because the mudflats on the northern edge of the slough, while still intertidal, are high enough to be a partial dam to northwest wind waves ( Figure 12). The aquatic light environment for North Bay eelgrass during summer afternoon high tides probably is being degraded by wind, but only a turbidometer located in North Bay itself or between Indian Island and Woodley Island would detect this type of event. Based on the relationship of turbidity at Dock B to tidal currents and precipitation; and, assuming that wind generated turbidity is occurring, then what other sections of Humboldt Bay should have similar levels of high turbidity that could be stressing eelgrass? Most of North\nRoughly 35% of the species identified from this study were introduced from various areas of the worlds' oceans. These introduced species play a critical role in the development of the fouling communities in Humboldt Bay. The initial phases of community development on \"undisturbed\" panels, for example, were dominated by colonial and solitary ascidians, bryozoans and hydroids, almost all of which were introduced to Humboldt Bay. In addition, some of the late successional species, including Watersipora subtorquata and Halichondria bowerbanki, are also introduced. It is therefore impossible to know what the \"native\" communities within Humboldt Bay should look like. It is notable that other fouling studies have shown very similar patterns of succession, often with the very same species, in other localities (e.g., Dean 1981;Mook 1981). Most of the hard-substrates available for settlement by sessile marine invertebrates and algae within Humboldt Bay are man-made structures, like those that stabilize the shores within the bay (e.g., rip-rap that lines the entrance channel and other areas within the bay) or those that have been introduced for aquaculture (e.g., the Japanese oyster Crassostrea gigas). Studies by Connell (2000Connell ( , 2001 have shown that within Sydney Harbor, Australia, new urban structures may facilitate the invasion of new taxa. Our own observations on the newly constructed municipal floating docks in Humboldt Bay also suggest this may occur. We have seen greater abundances and much larger colonies of the newly discovered bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata at these docks relative to those seen at the Woodley Island Marina. This pattern may represent a temporal correlation between the deployment of these new floating docks and the arrival of Watersipora. Introduced species contributed disproportionately to the development of the fouling community on docks at Woodley Island Marina. This community is characterized by seasonal pulses of fast-growing, short-lived species (e.g., colonial tunicates), combined with the persistent accumulation of longer-lived, slower growing species (e.g., mussels, sponges and tubiculous amphipods). Ephemeral species frequently grew over and on mussels and other longer-lived species, forming a \"canopy\" layer that showed dramatic changes in percent cover from month to month. Winter storms, which transported both fresh water and heavy sediment loads through the channel adjacent to the Woodley Island Marina, appeared to lead to the sudden disappearance of weedy suspension feeders, including colonial tunicates and bryozoans. Most of these species are exotic and can be found in bays and estuaries on both the Pacific and Atlantic Coasts of the United States, where they inhabit docks and pier pilings in a wide range of salinities. This tolerance of fluctuating salinity makes it more likely that the sudden declines in abundance, following winter storms, may be due to mortality from heavy sedimentation on the \"undisturbed\" panels. These conditions can effectively clog the suspension feeding organs of many sessile invertebrates (Maughan 2001). Although both the \"undisturbed\" and \"settlement\" panels initially reflected a pulse in settlement by tunicates, later changes in the dominance of species on \"undisturbed\" panels did not necessarily reflect pulses in recruitment. Initial settlement by the colonial sea squirts Diplosoma and Botrylloides onto the \"undisturbed panels\" lead to brief dominance by these species in September and October, whereas fairly low (<5% cover) recruitment by the solitary tunicate Ciona was followed by rapid growth, and subsequent dominance by a small number of individuals (25% cover on panels) in November, 2001. A peak in recruitment of the barnacle Balanus crenatus seen on \"settlement\" panels in October 2002 did not result in an increase in percent cover of this species in subsequent months. Osman and Whitlatch (1995) found that the major affect that resident adults have on the recruitment of settling larvae in a developing benthic community is to prevent them from taking over space. In addition, increases in percent cover are not always driven by prior settlement. An increase in the establishment of Botrylloides on \"undisturbed\" panels in May 2002 did not appear to be caused by heavy settlement of this species. Thus, increases in percent cover can be due to apparently \"sudden\" increases in growth by colonies, which may be present yet hidden below an upper \"canopy.\" In conclusion, dominance on \"undisturbed\" panels was not always driven by settlement processes, which changed in importance over the course of succession. Similar studies of marine fouling communities have also shown the importance of settlement changes during the successional process. Field (1982) found that the species that initially settled on panels suspended in the Damariscotta River in Maine were different from those that settled in older, more mature communities. He concluded that species that settled first altered the community, facilitating the recruitment of later species which otherwise may not have invaded. Chalmer (1982) also found that species selectively settled into different aged fouling communities on asbestos panels immersed near Garden Island, Western Australia. Most species in his study settled on young panels because they had little structure and considerable free space. In contrast, the mussel Mytilus edulis was able to settle freely on both young and old panels, and Chalmer (1982) suggested that the ability of Mytilus to settle in established communities was the reason for its ultimate dominance as a \"climax species.\" Dean (1981) found that mimicking the physical structure supplied by sessile organisms, such as colonial tunicates, hydroids and barnacles, facilitated the settlement of the mussel Mytilus edulis, which in turn pre-empted settlement by other species. Observations made in July 2004 of our \"undisturbed\" panels indicate that the mussel Mytilus trossulus is steadily increasing its percent cover over time, along with increases in the sponge Halichondria bowerbanki and tubiculous amphipods. Gradual increase in M. trossulus abundance, despite any sign of recruitment of this species onto \"settlement\" panels, may stem from preferential settlement into established communities with pre-existing structure. Alternatively, the relative absence of mussel predators, such as motile crabs and sea stars, may enable mussels to outcompete other species (Enderlein and Wahl 2004). Although mussels may not settle in high numbers, their persistence could be due to their ability to tolerate heavy sedimentation following winter storms, as well as their ability to settle in established communities. We hypothesize that mussels, sponges and tubiculous amphipods will form the eventual \"climax community\" on our panels if given enough time. These species appear to dominate the floating docks at Woodley Island Marina. Seasonal declines in abundance, seen in some of the dominant occupiers of space (including Botrylloides sp., Botryllus sp., Ciona intestinalis, Watersipora subtorquata, and Obelia dichotoma), could be due to either natural history variation or variation in water conditions in the bay. Short life spans, for example, could lead to synchronized senescence amongst a \"cohort\" of individuals that recruited simul-taneously. Such a phenomenon could lead to sudden apparent \"mortality\" at different times of the year. While we cannot rule out natural senescence as an explanation for the sudden decline in percent cover of Botrylloides, Ciona and Halichondria in January 2002 and 2003, these declines are correlated with high rainfall levels (Figures 1 and 3). It is unclear whether low salinity or increased sedimentation levels from rainstorms is responsible for these sudden disappearances. However, Dybern (1967) showed that Ciona is tolerant of a wide range of salinities, and many exotic species have a euryhaline distribution. Therefore, we suggest that deposition of fine sediments, along with reduced salinity from freshwater runoff, are the primary agents of disturbance responsible for the decline of many species in this fouling community. Repeated disturbances may ultimately influence the composition of fouling communities at Woodley Island Marina by favoring \"disturbance tolerant\" taxa. In conclusion, this study shows that the diverse community of sessile marine invertebrates that \"foul\" docks within Humboldt Bay is a highly dynamic system that changes markedly from month to month. Pulses of recruitment, rapid growth and sudden mortality characterize this system. Nevertheless, this community may be gradually approaching a less diverse state dominated by a few species, including the mussel Mytilus trossulus, the sponge Halichondria bowerbanki and the tubiculous amphipod Corophium sp. Persistent cover by a few dominant taxa may provide secondary substrate for more opportunistic species to settle on during high-recruitment months, masking a stable set of species in the understory. Because many of the species identified on our panels (~35%) are non-native, it is clear that Humboldt Bay is not immune to invasion by exotic species. In fact, it is likely that this process has been occurring since the mid- 1800s, although it is unclear if the number of exotic species has increased exponentially, as has been seen in San Francisco Bay (Carleton and Geller 1993). Clearly, further study over a longer time span is necessary to determine whether a \"climax\" community is attained, and whether this community can repel further invasion by exotic species. In addition, the role of sediment deposition in these communities appears to be an important source of disturbance that may drive this system.

Two hundred, twenty-three samples were collected during June and July 2001 using a Peterson grab sampler from aboard either a small skiff or pontoon boat. These samples were supplemented by 92 samples that had been collected from the deeper sections of the bay's main channels during the prior fall. The supplemented samples were collected using a Smith-McIntyre grab sampler aboard the R/V Coral Sea and M/V Ironic as a part of a survey identifying nonindigenous species in Humboldt Bay (Boyd et al. 2002). The locations of all 315 samples are shown in Figure 2. Samples were collected on transects orthogonal to the primary tidal channels and were nominally spaced at 0.5 nautical mile intervals. Generally, each transect consisted of five samples. Samples were collected from the main tidal channel, the intertidal flats on both channel flanks, and the high tidal flats on either side. A hand-held acoustic depth sounder was used to locate the center and the flanks of the channel on each transect, at the time of collection. Salt marsh environments were not sampled during this study. From each sediment sample collected, the upper 5 cm was analyzed in bulk for sediment grain size using standard sieve and pipette techniques (Ingram 1971;Galehouse 1971). The analytical techniques were chosen to match the techniques that were used by Thompson (1971) in a previous examination of the sediments in the bay, in order to allow a direct comparison of the sediment grain-size distributions. Samples were disaggregated and the organic material was oxidized using 30% hydrogen peroxide. Particles of coarse silt size and larger were separated from the fine silts and clays by passing samples through a 5.25 (0.25 \u03bcm) wet sieve. The portion that did not pass through the wet sieve was dried and shaken for 30 minutes through nested sieves at intervals of 0.25 \u03c6 (Ingram 1971). The grain-size distribution of the portion that passed through the wet sieve was determined using a settling column and Stoke's Law (Galehouse 1971). Sodium hexametaphosphate was added to inhibit flocculation of the particles in the settling column. The fine silts were separated at intervals of 0.50 \u03c6 while the clays were separated at intervals of 1.00 \u03c6. The graphical technique of Inman (1952) was used to determine sediment-size statistics."}, {"section_title": "Primary Sediment Distribution", "text": "In estuaries similar to Humboldt Bay, the sediment distribution has been described as being controlled primarily by tidally driven circulation (Nichols 1979;Dyer 1994). During both the ebbing and flooding tides, current speeds in Humboldt Bay should be highest within the inlet and in the channel thalweg that connects the North Bay with the harbor entrance. Greater speeds should occur in the North Bay thalweg, as compared to the South Bay thalweg, due primarily to the larger tidal prism in the northern section of the bay. The highest speeds should occur in areas of channel constriction. These estimates are in good agreement with measurements of current velocities made in the field using various Lagrangian drifters in different parts of the bay (e.g., Gast and Skeesick 1964;Casebier and Toimil 1973). The locations of highest expected current speeds provide a qualitative match to the locations of largest mean sediment diameter ( Figure  3). In the shallow areas near the bay entrance, waves are also important. One result is that the surface sediments near the harbor entrance are better sorted than elsewhere in the bay. The less vigorous circulation in South Bay, as compared to North Bay, provides an explanation for the differences in sediments encountered. At a similar distance from the inlet, South Bay sediments are finer grained than North Bay sediments (Figure 4). In addition, very coarse sand-sized and larger particles were encountered in a number of locations in North Bay, where almost none were found in South Bay."}, {"section_title": "Have Bay Sediments Changed? 1970 vs. 2000-2001", "text": "The influence of harbor modification and maintenance on sedimentary processes has been the subject of some prior research in Humboldt  Bay (Thompson 1971;Costa 1982;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 1994). Thompson (1971) compared sediments from dredged and undredged portions of the tidal channels in Humboldt Bay and found that the dredged portions contained greater percentages of gravel and siltand clay-sized particles than the undredged portions of the bay. The increased gravel content was thought to represent lag deposits that were exposed by dredging. The increased percentage of silt and clay was attributed to decreased current speeds where dredging had deepened the channel below its equilibrium level and had allowed for the deposition of fine-grained material. In a study of the Upper James Estuary in Virginia and the Thames River in England, Nichols (1979) suggested two main reasons for the increase in sedimentation that was observed following channel deepening: 1) decreased tidal currents caused by an increase in the channel's cross-sectional area, and 2) increased stratification leading to trapping of sediment in the lower layer by density-driven currents and an increased chance for deposition. In 1994, numerical modeling was used to predict changes that might occur as a result of dredging on the sedimentary processes operating in Humboldt Bay (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 1994). In essence, the model predicted that any deepening or widening of the bay channel would cause decreased current speeds in the increased cross-sectional areas and increased sedimentation rates in the channels in the vicinity of the inlet. To examine any variations in sediment size that may have occurred since 1970, the sediments in this study were analyzed using the same techniques used by Thompson (1971). Thompson employed sediment textural triangle diagrams (Shepard 1954) to display his results; the data from this study have been similarly displayed.  Figure 6 shows the sediment sizes of samples collected from the main tidal channels in 1970 and in 2000-2001. Comparison of the sediments collected from the high tidal flats ( Figure 5) suggests that the sediment size did not significantly change between 1970 and in 2000-2001. The textural triangle diagrams are suggestive that the sediments collected from the high tidal flats in 2000-2001 may have had less clay-sized fraction than the samples collected in 1970. However, this suggestion may be misleading due to some differences in sample collection for the two studies. Thompson (1971) extensively sampled the high tidal flats as well as the fringes of salt marsh environments, where he encountered the highest clay-sized fractions of his collected samples. In this study, the salt marsh environments were not sampled extensively and the silty clays sampled by Thompson (1971) may have been missed. The data suggest that the processes controlling sedimentation in the environments where the finest-grained sediments accumulate in the bay may not have significantly changed. However, comparison of the sediments collected from the main tidal channels ( Figure  6) indicate that the 2000-2001 samples had larger average grain sizes and contained less clay-sized material than in 1970. This apparent difference in sediment type cannot be explained by a sampling bias; the main tidal channels were sampled similarly during both studies and the samples were analyzed using the same techniques. The data suggest that the processes controlling sedimentation in the main tidal channels have changed. These results are seemingly contrary to what would have been predicted by earlier numerical modeling (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 1994). In a similar result, Costa (1982) observed an apparent shift in the sediment type in the central portion of Humboldt Bay after dredging had widened the North Bay channel in 1977 and1978. The channels that had contained significant portions of silt-and clay-sized particles prior to dredging became dominated by sand after the channel had been widened. Costa (1982) provided no explanation for these observations. These data suggest that the processes controlling sedimentation in the bay may have changed. Either the currents in the main tidal channels have become more vigorous and can better inhibit the accumulation of clay-sized sediments, or the sediments supplied to the channels are different. Prior modeling suggests that an increase in tidal currents is unlikely following the channel deepening or widening that occurred between 1970 and 2000 (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 1994). The implication is that the sand-dominated marine sediments, characteristic of the channels in the lower reaches of the bay, have propagated both northward and southward in the main tidal channels and away from the inlet."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In general, the distribution of surface sediments in Humboldt Bay is similar to that observed by previous investigators (Thompson 1971;Boyd et al. 1975;Burdick 1976;Moore 1977;Costa 1982). The major process that drives the transport and sorting of sediments in most regions of the bay is tidal currents. Waves entering the inlet from offshore are also an important process in Entrance Bay. Comparison of grain-size data collected during this study with results of a similar survey conducted by Thompson (1971) suggests that the main tidal channels have larger mean sediment sizes today than they had previously. These changes in sediment size may reflect an increased propagation of silt-and sand-sized particles away from Entrance Bay and into the North and South Bay Channels.

A major objective of the field sampling was to increase effort in areas that had not been typically investigated in past studies. Many locations along the periphery of the bay, as well as sloughs, channels, beach and rubble areas, mud flats and eelgrass beds were selected by reviewing a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) navigational chart. Some sampled areas not evident on the chart were detected through examination in the field."}, {"section_title": "Site description", "text": "Humboldt Bay is located in Northern California (40\u00b0 45 / N, 124\u00b0 13 / W) approximately 482 km miles north of San Francisco and 161 km south of the Oregon border. It is subdivided into North Bay (also called Arcata Bay) that has eelgrass beds, mudflats and oyster leases; the central part of the bay (Entrance Channel, Entrance Bay, North Bay Channel, Samoa Channel, channels to the west and east of Woodley Island) that include some narrow eelgrass beds, the Eureka waterfront, as well as the primary shipping lanes ( Figure 1); and South Bay, which is dominated by eelgrass beds and mudflats ( Figure 2). Geological activity is causing both North Bay and South Bay to subduct. Humboldt Bay is considered more of an embayment than an estuary because of the lack of a major river draining directly into it and because salinities only drop during the winter when the creeks and relatively small rivers discharge the precipitation landing in the watersheds (Barnhart et al. 1992). The tidal flushing rate of Humboldt Bay is fast relative to other bays and the flushing rate is faster in South Bay than North Bay (Barnhart et al. 1992). The bay is dominated by soft substratum; hard substratum occurs on docks, pilings, bridge abutments, oyster shells and the gear from mariculture companies and vessels. Activities in and around Humboldt Bay potentially impact its marine communities. About 70,000 people live in the Humboldt Bay watershed with the two biggest concentrations in the City of Arcata (~ 16,600) and the City of Eureka (~26,000). Watersheds draining into North Bay contain logging, commercial greenhouses, dairy farms, sewage effluent from Arcata (that receives secondary treatment followed by a passage through marshes before release), a pulp mill and a sawmill by the Mad River Slough, where fungicides have historically been used. The central part of Humboldt Bay receives wastewater treated to secondary standards and then is dechlorinated and discharged to the bay on ebb tides. Eureka storm drains also empty directly into the bay. The upper reaches of the Elk River, which drain into the same part of the bay, are logged. Watersheds draining into South Bay are from dairy farms and logging operations; and the bay itself is a popular site for sport fisheries and waterfowl hunting. The Eel River discharges into the ocean 16.0 km south of the Humboldt Bay Entrance Channel; and activities in this watershed also potentially impact the bay since its water and sediment are presumably carried into the bay on flood tides (Barnhart et al. 1992). Some degree of dredging, whether in the entrance channel or inner shipping lanes, occurs almost every year. At least one oil spill (MV Kure, 11/1997, ~5,000 gallons) has occurred within the bay."}, {"section_title": "Water Quality and Climate Description", "text": "At this time only turbidity data are available for understanding the aquatic light environment to which the eelgrass in Humboldt Bay is exposed; these data are from the Humboldt State University (HSU) group within CICORE. The particular data logger-or sonde-in use is made by Yellow Springs Instruments (YSI; mo. 6600 with automatic wiping of optical probes) and contains probes for a variety of parameters. This is the same sonde used by the National Estuarine Research Reserve System (NERR). The YSI turbidity probe (mo. 6136, range 0-1000 Nephelometric Turbidity Units; NTU) is standardized with YSI styrenedivinylbenzene copolymer at 0.0 NTU and 123.0 NTU. The sonde is located just south of the Eureka waterfront (Figure 1), where it hangs within an ABS plastic pipe that is attached to a piling underneath Dock B; this piling is about 2.0 m back from the front edge of the dock. Following the design developed by the NERR in Coos Bay, Oregon, the bottom of the ABS pipe is slotted to allow water to circulate around the turbidity and other probes. All probes remain ~ 1.5 m above the bottom and they are always underwater. Although the sonde can be deployed for three months, the chain it is hanging from inside the pipe was pulled up every three to four weeks. The data were uploaded and the sonde and probes were brought back to an HSU laboratory for cleaning and calibration and then redeployed. All of the probes on the HSU CICORE sonde took a reading every 15 minutes. The sonde was first deployed during June 2003, and data into June 2004 were included in this study. Values from the YSI turbidity probe greater than 500 NTU were removed because they were sporadic, and the NERR in Coos Bay also uses this cutoff value. Other water-quality and climate variables were used in order to understand why turbidity values measured in this study varied with time. Salinity and tidal changes in water depth were measured by the HSU CICORE sonde. Hourly precipitation readings were taken by S. Schlosser's Davis Vantage Pro weather recorder coastally located ~ 15 km north of the sonde. The Eureka Buoy operated by NOAA (#46022), which is located 31 km west-southwest of Eureka (40\u00b0 43 / 12 // N, 124\u00b0 31 / 12 // W), was used as a source of data for hourly wind direction and speed. Buoy data used in this study had not received a final editing by NOAA, and so data were graphically inspected for anomalies. Comparisons of wind direction and speed against turbidity were made by assigning wind directions to one of four possible unequal compass degree groups. These groups were constructed on the assumption that if wind is generating turbidity events, then mudflats around the north, east and southeast edges of North Bay are more likely to be sources of turbidity recorded by the Dock B sonde than sediments arising from the mudflats on the west side of the bay. Winds approximately out of the northeast (1\u00b0-60\u00b0) should be relatively rare but would generate waves that would break on the southeast mudflats, and these winds would be moving in the same direction as the ebb tide. Winds out of the east and south (61\u00b0-220\u00b0) should suspend sediments on the western mudflats and the northern mudflats on the western half of North Bay. Westerly and southwesterly winds (221\u00b0-280\u00b0) will have a long fetch within the bay and impact north and northeastern mudflats, whereas winds mostly out of the northwest (281\u00b0-360\u00b0) will also have a long fetch but potentially generate turbidity over the eastern and southeastern mudflats, which are closest to the Dock B sonde. Turbidity events less than 200.0 NTU range are the most common at Dock B and therefore should be the most relevant for understanding what affects water clarity in this part of Humboldt Bay. Values greater than 500.0 NTU had already been removed by CICORE because their appearance for only one reading amid a series of very low readings (i.e., < 30.0 NTU) suggests that these high values were not representative. We found that values between 300.0 NTU-500.0 NTU had a similar pattern of appearance but were retained so that this analysis can be compared against future turbidity events that might persist in this range, such as during El Ni\u00f1o events. Only short-term measures of the aquatic nutrient environment at multiple stations have been made in Humboldt Bay for the purpose of characterizing upwelling and nonupwelling periods in and just outside the bay (Pequegnat and Butler 1981; Barnhart et al. 1992;Althaus et al. 1997). Water temperatures from 1995 to 2004 were therefore inspected to determine if the bay experiences ENSO temperature changes, which could also mean changes in the concentration of oceanic nitrate. Water temperatures came from several sources. The NOAA Eureka Buoy hourly water temperatures were used to represent coastal waters just outside of the bay, whereas bi-hourly readings from the Sea Grant Extension office in Eureka ( Figure  1) and 15-minute readings from the HSU CICORE sonde were used to represent water temperatures in the bay. NOAA water temperature data from the North Spit in Humboldt Bay were not used because of the high number of anomalous readings. Since, in order to detect ENSO temperature changes, it is necessary to ensure that the temperatures used in this analysis were those of the flooding oceanic water, only the minimum daily temperatures occurring during the summer months were used. Data were smoothed by obtaining the minimum temperature for each day within a month and then the mean of these minimum values was used to represent the month. Means of minima were also used on the offshore buoy data, but fall and winter months were not omitted because of the assumption that this buoy is usually monitoring oceanic water. Chlorophyll fluorescence levels measured by the HSU CICORE sonde (YSI Fluorescence Chlorophyll Probe, Mo. 6025, range 0-200 ug/L) were also assessed to determine if seasonally upwelled nutrients, as reflected in phytoplankton blooms, are potentially entering the bay."}, {"section_title": "Grazer Experiment", "text": "One hundred eelgrass shoots were haphazardly collected during March 2004 from the bed by the western end of the Samoa Bridge (40\u00b0 49 / 31 // N, 124\u00b0 10 / 20 // W) in Humboldt Bay. Shoots were immediately brought to HSU's Telonicher Marine Laboratory, where they were placed in running seawater. All individuals of the opisthobranch grazer, Phyllaplysia taylori, were carefully removed and put back into seawater. In order to keep leaf age relatively constant, the third leaf (starting from inside The eelgrass mesograzer, Phyllaplysia taylori. the leaf bundle) was removed from each shoot. Sixty of these were randomly sampled by cutting them from where they emerged from the sheath, and then once again 30.0 cm above the first cut. If the leaf was shorter than 30.0 cm, it was abandoned and a new leaf was sampled from the larger pool. The 60 leaves were equally divided into ten one-gallon glass aquariums. One Plexiglass clamp (each with two pieces, each piece 24.0 cm * 4.0 cm * 0.4 cm, bolted together) holding six sandwiched leaves was placed in each aquarium, and the clamp itself was in a stand so that the leaves could be held in an upright, natural position. The ten aquaria, which were set up outside for ambient light, received circulated seawater. They were placed on a seawater table in two rows of five aquaria with a south aspect. The most southern row was raised enough so that the tank would not be shaded by the front edge of the table and the second row was raised even more so that it would not be shaded by the first row of aquaria. Water flowed into the top of the aquaria via tubing and exited through a J-shaped piece of \u00bd // PVC pipe. The intake of the pipe was covered with a 0.2-cm mesh and was located about 5.0 cm below the top of each aquarium. This arrangement prevented P. taylori from getting into the pipe and from crawling or floating out of the aquarium. Phyllaplysia taylori individuals were added to the five odd-numbered aquaria so that aquaria with and without P. taylori alternated in their position on the water table. One animal was attached to each leaf within a tank, and so each tank contained six individuals, which when moving underwater ranged from 1.0 to 2.0 cm in length. Each experiment, after commencing within 12 hours of the shoots and animals being collected, proceeded for seven days. The first experiment began on March 3, 2004 using a flow rate of 3.0 L /min. A second experiment using only 1.0 L / min. was initiated on March 27, 2004 because the first experiment showed that the higher flow seemed to cause mortality when animals were shaken loose and could not reattach or they moved down to the clamp. At the termination of the each experiment all the leaves were removed and the P. taylori individuals were added to the eelgrass educational display tank in the Telonicher Marine Laboratory. The response variable, diatom epiphyte abundance, was enumerated by scraping both sides of each leaf with a razor blade as has been done in similar studies (Drake et al. 2003). Within an aquarium, diatoms from different leaves were combined. Diatoms were placed in 23.0-ml vials and preserved in 10% formaldehyde in seawater. Sub-sampling of frustules occurred at two levels. Frustules within a vial were first homogenized by shaking and a 1.0 ml of sample was quickly removed and deposited into a gridded Sedgwick Rafter counting cell, where each grid is 1.0 mm 3 . Secondly, all of the frustules in five randomly picked 1.0 mm 3 grids were counted and then frustule numbers were extrapolated to represent all of the diatoms scraped from the leaves within an aquarium. Diatom epiphyte abundance was expressed as frustule density by dividing the total number of diatoms by the leaf area (leaf length * leaf width) of all the leaves in an aquarium. A two-sample t-test assuming unequal variances was used to determine if diatom densities were significantly different between treatments."}, {"section_title": "Proceedings of the 2004 Humboldt Bay Symposium \u2026 73", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Water Temperature and Chlorophyll as Indicators of Nutrient Availability", "text": "Water temperatures and tidal curves from the summer and winter were compared in order to determine if the mean of the daily minimum temperatures during a month could be used as the measure of the temperature of the oceanic water entering Humboldt Bay. During the summer, the minimum water temperatures for the day always corresponded to flood tide peaks (Figure 9a), whereas flood tide peaks during the winter were associated with either the warmest or coolest water temperatures for the day (Figure 9b). Only minimum daily summer (June through September) water temperatures were therefore used to indicate the temperature of the oceanic water flooding into Humboldt Bay (Figure 9c). Waters outside Humboldt Bay, as indicated by the Eureka Buoy, showed the highest temperatures (mean of all temperature values) during the summer of 1997, with smaller peaks during 1995 and 2003. The mean of the daily minimum temperature for a month within Humboldt Bay, as indicated by the Eureka Sea Grant logger, followed the same interannual temperature pattern as the outer coast water, except that the mean of the daily minimum water temperatures for a month was always about a degree warmer in the bay; preliminary data from the CICORE logger appears similar to the Sea Grant logger, which is in the same part of Humboldt Bay (Figure 1, Figure  9c).

In this case there was less P. taylori mortality (Figure 11)."}, {"section_title": "Proceedings of the 2004 Humboldt Bay Symposium \u2026 77", "text": "Bay should also have high levels of turbidity because it receives water from the Freshwater watershed (15,014 ha), the Jacoby watershed (5,268 ha), the Elk River watershed (15,176 ha) on flood tides and some from the Mad River Slough, especially when the Mad River connects to this slough during episodic flood events. In contrast, most of South Bay should have relatively less turbid water since it receives water from the smallest watershed, Salmon Creek (6,637 ha). Even though the Eel River watershed (954,152 ha) does not empty directly into Humboldt Bay, bottom transport of sand into the bay from this river may be occurring during the winter (Thompson 1971;Gera 1973;Costa 1982a;Komar et al. 2000). However, origins of the finer suspended sediments that would degrade the light environment in South Bay are unknown. The only data currently available for developing a hypothesis on the spatial distribution of water turbidity in the bay come from Dock B and the positions of watersheds, despite some existing Secchi disk and downward irradiance (Ed) data (Pequegnat and Butler 1981; Barnhart et al.1992;Rumrill and Poulton 2004). North Bay and the central part of the bay should be more turbid than South Bay, particularly during high rainfall events; and environmental stress to eelgrass due to light limitation should also be acute in North Bay because eelgrass beds in this bay occur at lower elevations than those in South Bay. Temporally, turbidity conditions that occur during the spring and early summer should have the greatest effect on eelgrass carbon balance (Bulthius 1987;Dennison 1987). Watersheds release their most turbid water during the winter when the physiological impact on eelgrass should be minimal because the plant survives the winter by photoacclimating and using carbon stored the previous summer (Zimmerman et al. 1991(Zimmerman et al. , 1995Olesen and Sand-Jensen 1993;Burke et al. 1996). However, the same watershed sediments could decrease eelgrass growth and carbon storage during the spring and summer if they are resuspended by summer afternoon winds. Thus we hypothesize that the spring and summer winds and tidalinduced turbidity differences between the two bays, along with the deeper depth of North Bay, should be the best predictor of eelgrass biomass and distribution. How do these hypotheses of the spatial and temporal distribution of turbidity in the bay compare to the abundance and compensation depths (i.e., the depth where H sat occurs) of eelgrass in Humboldt Bay? Eelgrass shoot densities and above-ground biomass from North Bay are in fact significantly lower than for South Bay (Schlosser, unpub. data). Data on eelgrass compensation depths in Humboldt Bay are rare but consistent with patterns of abundance between the two bays. Eelgrass compensation depths at the northern end of the Samoa Channel (just south of the southwest corner of North Bay; Figure 1) were ~ 1.5 m below MLLW (Miner 1993), whereas an uninterrupted lower bed margin at sites at the northern end of South Bay occurred at ~ 3.0 m below MLLW (Western Ecological Services Company 1990). The latter study also reported discontinuous eelgrass below 3.0 m MLLW at the northern end of South Bay with some of it occurring as \"clumps\" as deep as 10.3 m below MLLW. However, this study did not follow up the sonar mapping with SCUBA as in the case of Miner (1993), and the deeper eelgrass may have arrived there from shallower bed fragmentation and been in the process of dying. This first examination of available turbidity and eelgrass data suggests that eelgrass abundance and distribution differences between the two bays are due to the greater light stress in North Bay. Studies of nitrogen and eelgrass indicate that while it can be a source of physiological stress according to the ESM model because it can be toxic at high levels or limiting to growth at low levels (Williams and Ruckelshaus 1993;van Lent et al. 1995;van Katwijk et al. 1997), light is more frequently an important bottomup factor to eelgrass growth (Dennison et al. 1987;Zimmerman et al. 1987;Murray et al. 1992). This is despite the fact that eelgrass demand for nitrogen would appear to be high because so much growth is occurring during the spring and early summer; and, even though upwelling is occurring at this time, nitrate availability might be curtailed by competition from planktonic and epiphytic algae that have more efficient uptake kinetics (Pedersen and Borum 1993; Williams and Ruckelshaus 1993). Leaves and the roots/rhizomes of eelgrass can take up almost equal amounts of nitrogen; but ammonium is preferred over nitrate and, in the case of the root/rhizome, ammonium uptake is light dependent (Zimmerman et al. 1987;Hemminga et al. 1994). Nitrate dominates in the water column whereas ammonium is the dominant form of nitrogen in the sediment, where it also leaches out into the water (Short 1983). There are a number of reasons why nitrogen may not limit eelgrass biomass very often. Eelgrass requires approximately four times less nitrogen and phosphorous per atom of carbon than algae (Hemminga and Duarte 2000); and models have demonstrated that water column ammonium and nitrate levels that should be required to saturate growth, as well as sediment ammonium levels for saturating growth, should be less than ambient levels reported for temperate estuaries. In addition, since nitrogen uptake rates saturate at higher levels than for growth rates, it is possible to store nitrogen for times when ambient levels actually do fall below growth requirements (Zimmerman et al. 1987). Furthermore, eelgrass is capable of inter-nally recycling nitrogen by moving it from older senescing parts of the plant to meristematic areas (Borum et al. 1989;Pedersen andBorum 1992, 1993); and lack of available water-column nitrogen can be partially offset by the large amount of nitrogen that is released from decomposing plant matter in the sediment (Kenworthy and Thayer 1984;Harrison 1989;Risgaard-Petersen et al. 1998). Nitrogen fixation, which occurs in the rhizosphere microenvironment and is enhanced by eelgrass photosynthesis (McGlathery et al. 1998), also supplements the nitrogen budget for eelgrass, but only to a small degree (Risgaard-Petersen et al. 1998). In addition to the effects of light stress, could the lower eelgrass shoot densities and biomass in North Bay versus South Bay (Keller 1963;Harding 1973;Schlosser, unpub. data,) be due to ammonium toxicity or nitrogen limitation? There are no studies of sediment ammonium in Humboldt Bay even though oyster culture in North Bay, agricultural runoff into Mad River Slough and then North Bay, and sewage effluent from Arcata and Eureka could all increase sediment ammonium. However, eelgrass beds occur in sediment ammonium conditions over 500 \u03bcM (Zimmerman et al. 1987), so sediment ammonium must reach a high level for it to be toxic. Measures of water-column ammonium made throughout the bay and in Freshwater and Jacoby Creeks (0.0-4.22 \u03bcM NH 4 + ; Barnhart et al. 1992;Althaus et al. 1997) are well below ammonium levels that are toxic in the water column (~ 25 \u03bcM NH 4 + ; van Katwijk et al. 1997), but all of these measurements were made between May and August after the watersheds would have flushed ammonium into the bay. Present data are therefore inadequate for determining if water column or sediment ammonium is toxic to eelgrass anywhere in Humboldt Bay. Is eelgrass in Humboldt Bay being stressed by a lack of nitrogen rather than nitrogen toxicity? Although some of the ammonium uptake in an eelgrass plant occurs via the leaves, most of it occurs via the rhizomes and roots (Thursby and Harlin 1982); and, since no sediment ammonium data are available for the bay, this analysis will continue by focusing on ambient patterns of water-column nitrate. Patterns of nitrate availability in Humboldt Bay can be inferred from changes in water-column chlorophyll, and some direct measures of nitrate have been made at a variety of sites. Chlorophyll concentrations for the two bays are similar and increase from April to June and again during the early fall. During the spring bloom, both of these bays have approximately half the chlorophyll found in offshore water (Pequegnat and Butler 1982); chlorophyll fluorescence in the central part of the bay also increased during the spring and early fall of the present study. These chlorophyll patterns suggest that similar but reduced amounts of upwelled nitrate are spread throughout Humboldt Bay on the flood tide and that some of this nitrate is being intercepted by the phytoplankton. However, in order for nitrate limitation to be part of the reason for the lower shoot densities in North Bay, both nitrate and ammonium would have to be limiting in North Bay and not in South Bay. Direct measures of nitrate indicate that this form of nitrogen is either limiting or close to limiting in both bays, except in South Bay during upwelling events. During upwelling events, nitrate is three to ten times more concentrated just outside or inside Entrance Channel relative to North Bay or South Bay; and nitrate concentrations are in fact greater in South Bay than North Bay (Table 1). This is also the case during nonupwelling conditions (Table 1), perhaps because the phytoplankton in North Bay has more time to deplete nitrate. When these varying levels of ambient nitrate are compared to the nitrate levels at which eelgrass growth and leaf uptake rates should saturate (Table 2), they are all similar to or less than saturation levels, which means that eelgrass growth should be nitrate limited in both bays except for some sites in South Bay during upwelling. During May through August 1997, which was the beginning of an El Ni\u00f1o episode, Althaus et al. (1997) also assessed nitrate concentrations within Humboldt Bay and corroborated the above pattern (Table 1) by finding that sites at the southern end of North Bay or in this bay also had values that were generally too low to saturate eelgrass growth (0.0-~ 4.2 \u03bcM NO 3 -). Existing data for nitrate indicates that it occurs at less than saturation values across much of Humboldt Bay and is therefore unlikely to explain the lower shoot densities in North Bay. In addition, nitrogen may not be limiting anywhere even if there is a differential availability of nitrate within the bay because the total nitrogen budget can be compensated by saturating amounts of ammonium in the sediment (Zimmerman et al. 1987). Decreases in light and nutrient availability during El Ni\u00f1o may combine to produce stressful conditions that produce interannual patterns of eelgrass abundance. Eelgrass shoot density and flowering usually increased in the beds of Willapa Bay, Washington and Coos Bay, Oregon, following the strong 1997-1998El Ni\u00f1o event (Thom et al. 2003; but subtidal eelgrass close to Friday Harbor, Washington, increased in biomass and productivity during the 1992 El Ni\u00f1o event, probably because H sat actually increased and nitrate levels were well above what is required to saturate growth (Nelson 1997a). Multi-year data for eelgrass abundance are not yet available for Humboldt Bay; and, although the present study demonstrates climatic effects on the bay, it is not clear if they would cause significant stress to eelgrass. Precipitation is much greater around the bay during El Ni\u00f1o events ( Figure 6), and there is a positive relationship between winter precipitation and turbidity ( Figure 5). Nitrate levels, which should already be low because Humboldt Bay is distant from the more actively upwelling headlands of Cape Mendocino, California and Cape Blanco, Oregon (Strub et al. 1991), should drop by 5.0-7.0 \u03bcM NO 3 during an El Ni\u00f1o event because oceanic water entering Humboldt Bay is at least a degree warmer during the El Ni\u00f1o versus the La Ni\u00f1a portion of the ENSO cycle ( Figure 9c). Nitrate decreases during El Ni\u00f1o events because, below 15\u00b0 C, nitrate decreases by ~5.0 \u03bcM NO 3 for each degree of water temperature rise in the northeast Pacific Ocean (Dayton et al. 1999;Nielson 2003). However, the higher levels of suspended sediments produced by El Ni\u00f1o precipitation would only stress eelgrass if the same sediments were resuspended by summer winds and tides and sediment ammonium levels could be sufficient for eelgrass growth. Although the literature indicates that, from the bottom-up perspective, light followed by nutrients should be given the most attention when trying to understand the factors affecting eelgrass distribution and biomass in Humboldt Bay, other physical factors can result in high environmental stress (Koch 2001;Thom et al. 2003; Greve and Krause-Jensen 2005 1 ). Large hydrodynamic forces resulting from tidal currents or wind waves can directly reduce the biomass, shoot density and shoot length of Zostera noltii as well as the ability of leaf epifauna to graze off algal epiphytes (Schanz andAsmus 2002, 2003); and, although the seasonality of wind direction within the bay has been described (Costa 1982b), no empirical studies of wind waves within North Bay and South Bay have been made. Tidal velocities within the bays are also poorly known. Similarly, desiccation and photodamage due to high irradiance, which are environmental stresses that set upper intertidal limits to eelgrass (Hemminga and Duarte 2000;Boese et al. 2003Boese et al. , 2005, have not been described in the bay; and upper limits of eelgrass distribution are only known from one location (Keller and Harris 1966). Salinity regimes ultimately set the inland distribution of seagrasses; and eelgrass, like other seagrasses, is euyhaline, tolerating salinities from 5.0 ppt to 42 ppt, although salinity requirements for eelgrass seed germination (down to 4.5 ppt) and seedling survival (~ 32 ppt) are more specific. In some estuaries, what appears as physiological plasticity may instead be ecotypic differentiation to low-and high-salinity regimes (Giesen et al. 1990;Kamermans et al. 1999;Hemminga and Duarte 2000). Ranges of short-term summer measures of salinity in North Bay and South Bay were 33.2 ppt -34.4 ppt and 33.5 ppt-33.8 ppt, respectively (Pequegnat and Butler 1981; Barnhart et al. 1992); and continuous readings from the central part of the bay in the present study ranged from winter lows of almost 15 ppt to summer highs of 34 ppt. All of these values are within the range of eelgrass toleration. Physical factors resulting in environmental stress for eelgrass have been particularly acute for eelgrass in Humboldt Bay since the mid 1800s. Anthropogenic activities in the watershed and bay have either directly displaced eelgrass or stressed it by affecting the delivery and dispersal of suspended sediments into the bay. European development of the Humboldt Bay watershed began in earnest during the 1850s when lowland forests were cleared for residences and agriculture, most of which was dairy farming (Glatzel 1982). Enough logging was occurring during this time for the Mad River Slough Canal connecting the Mad River to Humboldt Bay to be built and rebuilt several *Paper was reviewed and updated since presentation to include relevant citations."}, {"section_title": "Proceedings of the 2004 Humboldt Bay Symposium \u2026 81", "text": "times between 1854 and 1881 in order to move logs into the bay, but the canal could not be maintained because it kept filling up with silt that also came into North Bay (Haynes 1986). Timber harvesting in the Jacoby and Elk River watersheds was also occurring by 1870 and 1880, respectively (Humboldt Bay Watershed Advisory Committee and Redwood Community Action Agency 2005*). Thus, the first substantial degradation to the aquatic light environment in the bay since the 1850s may have occurred when logging first peaked in the Humboldt Bay watershed between 1880 and 1910. After this time, logging activities declined for awhile but other activities affecting sediment dispersal and eelgrass habitat-like dock building, diking, shoreline armoring and dredging-did not abate (Costa and Glatzel 2002; Humboldt Bay Watershed Advisory Committee and Redwood Community Action Agency 2005*). Eelgrass beds in North Bay were further disturbed starting in the 1890s by several attempts at farming native and nonnative oysters, but farming activity became more established in the 1930s when nonnative oyster farming became successful (Waddell 1964;Shaw 1997;Dale, pers. comm.). The light environment in the entire bay may have been degraded again when, during the 1950s, bay headwaters and second growth lower basins were cut and extensive forest road building occurred. In addition to this light stress, some of the eelgrass beds in North Bay would have been physically disturbed by oyster dredges that were used from 1956 to 2000 (Dale, pers. comm.). Although oyster farming must reduce eelgrass abundance, present day long-line and hand-picking practices in North Bay can be less damaging to the beds (Rumrill and Poulton 2004). The majority of armoring in Humboldt Bay, especially in Entrance Channel, was completed by the early 1970s; but the third and most recent peak in watershed logging started in 1990 and dredging also continues today (Costa and Glatzel 2002; Humboldt Bay Watershed Advisory Committee and Redwood Community Action Agency 2005*). It is not possible to determine if present day dredging activities are affecting eelgrass distribution and productivity because eelgrass surveys have only been made prior to but not after dredging events (e.g., Western Ecological Services Company 1990; Miner 1993). Eelgrass habitat in Humboldt Bay has therefore been subject to a variety of anthropogenic disturbances since the mid-1800s, and many of these are still occurring in Humboldt Bay and the surrounding watersheds. The ESM model predicts that when all the physical factors and disturbances described above for Humboldt Bay are minimal, then environmental stress will be low and biotic interactions (i.e., competition, predation) will be relatively more important in regulating biomass and the number of trophic levels in the eelgrass community. This is the top-down perspective, and its importance to understanding seagrass systems around the world has been neglected (Valentine and Heck 1999;Valentine et al. 2000;Williams and Heck 2001). The dominant paradigm as applied to Humboldt Bay is that all the carbon fixed by eelgrass is passed on to other trophic levels by a detritus-based pathway. Adopting this paradigm means that management decisions about eelgrass could be very bottom-up centric and not consider the topdown effects of grazing by Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) and Widgeon on eelgrass in the bay (Moore et al. 2004) or the lethal effects of the eelgrass grazing limpet, Tectura depicta, which may be migrating north from Monterey Bay, California, as sea temperatures rise (Zim-*Paper was reviewed and updated since presentation to include relevant citations. merman et al. 1996). Another shortcoming of the detritus paradigm is that it is accompanied by the misperception that most of the carbon in an eelgrass community is fixed by the eelgrass and not other photoautotrophs. In fact, about 50% of the net primary production in an eelgrass community can be fixed by the algae epiphytic on eelgrass leaves; and these algae can make substantial contributions in other seagrass systems as well (Nelson and Waaland 1997;Hemminga and Duarte 2000;Kaldy et al. 2002;Valentine et al. 2002). The inertia behind the seagrass-to-detritus paradigm of carbon flow affects decisions about what variables to include in monitoring and restoration plans for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). Plans dominated by variables causing physiological stress to eelgrass are appropriate for many estuaries, but the same plan may be less effective in another estuary where seagrass and epiphyte grazers have a larger role in affecting the productivity of the system. What effects could grazers of eelgrass and epiphyte mesograzers have on the productivity and biomass of eelgrass in Humboldt Bay? Black Brant geese and some other migratory waterfowl graze on eelgrass beds in each of the bays between Baja California, Mexico, and Alaska (Wilson and Atkinson 1995;Reed et al. 1998;Ganter 2000;Moore et al. 2004;Ward et al. 2005*). Black Brant arrive in Humboldt Bay on their northward migration around December of each year. They are presently peaking in abundance at about 17,000 individuals by mid-March and most birds have flown north by May (Lee et al. 2007*). Terrestrial systems demonstrate a strong positive relationship between moderate levels of grazing and primary productivity (McNaughton 1985;Jeffries 1988;McNaughton et al. 1989McNaughton et al. , 1991Rowcliffe et al. 1995;Bakker and Loonen 1998), and some of the warm-water seagrass grazers have also had positive effects on seagrass growth (Ziemen et al. 1984;Cebrian and Duarte 1998;Valentine and Heck 1999). The capacity of grazed plants to be more productive than nongrazed individuals of the same species is termed overcompensation or compensatory growth (Belsky 1986;Belsky et al. 1993). Overcompensation in seagrasses can occur either by increasing leaf growth rates or the rate of shoot production (Clausen 1994;Valentine et al. 1997). Black Brant often eat the youngest eelgrass leaves with the highest nitrogen content and avoid the shoot apical meristem, leading to the hypothesis that they \"garden,\" or enhance the proportion of leaves with a high nitrogen content by regrazing and adding fecal matter to the same eelgrass patches (Moore and Black 2006). Southern Humboldt Bay, with its greater eelgrass shoot densities and biomass than North Bay, is also the bay where the majority of Black Brant feed and roost (Moore et al. 2004); and, since even the youngest eelgrass leaves are poor fodder relative to terrestrial grasses, the geese have to optimize their foraging time (Moore and Black 2006). Far fewer birds graze on North Bay eelgrass, which could be because of the greater amount of human activity on and around this bay, the lower shoot densities do not attract them, or the eelgrass may not be as accessible to the birds since the eelgrass in North Bay is deeper than South Bay and Black Brant only feed while floating over the eelgrass (Moore et al. 2004). Seagrass mesograzers are capable of regulating epiphyte biomass (Williams and Ruckelshaus 1993;Jernakoff et al. 1996) and thus potentially also increasing seagrass productivity by removing epiphytes that intercept PAR, particularly in the blue and red wavelengths (van Montfrans et al. 1984;Drake et al. 2003). Caprellid and gammarid amphipods, the isopod Idotea resecata, the gastropod Lacuna variegata and the opisthobranch Phyllaplysia taylori all occur in Humboldt Bay; and eelgrass epiphytes make up part or all of their diets (Beeman 1968(Beeman , 1969(Beeman , 1970Zimmerman et al. 1979;Williams and Ruckelshaus 1993;Nelson 1997b;Nelson and Waaland 1997;DeLorenzo 1999). Phyllaplysia taylori is cryptically colored and spends its entire life on eelgrass leaves (Bridges 1975); and, while its reproductive biology has received some attention (Beeman 1970;Dykhouse 1976;Jaeckle 1984), its ecological function as an eelgrass mesograzer is just beginning to be appreciated. The number of adult P. taylori in North Bay shows an inverse relationship with eelgrass epiphyte loads (Keiser 2004). The present study therefore used aquaria to test the hypothesis that P. taylori can reduce epiphyte loads, and this hypothesis was supported each time the experiment was run. We also noticed that more P. taylori became permanently detached from the eelgrass leaves at the higher flow rate of 3.0 L/min, similar to the way snails are removed from shoots of Zostera noltii that occur at sites in the North Sea with more water movement. The loss of these snails results in epiphyte release (Schanz and Asmus 2002). The consequences of grazers to plant productivity in other systems, the dependence of Black Brant on eelgrass and the correlative and experimental data for P. taylori all indicate that Black Brant grazing could be increasing leaf growth rates or shoot densities in Humboldt Bay and that leaf cleaning by P. taylori and possibly other mesograzers allows eelgrass to be more productive. Eelgrass productivity and biomass in Humboldt Bay may not only be the result of fluctuations in physical factors. The ESM conceptual model of community regulation that we applied to eelgrass in Humboldt Bay does not include parasitism as one of its biotic interactions although the pathogen Labyrinthula zosterae (Protista, Heterokontophyta), which has severely reduced eelgrass biomass in the northwestern Atlantic (Muehlstein 1989;Muehlstein et al 1991), could have a major effect on the eelgrass habitat in the bay. Although there has never been a large-scale die-off of eelgrass in Humboldt Bay, the characteristic black leaf lesions of the wasting disease and L. zosterae itself are present on eelgrass in the bay (Leander, pers. comm.). The conditions that trigger an outbreak of L. zosterae are unclear. The advantage of this model is that it has a broad perspective, and its application to the eelgrass in the Humboldt Bay environment in this analysis leads us to hypothesize that low light due to suspended sediments will be one of the largest stressors to eelgrass. Mechanisms of importance that could also impact eelgrass at a bay-wide scale are nitrate levels that, if not compensated by sediment ammonium, could limit eelgrass growth and the intensity of epiphyte grazing by Phyllaplysia taylori. Other factors regulating eelgrass abundance and trophic relationships-in particular wind waves, desiccation, Black Brant grazing and anthropogenic activities like dredging and mariculture operations-will have more localized effects. In total, South Bay should be less stressed and more regulated by top-down trophic interactions than North Bay, and future information should show relatively finer-scale differences in stress within the bays."}, {"section_title": "Management Tools and Supporting Research", "text": "One approach to the conservation of the eelgrass ecosystem in Humboldt Bay is to use the environmental stress model of Menge and Sutherland (1987), or a similar model, in order to derive a set of eelgrass habitat requirements. While several endeavors of this kind are underway around the world, requirements developed for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the Chesapeake Bay are a particularly strong example (Kenworthy et al. 2006). Because of the susceptibility of SAV to low light and the multiple anthropogenic activities that degrade aquatic light, the Chesapeake Bay Program has focused on light attenuation either just through the water (based on Secchi depth or direct measures of light attenuation) or the more accurate but data-intensive approach of accounting for light attenuation by epiphytes as well as the water column (based on water column and epiphyte extinction coefficients, epiphyte biomass, total suspended solids, nutrients; Dennison et al. 1993;Batiuk et al. 2000). In both approaches, there is an attempt to manage the light environment to meet SAV requirements, which are stratified according to salinity regime. Batiuk et al. 2000also recognize that other physical factors (e.g., tidal range, tidal velocities, wind waves, sediment grain sizes, porewater sulfide) have to be incorporated into habitat requirements in the future. This approach could be adapted for Humboldt Bay; but we suggest that, in addition to these physical factors, since eelgrass growth and the health of this critical fish habitat may be positively affected by Black Brant grazing and mesograzers like Phyllaplysia taylori, these organisms need to be part of the habitat requirements for eelgrass in Humboldt Bay. Even when the original data presented in this analysis is combined with existing studies, it is clear that several types of studies are necessary for both a more complete perspective of eelgrass regulation in Humboldt Bay as well as the development of relevant and accurate habitat requirements for eelgrass in the bay. The first group of studies needs to expand upon what is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of eelgrass in Humboldt Bay. More complete maps of eelgrass and green algal distribution, with the upper and subtidal lower elevations of the eelgrass beds clearly demarcated, are necessary in conjunction with long-term monitoring of eelgrass metrics at select locations to identify watershed and climate effects. The second group of studies needs to more completely enumerate the spatial and temporal variability of water-column and eventually epiphyte attenuation of light (e.g., Batiuk et al. 2000). Water column K d values and corresponding compensation depths from San Francisco Bay should be similar to those in Humboldt Bay and therefore give a range of K d values to expect and a possible target for management. These are K d = 1.5, 1.6 (-2.0 m MLLW), K d = 1.9 (-1.5 m MLLW), K d = 2.2 (-1.0 m MLLW) and K d = 3.1 (-0.5 m MLLW) (Zimmerman et al. 1991;Wyllie-Echeverria and Fonseca 2003). The present study indicates that water-column attenuation of light due to suspended sediments needs to be better understood in Humboldt Bay, and it will not be possible to manage for K d if the origins of sediments in the bay remain relatively unknown. The efficacy of managing the light environment could be evaluated by both remote sensing (Batiuk et al. 2000) as well as Zimmerman's (2003) biooptical model for predicting eelgrass productivity in which K d is one of the parameters. A third group of studies needs to further describe the spatial and temporal pattern of nitrate, ammonium and phosphate in the water column and sediments of the bay and determine if any of these nutrients are contributing to light attenuation by promoting phytoplankton or epiphyte growth or if they are having directly toxic effects. As is the case for sediments, management of nutrients will only be possible if nutrient origins are known; and, since nitrate is primarily oceanic in origin, ammonium and phosphate need specific attention. A fourth set of studies should examine many of the less understood physical factors that affect eelgrass distribution and productivity, particularly the role of wind-wave disturbance and sediment grain size in setting upper limits for eelgrass in Humboldt Bay."}, {"section_title": "Proceedings of the 2004 Humboldt Bay Symposium \u2026 85", "text": "A final group of studies needs to examine the importance of top-down interactions from Black Brant and mesograzers on eelgrass productivity. Black Brant are known to occur in large numbers in Humboldt Bay and consume the eelgrass (Moore et al. 2004;Moore and Black 2006); but their effects on eelgrass productivity, potentially positive or negative depending upon feeding behavior and population size, are unknown. Since grazing changes the vegetation structure of the eelgrass bed, it is also possible that Black Brant affect the type, number and size of crabs, fish and shrimp using the bed. A more complete temporal and spatial description of the eelgrass mesograzer guild in the bay is also necessary, particularly for Phyllaplysia taylori. In addition, sources of mortality of P. taylori, likely suspended sediments and eutrophication (Clark 1995), need to be identified.   Barnhart et al. (1992).

Misitano found that English sole enter Humboldt Bay at approximately the same time that they begin settling to the bottom. Anderson and Bryan (1970) described growth of surfperches in Humboldt Bay. They detailed length-weight relationships between males and females by studying scales from three species of surfperch collected in the bay.

Eldridge (1970) found that the abundance of larval fishes increased with increasing distance from the mouth of Humboldt Bay. His study found a total of 37 species of larval fish. DeGeorges (1972) also collected a number of fish species in Humboldt Bay that had not yet been documented during his study of artificial reefs in South Bay. Samuelson (1973) and Sopher (1974) each conducted trawl surveys in South and North Bay, respectively, to determine species composition. These two studies are commonly cited in other publications describing the fish composition in Humboldt Bay. Waldvogel (1977) studied the distribution and age structure of Northern anchovy, Engraulis mordax, in Humboldt Bay. In the process, he documented 16 incidentally collected species. Other studies that provide information regarding species composition can be found in Prince and Gotshall (1976), Hill and Hendrickson (1991) and Chamberlain and Barnhart (1993), among others. Each of these has documented the presence of specific fish and added to the current information of species composition in Humboldt Bay. Further information on the fish species inhabiting Humboldt Bay is often based on summary reports, both published and unpublished (Gotshall 1966;Monroe 1973;Shapiro and Associates 1980;Gotshall et al. 1980;Barnhart et al. 1992;Fritzsche and Cavanagh 1995). These papers reference the research of Humboldt State University, Master's theses, historical records and personal communications. Because of this, determination of dates and locations of fish species collected in Humboldt Bay are often difficult to ascertain. A majority of the data presented in these papers was collected in the 1970s. These studies are also limited in application because only certain habitats within Humboldt Bay were sampled. Examination of many habitats would allow for a new understanding of fish distribution as it relates to habitat type, and provide detailed information for GIS analyses regarding ecological relationships within Humboldt Bay. It would also produce a database of current information regarding fish species and their distribution in Humboldt Bay. Geographic information systems technology allows for complex spatial analyses to be conducted. Its capabilities allow scientists to examine ecological relationships to improve fisheries management decisions. For example, established characteristics for suitable salmon spawning habitat were entered into GIS in order to determine possible locations that met these criteria (Dauble et al. 1999). The health of fish habitat can also be determined using GIS. Hawks et al. 2000used GIS as an aid in the development of watershed interactions, and determined appropriate acquisition areas based on human impacts, percentage of public land, species richness and habitat characteristics. Geographic information systems can also be very useful for predictive analyses. Keleher and Rahel (1996) were able to model potential fish habitat loss based on gradual increases in temperature over time. Many variables affect the distribution of fish and habitat utilization. Geographic information systems allow a number of environmental factors to be analyzed. Zheng et al. (2002) found that statistical analyses used to describe spatial patterns of whiting, Merlangius merlangus, were limited and potentially incorrect. Subsequently, in order to accurately model the relationship between environmental conditions and abundance of whiting, GIS was used. The ability of GIS to query spatial data and produce maps of species distribution makes it highly practical for analyzing fish habitat data. Fortunati et al. (2002) recognized the importance of analyzing and depicting trawl data using GIS, and therefore described the Trawl Survey Data Viewer (TSDV), a new GIS tool. This tool allows researchers to apply the graphic capabilities of GIS to the large amounts of data collected during trawl surveys. Singh et al. (2000) used maps created in GIS to support a proposal to include Musquash Estuary in New Brunswick, Canada, as a Marine Protected Area (MPA). The capabilities of GIS allowed clear representation of fish habitat and distribution. Several physical and biological features of Humboldt Bay are currently being mapped using GIS. Many of these are available from the Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation and Conservation District at http://www.humboldtbay.org. Several of the maps describe the infrastructure surrounding the bay, including property lines and roads. There are also maps depicting bird habitat, oyster culture beds, and historic and current eelgrass bed locations. The capabilities of GIS are useful to the Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation and Conservation District because it is responsible for the management of the Port of Humboldt Bay. Consequently, it maintains the many GIS coverages of the bay. However, there is no coverage available that describes the location of finfish in Humboldt Bay. This study is important because fish distribution data have never been collected over such a large scope of locations within Humboldt Bay. Physical-chemical parameters have also been recorded at many sampling locations. These data can easily be combined with habitat type data in GIS, allowing specific queries of the data. For this study, GIS will be used to determine habitat utilization by fishes of Humboldt Bay, and primarily for its ability to graphically depict fish distribution within the bay.\nAllen LG, Horn MH (1975)  During this survey, we collected and identified 97 species that are possibly nonindigenous marine species (NIS) in Humboldt Bay. There were representatives from most major groups of organisms, ranging from vascular plants to fish. The largest number of species is found in various invertebrate groups, including polychaetes (24), amphipods 20, and bryozoa (8). Previous studies in Humboldt Bay (Barnhart et al. 1992) were not focused on identification and enumeration of introduced species, but many of the NIS found in this study have been reported in that earlier work. A number of introduced species have been in Humboldt Bay for a long time, some cases going back to the first settlement of the region by Europeans in the mid-1800s. Almost immediately following initial settlement, maritime trade began, with shipping of lumber and lumber products to all parts of the world. Sometime in the 1860s, the most abundant plant of Humboldt Bay salt marshes, Spartina densiflora, was brought into the bay from South America, probably as shingle or dry ballast (Barnhart et al. 1992). Intentional introductions have also accounted for a number of species that are numerous in the bay. Beginning in the 1890s, efforts to introduce and grow oysters were pursued all along the California coast (Bonnot 1935). Attempts to grow Eastern and European oysters failed, but Japanese oysters were successfully introduced into Humboldt Bay. A significant commercial aquaculture activity continues around the planting, growth and harvesting of Japanese oysters. The seed oysters for this species are produced in Puget Sound and shipped in bags to Humboldt Bay. We identified one species of algae, previously unreported from Humboldt Bay, which has probably arrived from Puget Sound in this manner. Other examples of species that were introduced intentionally include the Eastern soft shell clam (Mya arenaria) and the Japanese cockle (Venerupis phillippinarium). However, unintentional introductions also occurred. Early methods of transporting marine organisms from one area to another might take several days and packing in wet algae was commonly used to retard dessication. Numerous small, inconspicuous juveniles of other species might be concealed among the algae or attached to its blades. In this manner, small polychaetes or crustaceans were inadvertently introduced when the algal material was tossed into the bay. We included in this study species that are clearly the result of introductions and those that have been characterized as cryptogenic (Cohen and Carlton 1995;Carlton 1996a). Cryptogenic species are organisms that appear to be widespread in bays, ports, and estuaries of the world and cannot be identified as definitely native or exotic to a particular region. Carlton (1996b) has proposed that many of these species are the result of maritime trade and other human activity that go back hundreds of years. Some cryptogenic species occurrences are the result of intentional or unintentional Spartina densiflora. introductions that are lost in time and history. Others are of uncertain relationship to species that have a wide range of occurrence but may be genetically distinct in parts of their range. In yet others, their present-day occurrence is merely an indication of their capacity to adapt to a wide range of environmental conditions. Of the 97 species that we identified as possible introductions to Humboldt Bay, 11 are probably cryptogenic, while an additional 13 species may fall into that category. We compared the occurrence of introduced species in Humboldt Bay to their occurrence mentioned in previous studies done along the Pacific coast of North America (Cohen and Carlton 1995;Ruiz et al. 2000). In particular, we compared the reported occurrence of species in San Francisco Bay to the south and in Coos Bay, Oregon to the north. Of the 97 species in Humboldt Bay, 31 have been reported from all three bays, 23 species in San Francisco and Humboldt Bays, but no species that were found only in Coos and Humboldt Bays. Twentyseven of the introduced species we report are found only in Humboldt Bay. These data on co-occurrence suggest that San Francisco Bay could be an important source area for introductions to Humboldt Bay, a finding consistent with ship and small boat traffic moving between these two locations. The 27 species that appear to be found only in Humboldt Bay suggests that there may be factors such as shipping or other human influences that are unique to the bay.\n\n"}, {"section_title": "Proceedings of the 2004 Humboldt Bay Symposium \u2026 109", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Site Description", "text": "Humboldt Bay is located 372 kilometers north of San Francisco Bay at latitude 40\u00b0 46 / N and longitude 124\u00b0 14 / W (Figure 1). The bay is composed of three subbays: North Bay, Entrance Bay and South Bay. Collectively, the bay measures 22.5 km in length, with an area of 62.4 km 2 at mean high water (MHW), and 28.0 km 2 at mean low water (MLW) (Proctor et al. 1980). Humboldt Bay is primarily exposed at low tide, with 65-70% of the entire bay made up of mudflats, the dominant habitat in both North and South Bays (Barnhart et al. 1992). The bay is considered an atypical estuary because true estuarine conditions rarely occur due to limited freshwater input. There is also little mixing in the bay. At low tide, water that was covering the mudflats and present in the channels at high tide moves into the deeper channels and nearshore waters, respectively (Pequegnat and Butler 1982). A descriptive classification of Humboldt Bay was given by Costa (1982) when he described it as a tidedriven, multibasin coastal lagoon. North Bay, also called Arcata Bay, is the largest of the three subbays, with a surface area of 8,000 acres (Monroe 1973). Jacoby Creek in the northeast, and Freshwater Creek and Elk River in the southeast provide freshwater to North Bay. Seventy-seven percent of the MHW area of North Bay is made up of intertidal mudflats, which are segmented by channels ( Figure  2). North Bay Channel, Samoa Channel, and Eureka Channel are deepwater channels that extend from Entrance Channel, at the entrance of the bay, into North Bay. Mad River Slough Channel and Arcata Channel are shallower tidal channels that branch from deeper channels and segment into several tidal gullies. South Bay is approximately 4,600 acres in area (Monroe 1973). Mudflats are the major habitat type, making up 81% of the MHW area in this subbasin. Freshwater input comes from Salmon Creek, which flows into the southeastern portion of South Bay. Two channels, Hookton Channel and Southport Channel, extend from Entrance Channel into South Bay. Because the tidal prism, MHW to MLW, of South Bay is 68% (higher than the 44% tidal prism of North Bay), the water in this bay is much closer in character to nearshore water (Pequegnat and Butler 1982). Eelgrass, Zostera marina, is commonly found on the low mud flats near tidal gullies of both North and South Bays. Harding and Butler (1979) estimated the combined area of eelgrass cover in both North and South Bays to be 1,221 hectares, with a higher biomass in South Bay. Current mapping of eelgrass beds in Humboldt Bay is being carried out (McBride 2003, pers. comm.). Based on digital images taken in October 2000 by the California Department of Fish and Game, the area of eelgrass in all of Humboldt Bay was determined to be 1,951 hectares, with North Bay possessing a larger area of eelgrass than South Bay (McBride 2003, pers. comm.). Entrance Bay connects North and South Bays and is essentially a deep channel that includes the mouth of Humboldt Bay. The area covered by water remains relatively constant throughout the tidal cycle, with only 10% of its area considered tidal flat (Barnhart et al. 1992). Two jetties, approximately 2 km in length, were constructed at the entrance of the bay from 1889 to 1899. The entrance to Humboldt Bay increased in depth from 12 to 27 feet due to this construction (Tuttle 1982). The addition of the jetties caused an increase in wave energy entering the bay (Costa 1982), and led to the complete rebuilding of the jetties from 1911 to 1925 (Tuttle 1982). Much of the shore of Entrance Bay is lined with rip-rap due to this increased wave action ( Figure 3).    In order to maintain channel depths, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is required to dredge Humboldt Bay channels annually. Entrance Channel, North Bay Channel, Samoa Channel, Eureka Channel and Hookton Channel are dredged to depths of 7.9-10.7 meters (Barnhart et al. 1992). Major modifications of channels require sponsorship from the local Humboldt Bay Harbor District, which sponsored USACE projects to deepen Entrance Channel, North Bay Channel and Samoa Channel in April 2000 to improve navigation (Humboldt Bay Harbor District; http://www. humboldtbay.org). In addition to dredging, other modifications such as diking, draining and filling have changed the morphology of Humboldt Bay remarkably (Glatzel 1982). The National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is responsible, under the 1986 Emergency Wetlands Resource Act, for characterizing and sizing the country's wetlands and deepwater habitats. The agency has mapped approximately 90% of the wetlands in the continental United States, 44% of the maps are available in digital format (http://wetlands.fws.gov). They have distributed over one million digital wetland files; all are available for use by the private sector. The NWI uses Cowardin et al. (1979) for classification of wetlands and deepwater habitats (Appendix A). This scheme is widely used, and serves as a consistent system for describing wetland habitat. The hierarchical system begins with five major categories: Estuarine (E), Lacustrine (L), Marine (M), Palustrine (M), and Riverine (R). The digital map of Humboldt Bay, available through the NWI, is used as the base habitat map in this GIS study."}, {"section_title": "Coordinates", "text": "Geographic coordinates were collected at each site in order to accurately record the location. Points for many intertidal and subtidal locations were collected on the shore adjacent to the wetted area sampled. Locations were recorded as geographic coordinates in degrees, minutes and seconds, using a Trimble GeoExplorer II hand held Global Positioning System (GPS) unit. The GPS points were collected instantaneously, and not averaged or corrected. A total of 280 points were collected using this GPS unit. Forty-nine trawling locations, sampled using the R/V The Coral Sea, were collected via a Furuno GPS 80 unit. Because the base layer map of Humboldt Bay was projected in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), these coordinates were then converted using Corpscon for Windows Version 5.11.08."}, {"section_title": "Fishes", "text": "The focus of fish sampling was in areas that had not been thoroughly sampled in the past, including small channels, sloughs, rip-rap areas in the vicinity of the jetties and flocculent mud flats. Sampling techniques varied with habitat type. Much of the sampling was completed from the shore using pole seines, which varied in size from 8-50 feet long by 4-6 feet deep with a mesh size of 0.25 inch. Two to four crewmembers pulled the pole seine either parallel to shore or at a slight angle towards the shore. Beach seines were also used, and ranged in size from 120 to 150 feet long by 6 to 8 feet deep with a mesh size of 0.25 inch. One end of a beach seine was stacked on the shore while the free end was attached to a small aluminum skiff. The skiff was then used to deploy the seine in order to make a half circle from the shore. Once the skiff had completed the set, crewmembers would pull the net onto the shore. Sampling of the major channels in the bay was conducted from the R/V Coral Sea using a 32-foot epibenthic otter trawl with a 2-inch stretch mesh in the body and 1-inch stretch mesh in the cod end. Seventeen trawls were completed using this trawl net. Trawling over eelgrass beds was done using a 16-foot epibenthic otter trawl with a 1-inch stretch mesh in the body and 0.25-inch stretch mesh in the cod end. Sixteen trawls were done with this net from Humboldt State University's 27-foot aluminum pontoon boat. The tow speed and length of each trawl was dependent upon location, and was recorded to the nearest minute. On most occasions, geographical coordinates were taken once the trawl entered the water and again when the net was pulled out of the water. The pontoon boat was also used to deploy a 6-foot modified beam trawl with 3-mm mesh to collect juvenile fishes a total of eight times. Standard minnow traps were also used in areas where nets could not be easily deployed. For example, minnow traps were attached to rip-rap at the entrance to the bay, which is a deep channel with very steep sides. A total of 30 traps were set in Humboldt Bay. The type of gear used reflected the habitat type being sampled, and there was no attempt to complete repetitive sampling. Due to this, the resulting data do not allow for any advanced statistical analyses. All fishes were identified, enumerated, measured to the nearest millimeter (total length, TL), and released at the site of capture. Fish that could not be identified in the field were fixed in either 5-10% formalin, depend-ing on life history stage. These specimens were brought back to the laboratory where they were subsequently transferred to 40% isopropyl alcohol and identified. An approved protocol was obtained under the Institutional Animal Care and Use Protocol #00/01.F.104.A. Fishes were primarily identified using Miller and Lea (1972). Other keys used were Tarp (1952), Hitz (1965), and Materese et al. (1989."}, {"section_title": "Water Quality", "text": "Temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen were measured concurrently with fish sampling with either a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) model 85 or model 33. Location and number of readings were contingent upon the nature of the sample site. For example, a slough would require readings to be taken at the mouth where salinities might be higher, and also at the terminus, where salinities might be lower. In order to accurately represent changes in water quality over area, readings were taken as frequently as possible."}, {"section_title": "GIS Analysis", "text": "A digital habitat map of Humboldt Bay was obtained from the NWI Web site (http:// www.nwi.fws.gov). Seven separate ARC/INFO export files corresponding with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles, were downloaded to obtain a complete coverage of Humboldt Bay (Environmental Systems Research Institute 1999a). These were joined into one contiguous coverage and then the dissolve command was used to combine the attribute tables into one database table. The polygons of the resulting coverage included habitat types as well as their area. The habitat types included estuarine, marine, palustrine and riverine. For each of these highlevel categories, many subsystems were defined. A new column was added into the attribute table to condense the habitat code for all but the estuarine type into one code for each. For example, instead of including all three marine habitats: M1UBL, M2US2N and M2US2P, polygons were merged to include all subcategories under the single heading \"Marine.\" This coverage was used as the base layer for fish and water-quality data. Two separate tables were created in Mi-crosoft\u00ae Excel to include spatial information for each sample location. Most sites were represented by points. Most trawl sites were represented by a pair of points representing the start and end of the trawl. Each point in both tables was given a unique number based on sampling order. These tables were saved as dBASE IV files, and imported as shapefiles using ArcView\u00ae 3.2 (Environmental Systems Research Institute 1999b). These shapefiles were then converted to coverages. The point shapefile depicting trawl locations was edited in ArcMap to create lines (Environmental Systems Research Institute 2000). For trawls with a start and end point, lines were digitized connecting the two. Trawl lines that crossed an upland polygon when a straight line was digitized were given a central vertex outside of the upland polygon. For trawls with only a start point, trawl length was determined using the equation: d = vt, where d = distance, v = velocity and t = time, as both the speed of the boat as well as the length of time for each trawl were known. Once the distance was obtained, lines were digitized to the specific length. The appropriate azimuth was retained for all lines. These trawls were saved as a line shapefile. A column was added to the attribute table to give each line a new, unique identification number. With the creation of the line shapefile, a completely new set of unique identifying numbers was created for the point shapefile. This was necessary, as the original point shapefile included all sampling events in one series of numbers. Because there were two separate shapefiles, new numbers were needed. The attribute table reflects the addition of new numbers with the original number identified as \"Sample_#,\" and the new number identified as \"ID.\" The sample number was retained in the attribute table to allow easy cross-referencing with originally collected tabular data. Two tables were created in Excel to include fish data collected at each site: one for point locations and one for line locations. The tables included, for each feature, the common name of the fish species collected, the maximum, minimum and average length and abundance for each species. The table also included the respective identification number (ID) for each sampling site. Similarly, two water-quality data tables were created. These tables were saved as dBASE IV files. Upon viewing the point shapefile with the habitat map shapefile in ArcMap, it was apparent that many points did not fall within the correct known habitat polygon. This was primarily due to established, inherent error in both the GPS units and the map data, but also the nature of GPS point collection. Therefore, many points appeared to fall on land. Other inaccuracies were noticeable when points fell just outside the respective channel sampled (Figure 4). Point-in-polygon and line-in-polygon intersections were performed between the sample location files to allow easy examination of what habitat type contained points and transects by searching only the attribute table. A considerable number of locations that were, in actuality, sampled in estuarine habitat appeared to fall within upland or palustrine habitat polygons. These points were selected from the attribute table. An export file was created that contained only these points. In order to move these points into the correct habitat polygons, the editing function in ArcMap was used. The original point shapefile was used as the editing layer. Each point   from the export file was examined individually while reviewing raw data sheets for accuracy of location. Points that fell outside the actual areas sampled were mapped to an appropriate nearby location. These included points in both estuarine and palustrine habitat polygons. Points that fell in the sloughs and channels that were not evident on the map were not edited. The newly edited points were saved as a separate shapefile ( Figure 5). The edited point coverage was intersected in ARC/INFO. After this intersection, the only points that fell within upland polygons were the unedited points from sloughs and channels not detectable on the map. The original intersected line shapefile was free of discrepancies. Any further editing of points was made directly to the new intersected coverage. The fish and water-quality data tables were related to the intersected point and line cover-ages on the common ID field in the attribute tables in ArcMap. Because dBASE IV files created in Excel do not maintain cell formatting, columns containing text were not recognized in ArcMap. A new text column was added to the fish data tables in ArcMap, and the field calculator was used to copy the original species column, \"Fish_Sp,\" to the new column, \"Species.\" After the finished tables were related to the spatial data, specific data were queried for all habitat analyses. Specific habitat types were selected from the intersected coverages. Because the fish data tables were related, statistics for all species collected in a selected habitat were easily queried. For example, searches for specific fish species were easily conducted to determine locations within the bay where these species were captured. (Figure 6). Likewise, the average length for a particular species was obtained    by averaging the average length column; overall maximum lengths were obtained from the maximum-length column. In the same way, species were also queried by subbay."}, {"section_title": "Estuarine, Subtidal, Unconsolidated Bottom, Sand, Subtidal (E1UB2L)", "text": "This habitat type constituted 26.73% of all estuarine habitat within the bay.

While threespine stickleback was the most abundant species, the Pacific staghorn sculpin was the most commonly captured species. Previous studies of Humboldt Bay support this extensive distribution of staghorn sculpin. Shapiro and Associates (1980) claimed staghorn sculpin was one of the most abundant and widely distributed fish in Humboldt Bay. Barnhart et al. (1992) listed staghorn sculpins as abundant, and strongly euryhaline, allowing the species to live in both fresh and saltwater habitats. Staghorn sculpins were found at just over 60% of all locations and collected in all but one habitat type sampled in the bay. Water quality readings taken both during trawls and other sampling methods ranged from 0.6 parts per thousand to 37 parts per thousand (Appendix J). Lengths of staghorn sculpins ranged from 11 mm TL in habitat type E1UBL to 242 mm TL in habitat type E1UB2L. Shiner surfperch was the most abundant species collected in both Samuelson's (1973) South Bay study and Sopher's (1974) study of North Bay. Because Sopher found no females carrying young after May and no individuals less than 85 mm TL between January and May, he determined that spawning in Humboldt Bay must occur between May and June. The highest numbers of smaller individuals occurred between the months of June and July. Similarly, Samuelson found that between the months of February and April, C. aggregata ranged in total length from 73 mm-225 mm. However, between the months of June and October, total lengths ranged from 50 mm-132 mm. In this study of Humboldt Bay, shiner surfperch, collected from September 25, 2000to November 30, 2001, was the second most abundant species. The highest numbers were collected during the summer months of June through September (Appendix K). Shiner surfperch were primarily collected by seine during these months. No trawl samples were collected. The smallest individual measured 36 mm TL, and was collected in July. Most of the smaller individuals were collected in July with the average TL being lowest between the months of June through August. The higher number of individuals collected in the month of September is a reflection of the over 1,000 shiner surfperch caught by trawl in Eureka Channel. Collected at only 33 sites, Northern anchovy was the sixth most abundant species collected. Waldvogel (1977) found that Northern anchovy entered Humboldt Bay in April, and remained until the first week of November. Samuelson (1973) and Sopher (1974) found Northern anchovies in Humboldt Bay from April to October, and March to September, respectively. Eldridge and Bryan (1972) found E. mordax larvae in the months of March, August, September, and December. These results are consistent with the present study, as anchovies were found in the bay from March to October. Anchovies were most abundant from June to August. Northern anchovy -text continued p. 156                              are abundant in other California coastal estuaries, and was the most abundant species in August and September. They were also the most abundant species overall in a study of Colorado Lagoon (Allen and Horn 1975). Northern anchovy are thought to bring coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch. and chinook salmon, O. tshawytscha, into Humboldt Bay, as they are a major food source for both species."}, {"section_title": "Proceedings of the 2004 Humboldt Bay Symposium \u2026 141", "text": "English sole were the eighth most abundant species for this study. This is consistent with results from other published studies of Humboldt Bay (Samuelson 1973;Sopher 1974;Shapiro and Associates 1980;Chamberlain and Barnhart 1993), where English sole were among the most commonly collected species. Misitano (1970Misitano ( , 1976 found that English sole use Humboldt Bay as a nursery area, and that entry into the bay occurs when they are between 19 mm-26 mm TL. Young-of-the-year English sole were determined to be present in Humboldt Bay between the months of February and April, when they became abundant until the emigration of yearlings from the bay (Toole 1980). The smallest examples of English sole collected in this study were found on March 13, 2001. For this one sampling date, mean lengths of each trawl ranged from 19 mm to 34 mm TL, with the smallest individual being 18 mm TL. These sole were collected in North Bay channel and the channel between Indian and Woodley Islands while sampling for juvenile fishes with the 16-foot modified beam trawl. Over the entire study, the mean lengths of English sole ranged from 37.39 mm to 104.29 mm TL at each collection site. The largest specimen collected in this study was 230 mm TL. This individual was taken in North Bay Channel, northwest of the mouth of Elk River slough on November 30, 2001. Based on Ketchen (1956), this individual would be considered near sexual maturity, and was collected during the English sole spawning season between October and May (Matarese et al. 1989). Because no sexually mature English sole have been collected in Humboldt Bay, spawning is believed to occur in ocean waters. The presence of leopard sharks in Humboldt Bay has been noted by several researchers (Samuelson 1973;Sopher 1974;Gotshall et al. 1980;Shapiro and Associates 1980;Fritzsche and Cavanagh 1995). A 1975 study of food habits of leopard sharks in San Francisco and Tomales Bays noted that Callianassa shrimp, crabs of the genus Cancer, and an echiuran worm, Urechis caupo, were the most frequent choices (Russo 1975). Each of these is a demersal invertebrate, which supports the claim that leopard sharks are benthic feeders on mud flats. Although leopard sharks were found in North Bay and Hookton Slough, they were collected in abundance in the southwestern portion of South Bay on May 8, 2001 ( Figure  23). On this day, a total of 86 individuals were collected on an incoming tide. The habitat at this location is E2US3N, and is best described as mudflat segmented by narrow channels. Miklos et al. (2003) studied leopard sharks in Tomales Bay and found that summer location is greatly affected by tidal stage, with movement into the littoral zones to feed occurring at high tide. The temperatures in the intertidal areas of Tomales Bay during the study often reached 25 \u00ba C. Water temperatures recorded on May 8, 2001 in Humboldt Bay reached 21 \u00ba C, with a salinity of 34 parts per thousand. One medusafish, Icichthys lockingtoni, family Centrolophidae, was collected in eelgrass beds near Southport Channel in South Bay. Gotshall et al. (1980) stated that a medusafish had been collected in Humboldt Bay by trawl in September 1968. Fritzsche andCavanagh (1995) reiterated that this was the only medusafish recorded from Humboldt Bay, and that they are rarely found in shallow water. The individual found in this study measured 79 mm TL. It was collected on July 12, 2001 on an outgoing tide. Twenty-six tidewater gobies were collected in six habitat types in Humboldt Bay, including the assigned habitat type of E2US3N for the drainage ditch in North Bay (Figures 24  and 25). Gobies were collected on both sides of the tide gate between the drainage ditch (nine    During the course of this study, five species not previously documented in Humboldt Bay were collected. These were gopher rockfish, Sebastes carnatus, Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax, mosquitofish, Gambusia affinis, longjaw mudsucker, Gillichthys mirabilis, and petrale sole, Eopsetta jordani. These species are not uncommon to the northeast Pacific Ocean, however, no prior studies have noted their presence in Humboldt Bay. Because of our sampling techniques, only juvenile rockfish were collected in this study. Most of the 155 individuals were black rockfish, a species known to reside in Humboldt Bay (Gotshall et al. 1980). Juvenile rockfish have been shown to reside in other California bays and estuaries (Moring 1972;Yoklavich et al. 1991Yoklavich et al. , 1996. The single copper rockfish collected on August 14, 2001 at the mouth of Hookton Slough in South Bay is also considered to be resident in Humboldt Bay (Gotshall et al. 1980). One gopher rockfish was collected in the southern end of Southport Channel in South Bay on July 11, 2001. While copper rockfish are considered residents of Humboldt Bay (Gotshall et al. 1980), gopher rockfish have never been noted in Humboldt Bay. Their range is described as San Roque, Baja California to Eureka, California (Miller and Lea 1972). However, rockfish of the subgenus Pteropodus, the \"copper complex,\" which include the gopher rockfish, were thought to be common near Monterey Bay (Yocklavich et al. 1996). The geographic range of Pacific sardines is from Guaymas, Mexico, to Kamchatka, Russia (Miller and Lea 1972). While common within this range, this species has never previously been documented in Humboldt Bay. Pacific sardines may be identified by the striations on the operculum and black spots on their sides. These two characteristics differentiate them from other common Clupeioid fishes such as the Pacific herring. The Pacific sardine spawns from January to June, with northward migra-tions beginning in early summer (Hart 1973). In the present study, 46 sardines were collected at six separate sites on four different dates. Collection occurred between July 12 and November 30, 2001, with 37 individuals being collected on August 14, 2001. The smallest sardine collected was 81 mm TL; the largest 148 mm TL. Based on the age description of sardines off Central California given by Hart (1973), the individuals collected over the course of this study were approximately one year old. Mosquitofish were collected in the drainage ditch near the Eureka airport. There is a tide gate located at this location on Eureka Slough, as noted on the USGS topoquad. This gate separates the slough from the drainage ditch that follows the outline of the bay (Figures  24 and 25). The mosquitofish were found on only one side of this disconnect, in the direction of the drainage ditch. Ten mosquitofish varying in size from 13 mm to 41 mm TL were collected. This species is considered a freshwater or brackish fish and is not native to Humboldt Bay. The California Department of Fish and Game has no historical record of when mosquitofish may have been planted into Eureka Slough or the drainage ditch, however, a 2001 USFWS study of the ditch found mosquitofish and threespine stickleback (Goldsmith 2003, pers. comm.). Mosquitofish are found in other California bays and estuaries. In San Francisco Bay it is considered an introduced species, where it was found in less than 1% of both otter trawls and beach seines during a 20-year study of Suisun Marsh (Matern et al. 2002). However, mosquitofish were abundant in a study of a more southern estuary, Mugu Lagoon, the largest estuarine lagoon in southern California, located at Point Mugu, Ventura County (Saiki 1997). One longjaw mudsucker, Gillichthys mirabilis, was collected in a small channel that dead-ends just west of the mouth of Mad River Slough. Salinities on the day of capture ranged from 33 to 34 parts per thousand. This is consistent with what is considered typical habitat of the longjaw mudsucker: shallow backwater with soft, muddy substrate and moderate to high salinities (Barlow 1961). Its geographical range is Tomales Bay just north of Point Reyes to the Gulf of California (Miller and Lea 1972). Although Barlow (1961) gives the same northern limit, he notes that the northernmost \"permanent\" population may be in San Francisco Bay, due to the abundance of the species there. Longjaw mudsuckers were present and found to be tolerant to the fluctuating conditions of tidal marshes in San Francisco Bay estuary (Josselyn 1983). A study in the Sweetwater Marsh National Wildlife Refuge in San Diego, California, found juvenile Gillichthys mirabilis to be abundant in spring and summer, with adults present in most samples throughout the study (West and Zedler 2000). In the study, juveniles were determined to be those individuals less than 100 mm. The individual collected in Humboldt Bay would, therefore, be considered a juvenile at 93 mm TL. Two juvenile petrale sole were collected near the eastern shore in Entrance Bay. This area is characterized by high wave action, and sandy beaches. None of the identified specimens in the larval fish studies of Humboldt Bay by Eldridge (1970) or Eldridge and Bryan (1972) was petrale sole. There are no publications that have documented petrale sole in Humboldt Bay. Miller and Lea (1972) define the range of petrale sole from Islas Los Coronados, Baja California, to the northern Gulf of Alaska. Petrale sole are found in nearshore waters near Humboldt Bay. Juvenile fishes use Humboldt Bay as a refuge from predators and as a nursery area. Mature fishes use its many habitats for both feeding and spawning. A study in the Kariega Estuary in South Africa (Paterson and Whitfield 2000) supports the supposition that juvenile fishes seek out the shallower habitats of estuaries to avoid predation. Similarly, many of the same species found in Humboldt Bay were also found during an ecological profile of San Francisco Bay (Josselyn 1983). These fishes were abundant in shallow tidal sloughs. Spatial analyses of fish distribution within Humboldt Bay using GIS have shown that fish utilize many habitats in the bay, and that juvenile fishes are abundant in shallow areas. In the field of fisheries, GIS allows for comprehensive spatial analyses and generates descriptive graphical output. It is this output that provided an updated display of finfish distribution in Humboldt Bay for this study. However, by entering the fish data into GIS, additional advantages were provided. For example, simple analyses of fish species by habitat type were easy to perform and meaningful to obtain. Likewise, water-quality data were easily added to the spatial database. Collected data like these may be used in many ways because they are displayed visually. Other studies have used GIS to present data for both conservation and management. Lunetta et al. (1997) used GIS to combine aspects of salmon-spawning habitat such as stream bank vegetation and gradient to identify particular areas in a stream. By using GIS and other remotely sensed data, suitable habitat locations were predicted before attempting to find them in the field. Fish abundance and habitat usage are not often described using GIS. This was the reason for the study of whitefish in a boreal lake in Ontario, Canada (B\u00e9gout Anras et al. 1999). Location of the whitefish was tracked over two spawning seasons. These data were combined with detailed habitat data to determine patterns of whitefish-spawning behavior. The habitat-type data layer used here was digitized from USGS topographic maps, which were photorevised in the 1970s. Because not all of the small sloughs were apparent on the habitat map, sample points appeared to fall on land. Similarly, points that landed in palustrine habitats were inaccurate as none of the sites sampled during this study were nontidal. Clearly there is a need for new cartographic media to describe wetland habitats of North America. The Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation and Conservation District maintains a current Humboldt Bay atlas of GIS coverages. Of these, several map biological characters. These coverages can be intersected with our new fish distribution coverage to perform analyses similar to the fish by habitat analysis in this study. One of the available coverages of Humboldt Bay is a 1980 sediment layer. This layer was hand-digitized in 2000 from two paper maps (Shapiro and Associates 1980). The coverage gives a description of sediments from clay to sand and silt, as well as a coarseness category (Figure 26). When this coverage is intersected with our fish distribution layer, a list of the detected species can be queried by sediment type. For example, at least 18 species, including juveniles of the family Osmeridae, were collected by methods other than trawl over the sediment type described as marsh (Table 20). Topsmelt accounted for over one-half of the total number of fishes collected in marshy sediment type. A total of 42 species collected by methods other than trawls were associated with the sandy sediment type when the coverages were intersected (Table 21).   There is also a coverage depicting eelgrass beds in Humboldt Bay from 1997. Because eelgrass beds are known to be very productive areas in the bay, and provide habitat for shelter, feeding and spawning, the results from intersecting this coverage with the fish distribution layer are worthy of note (Figure 27). A total of 22 species were collected in eelgrass beds throughout the entire study (Table 22). Shiner surfperch was the most abundant species; two other surfperch species were also collected. Just as a substantial amount of editing was required for this study to assure that sampling locations fell within the correct habitat type, further editing would be required for this analysis. Bay pipefish, which are known to reside in eelgrass beds, are clearly underrepresented as the majority of the bay pipefish collected in this study were in fact collected over eelgrass beds. Most likely points from fish sampling areas either fell among the fringe of the defined eelgrass beds or the current eelgrass coverage needs further updating. The Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation and Conservation District updates coverages as they are created. Both the sediment coverage and eelgrass coverage are several years old, as was the habitat map used for this study. Because of this, slight discrepancies, like changes in tidal sloughs, are apparent when the coverages are used as a base layer for current fish data. This study of Humboldt Bay fishes has accomplished several goals. The need for current fish species data was apparent, as most of the published data are vague in terms of location and comes from the 1970s. A new GIS coverage for Humboldt Bay has been created that can be layered with other available GIS coverages. For this study, the creation of this fish species coverage has offered a new understanding of fish distribution by Humboldt Bay habitat type. The addition of this new coverage will also allow for future analyses to be performed as more GIS coverages of the natural resources of Humboldt Bay are created.

These \"settlement\" panels were monitored for monthly and seasonal larval settlement and used to detect species introductions as well as reproductive periods of sessile invertebrates in Humboldt Bay. All \"settlement\" panels were scraped clean and soaked in fresh water after each census to ensure free substrate was continuously available for settlement of marine larvae each month.\nSeveral of the most conspicuous species displayed seasonal pulses of settlement varying dramatically within and between years (Figure  2a-c). Recruitment levels were higher during summer and fall; little or no settlement was observed during winter months. The hydroid Obelia dichotoma and bryozoan Celleporella hyalina, both exotic species, were present most months of the study. Following winter storms in January 2002, most of the \"overstory\" in this community (especially colonies of Bugula) disappeared and many of the barnacles died. However, two colonies of the bright red invasive bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata appear. (Third) Eight months later in September 2002, one of the two colonies of Watersipora was completely overgrown, while the second was surrounded by colonial ascidians (Diplosoma macdonaldi and Distaplia occidentalis). At this point, a large percentage of the panel was occupied by sponges and the fine, muddy tubes of Corphium. (Bottom) Another eight months later, in May 2003, these colonial ascidians have disappeared, leaving the panel primarily covered with sponges (through which some of the original barnacles can be seen) and a few large mussels."}, {"section_title": "Community Development", "text": "The second set of 20 panels, deployed July 2001, was designed to follow the development of \"undisturbed\" sessile marine communities. Panels in this set were sampled in a nondestructive manner by taking photographs to record the settlement, growth and mortality of sessile species through time. Monthly census of this \"undisturbed\" set coincided with the settlement set. Sampling the two sets simultaneously allowed insights from seasonal time comparisons of recruitment and growth within the developing \"undisturbed\" community.\nThe initial composition of the \"undisturbed\" panel set, deployed in July 2001, was characterized by a steady accumulation of competitive, fast growing colonial tunicates (Figure 3a,b). Diplosoma macdonaldi and Botrylloides sp. dominated most of the space after two months of development. Diplosoma peaked in abundance at 30% cover in September and then rapidly declined in October, failing to reach that level in any of the remaining months of the study. As Diplosoma growth subsided there was a rise in the abundance of Botrylloides (in October) that lasted until December. Ciona intestinalis, originally from the East Coast of the United States, followed on the heels of these two species, peaking at almost 25% cover in November. This peak in Ciona coverage resulted from dramatic growth of a few individuals, with some reaching 5 in. or more in length and covering a substantial portion of the fouling panels. The encrusting bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata, a recently observed introduction to Humboldt Bay, settled and expanded on the panels from October through November 2001. Watersipora maintained up to 10% coverage through March 2002. We have observed this species forming large (6-8 in.-diameter) lettuce-like \"heads\" on the new Eureka municipal docks located across the channel from Woodley Island Marina. Watersipora declined rapidly in abundance after April 2002 at the study site. Winter months were characterized by heavy rain, sedimentation and turbid waters with decreased settlement and growth of any new individuals in the fouling community. There was a noticeable increase in free space on the panels following large storm events (Figure 1), resulting from the disappearance of Botrylloides, Ciona and other tunicates. The comparatively strong settlement during summer and early fall months (Figure 2a-c). Botrylloides settled heaviest from June through August 2001 and again from July through September 2002. Botryllus settled in the early fall months of October 2001 and September 2002, although it did not comprise more than 10% cover on any occasion. In 2001, both Distaplia occidentalis (July) and Diplosoma macdonaldi (October) recruited heavily, dominating nearly half the space on settlement panels. Nevertheless, recruitment levels for these two species resulted in less than 20% cover during the same months in 2002. In contrast, settlement numbers were low for the solitary tunicate Ciona intestinalis during fall 2001 and 2002. Two large pulses of recruitment from the barnacle Balanus crenatus occurred during October 2002 andMay 2003 (Figure 2c). These peaks, representing close to 40% cover, are remarkable given that a newly metamorphosed barnacle comprises less than 0.5% cover. Prior to these peaks, settlement of B. crenatus was extremely low, even during the same months in 2001. hydroid Obelia dichotoma appeared soon after these storms and colonized any available space. Obelia maintained ~18% coverage from January through July 2002. During spring months, Balanus crenatus recruitment to the undisturbed panels was low and never occupied more then 5% cover. Tubedwelling amphipods, Corophium sp., formed clusters of tubes from fine sediment grains accumulating on panel surfaces after winter storms. These crustaceans increased on the panels from January to April 2002 and remained throughout the study. Botrylloides reappeared in the spring to occupy 35% of the undisturbed fouling panels. Their rapid peak in abundance was followed by a steady decline through spring 2003. The sponge Halichondria bowerbanki, an exotic species, first appeared in April 2002 on the \"undisturbed\" panels. Its coverage increased through December 2002, dropped off in January, and recovered in spring of 2003. There were strong pulses of recruitment and growth from Ciona intestinalis, Watersipora subtorquata and a new colonial tunicate, Distaplia occidentalis, during the fall of 2002. Throughout the study, dominant organisms in the community were observed arriving in short pulses of recruitment that typically occurred within a single month. These species were very competitive and overgrew any previous occupants. Beneath these ephemeral species, several disturbance-resistant taxa, including the sponge Halichondria bowerbanki, the tube-forming amphipod Corophium sp. and the mussel Mytilus trossulus (data not shown) gradually increased their substrate occupancy over time (Figure 3b). In contrast to repeated seasonal dominance by fast growing, short-lived species, these durable slow-growing forms were persistent. Recent observations of these same \"undisturbed\" panels (July, 2004) show contin-ued dominance by the mussel M. trossulus and the sponge H. bowerbanki (Janiak, pers. obs.), demonstrating they are capable of persisting for at least several years on these panels."}, {"section_title": "Panel Census Methods", "text": "Data were recorded at Telonicher Marine Laboratory (TML), Trinidad, California.

Care was taken during the retrieval and handling process to avoid long periods out of water or physical loss of sessile species. Each panel was digitally photographed using Nikon\u00ae Coolpix 990 or 995 cameras. Corresponding panel and image numbers were recorded along with notes describing important trends.

The PCJV, as does the Act, aspires to improve the overall quality of natural and artificial coastal wetlands (PRC \u00a7 30001.5), a goal that if achieved would benefit us all. Improving the quality of a wetland can be achieved by increasing its functions (what it does), the processes (physical, chemical, biological aspects of how it performs) or values (those characteristics resulting directly or indirectly from its function that are perceived by society as desirable and worthy of protection, or those characteristics that contribute to the habitat quality of the resident biota). The methods accepted in restoration ecology to improve wetland habitat are: 1. restore: re-establish historic functions and values of a former wetland; 2. enhance: increase the size and/or improve functions and values of an existing wetland; 3. create: establish a new, self-sustaining wetland in an upland area. The Commission staff face an administrative \"albatross\" when evaluating wetland restoration or enhancement projects for compliance. The Act interprets any immediate construction action (e.g., diking, filling, excavating), regardless of its purpose, as \"development\" (PRC \u00a7 30106) that will require a CDP (PRC \u00a7 30600), even if that action is necessary to complete a wetland restoration or enhancement design. To secure a CDP, any action that might cause adverse environmental effects must, if feasible, be mitigated (PRC \u00a7 30233 [a]). The wetlandenhancement proponent/permit seeker is thus faced with the curious dilemma of having to mitigate for restoring or enhancing a wetland. Unfortunately, many enhancement projects cannot overcome the compensatory mitigation hurdle, or the paradox, and are abandoned. Fortunately, the Act provides guidance to resolve this paradox and to achieve its basic goals, which are to \"protect, maintain, and, where feasible, enhance and restore the overall quality of the coastal zone environment and its natural and artificial resources\" (PRC \u00a7 30001.5 [a]). The Act also can resolve conflicting policies by seeking a balance that is the most protective of significant coastal resources (PRC \u00a7 30007.5). When assessing a project whose sole purpose is restoration or enhancement, Commission staff should weigh the net benefit derived from such activities and conclude that these activities, when balanced, are beneficial and therefore are \"self-mitigating\" and do not warrant compensatory mitigation. In California, PCJV partners face significant challenges in complying with the Act when proposing to enhance coastal freshwater wetlands. For former tidelands that are diked, the Act favors restoring freshwater wetlands back to tidelands rather than allowing freshwater wetland enhancement. Freshwater coastal wetlands created on diked former tidelands shall, according to the Act, be restored to tidal influences where feasible (PRC \u00a7 30230), i.e., if there are no physical, economic or political impediments. However, these impediments do exist at many sites or on surrounding lands making restoration infeasible, or risking greater adverse environmental effects than enhancing existing seasonal freshwater wetlands. Consequently, such sites are better suited to enhancing existing freshwater wetlands. Another significant challenge the PCJV faces in enhancing existing freshwater wetlands is the Commission's interpretation of California's Wetlands Conservation Policy (Executive Order W59-93), commonly referred to as the \"no-net-loss\" of wetlands policy. One goal of this policy is to \"Ensure no overall net loss and achieve a long-term net gain in the quantity, quality, and permanence of wetlands acreage and values in California \u2026\" Although \"overall\" was meant to qualify \"no net loss,\" this policy is generally applied as a strict prohibition against net loss of area for every wetland. Rather, \"overall\" implies some latitude or balancing is permissible in order to achieve a long-term net gain of wetland quality in California, which is the goal of enhancement. Likewise, the federal \"no-net-loss\" policy (Executive Order 11990; see Appendix 6.2) is often cited in support of an outright prohibition on any net loss of wetland acreage. But it also allows for balance by stating \"in order to avoid to the extent possible the long and short term adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands \u2026 wherever there is a practicable alternative \u2026 .\" When the sole purpose of a project is enhancement of wetland functions and values, there is likely no practicable alternative to achieving the project's purpose. The federal policy goes on to encourage enhancing the natural and beneficial values of wetlands. Ironically, the federal policy states that it does not apply to issuance of federal agency permits or allocations to private parties for activities involving wetlands on nonfederal property (see Appendix 6.2), yet it is routinely applied to private parties who propose to enhance wetlands. Lastly, in support of a more balanced approach to apply these orders, neither the Act nor the federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.) has been amended to incorporate a \"no-net-loss\" policy. Enhancement of an existing wetland can often result in some loss of wetland acreage, while restoration of a former wetland or creation of a new wetland generally does not. The Commission's application of the \"no-net-loss\" policy fails to value the benefits of enhancing function or value over a net loss in acreage. It is important to note that function may not be directly related to acreage (Commission 1995). Thus the opportunity to improve an existing, degraded wetland is often discouraged by the Commission's application of the \"no-net-loss\" policy. Therefore, the wisdom of strictly adhering to a narrow interpretation of this policy must be questioned. This is particularly important as current expectations of successfully improving wetland quality by increasing its functions and values may be greater, or realized sooner, when enhancing an existing wetland as opposed to either attempting to restore a historic wetland or creating an entirely new one. In support of enhancement, the Commission's procedures (p. 1-8, Commission 1994) encourages staff to work with what exists, because wetlands are hard to restore and even harder to create, and recommends that compensatory mitigation not be required (p. 9-1, Commission 1995). Determining which diked former tidelands are feasible for restoration to tidal functions would identify those freshwater wetlands that are best suited for enhancement. In most instances completely removing or breaching a dike is not feasible if adjacent lands, roads or infrastructure would become inundated with salt water; therefore, in those situations it is often necessary to relocate the dike or build a new one. Naturally, on those lands where it is not feasible to restore tidal functions, PRC \u00a7 30230 would not apply and enhancing existing freshwater wetlands would be the appropriate option."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Act Regulations that can Constrain Enhancement of Coastal Wetlands", "text": "The PCJV's promotion of coastal wetlandenhancement projects is primarily affected by the application of the following: PRC \u00a7 30106,30519,30121,30230,30231,30233 (a)(c), 30600 (a)(e), and 30607.1.

Nearly all proposed enhancement or restoration projects in the Coastal Zone, with few exceptions, will need to secure a CDP (PRC \u00a7 30600 [a], [e]). A CDP is issued by one of two entities: the Commission who retains jurisdiction on all submerged lands, tidelands, and public trust lands such as diked former tidelands (PRC \u00a7 30519 [b]), or local land-use authorities such as a county or city who have jurisdiction pursuant to their certified Local Coastal Program on all other lands within the Coastal Zone (PRC  \u00a7 30519 [a]). Those nonfederal or nonstate projects residing on lands under local land-use authority will have to apply for a CDP to these authorities, and not the Commission. Local authorities, in addition to issuing a CDP, also control use on all lands except those that are federal or state-owned. Most local landuse authorities have identified land uses that are permitted, i.e., do not need a use permit, uses that must be conditionally approved-usually Proceedings of the 2004 Humboldt Bay Symposium \u2026 239 via a planning commission -while all other uses not identified are prohibited. Typically, habitat enhancement and restoration projects are required to secure a Conditional Use Permit (CUP), but before a permit can be issued, the local land-use authority must first comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (PRC \u00a721000 et seq., and CEQA Guidelines California Code of Regulation [CCR] \u00a715000 et seq.). Unless CEQA has been complied with by some other permitting agency, the local land-use authority becomes the lead agency for compliance. Preparing appropriate environmental documents and processing a use-permit application can often take many months. During the process of securing a CUP and CDP from the lead agency, the CEQA document is circulated among other regulatory agencies for review and comment. Often, in the course of this circulation, the lead agency or project proponent will receive notices that additional permits or consultations are required. For projects located on lands where the Commission has not retained jurisdiction to issue a CDP, the project proponent can expect their permit efforts to increase in complexity, time and cost."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Wetland Definition, PRC \u00a7 30121", "text": "In California's coastal zone, wetlands are broadly defined as lands that may be covered periodically or permanently with shallow water. The Commission relies on consultation with the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) to delineate wetlands, but requires that only one of three criteria used by federal agencies (e.g., hydrology, hydric soils or hydrophytic vegetation) need be present to delineate a wetland (Environmental Services Division 1987, in CCC, 1994. On the coast, diked former tidelands are often inundated during winter and spring months with fresh water from either overland flows or from a high groundwater table that form seasonal wetlands. Livestock grazing can often limit seasonal wetland functions and values by reducing or altering native plant cover and associated species diversity, in favor of exotic species with less habitat value. Enhancing grazed seasonal wetlands often requires some fill and/or grading to increase topographic diversity and the duration of more vegetation, thereby improving a seasonal wetland's functional capacity and values. But excavation and placing fill during restoration or enhancement in a seasonal wetland is considered a development, causing an adverse impact that requires compensatory mitigation. Because of the Commission's broad definition of what constitutes a wetland on diked former tidelands, it is often difficult, if not impossible, to locate an area that is not a seasonal wetland in order to provide compensatory mitigation (i.e., replace the wetland area being filled). Wetland Yet, forgoing the enhancement of a grazed seasonal wetland would appear to be contrary to meeting a major goal of the Act, which is to enhance the overall quality of the coastal zone environment (PRC \u00a7 30001.5)."}, {"section_title": "Marine Resources, PRC \u00a7 30230", "text": "Marine resources, such as submerged areas and tidelands, shall be maintained, enhanced and, where feasible, restored. Consequently, on diked former tidelands the Act prioritizes their restoration over enhancing existing freshwater wetlands. Whether it is feasible to restore a former tideland can be determined by the presence of physical, economic or political impediments to restoring tidal waters to these lands. A commonly encountered constraint to restoring tidewater to former tidelands is an inability to prevent salt water from flooding adjacent agricultural or residential lands, inundating utility easements, public roads or rail corridors. Another policy of the Act, PRC \u00a7 30607.1, supports restoring marine resources such as former tidelands, while PRC \u00a7 30607.1 requires that a condition of approving fill in wetlands, if feasible, be mitigated at a minimum by opening up equivalent areas to tidal action. On former tidelands that are deemed infeasible to restore, then enhancement of seasonal freshwater wetlands would be the means to improve the quality of coastal wetlands. Restoring former tidelands is not a simple activity and merely opening an area to tidal action is no assurance that historic tideland habitats will be restored. Many former tidelands were diked and drained over a century ago. Since then these tidelands have been cut off from tidal ebb-and-flow and may have subsided, so some areas are several feet lower than the submerged lands in adjacent tidal waters. Also during the intervening time, sea levels have risen-lately the increase in peak high-tide elevations has become particularly noticeable. In many situations simply restoring tidal flows to subsided diked former tidelands may create mudflat habitat rather than salt marsh because of the increased saltwater inundation on these lower surfaces. Therefore, the benefit of restoring tidal influences to former tidelands should be balanced against the loss of functions and values if these lands currently support seasonal freshwater wetlands, i.e., the cumulative loss of seasonal freshwater areas used by waterfowl such as Cackling Geese here on the North Coast."}, {"section_title": "Biological Productivity, PRC \u00a7 30231", "text": "PRC \u00a7 30231 of the Act requires that biological productivity (a function of both growth rate and biomass of an organism) and quality of coastal wetlands be maintained and, where feasible, restored. Where dike and fill development in wetlands is permitted, PRC \u00a7 30607.1 requires that the affected areas be mitigated by acquiring other areas of equal or greater biological productivity. Depending on the expected gain in functions or values from enhancing a freshwater wetland versus restoring tidelands, this biological productivity policy may conflict with the apparent mandate to restore marine resources, where feasible, contained in PRC Sections 30230 and 30607.1. Further, this policy's emphasis on improving biological productivity and quality of coastal wetlands supports this paper's position that increasing function and value, i.e., quality, should be allowed even if there is a loss of wetland area as a consequence of enhancement activities."}, {"section_title": "Diking, Filling, or Dredging, PRC \u00a7 30233(a)", "text": "This section regulates the alteration of coastal wetlands from diking, filling, or dredging (excavating), and stipulates several criteria under which these developments are permitted: \u2022 they shall be limited to certain allowable uses such as for \"restoration\" purposes, and \u2022 where there is no feasible less environmentally damaging alternative, and \u2022 where feasible mitigation measures have been provided to minimize adverse environmental effects. Allowable Uses: The Act allows diking, filling, dredging or excavating a wetland when restoration is the main purpose of the project or similar resource-dependent activities such as enhancement. The Act does specifically address enhancement as one of the state's basic goals in the coastal zone (PRC \u00a7 30001.5 [a]), and the Commission has found in previous project approvals that a wetland-enhancement project, where the primary purpose of a project is to improve wetland habitat values, shall be considered for purposes of complying with this section \"restoration,\" which is an allowable use (Commission- Fay Slough 2001). The Commission, in previous projects, found that a project involving fill associated with dikes, which by itself is not an allowable use, was allowable because the project was designed to enhance the diversity of freshwater wetland types and enhance habitat values for water-associated wildlife (Commission- Fay Slough 2001). Similarly, restoring former tidelands around the bay that have been diked may require the relocation of a dike or construction of a new dike, often on a seasonal freshwater wetland, to contain tide waters from inundating adjacent land. While placing fill in a wetland to re-locate or construct a dike is not an allowable use by itself, if restoration of an equivalent area of tidelands is integrated into the project, it may be allowed. However, not all property located on diked former tidelands borders a tidal channel or a dike, and without access to tidewaters it is not feasible to restore marine resources. In such instances enhancement of existing seasonal freshwater wetlands may be the only option available to increase the quality of coastal wetlands. A key assumption in the Commission's approval of a wetland restoration or enhancement project is that it will be successful and provide a net gain in wetland acreage, functions and values and become a self-sustaining environment. The Commission's evaluation of proposed restoration or enhancement projects could require the preparation of a comprehensive environmental assessment describing baseline habitat functions and their desirable values. Restoration versus enhancement projects may have an additional burden of providing an environmental assessment of a reference area to be used to ascertain the success of the restoration activities. Restoration and enhancement projects will also be required to provide a monitoring plan that should describe methods to measure improvements in habitat value and diversity at the site, including species and abundance, over the course of five years following project completion. A monitoring plan or, more appropriately, an adaptive management plan, should include provisions for remediation to ensure that the goals and objectives of the wetland-enhancement project are met."}, {"section_title": "Least Environmentally Damaging Feasible", "text": "Alternative: An alternative analysis is required of all developments, even for restoration and enhancement projects. The proposed project is compared to other feasible alternatives that the applicant provides to determine which is the least environmentally damaging (including the proposed project). This alternative analysis assesses and compares only two impacts: loss of wetland acreage and loss of functional capacity, which means the level and number of species, level of biological productivity, and relative size and number of habitats. The alternative with least overall impact is the least environmentally damaging alternative. Alternatives to the proposed project could be: 1. \"no project\" or relocate project to have no impact to wetlands, and 2. modified project design (size, fill footprint, grading, hydrologic modifications, planting, etc.). As the alternative analysis is applied, there are several difficult hurdles for any enhancement project to overcome. Foremost is that any alternative, including the project that would result in a net loss of wetland acreage, can be denied, because a \"no project\" alternative would maintain existing wetland acreage, i.e., \"no net loss.\" Therefore, if any alternative may cause a net loss of wetland acreage, then proposing compensatory mitigation will be necessary to achieve \"no net loss\" of wetland acreage. In-creasing wetland acreage can only occur on land that is not already a wetland. In the case of diked former tidelands around the bay, almost all of those lands qualify as a seasonal wetland in the winter. To compensate for filling these seasonal wetlands, it may be necessary to go off-site and increase the size of an existing wetland or to create a new one. Given the unique nature of these seasonal wetlands and their proximity to tidal waters, compensatory mitigation may be achieved by opening up an equivalent area to tidal waters as it is being filled. Lastly, using the \"no-net-loss\" policy in this alternative analysis would conflict with the Commission's procedural guidance of not requiring compensatory mitigation, habitat compensation, for projects where the sole purpose of the project is restoration enhancement of a wetland, which is considered a beneficial activity (pp. 8-2, 9-1, Commission 1995). If the proposed project or an alternative passes this first threshold, then the second criterion to evaluate is whether the functional capacity of an existing wetland is maintained or increased. An ecological assessment can assist in evaluating whether the proposed project will maintain or increase functional capacity by describing and quantifying baseline attributes of a specific function, which necessitates an understanding of the relationship between the attributes and the function. When evaluating the functional capacity of alternatives such as enhancing a seasonal freshwater wetland, it is worth noting that just extending the seasonality or duration of inundation does not guarantee that existing functions or values will be increased. While the ephemeral nature of a seasonal wetland may reduce the time period of a function, the performance of that function and its overall value are not necessarily diminished relative to perennial wetlands or wetlands that are wet for longer durations. In fact, many of the same functions and Proceedings of the 2004 Humboldt Bay Symposium \u2026 243 ated with filling, diking or excavating during restoration and enhancement projects include: \u2022 covering (fill) or altering (excavating/ grading) wetland topography; \u2022 removing or damaging wetland vegetation; \u2022 discharging stormwater runoff causing an increase in turbidity or sediment delivery to coastal waters; \u2022 changing hydrological conditions that affect the duration or frequency of inundation resulting in the conversion of a seasonal wetland (or riparian region) to another type, such as open water or salt marsh with different functions or values. Even projects whose main purpose is the beneficial improvement of a wetland via restoration or enhancement will, of necessity, involve one or more changes to existing conditions: topography, hydrology or vegetation. Any change to existing wetland conditions, certainly in the short term, may adversely affect wetland functions or values. The Commission has found that allowing fill of a freshwater wetland from dike rehabilitation and construction as part of a restoration project would require compensatory mitigation to prevent \"no net loss\" of wetland acreage pursuant to their interpretation of Executive Order W-5993 (Commission- Fay Slough 2001). Compensatory mitigation is either achieved by restoration, enhancement or creation and is the most common mitigation proposed by the Commission to replace lost or adversely impacted habitat by development projects (Commission 1994). There are two types of compensatory mitigation: in-kind, which involves the same type of habitat as that impacted by the development activity, or out-ofkind, which involves different types of habitat. Common to all mitigation plans is the need for an environmental assessment of the existing wetland habitat and functions that will values are present in both types of wetlands. Additionally, seasonally wet wetlands can, during certain times of year, provide greater value for certain functions (e.g., ground water recharge, floodwater storage, habitat for endangered species or feeding and resting spots for migratory birds), relative to nearby perennially wet wetlands (Commission 1994). The alternative analysis, as administered, seems to place greater weight on achieving \"no net loss\" of area rather than balancing gains in functional capacity to determine the most beneficial project. The \"no project\" alternative in a degraded wetland should not be an acceptable alternative if enhancement could increase desirable wetland values."}, {"section_title": "Feasible Mitigation Measures:", "text": "The Act, while allowing filling, diking and excavating of wetlands during restoration activities, requires feasible mitigation measures to minimize adverse environmental effects (PRC \u00a7 30230 [a]). Generally, environmental regulations do not treat all mitigation measures equally; there is a hierarchy of mitigation, which in descending order of preference is: avoid, minimize, rectify, reduce and compensate. The Commission's procedural guidance documents emphasize avoidance, where feasible, as opposed to minimization (Commission 1994(Commission , 1995. However, the Commission's administration of the Act has imposed an additional requirement that can affect enhancement projects-that of achieving \"no net loss\" of wetland acreage. The effect of applying this \"no net loss\" standard is requiring habitat compensation even for projects where the main purpose of the project is restoration or enhancement of wetlands, contrary to the Commission's own guidance document (p. 9-1 Commission 1995). In coastal wetlands, adverse impacts to existing wetlands such as seasonal freshwater pastures, i.e., \"farmed wetlands,\" often associ-be adversely impacted by the proposed project. Assessing function is achieved by describing associated biological (which species and their distribution and abundance), chemical (such as water-quality conditions-salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen) and physical (habitat structure) attributes. Assessing values (the importance society places on that characteristic derived from each function) helps to prioritize the importance of the functions. PRC \u00a7 30607.1 utilizes a compensatory mitigation ratio of 1:1 as a minimum for dike, fill or excavation actions permitted in wetlands in conformity with PRC \u00a7 30233, when the proposed mitigation is either acquisition of equivalent areas of equal or greater biological productivity, or opening up equivalent areas to tidal action. The Commission may also require compensatory mitigation ratios greater than 1:1; normally the ratio required is determined on a project-by-project basis to establish the mitigation area. The ratio required is often linked to whether in-kind or out-of-kind mitigation is being proposed. The determination of what is an appropriate ratio will depend on many factors such as: \u2022 habitat function and values of the area to be affected by filling, diking or excavating; \u2022 level of confidence in success of proposed mitigation plan; \u2022 time lag between when impacts to existing habitat are sustained and when habitat values have been fully realized at mitigation sites. Higher mitigation ratios may be required as a balance against the uncertainty of creating wetland habitat, and to offset adverse wetland impacts that result from a lengthy time lag between project impact and implementation of mitigation (Commission 1995). Any mitigation plan must have measurable goals, objectives and appropriate financial commitment for its suc-cessful implementation. A mitigation plan must also have a monitoring program to measure performance, determine compliance (\"as-built\" assessment) and evaluate whether desired habitat functions and values have been achieved. A mitigation-monitoring plan should include an adaptive management clause in case mitigation goals have not been achieved and further remedial measures are required."}, {"section_title": "Functional Capacity, PRC \u00a7 30233(c)", "text": "This section of the Act states that diking, fill or dredging (excavation) in existing wetlands shall maintain or enhance the functional capacity of the wetland. As mentioned earlier, function refers to what a wetland does and the processes it performs. Evaluating a wetland's function is best achieved by describing and quantifying the physical, chemical and biological attributes that are at work in a particular wetland (Commission 1995). The section would appear to preclude changing what an existing wetland does and the processes it performs, as may be the case when enhancing a seasonal wetland or converting one to a brackish-water environment. Applying this section may also conflict with two other sections of the Act pertaining to restoring marine resources (PRC \u00a7 30230) or restoring tidal influences by filling, diking or excavating wetlands (PRC \u00a7 30607.1) when an existing freshwater wetland's function is altered by converting it to tidelands.

This policy's emphasis on an equivalent area would reinforce a minimum compensatory mitigation ratio of 1:1 even if the loss of wetland area is a consequence of wetland-enhancement activities that may increase biological productivity. This section, in conjunction with PRC \u00a7 30230, also constrains enhancement of coastal wetlands by prioritizing restoration of tidal influences and marine resources. One benefit derived from this section is that it allows temporary or short-term filling or diking of a wetland, with requiring mitigation, if restoration is assured in the shortest feasible time. mitigation measures. For instance, describing the functions and values as well as the functional capacity of a seasonal wetland to be impacted, versus the wetland habitats being proposed, will greatly assist in development of the project and later when the Commission evaluates it. Presenting a project to the Commission that has successfully completed a regulatory compliance review will greatly improve and hasten the ability of staff to recommend that the project be approved. 2. There is extensive acreage of diked former tidelands that now support grazing of seasonal freshwater wetlands. The ofteninsurmountable problem encountered when enhancing seasonal wetlands is what to do with the material generated from grading or excavation. One means to overcome the conundrum of compensating for fill placement in a wetland, while implementing an enhancement project, is to focus on projects in areas where there is an opportunity to access tidal waters. The Act has prioritized: restoring former tidelands, a marine resource, wherever feasible (PRC \u00a7 30230), and when mitigating impacts to coastal wetlands by opening an equal area to tidewater inundation (PRC \u00a7 30607.1). Combining the restoration of former tidelands with the enhancement of seasonal freshwater wetlands can increase the number of habitats, their ecological functions and societal values. Many of the century-old dikes are now severely eroded and their failure could threaten existing freshwater wetlands, agricultural uses, buildings, infrastructure, livestock and people, with breaches and perhaps catastrophic flooding. In some situations, the most feasible way to restore diked former tidelands and to enhance freshwater wetlands is to relocate an existing dike. By moving a dike away from the shore, slough or tidelands, the area subject to tidal ebb-and-flow can be expanded. In many cases, building a dike to present-day standards will require increasing the former dike footprint"}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "Sometimes it is necessary to strive for a balance between conflicting policies in order to achieve the laudable goal of improving the quality of coastal wetlands. The following recommendations are offered for consideration to assist in the enhancement and restoration of coastal wetlands. 1. The effort and cost to secure authorization from the Commission for enhancement projects would be reduced if project proponents incorporate a regulatory compliance review in their project development efforts. Knowledge of regulatory constraints presented in this paper that may affect a proposed project should enable the proponent to redesign their project to avoid conflicts, or to develop suitable and will reduce net wetland acreage. However, the loss of freshwater acreage to an increased dike footprint creates an opportunity to restore former tidelands. This strategy for restoring tidelands also creates an opportunity to enhance adjoining seasonal freshwater wetlands; when building a dike there is new upland area, and the relocated dike can be filled with any excavated material generated by enhancing the topographic and aquatic diversity of the wetland behind the dike. These types of projects can successfully integrate three interdependent needs: dike rehabilitation, salt marsh restoration and freshwater wetland enhancement. 3. There are several possible administrative remedies to streamline review and permitting of publicly funded projects where the main purpose of the project is restoration or enhancement of coastal wetlands. Publicly funded resource agency (e.g., CDFG, National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, or Natural Resource Conservation Service) projects have already been developed and reviewed to assure protection of wetland resources. The Commission could utilize the Act's conflict-resolution policy contained in PRC \u00a7 30007.5 to weigh the net benefit derived from a project whose sole purpose is enhancement or restoration, and conclude on balance that these activities are beneficial and therefore \"selfmitigating\" and do not warrant compensatory mitigation measures. If the Commission did not treat these types of projects as a development pursuant to PRC \u00a7 30106, they could be exempted from needing a CDP. Again, if these projects were considered self-mitigating, they could also be exempted from needing a CDP pursuant to PRC \u00a7 30600(e). When assessing alternatives (PRC \u00a7 30233 [a]) to enhancement projects, determining the least environmentally damaging alternative should also achieve the proposed and preferred project's goals and objectives. areas shall be protected against any significant disruption of habitat values, and only uses dependent on those resources shall be allowed within those areas."}, {"section_title": "(a):", "text": "Except for appeals to the commission, as provided in Section 30603, after a local coastal program, or any portion thereof, has been certified and all implementing actions within the area affected have become effective, the development review authority provided for in Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 30600) shall no longer be exercised by the commission over any new development proposed within the area to which the certified local coastal program, or any portion thereof, applies and shall at that time be delegated to the local government that is implementing the local coastal program or any portion thereof.

Within these three divisions, a variety of projects and activities occur to fulfill the Harbor District's mission."}, {"section_title": "Examples of Projects and Activities", "text": "Harbor: The Harbor District oversees channel maintenance, channel improvement, dredging projects, port marketing and shipping facility improvements, oil spill response, navigation safety education and oceanographic research. In April 2000, the Harbor Deepening Project was completed; the harbor entrance was deepened to minus 48 feet (MLLW) and the North Bay and Samoa shipping channels to minus 38 feet (MLLW). This project was needed to improve navigation safety and to accommodate the needs of the current shipping fleet. Part C addressed specific setting conditions that were important for the policy framework laid out in Volume III and were divided into the Harbor District's three focus areas of Harbor, Recreation and Conservation. Much of the information required in the Harbor section was abstracted from the Humboldt Bay Harbor Revitalization Plan and other planning documents. The Recreational summary of Part C identified those uses and opportunities throughout the Humboldt Bay watershed. The content of this section was based on adopted plans and addressed the requirements of local, state and federal laws with respect to recreational opportunities. The discussion in the Conservation section was focused on specific environmental conditions and \"resources\" that were the subject of policy considerations in Volume III. That is, the topics in this section were \"key issues\" for the policy document (Volume III). As in the general discussion, this section was not intended to be encyclopedic in coverage, but to present instead the current understanding of basic and applied scientists, agency staff and informed members of the public regarding ecological processes, and the biological and physical conditions in Humboldt Bay that were needed to carry out informed consideration of the policy framework in Volume III. Volume III-Policy Document consisted of three parts: 1. Part A-Overview; Harbor District Relationships With Other Planning Efforts 2. Part B-Management Plan Policies 3. Part C-Implementation Volume III, Part A established the overall Plan framework. The \"three-bay\" focus provided a unifying thread or theme to help readers grasp the underlying Plan structure and the focus of its efforts to identify a policy focus for the various \"resources\" in Humboldt Bay. The \"three bays\" were defined as: 1 Part B identified a policy focus for the Harbor District's management actions in Humboldt Bay. The Harbor District's responsibilities and implementation tasks in the three primary areas (Harbor, Recreation and Conservation), as identified by the Task Force, were the focus. As requested by the Task Force, each section of the policy document cross-referenced relevant policies in other sections. The Recreational portion of Part B addressed the interrelationships of the Harbor District's jurisdiction with those of other local agencies, including access \"across\" the shoreline. The requirements of various state and federal acts were considered. To the extent possible, long-range plans for recreational improvements were incorporated. The growing attention to the ecological or conservation importance of Humboldt Bayregionally, nationally and internationallyrequired a policy framework that embedded the Bay's management in the larger context. The policy framework in the Conservation section of Part B, nonetheless, addressed the Harbor District's responsibilities and powers, while attending to the statewide and national policy framework that was of interest to many Humboldt Bay stakeholders. Part C included specific implementation actions recommended for action by the Harbor"}, {"section_title": "Proceedings of the 2004 Humboldt Bay Symposium \u2026 259", "text": "District's Board of Commissioners in order to enact and enable the Plan's recommendations. In March 2004, these implementation recommendations were underway.* However, the Task Force discussed the following generalized implementation sequence: 1. Draft Plan reviewed by the Task Force. Policy issues were amended to reflect Task Force views. 2. The Harbor District Board of Commissioners reviewed the Amended Plan. Policy issues were amended to reflect Board views. 3. Harbor District staff prepared an environmental review document pursuant to the CEQA. This document outlined mitigation measures for any potentially significant effects of the Plan's policy proposals. 4. Harbor District Board of Commission ers reviewed final CEQA document and Plan, approved the CEQA document, and adopted the Plan. 5. Harbor District staff carried out the Implementation Program identified in the Plan. Appendix: This was divided into two major components. The first component contained text references of relevant bay management laws, and rules and regulations from the Harbor District, as well as all other relevant agencies. This portion of the Appendix contained a list of all appropriate agency and stakeholder contact information. The second component of the Appendix contained a variety of species guides. These guides were intended for reference and educational purposes and contained relevant pictures and life history information of all invertebrates, fishes, birds and plants that inhabit Humboldt Bay."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The Plan seeks not only to provide information to resource managers on the current state of Humboldt Bay's biological and physical resources, but also to provide a guideline for future resource management strategies that will ensure compatibility with Humboldt County's search for economic stability. When the various management strategies for the Plan are implemented,* the results monitored, and additional scientific information gathered, this Plan will evolve and, like Humboldt Bay, will be a living and changing entity.   Each panel member gave comments on the symposium presentations and identified those data gaps that were important to address from their perspective. David Hull, Executive Director of the Humboldt Bay Harbor Recreation and Conservation District, noted current high interest in the Bay. He thought there had been a gap in community interest in the Bay from about 1980 to 1996. Data gaps important to the Harbor District are being addressed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)/Humboldt Bay Shoreline Monitoring Project, but it will be a few years before sufficient data are collected for analysis. NOAA and the Center for Integrated Coastal and Ocean Research and Education at Humboldt State University (HSU) will add directional capabilities to buoy data that are important for navigational safety. Hull said it is important for contemporary studies to use methodology comparable to historic studies whenever possible. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data are now in a usable format and provide topographical bathymetric data for Humboldt Bay. He noted other useful studies currently in process such as the Humboldt Bay Cooperative Eelgrass Project that conducts eelgrass surveys twice a year. Hull would like to see statewide requirements for shipboard treatment of ballast water exchange to reduce invasive species introductions. Troy Nicolini of the Humboldt Fisherman's Association (and National Weather Service hydrologist) fishes part-time for anchovy, herring and sardine in Humboldt Bay. He recommended fisheries biologists work with local fishermen to develop methodology for targeted fish studies. This is especially useful as fishermen can provide knowledge on timing of species occurrence. Greg Dale thought the Indian Island restoration project deserves support and it would be useful to compile or archive resources such as Don Tuttle's photographs. He would like to see bathymetric LIDAR data used to develop an electronic chart. Dale also noted the lapse in Humboldt Bay studies and suggested strong support for HSU research and generally using more local expertise. The symposium was important, but action is needed on information presented and integration of bay and watershed studies and activities. Lesley Ewing said the California Coastal Commission (CCC) will apply scientific information on Humboldt Bay to their day-to-day permitting of development and restoration projects. The kinds of questions they ask about projects are: Is something being done to the bay going to be safe? Are there any geological hazards such as erosion or landslides? Regarding shoreline armoring, would natural levees or beaches be useful instead? Are there ways to maintain the shoreline and avoid nonindigenous species invasions? Is sediment and beach nourishment a way to get a more natural bay shoreline? Is dredging being conducted by the USACE enhancing or degrading the bay? We need a bay sediment budget. What is sea-level rise doing to the tidal elevations, subsidence and accretion around the bay? What are the natural dynamics of Humboldt Bay evolution? The more information Ewing has, the easier her work will be. Steve Costa said there is a dearth of studies on Humboldt Bay. Regarding physical processes, Nick Krause's model could be used to predict the time and speed of currents. This should be integrated with a water quality transport model. For example, if something gets dumped in the bay, what happens? The advantage of models is their ability to answer the \"what if \" questions. There is a general lack of water-quality and sediment monitoring. Jeff Borgeld's research is great for the sediments that are present now, but we also need to examine toxics that may be in the sediments. Costa also stated the need for a sediment budget to include ocean and watershed sources. Adele Militello pointed out that the lack of directional wave data for shoreline erosion and accretion models is a huge data gap. Directional data are needed to make effective current models for different seasons, tides and wind direction. Important questions to answer are: How is the shoreline changing? What change in sediment size is occurring? If a new model that included sediment transport were developed, we could calculate bed elevation changes and how components of the system are related. All of this could be applied to dredging practices and management. Nick Krause recommended a siren for tsunami warnings, as the area is vulnerable to this natural hazard. He endorsed the idea of a directional wave buoy and said in Grays Harbor, Washington, their directional wave buoy costs $45,000 annually to maintain. It would take about $25,000 to upgrade the existing buoy, and he encouraged the CCC and USACE to collaborate and get a directional wave buoy. Krause stressed the importance of regional sediment management. He considered dredge spoils a resource and asked how can we get projects to talk with each other? Beaches are eroding around Humboldt Bay yet we are removing sediment from the bay. Beneficial uses of dredge spoils elsewhere include shoreline restoration of beaches, seagrass habitat creation and shoreline protection. Mounds of dredge spoils can protect nearby levees, form bird islands, or provide a substrate for saltmarsh plants. The new data on currents in Humboldt Bay will be on their Web site. He will request NOAA make new bathymetric projections for an updated chart of Humboldt Bay. He pointed out that the USACE LIDAR data could be used, for example, to determine where to plant eelgrass but could not be used for navigation. Vicki Frey noted gaps in shoreline monitoring in the bay to prevent erosion without armoring, as erosion occurs at the ends of most armored sections of shoreline. Coordination of LIDAR data between HSU, USACE and the Harbor District for circulation and transport of sediment at the Humboldt Open Ocean Disposal Site (HOODS) site is important. As more dredge spoils are taken to HOODS, what is the site's expected life span? If the harbor is increasingly deepened, what effects and impacts will be seen around the bay? Biological monitoring of the edge of the shipping channel is needed. How are salmonid populations existing in the bay? Do they leave via the eelgrass beds or main channels? How does oyster filtration affect eelgrass? What is the role of oysters on bay ecology? Tim McKay asked how far do fish go that started out in Humboldt Bay tributaries? He"}]
