[{"section_title": "Sydney Levitus -one of NOAA's most respected and well-known scientists \"NOAA Researcher Leaves Ocean Warmer than He Found it 39 Years Ago\u2026\"", "text": "Syd joined the U.S. NODC in 1989 where he has been a pioneer of ocean climate science and ocean warming studies. He has made significant contributions to the scientific and ocean data management communities. Before joining NODC he worked at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). While at GFDL Syd published \"Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean\" in 1982 which was based on the ocean data archived at the NODC/WDC. This work has been cited more than 2800 times in the refereed scientific literature indicating its impact and utility to the scientific community. He has also increased public understanding of the role of the oceans in climate. Syd was one of the first to recognize the importance and benefits of developing quality-controlled historical oceanographic databases with all data in a common digital format and gridded, objectively analyzed climatological fields of measured ocean variables including temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients, and fields derived from the data in these databases. These research-quality databases and products based on them have enabled systematic studies of ocean variability that were not previously possible. All of these products have been made available internationally without restriction, a characteristic of Syd's work throughout his career. The \"World Ocean Atlas\" series are used so frequently that they have become known generically as the \"Levitus Climatology\". He formed the NODC Ocean Climate Laboratory (OCL) and became director of the ICSU World Data Center for Oceanography (WDC), Silver Spring. In 1993 the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission asked Syd to lead the newly initiated \"Global Oceanographic Data Archaeology and Rescue\" (GODAR)project to locate and \"rescue\" historical ocean profile data that were at risk of being lost due to media decay. With his OCL colleagues, and unprecedented cooperation from the international ocean scientific and data management communities, this project resulted in a significant increase (millions of profiles) in the number of Station Data, XBT, MBT, and CTD casts for the pre-1991 period . Syd has been the senior author or co-author of many peer reviewed scientific publications and book chapters, senior author of several NOAA professional papers and atlases, and editor of the \"World Ocean Database\" and \"World Ocean  Word size indicates the number of articles in whose titles the word appears and word color indicates groups of words that often appear in the same titles.
