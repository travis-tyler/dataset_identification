Brain damage can occur due to a variety of causes with the most common being Alzheimer's disease (AD), although many Alzheimer's patients also have damage resulting from vascular disease. Dementia is a major global health problem, affecting ~4\u00b75% of people aged 60 and older in 2016 with over 43 million affected globally 1 . It exacts tremendous costs, both in terms of disability for those affected and in pure economic terms. The predicted cost of dementia is greater than $290 billion yearly in the United States alone 4 , and the disease is responsible for 30 million disability adjusted life years 5 . In the absence of a cure and with improved technology, there is increased focus on risk reduction, timely diagnosis, and early intervention. Early identification of at-risk individuals may enable patients and their families to better prepare for and reduce the impact of this condition.\nThe traditional approach evaluates an individual in the presence of symptoms. However, it has been established that amyloid deposits begin to accumulate years before symptoms begin to appear 2,3 . Furthermore, lifestyle is key in influencing an individual's risk 6 , and early risk identification provides greater opportunity for intervention and risk mitigation 7 . To accomplish the early identification of at-risk individuals, prediction must rely on evidence prior to the onset of symptoms. In certain diseases, such as coronary artery disease, there are clear biomarkers and calculated scores that aid physicians in predicting which patients are at high-risk. Although significant research effort has focused on the development of better models for predicting onset of dementia, particularly in the progression of individuals from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD 8-10 , a predictive score, used clinically, that assess and individual's risk is yet to be developed. Biomarkers that may be used include genotype, in particular APOE status, and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

However, late onset dementia is a complex disorder influenced by environmental and genetic factors, with APOE variants accounting for the majority, but not all, of phenotypic variance 13 . To this end, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have facilitated the identification of additional genetic variants associated with AD, although most have a limited effect [13] [14] [15] and novel associations continue to be uncovered 16 . Some researchers have combined the effects of known variants into a polygenic hazard score.

One such algorithm demonstrated the utility of using the information from a single PET scan in the prediction of disease progression for MCI individuals within 2 years 24 .\nTesting for A\u00df or tau, either via lumbar puncture or PET imaging is invasive (because of the need for an intravenous injection of radioactive dye), although work is progressing toward a less invasive blood test for tau 25 .

A common challenge in building such models is that a fraction of the data is often censored, that is, the subject leaves the study before the occurrence of the event of interest.\nThe Cox proportional hazards (CPH) model is a standard statistical model for investigating the association between survival time and predictor variables and aims to compute a hazard function for each individual, which describes how the risk of the event evolves with time. The proportional hazards model assumes that the hazard function consists of two parts: a baseline hazard function, which is common to the whole population, and a multiplicative factor, which is unique for each individual.\nWhere \u210e( , ) is the hazard function for people at risk with predictors , \u210e ) ( ) is the baseline hazard function for the population of people with =0, ( , ) is the individual survival function, i.e., the probability a person's event occurs after each time t, and ) ( ) is the baseline survival function ( =0).
