Recently, the measure of brain amyloid burden by PET has fueled the design of prevention trials in AD, enabling the screening of amyloid positivity in healthy controls (HC) and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 2 To date, about 42.9% and 66.7% of ongoing and starting clinical trials (phase II/phase III and phase III) enrolling HC or subjects This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made.\nwith MCI, respectively, adopt amyloid-PET for screening (data retrieved from www.clinicaltrials.gov on 17 April 2018).

The inclusion of biomarkers of neurodegeneration could represent a valuable strategy to enhance enrollment accuracy by excluding subjects with a high likelihood of remaining cognitively stable notwithstanding a significant amyloid burden. 3 [18F]FDG-PET measure of brain glucose metabolism is considered a sensitive marker of ongoing neurodegeneration/synaptic dysfunction, also preceding atrophy, with high accuracy in the early detection and staging of AD, 8, 9 especially when coupled with optimized analytical methods. 10 The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether [18F]FDG-PET brain hypometabolism, as an early marker of neurodegeneration, and in the context of established amyloid positivity, would support the identification of subjects either clinically stable or on a trajectory to dementia, with a subsequent impact on screening accuracy for clinical trials.\nWe compared two different biomarker screening strategies including (1) only amyloid-PET status (Standard Strategy) or (2) amyloid-PET positivity plus [18F]FDG-PET brain hypometabolism status (Enriched Strategy) for the identifications of HC and subjects with MCI who could better benefit from putative treatments."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data source", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

[1.57-4 .79] and 3.55 [2.15-5 .85], P = 0.0004 and P < 0.0001, respectively) (see Table 1 and Fig. 1A ). Very few amyloid-negative cases progressed clinically, leading to a highly accurate negative prediction for amyloid-PET (negative predictive values -NPV were 0.876 and 0.904, respectively for HC and subjects with MCI).\nStill, more than half of the Amy+ subjects (66% HC, 60% subjects with MCI) did not progress during followup (average months 44.79 AE 20.5 for HC and 39.0 AE 22.7 for subjects with MCI).\nConsidering other predictors, Cox regression models showed an additional significant effect of age at amyloid-PET scan time in the HC group (multivariate HR: 1.08 [1.03-1.14], P = 0.001), and of APOE status (multivariate HR: 1.66 [1.13-2.46], P = 0.01) and MMSE score (multivariate HR: 0.81 [0.75-0.89], P = <0.001) in the MCI group. The final multivariate Cox models included age and amyloid-PET status for the HC group and amyloid-PET status, MMSE score and APOE e4 status for the MCI group (log-rank tests P = 3e-06 and P < 2e-16, respectively). The significant predictors in univariate analysis are available in Table S2 . Amy+ subjects without evidence of neurodegeneration at [18F]FDG-PET (FDG\u00c0) were very likely to remain stable (NPV 0.829 and 0.805 for HC and MCI, respectively) (see Table 1 and Fig. 1B) . Conversely, Amy+/ FDG+ subjects were more likely to progress clinically during follow-up (multivariate HRs: 3.29 [1.36-7.96] and 5.04 [3.13-8.12] for HC and subjects with MCI, respectively) and at faster rates with respect to Amy+/ FDG-subjects, independent of follow-up length (see below and Table S3 ). As for MCI, the presence of an AD-like versus non AD-like [18F]FDG-PET pattern was not significantly modulating the likelihood of clinical progression (P = 0.5), whereas HC subjects with ADlike hypometabolic patterns were more likely to progress during follow-up compared to HC subjects with patterns suggestive of non-AD conditions (HR 3.48, [1.087-11.19], P = 0.04). Considering a standard length for clinical trials (i.e., 24 months), about 18% of the Amy+ MCI subjects progressed to dementia during follow-up. Of note, when adding the [18F]FDG-PET status, the observed rate of progression was higher in neurodegeneration-positive subjects, with about 30% of the Amy+/FDG+ MCI subjects progressing, as opposed to only 5% of the Amy+/FDG\u00c0 MCI subjects. Similarly, 8% of the Amy+ HC subjects progressed to MCI within 24 months. The rate of progression increased in the neurodegeneration-positive subjects, with about 16% of the Amy+/FDG+ HC progressing to MCI within 24 months, as opposed to about 2% of the Amy+/ FDG\u00c0 subjects (see Table S3 ). For paradigmatic examples of [18F]FDG-PET SPM-t maps, see Figure 2 .\nCox models showed an additional significant effect in terms of progression probability for the age at amyloid-PET scan in the HC group (multivariate HR: 1.14 [1.04- Table S2 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Previous studies have evaluated biomarker enrichment strategies, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] with the aim to provide an ideal biomarker screening paradigm and targeted enrollment of atrisk subjects for clinical trials. Amyloid-PET evidence for significant brain amyloid plaque deposition 1 improves screening accuracy for clinical trials targeting amyloid pathology [13] [14] [15] and is now commonly adopted. Topographical functional or structural measures of ongoing neurodegeneration are included in AD research diagnostic criteria 8 and could help in the screening of subjects at risk for more rapid cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. 22 In this direction, it has been suggested that the inclusion of hippocampal volume, together with amyloid positivity, could support the identification of subjects more rapidly progressing, with cost reductions and improved statistical power for clinical trials. 15 Another autopsy-based retrospective study modeling the implications for clinical trials on knowing the Braak stage of neurofibrillary tau tangle pathology showed considerable improvement in the statistical power and consistent reduction in the required sample size. 17 Here, we built on and extended the evidence of the role of in vivo biomarkers of neurodegeneration, such as brain hypometabolism, by considering adding [18F]FDG-PET as an enrichment strategy for subject screening in clinical trials. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether clinical stability (or progression) could be predicted by an advanced marker of neurodegeneration such as brain hypometabolism with [18F]FDG-PET, in cases belonging to the Alzheimer's disease continuum (i.e., amyloid-positive). 9 Our results support the high predictive value of a [18F]FDG-PET negative scan, in the identification of clinically stable, though amyloid-positive, subjects. The [18F]FDG-PET negative pattern, as evaluated with semiquantitative voxel-wise procedures at single-subject level, was indeed associated with more than 80% chance of remaining clinically stable during followup for both HC and subjects with MCI even with amyloid positivity. The adopted [18F]FDG-PET method 10 additionally allowed to identify brain hypometabolism patterns suggestive of AD and also non-AD neurodegenerative conditions, mostly within the FrontoTemporal Lobar Degeneration spectrum. It is likely that these patterns would be associated with different clinical dementia syndromes at follow-up, as we have previously shown in MCI. 23 Adding the [18F]FDG-PET status, the observed rate of progression was higher in neurodegeneration-positive MCI subjects, with about 30% of the Amy+/FDG+ MCI subjects progressing to dementia within 24 months of follow-up. There was also some evidence for a more rapid clinical progression in amyloid-positive HC subjects showing an AD-like hypometabolic pattern compared to those with non-AD patterns, which we believe needs further replication in larger cohorts. Overall, our results show that the presence of ongoing downstream neurodegeneration both in HC and MCI subjects predicts a worse prognostic outcome regardless of the upstream primary pathology.\nWe suggest that the inclusion of biomarkers of neurodegeneration can reduce the number of recruited subjects who are not on a trajectory to dementia, also avoiding exposure to possible side effects of the tested treatment.
