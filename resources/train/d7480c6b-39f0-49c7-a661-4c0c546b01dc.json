Prospective studies show WMH predict increased risks of cognitive decline, stroke and death. 3 One might expect risk factors for WMH in community populations to also confer increased risk of WMH in stroke patients. However, the underlying pathology of WMH is heterogeneous; small punctate lesions are associated with mixed etiologies, while more confluent areas correspond primarily to small vessel disease (SVD). 4 In stroke patients, WMH are more frequent and extensive compared with healthy age-matched individuals and are usually associated with SVD. 4 We hypothesized that risk factors for WMH in community populations without stroke also confer increased risk of WMH in stroke patients. Therefore, we assessed whether the 17q25 locus is associated with WMH as a quantitative trait in ischemic stroke. If the 17q25 locus acted to increase WMH through promotion of the small vessel arteriopathy, one might expect it to also increase risk of lacunar stroke, another SVD phenotype. To test this hypothesis, its association with lacunar stroke status was also examined in a cases-control analysis."}, {"section_title": "METHODS & MATERIALS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A.

The most significant SNP here was rs9894383 and meta-analysis with two previous reports 1,2 revealed a combined p-value of 1.0x10 -11 . Most SNPs within the 17q25 region were highly correlated and conditional analysis did not reveal more than one independent signal.\nIn contrast the 17q25 locus was not associated with another manifestation of SVD, lacunar stroke. This may suggest that any causal variant linked to this locus does not act by directly promoting small vessel arteriopathy or the type of arteriopathy primarily underlying lacunar infarction. The study was powered to detect an association with an odds ratio between 1.1-1.15.\nImportantly, however, controls did not have brain imaging to exclude silent brain infarction, which is found in some 20% of healthy elderly 15 and this could have limited study power.\nWe performed a meta-analysis with the top SNPs reported by CHARGE; however, no novel loci reached genome-wide significance. To determine whether there were additional genetic variants shared by WMH occurring in community-participants without stroke and ischemic stroke, we calculated GRS excluding the 17q25 locus. This was a significant predictor of WMHV consistent with additional shared genetic variants. !\nThere are several genes in the 17q25 region; however, cis-expression quantitative trait loci, primarily of HapMap lymphoblastoid cells, implicate TRIM47. TRIM47 could modulate brain responses to ischemic injury as its RING domain confers protein ubiquitination, which promotes proteolysis and cellular homestasis. 16 Imbalance in ubiquitin-proteasome pathways is integral to cerebral ischemic injury mechanisms 17 and also evident in WMH expression profiles."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "This study used volumetric MRI techniques, which have been demonstrated to be reliable and accurate [7] [8] [9] with good agreement across reading centers. A limitation is the variability in MRimaging protocols, resulting from the use of clinical imaging in these GWAS databases.\nHowever, studies applying volumetric techniques have shown high reproducibility across acquisition protocols 8 and scanner models. 19 To minimize effects of MRI heterogeneity, centers were analyzed separately and WMHV z-scores were derived prior to association testing. We measured whole brain rather than regional WMHV and therefore could not investigate genetic differences between periventricular and subcortical WMH, which are suggested to have differing pathological, risk factor and functional associations. 4 Another limitation is that genotyping was performed on multiple platforms. However, top SNPs were imputed to a high quality with consistent allele frequencies.\nIn conclusion, our data provide further support for an association between the 17q25 locus and WMHV in patients with ischemic stroke. Future studies are warranted to explore these genetic associations in order to understand biological underpinnings of this complex cerebrovascular phenotype. The lack of association with lacunar stroke may suggest that the 17q25 locus does not act via promoting small vessel arteriopathy.

For the German samples controls were Caucasians of German origin participating into the population KORAgen study (http://epi.gsf.de/kora-gen/index_e.php). This survey represents a gender-and age stratified random sample of all German residents of the Augsburg area and consists of individuals 25 to 74 years of age, with about 300 subjects for each 10-year increment. All controls were free of a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack."}, {"section_title": "GENOTYPING, IMPUTATION & QUALITY CONTROL IN METASTROKE COHORTS The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC)", "text": "Genotyping was performed with the GeneChip SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix). Subject specific quality control filters included filters for call rate, heterozygosity, sex mismatch. SNP specific quality control filters included filters for call rate, minor allele frequency (MAF), HardyWeinberg equilibrium (HWE), and differential missingness by outcome or genotype. The set of genotyped input SNPs used for imputation was selected based on high quality GWA data. We used a call-rate >95%, HWE p-value>5x10 -6 ; MAF>0.01. A total of 704,588 SNPs passing quality control (QC) criteria were used for imputation, which was performed with the MaCH (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/yli/mach/index.html) v1.0.16 software."}, {"section_title": "deCODE Genetics", "text": "The Icelandic chip-genotyped samples were assayed with the Illumina Human Hap300, Hap CNV370, Hap 610, 1M or Omni-1 Quad bead chips at deCODE genetics.

All samples with a call rate below 97% were excluded from the analysis. Imputation was performed using IMPUTE (https://mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute/impute.html).\nThe Genetics of Early Onset Stroke (GEOS) Study, Baltimore, USA Samples were genotyped at the Johns Hopkins Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), and using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad_v1-0_B BeadChip. Case and control samples were balanced across the plates. Allele cluster definitions for each SNP were determined using Illumina BeadStudio Genotyping Module version 3.3.7, Gentrain version 1.0 and the combined intensity data from all released samples. Genotypes were not called if the quality threshold (GenCall score) was below 0.15.\nAll samples had a genotype call rate > 98%. Genotyping concordance rate was 99.996% based on study duplicates. Samples were excluded due to unexpected duplicates, gender discrepancy, unexpected relatedness or evidence of non-European ancestry based on principal components analysis. Individual SNPs were excluded from analysis if they had excessive deviation from HWE in controls p< 1.0x10 -6 , genotype call rates <97.5% or MAF < 0.01."}, {"section_title": "The Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study (ISGS)/ Siblings With Ischemic Stroke Study (SWISS)", "text": "SWISS and ISGS cases were genotyped using Illumina 650K Quad arrays at the Department of Molecular Neuroscience and Reta Lilla Weston Laboratories, Institute of Neurology, University College London.
