However we cannot obtain the performance by using the sub-band pulse of multi-carrier 10-template.\nTo improve the interference detection ratio, number of correlating times for each band are increased and the sensing As the other solution to get better detection performance, Figure 8 . Interference band detection performance by BPFs we propose that more sub-band pulses are used to detect one 0 MB-OFDM band over various frequencies. Consequently, the 10 bandwidth of sub-band pulses and interval of sub-carrier center frequency become narrow down like in Figure 9 . When the three or five sub-band pulses are used, they indicate Figure 9 . Interference band detection performance better performance to add up their correlation values than by using narrower sub-band pulses estimated by using maximum correction value.
