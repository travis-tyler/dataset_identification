[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Motion artifacts are a well-known and frequent limitation during neuroimaging workup of cognitive decline. While head motion typically deteriorates image quality, we test the hypothesis that head motion differs systematically between healthy controls (HC), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) and consequently might contain diagnostic information. This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee and includes 28 HC (age 71.0 \u00b1 6.9 years, 18 females), 15 aMCI (age 67.7 \u00b1 10.9 years, 9 females) and 20 AD (age 73.4 \u00b1 6.8 years, 10 females). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3T included a 9 min echo-planar imaging sequence with 180 repetitions. Cumulative average head rotation and translation was estimated based on standard fMRI preprocessing and compared between groups using receiver operating characteristic statistics. Global cumulative head rotation discriminated aMCI from controls [p \\ 0.01, area under curve (AUC) 0.74] and AD from controls (p \\ 0.01, AUC 0.73). The ratio of rotation z versus y discriminated AD from controls (p \\ 0.05, AUC 0.71) and AD from aMCI (p \\ 0.05, AUC of 0.75). Head motion systematically differs between aMCI/AD and controls. Since motion is not random but convoluted with diagnosis, the higher amount of motion in aMCI and AD as compared to controls might be a potential confounding factor for fMRI group comparisons. Additionally, head motion not only deteriorates image quality, yet also contains useful discriminatory information and is available for free as a ''side product'' of fMRI data preprocessing."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Head motion related artifacts are a well-known and frequent problem in the neuroimaging workup of cognitive decline deteriorating image quality (Ikari et al. 2012; Sperling 2011) . We assessed whether head motion systematically differs between amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) patients as compared to healthy controls (HC). A potential systematic difference in head motion between groups would in turn imply that head motion does not only deteriorate image quality, but may actually contain useful discriminatory information.\nThe early detection of Alzheimer disease (AD) and in particular amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a key clinical question, as promising therapeutic candidates are currently being evaluated (for review see (Nitsch and Hock 2008; Duara et al. 2009)) . Recent studies indicate a limited performance of these therapeutic candidates in patients with clinically overt dementia (Holmes et al. 2008; Lannfelt et al. 2008 ). This implies a need for early treatment, which in turn implies a need for early diagnosis. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transition zone between normal aging and very early dementia and is characterized by selective memory deficits associated or not with other cognitive dysfunctions (Petersen and Negash 2008) . The definitions of MCI have substantially evolved and changed over the last years, which goes beyond the scope of this manuscript. We specifically focus on amnestic MCI (aMCI), which is the most likely MCI subgroup to eventually progress to clinically overt AD with an annual rate of 10-15 % (Petersen 2004; Mariani et al. 2007) , whereas other MCI subgroups may remain stable or evolve to other forms of dementia (Forlenza et al. 2009 ).\nMultiple recent investigations assessed the performance of various neuroimaging techniques for the early detection of AD and MCI, including T1 derived grey matter voxel based morphometry (Plant et al. 2010; Misra et al. 2009; Fan et al. 2008) , diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) derived white matter properties (Haller et al. 2010b (Haller et al. , 2013 O'Dwyer et al. 2012) , susceptibility derived iron deposition (Haller et al. 2010a ) and in particular functional MRI (Mueller et al. 2011; Fox and Greicius 2010; Sperling 2011) .\nHead motion parameters are routinely estimated during the data preprocessing steps of fMRI. These parameters are typically used as non-explanatory co-variables for the data analysis, yet are not specifically analyzed as discriminatory parameters. In the current investigation, we tested the hypothesis that aMCI and AD have increased head motion parameters compared to HC. This analysis makes use of already existing and thus freely available motion correction parameters of fMRI data and might complement the results of the ''actual'' fMRI analyses."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The institutional ethical committee of the University of Basel, Switzerland, approved this prospective study and all participants gave written informed consent prior to inclusion.

In agreement with our hypothesis, global head motion was more pronounced in patients and discriminated aMCI and AD from controls. Consequently, head motion not only deteriorates image quality, yet also contains useful discriminatory information. Head motion parameters are routinely estimated during the data processing of fMRI studies (Fox and Greicius 2010) , available for free as a ''side product'' and might complement existing tests to discriminated AD and aMCI from controls. The simple global accumulated head rotation significantly (p \\ 0.01) discriminated aMCI versus HC with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74 as well as AD versus controls (p \\ 0.01, AUC 0.73).\nThe major point of this paper is to demonstrate that head motion not only deteriorates image quality in a random fashion, but rather is convoluted in a systematic fashion with clinical diagnosis. The main strength of the current investigation is the use of the ''freely available'' motion parameter in fMRI to discriminate aMCI and AD from controls. The simple parameter of accumulated global head rotation discriminated aMCI and AD from controls.\nAlthough these motion parameters are routinely estimated during data processing of fMRI data, these parameters are typically not specifically analyzed. Given this systematic effect, adding motion parameters as an additional covariate in the analysis of fMRI data may be prudent.\nOur observation of increased head motion in aMCI and AD in fMRI is in agreement with previous experience in the field of fMRI (Sperling 2011) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, for example in the Japanese Alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative (J-ADNI) multicenter study (Ikari et al. 2012 ). Interestingly, a recent investigation demonstrated that head motion produces substantial resting-state fMRI changes despite compensatory spatial registration and regression of motion estimates (Power et al. 2012) . In particular, long-distance correlations are decreased while short-distance correlations are increased by head motion. As we observed systematic difference in the amplitude of head motion between the study groups, this implies that group differences in head motion might actually represent a systematic confound for rs-fMRI connectivity studies between controls, MCI and AD subjects.\nDue to the spatial constraints of the MRI table and the head coil, some head motions are easier than others. In particular, rotatory movements to the left and right (yaw, like saying ''no'') and rotation up and down (pitch, like saying ''yes'') are relatively easy, while left-right tilting movements (roll, inclining the head sideways) or longitudinal translation movements are more restricted. In agreement with these spatial constraints, rotation movements were more pronounced than linear translation movements in our data. As discussed above, the discrimination between aMCI versus controls is the clinically most relevant parameter. Concerning the discrimination of AD versus controls, the clinical diagnosis is oftentimes already established in this advanced stage of the disease. The discrimination between aMCI and AD was less evident in the current data as both groups show considerable head motion. In our sample, AD patients performed in particular strong motion along the Z axis, i.e. right-left rotation of the head or ''no'' movements. To relatively normalize this ''no'' motion per subject, we calculated the ratio between Z rotation versus Y rotation (roll or tilting the head sideways). This parameter discriminated AD patients from controls (p \\ 0.05) as well as from aMCI (p \\ 0.05)."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Major limitations of the current investigations include the relatively small sample sizes per group, which is due to the strict pre-selection of patients in a single-center study. Our results should thus be confirmed in larger scale studies. Moreover, the current investigation deliberately assessed basic and simple global head movement. The exact origin of the head motions are not assessed in detail in the current investigation and may include decreased compliance, increased anxiety, loss of fine motor coordination and other factors. Future studies might determine whether more detailed motion derived parameters such as speed of acceleration/deceleration or frequency of oscillations may also discriminate between different diseases, for example other forms of dementia such as frontotemoral lobar degeneration or other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson Disease taking into account that head motion might be influenced by multiple factors including for example medication."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The higher amount of motion in aMCI and AD as compared to controls might be a potential confounding factor in fMRI group comparisons.
