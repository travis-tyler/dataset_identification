Instrumenting location with visa status that requires return to home countries, we find a large negative relationship between non-U.S. location and research output for countries with low income per capita but none for countries with high income per capita.

Introduction", "text": "T HE United States produces more doctorates in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) 1 than any other country, is home to a disproportionate share of top scientists (NSF, 2010; Zucker & Darby, 2007) , and has many of the most highly rated universities in the world. 2 However, the share of STEM doctoral degrees produced outside the United States has grown in recent years (NSF, 2010) , and some countries have increased efforts to attract star scientists. 3 In light of the increasing globalization of science, as well as recent declines in public funding for R&D in the United States, many observers have questioned whether U.S. dominance in science and engineering can be expected to continue (Wadhwa et al., 2007 ; MIT Committee to Evaluate the Innovation Deficit, 2014). The answer is likely to hinge on whether the U.S. research environment offers inherent advantages to scientists whose productivity would fall if they located elsewhere, or instead whether the United States has merely succeeded in attracting a large number of exceptional scientists who would be productive in any location. Geographic proximity to a high concentration of top scientists that creates large knowledge spillovers, top journals and scientific conferences headquartered in the United States, extensive financial resources devoted to R&D, and a U.S. culture of academic competitiveness may all contribute to a special advantage in science for the United States. These advantages may no longer be determinative, however, because of advances in communication technology and increased investment of other countries in science. As a result, other countries may be able to woo scientists to relocate and the United States could lose its edge in science and engineering research and potentially other types of innovation (Furman, Porter, & Stern, 2002) . This paper directly addresses the question of whether U.S.-based scientists are more productive than those located elsewhere. Specifically, we compare U.S.-educated, foreign-born scientists who stayed in the United States postPh.D. to those who went abroad post-Ph.D., in terms of their research output (measured by the number and prestige of publications, first and last authorship), and diffusion and impacts on science (measured by the number of citations to their articles-forward citations).\nA first look at the research records of a sample of 498 foreign-born scientists who received Ph.D.s from U.S. universities between 1991 and 2005 (table 1) clearly indicates that compared to those located outside the United States, the U.S.-located scientists produce more publications, and more publications in high-impact journals, each year, with the difference starkest between the United States and lower-income countries but still large for higher-income ones. Later tables also show that these U.S.-located scientists' articles also receive significantly more citations.\nHowever, comparisons of scientists inside the United States with those outside are plagued by unobserved heterogeneity among scientists and endogeneity of location choices. For instance, better scientists may be more likely to receive U.S. job offers, desire to remain within the U.S. research community, or face a wide wage differential between locating in the United States versus abroad. Therefore, a na\u0131ve comparison of the publications of scientists in different locations would not isolate the impact of location on productivity as distinct from unobserved individual productivity and preferences.\nIn this paper, we address this problem by constructing a new data set carefully crafted to isolate the impact of U.S. location by exploiting exogenous variation in post-Ph.D. location induced by visa status. The research productivity of 249 foreign-born Ph.D. recipients who came to the United States through the Foreign Fulbright Fellowship program and legally must leave the United States on the completion of their studies is compared to that of a control sample of 249 foreign-born Ph.D. recipients who received their Ph.D.s in the same university, field, time period (and, if possible, the same advisor) but had no visa requirements to leave the United States. Our data are unique in being the only data set of which we are aware (at the time of writing) that tracks the career progression of individual U.S.-trained Ph.D. scientists, whether they leave the United States or not. 4 Although we constructed our Fulbright and control samples to be very similar in ability and background, there may remain differences in inherent research potential between the two groups. Therefore, we also control for additional background factors, including the income per capita of the country of origin and the pre-Ph.D. publication record. In addition, we show that the distribution of characteristics of individuals in our sample is comparable to the distribution of characteristics in the population of U.S. STEM Ph.D.s of foreign origin; we investigate whether our results change under different hypotheses about bias; we explore alternative matching methods; and we perform a battery of robustness tests (all described in section IV).\nTo summarize our results, we find that, on average, being outside the United States leads to fewer total, last-authored, and high-impact publications and to fewer citations to highimpact publications. Further, we find that the negative impact of being outside the United States is present and large for those in countries with low levels of GDP per capita but is eliminated for rich countries.\nThese findings have implications about the global dispersion of research during the coming decades, and particularly whether the United States is likely to retain its current research edge if today's trends continue. In the paper's conclusion, we discuss possible implications and policies that might alter the future path of geographical dispersion of research. Before proceeding to a description of our data, our empirical results, and discussion of the implications of these results, we first address in the following section why U.S. location may directly affect research productivity."}, {"section_title": "II. Why U.S. Location May Be Important", "text": "Why might the United States be a location that engenders greater productivity in scientific research than other locations? First, geographic proximity to other scientists is thought to enhance knowledge diffusion and collaboration. In geographic areas within the United States with greater stocks of knowledge (as measured by past articles, patent applications of scientists working there, the presence of star scientists, or highly ranked academic institutions), there are more new publications, patents, and innovations by both private companies and academics. However, the research on proximity's advantages has struggled to establish this as the impact of location working through geographic knowledge spillovers from nearby scientists rather than mere correlation. The existence of spillovers is suggested by the increased tendency of researchers within the same geographical area to collaborate across institutions and sectors and to cite each other's articles and patents, the tendency of new firms to locate near universities active in that field, and the impact of exogenous changes in universities' R&D funding on geographically close companies. 5 The causal impact of top scientists in prestigious departments on new assistant professors has been isolated by instrumenting prestige with demand and supply factors affecting the academic market at the time of the initial placements (Oyer, 2006; Stephan & Levin, 1992) .\nGiven evidence that geographic closeness to excellent universities and scientists spills over to others' research productivity, the high concentration of top scientists in the United States gives all scientists located within the country an advantage to the extent that these knowledge spillovers are more likely to occur within a country than between countries. Moreover, for U.S.-educated scientists, geographic closeness is likely to foster increased collaboration with Ph.D. advisors and fellow students. Consequently, it seems likely that foreign-born recipients of U.S. doctorates who return to home countries will be less productive than those who remain in the United States. Of course, the same reasoning applies to scientists living far from universities and research centers but within the United States. Nevertheless, distances within the United States are small, on average, compared to the thousands of miles of water and land that separate the United States from all but its few nearest neighbors.\nGeographic propinquity is not the only avenue through which scientists can benefit from U.S. location. Wellfunded American universities and research institutes can also devote considerable financial resources to increasingly expensive research laboratories and equipment. Many top journals are located in the United States and have mainly American editors and reviewers. Additionally, scientists One can obtain information on foreign-born scientists who remain in the United States from the NSF's SESTAT database. Also, Michael G. Finn's (2007 Finn's ( , 2010 research provides valuable information on the stay rates of Ph.D.s of foreign origin.\n5 See Agrawal, Cockburn, and McHale (2006) ; Audretsch and Feldman (1996) ; Audretsch, Lehmann, and Warning (2005) ; Jaffe (1989) ; Jaffe, Trajtenberg, and Henderson (1993) ; Zucker, Darby, and Brewer (1998) ; Zucker and Darby (2006); and Zucker et al. (2007) . However, Orlando (2004) and Thompson and Fox-Kean (2005) have contested the strength of some of this evidence. located in the United States face lower costs of participating in the many well-attended conferences, seminars, and meetings in the country where they can network and present their research.\nCulture itself may also be a factor. Many U.S. universities place a high value on successful research, indicated by prestigious publications and grant awards, and consequently U.S. academia is often characterized by a high degree of competitiveness. Common institutional structures within U.S. academia and research centers make collaboration within the United States easier. Finally, there may be a wider range of jobs in basic scientific research available in the United States.\nMoreover, initial career advantage tends to lead to later advantage in academia.\n6 Consequently, students who leave the United States post-Ph.D. for visa reasons even for just a few years could see their research careers permanently affected.\nSeveral countervailing forces might have mitigated many of the advantages enjoyed by U.S. researchers in the second half of the twentieth century and early twenty-first century. Advances in communications technology and reductions in the cost of international travel have reduced geographic barriers to knowledge diffusion and long-distance collaboration in science. Over the past decade particularly, other governments have made the development of stronger research capabilities a national priority at a time when U.S. policies may have deterred some scientific explorations.\n7 These countries are expanding and improving their doctoral-level educational capabilities, partially by successfully attracting more star scientists. The U.S. share of STEM Ph.D.s awarded is decreasing, and Freeman (2006) documents that in the previous two decades, the major Asian Ph.D.-producing countries went from graduating fewer than half the number of U.S. STEM Ph.D.s to graduating more; somewhat less dramatically, EU countries went from graduating fewer to more STEM Ph.D.s than the United States. Between 2003 and 2007 , countries other than the United States slightly expanded their share of the top 100 universities, although they have not made new inroads into the top 20 (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2003 , 2007 . Finally, private sector STEM jobs abroad have also become more widely available as multinationals increase their non-U.S. employment of research scientists and U.S. companies off-shore some highlevel STEM jobs to foreign-owned companies."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "These factors might be the cause of the increasing collaboration and citations observed recently across state and international borders and of the decreasing impact of being in a top university on research productivity.\n9 They may also account for the increasing propensity of U.S.-trained highly skilled immigrants (including top scientists) to return to their home countries, dubbed by Annalee Saxenian as a ''brain circulation'' replacing ''brain drain, '' 10 and for increasing effects of R&D spending across international borders.\n11 Below, we investigate whether these trends have indeed erased any productivity advantage for scientists working within the United States."}, {"section_title": "III. Empirical Approach and Data Set", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. The Foreign Fulbright Program as an Instrument", "text": "As noted earlier, comparisons of U.S. and foreign scientists' research output will inevitably be plagued by endogeneity, since scientists' locations are likely to be influenced by unobserved characteristics correlated with productivity. Specifically, the most productive foreign-born U.S.-educated scientists may be the most likely to stay in the United States. The strategy we use to identify the separate impact of location on productivity is to identify pairs of foreign-born U.S. STEM Ph.D. recipients from the same department in the same university graduating during the same period (and, whenever possible, with the same advisor and from the same world region before entering their Ph.D. program)-one of whom is a Fulbright fellow with a J-1 student visa required by law to leave the United States for at least two years after finishing his or her doctorate and one of whom faced no such restrictions.\nFor Fulbright status to be a useful instrument, we must first establish that far more Fulbright fellowship recipients actually do leave the United States than do other foreigners studying in the United States. The requirement to leave the country after the completion of studies is quite stringent. It is possible to apply for a waiver of the foreign residency requirement if a student falls into one of several very restrictive and quite rare categories.\n12 Also, Fulbright reci-6 See Stephan (1996) and Oyer (2006 Kim et al. (2006), and Singh (2005) .\n10 See Saxenian (2002) , Zucker and Darby (2006) . 11 Kerr (2008) . 12 One route is for students to ask their country of origin to file a ''noobjection'' statement, although this approach is almost never considered grounds for waiving the foreign residency for Fulbrights (conversation with Boston University International Students and Scholars Office, January 2008). Waivers may also be obtained if an ''Interested Government Agency'' files a request on behalf of the student, stating that departure of the student will be detrimental to its interest and that of the public. Our conversations with experts suggest that these waivers are obtained only in rare circumstances. Medical doctors may obtain a waiver if they agree to practice in a region of the United States with a shortage of health care professionals. Waivers can be given if ''an exchange visitor believes that he or she will be persecuted based on his/her race, religion, or political opinion if he/she were to return to his/her home country.'' Finally, applications for waivers may be filed on the basis of ''exceptional hardship to a United States citizen (or legal permanent resident) spouse or child of an exchange visitor.'' The State Department warns, ''Please note that mere separation from family is not considered to be sufficient to establish exceptional hardship'' (http://travel .state.gov/visa/temp/info/info_1288.html). Economists can remain in the United States if they become part of international organizations like the World Bank, an avenue not available for most natural scientists. pients may delay their departure for two years of a postdoc or for up to three years of occupational or practical training (OPT) on-the-job immediately following the completion of their studies. Thus, in principle, a Foreign fulbright recipient could remain in the United States for up to five years following the receipt of Ph.D. before having to leave the country. Moreover, the Fulbright-subsidized Ph.D. can apply for a work visa and return to the United States after two years spent in their home country.\nThe enforcement of these rules is sufficiently stringent that almost all foreign Fulbright Ph.D. recipients leave the United States for some period post-Ph.D. Only 12.8% of our Fulbright sample appear to have remained in the United States continuously, and 24.0% appear never to have been in their home country post-Ph.D. and thus not to have fulfilled their home country residency requirement, although even they could have fulfilled the requirement in short segments that we did not observe. 13 For the other 76.0% of the Fulbright students in our sample, we were able to find evidence that they did spend some time in their home countries after receiving their Ph.D., compared to only 32.1% of our control group of U.S.-educated foreign-origin non-Fulbrights.\nWe observe our sample of 249 Fulbright scholars for a total of 2,164 person-years post-Ph.D., with 72.3% of these years spent outside the United States.\n14 These years spent outside the United States are mostly spent in the home country: 57.7% of the observations of Fulbrights are in their home countries, and 14.6% of observations of Fulbrights are located outside the United States but in a country that is not their home country. In contrast, the 249 controls spent only 34.1% of their 2,175 observed person-years outside the United States. Of these observations on controls, 25.8% are in their home countries and 8.3% in non-U.S. locations that are not their home countries. This U.S. stay rate of approximately 66% for control students is nearly identical to the average stay rate estimated in a much larger sample by Finn (2007) , who found that 67% of foreign students who received their doctorate in 1998 (close to the average Ph.D. year in our sample) were observed in the United States in 2003. A large difference between Fulbrights and controls in their tendency to be outside the United States exists for each region of origin. (Details are given in figure A4 of the online appendix accompanying this paper."}, {"section_title": "15", "text": ") In sum, the Fulbright instrument is strongly correlated with the endogenous variable foreign location.\nIn order for Fulbright status to be a legitimate instrument, we must also establish that our Fulbright sample is similar to our control group with respect to potential research productivity and proclivity at graduation. Our matching of each Fulbright with a control was done in order to create two groups with similar potential. In order to convince readers that we have done so, we discuss the construction of our control sample in some depth here. Additional details on sample construction are available in the online appendix.\nFor each Fulbright-funded Ph.D., we used the ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database to obtain information on the year of graduation and advisor and to identify a control student of foreign origin who did not have post-Ph.D. location restrictions and who graduated from the same program in the same year and, whenever such a student existed, with the same advisor. 16 Since students who receive substantial funding from their home country's government often are required to return for some period, we excluded the student as a control if we found evidence of substantial foreign governmental funding.\nWhen several potential control students were identified for a single Fulbright fellow, we chose the student who came from the same region or, more generally, from countries similar (particularly in GDP per capita) to the countries represented in the Fulbright sample. However, the distribution of students across countries in the treatment and control groups, while similar, is not identical (as shown in online appendix table A5.) There are several reasons for this. First, the distribution of Fulbrights across countries is affected by past and current political factors. Second, because many students from certain countries receive government funding, we were less likely to select controls from those countries. 17 We then searched for the Fulbrights' and controls' locations since their Ph.D. receipt on Google, Google Scholar, LinkedIn, or Web of Science, the combination of which allowed us to find both academics and nonacademics."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "Online appendix figure A3 lists the online sources of information on the locations of Fulbrights and controls and indicates that in general, their distribution across source types 13 The two-year residency requirement need not even be 730 consecutive days, but could be a combination of summers or semester-long visits abroad while spending the rest of the time in a U.S. postdoc or in OPT. This is discussed in greater detail in Kahn and MacGarvie (2012) .\n14 Our original sample as described in Kahn and MacGarvie (2012) consisted of 244 Fulbright-control pairs. We updated the location data after additional searches in June-July 2013 and were able to add 5 pairs who had previously been excluded due to lack of data.\n15 Appendix materials are available at http://people.bu.edu/skahn/. 16 In cases where there was no control student with the same advisor in the same year, we identified a student with the same advisor graduating within three years before or after the Fulbright. If no students met the latter criterion, we chose a student graduating in the same year in the same major field but with a different advisor. 17 There are considerably more Fulbrights from Mexico, Portugal, and South American countries and more controls from China, Germany, Italy, and Turkey. (A complete listing is available in the online appendix.) There are no Fulbrights from China or India in our sample, so we tried to avoid sampling controls from these countries, but when a suitable control could not be found from another country, we allowed students of Chinese and Indian origin in the sample. The reason that there are many Fulbrights from Mexico but no controls is that most of those without Fulbright fellowships are subsidized by their governments. Note that for countries with a large number of Fulbrights, it is preferable not to have controls from the same country since it becomes more likely that those who did not receive Fulbrights were of lower quality. 18 Many academics had CVs posted on the web, which included their location and their previous locations. Nonacademics were more likely to be found on LinkedIn, conference or meeting programs, alumni associations, local news articles, or civic or religious organizations' websites. One person was even located through a DUI arrest. We made sure that the person we located had more than just name in common with the student we knew (e.g., the Ph.D. location or a previous employer might be mentioned). Note that although we had many people's CVs, for consistency we did not base our publication counts on them but used Web of Science for everyone.\nis quite similar. If people were found in the same location and at the same institution several years apart, we assumed that they had been at that location continuously. If we could not find or interpolate the location, we dropped the personyear. Using this method, we dropped fewer than 5% of the person-years due to missing location. Finally, if, in our search for locations or publications, we found that we could not disambiguate a person's publications from others with the same name and field, we dropped the pair.\nIn sum, the match between treated (i.e., Fulbright) and control students was made with the goal of choosing controls as similar as possible along the characteristics relevant to our study. The criteria we used for matching were based on our priors about the characteristics that are most relevant for future research output (institution, field, year of graduation, and, where possible, advisor and region of origin). Statistics on the closeness of the matches are in the online appendix.\nDespite these efforts to ensure that the Fulbrights and controls are as similar as possible along relevant dimensions besides visa status, there still may be concerns that they are inherently different or that the method used to locate them biases whom we find.

Lower rank signifies higher quality. Since rank is the same for Fulbright and control, this variable only increases the explanatory power across Fulbrights-control pairs.\nField dummies. Fields differ widely in the number of articles published per year and in citing conventions. We categorize each student by the first field listed in their (ProQuest) dissertation record. We divide fields into the seven groups listed in table 3. 25 Since the control and Fulbright were chosen from the same field of study, the distribution across fields of study should be exactly identical. There are small differences, however, since often the fields specified in ProQuest are quite narrowly defined and many dissertations list more than one field.

We have estimated the uninstrumented Poisson regressions with the full set of year and Ph.D. year dummies and did not find results to differ substantially from the results using the more restricted year and year from Ph.D. variables.

Mullahy proposes a transformation of the model with multiplicative errors that is not subject to this problem. We used Stata's ivpois function to estimate these models, modified to allow for clustered standard errors.

However, citations to these articles are not significantly lower on average.\nFinally, LAGFORLOC also has a large and significant impact on publications and citations in high-impact journals, at \u00c079% for publications and \u00c072% for citations.\nControlling for pregraduation publications (panel B) lowers point estimates and significance levels of the impact of foreign location) across the board. However, although the gap between the United States and abroad narrows, it is still statistically significant for total publications (p-value \u00bc .54), last-authored publications (p-value \u00bc .051), highimpact publications (p-value \u00bc .017), and citations to highimpact publications (p-value \u00bc .091).\nOverall, the results from panels A and B suggest negative effects of being abroad on some measures of research output, with fewer when conditioned on publications while in graduate school.\nHowever, the impact of being outside the United States on scientists is likely to be heterogeneous. One factor that may affect the magnitude of any negative impact of being abroad is the wealth of the country in which the scientist is located, measured by its real GDP per capita. We expect that the research output of those who are in less developed countries with fewer resources for research would be most hurt by being outside the United States. However, the GDP of the scientist's foreign location will also be endogenous, with the most research-oriented Ph.D. recipients more likely to get jobs in richer countries with more resources devoted to science.

Endogenous explanatory variables panels A, B, E-H: lagged foreign location (LAGFORLOC); Instrument: Fulbright dummy. Endogenous explanatory variables panels C and D: LAGFORLOC, LAGFORLOC\u00c2ln(lagged)current GDP. Instruments: Fulbright dummy and lagged ln(real home country GDP). Exogenous explanatory variables: scientific field dummies, period dummies, Ph.D. year dummies, gender, ln(rank of Ph.D. institution). In specified regressions, also include ln(real home country GDP per cap five years prior to graduation) and pregraduation total, first, and first high-impact publications.\nWe differentiate the effect of being outside the United States by GDP per capita in two ways. In panels C and D of table 4, the two endogenous variables related to foreign location are LAGFORLOC alone and LAGFORLOC interacted with the GDP per capita of the current country (LAG-FORLOC X ln(lagged)GDP). The instruments that we use are Fulbright status and the lagged (log of) GDP per capita of the home country. The GDP per capita of the home country captures the differential effect of location for students from countries with different levels of income. Since it is based not on current country but home country, it is clearly predetermined. Note that in this case, we have not controlled for the home country's GDP five-year period to Ph.D. receipt since it is so highly correlated with present (lagged) GDP of one's country of origin. The F-statistics on these instruments are 64.63 (LAGFORLOC) and 73.77 (LAGFORLOC \u00c2 ln(lagged)GDP). The first-stage regression results are found in the appendix table, columns 2 and 3. Panels C and D of table 4 present estimates of the impact of being abroad at four points in the distribution of GDP per capita: at the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, controlling and not controlling for pregraduation publications, respectively.\nThe income per capita of the country in which the scientist is located does seem to mitigate the effects of being outside the United States, with the point estimates of the impact of being abroad more negative in poorer countries than in richer ones for all research measures. Thus, once we instrument to account for selection bias induced by endogenous differences in foreign locations, there is no statistically significant negative difference between scientists in the richest countries (90th percentile of GDP per capita) and those in the United States on any of the measures of research output. In other words, the negative impact of foreign location is completely absent in countries with higher GDP per capita. In contrast, scientists in countries with low GDP per capita are significantly negatively affected by foreign location. When pregraduation publications are not controlled for, scientists from countries at the 25th percentile of the GDP per capita distribution are significantly negatively affected by foreign location in terms of all publication and citation measures, while those at the 50th percentile of the GDP per capita distribution are significantly negatively affected for all output measures except citations to first-authored articles. After controlling for pregraduation publications, point estimates and significance of the impacts fall somewhat, but most remain significant at both the 25th percentile and 50th GDP percentile, although citations to first-authored articles are not significantly different at any income level.\nPanels E through H of table 4 use a different approach to measure separate effects of being in rich versus poor countries. They divide the sample into two groups, the first comprising scientists from richer countries (defined as in the top quartile of countries' real GDP per capita in the year of graduation) and the second comprising the rest of the world. 32 For those from rich countries, the effect of being abroad on every measure of scientific output is actually positive rather than negative. In contrast, for scientists originally from poor countries, the impact of being abroad is negative (except for first-authored publications in panel H) and significantly so for many measures (with and without pregrad publication controls). Thus, the impact of being outside the United States was significantly negative for both specifications for high-impact publications, total citations, and cites to high-impact publications and only consistently insignificant for first-authored publications and cites to those publications.\nFinally, in results not included here, we estimated the main models without instrumenting. 33 We expected uninstrumented coefficients to be more negative than the instrumented ones because we believed that those with a higher propensity to publish are more likely to stay in the United States. We did find the uninstrumented results to be more significant in general than the instrumented ones (e.g., in table 4, panels A and B). However, we found that the instrumented impact of being abroad is often larger (in percentage terms) than the uninstrumented one. In the separate rich/poor regressions comparable to table 4, panels E to H, we found that the effect of being abroad in a rich country is much more negative in the uninstrumented ones, and often significantly so. Thus, selection bias dominated OLS results for those from rich countries: those with a higher propensity to publish are more likely to remain in the United States. However, for those from poorer countries, the instrumented results were uniformly more negative than the uninstrumented ones. One possible explanation is that the instrumented results for those from poorer countries are picking up the local average treatment effects (LATE) for the compliers-the Fulbrights who comply with the foreign residency requirements of their visas and therefore are in their home countries. In contrast, uninstrumented results combine Fulbrights abroad with controls abroad who have voluntarily chosen to return to their home countries (the ''always takers'' in the language of Angrist, Imbens, & Rubin, 1996) , probably because they have more opportunities there or fewer opportunities in the United States.\nIt is worth noting that not all foreign research institutions are created equal. Heterogeneity across institutions around the world ensures that a top-ranked institution in a highincome foreign country will often be a more fertile environment for research than the median U.S. university. To investigate how the effects of location depend on the quality of the foreign institution, in panel I of table 4, we add a control equal to 1 if the scientist's current institution is the highest-ranked institution in the country according to the 32 Note that these analyses are able to include the home country GDP per capita (five years pre-Ph.D.) as a control variable because there is no other GDP variable in the estimation.

By adding together the coefficient on the foreign location dummy and the coefficient on the top-ranked foreign institution dummy, we find that for scientists working at the foremost institution in their country of residence, the negative effects of foreign location on productivity are substantially diminished. The reduction is largest for high-impact publications: while being abroad reduces high-impact publications by 79% on average (column 4, panel A of table 4), being abroad at the top institution in one's country reduces high-impact publications by 61%."}, {"section_title": "35", "text": "To summarize the major results from this section, research output and the dissemination of this output suffer for scientists who leave the United States for low-GDP countries, even after the endogeneity of that location choice is accounted for by instrumenting. The one exception may be first-authored publications and cites to these publications, although even for these, there is some indication of a negative impact of being in the very poorest countries. In contrast, being outside the United States does not seem to impede research or diffusion for researchers located in countries with more wealth and resources. Results controlling for pregraduation publications are likely to be an underestimate of the impact of location, but even these indicate quite negative impacts of being in low-income countries."}, {"section_title": "B. Potential Biases", "text": "Perhaps the most serious potential criticism of our instrument is the possibility that Fulbright status is inherently correlated with a researcher's quality, independent of location, implying that the exclusion restriction is violated. A similar potential problem would affect interpretation of the estimates if the method we used to find the Ph.D.s' locations biases us toward finding certain kinds of people in ways that affect Fulbrights and controls differently. We address these concerns next.\nPotential biases associated with differential inherent ability. Countries generally have their own committees that award Fulbright Fellowships based on their own selection criteria. We assume that academic excellence is one of these criteria, and this could mean that the typical Fulbright recipient has greater inherent potential for research than the typical randomly selected student from the same department. Alternatively, national Fulbright commissions might avoid funding the most promising students if they are believed to be less likely to spend their careers in their home country, which would result in Fulbrights having less research potential than controls on average. Moreover, many excellent students may not accept Fulbright Fellowships if they have strong preferences to remain in the United States post-Ph.D. or can afford to avoid funding that restricts their futures.\nTo the extent that U.S. universities can observe the differences among students, the university admissions procedure should ensure that the Fulbrights and non-Fulbrights they admit to any specific department have approximately equivalent abilities. However, future research preferences may not be entirely observable to U.S. university admissions or U.S. departments may lower their standards somewhat for graduate students who are already funded by a fellowship at the time of application. Finally, Fulbright Fellows might not apply to the university best matched to their abilities. In many countries, Fulbright commissions guide fellows towards particular U.S. universities, sometimes influenced by the availability of supplementary fellowship funding from the university or the lower tuition costs of public universities."}, {"section_title": "36", "text": "In short, there are possible biases leading to Fulbrights' having inherently higher ability and other possible biases leading to Fulbrights' having inherently lower ability. As shown below, if Fulbrights have greater inherent ability than controls, the IV results will be biased against finding a negative effect of foreign location on productivity. If Fulbrights have lesser inherent ability than controls, the IV results will be biased toward finding a negative effect of foreign location on productivity.\nPotential biases associated with use of online data sources. It is possible that the online information that we use to identify the locations of individuals in our sample is more readily available for the most productive scientists. This could occur if scientists working in academia both publish more and are more likely to post CVs when compared with scientists working in industry or if the scientists with the most publications are most eager to publicize their accomplishments. Thus, we would have attrition of the least productive scientists from the sample. Let us consider how this could affect our results under different scenarios.\nIf this tendency toward self-promotion is independent of Fulbright status and location, our data exhibit parallel attrition. In other words, the factors leading to attrition are common in the United States and other countries. This would imply that our results on productivity differentials are informative about a sample of scientists with above-average productivity. However, we would not expect parallel attrition to lead to over-or underestimating the effects of location on the productivity in this sample.\nBy contrast, if the probability of attrition from the sample depends on location, bias may be introduced. For example, if people living outside the United States have stronger incentives to self-publicize in order to maintain their connections to U.S. science, we may be more likely to collect data on the full distribution of productivity in foreign countries, while it is only the more productive scientists in the United States who post information about themselves online. This would introduce negative bias in our estimate of the effect of foreign location because our sample of foreign scientists is representative of the population, while our sample of U.S.-based scientists is positively selected.\nAlternatively, if online information on individuals living in lower-income countries is less prevalent due to those countries' less-developed Internet infrastructures, we may tend to collect data on only the most productive individuals in those countries. 37 This would lead to positive bias in our estimates of the productivity of those located abroad, particularly in lower-income countries.\nEvaluating the extent of bias. Information on the locations of scientists in our sample was obtained from a variety of online sources. The most common was an online CV, with 28.7% of observations on controls' locations and 29.7% of Fulbrights' locations coming from this source. Other common sources are LinkedIn, with 22.3% of control observations and 17.7% of Fulbright observations; faculty websites or web bios, with 14.7% and 17.7% of observations, respectively; and publications, with 14.6% and 13.9% of observations, respectively ( Figure A-3 of the online appendix shows the distribution of all sources Fulbrights and controls in more detail.) Moreover, average publications are not different for those academics who post and do not post their CVs or LinkedIn profiles and this is true for those in the United States and abroad (shown in the online appendix, table A-3). Based on this analysis of the sources of location data, we conclude that there is little reason to believe that results are biased by differential availability of online information about Fulbrights and controls.\nWe can also compare some of our data with random samples of STEM Ph.D.s from other sources to establish whether the U.S.-foreign publication differences that we have calculated for our sample obtained through online methods reflect U.S.-foreign differences among the larger population of doctoral recipients. The NSF's Survey of Doctoral Recipients (SDR) follows a random sample of U.S. doctorate recipients who remain in the United States as their careers unfold, with survey waves typically every two years. Unfortunately, only those who remain in the United States are tracked by the SDR. However, we can compare the foreign Ph.D.s in our sample who remain in the United States to those in the SDR. The 2001 wave of the SDR asked respondents to self-report the number of ''published articles in refereed professional journals'' over the previous five years. We extracted a subsample of the SDR consisting of temporary residents in STEM with Ph.D.s conferred from 1996 to 2001 to ensure comparability with our sample. We then computed the average and median number of publications per year for each cohort.\nWe then compared these numbers to the publications in our analysis for those who remain in the United States. Recall that our publication measures are based on refereed publications found on the Web of Science which, while quite comprehensive, is not a complete list of refereed journals. We also compared these two sources to the number of publications in refereed journals self-reported by individuals in our sample for whom we found CVs and who were in the United States continuously between 1996 and 2001. We found that the article counts for the scientists in our sample are similar to the article counts reported by the SDR for each survey wave (see online appendix table A-7). In no survey wave is the difference between our sample's mean publications and the mean publications in the SDR statistically significant. In sum, we conclude that there is no evidence that our data collection methodology has substantially biased the number of publications of those observed living in the United States and particularly did not bias these numbers upward.\nThere may still be concern that the use of online data induces sample selection bias for scientists located abroad, who in our sample are more likely to be the Fulbrights. We cannot compare publication data in our sample with those of a randomly selected group of foreign scientists with U.S. Ph.D.s because the latter data set is not available (to our knowledge). However, we can compare the basic characteristics of the Fulbrights and controls in our sample with the characteristics of the universe of people receiving U.S. Ph.D.s in STEM, based on the NSF's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). The SED is distributed to doctoral recipients at the time of completion of their degrees and contains information about their demographic characteristics, country of origin, and post-graduation employment plans but not about their research productivity. We make this comparison for the Ph.D. years (1996 and 1997) in which SED respondents were asked about their specific sources of funding, including Fulbright fellowships. We identify in these years the STEM Ph.D. recipients of foreign origin who did not have Fulbright funding and those who did have Fulbright funding. We compare the postdegree employment (academic, private, or government) of Fulbrights and controls in our sample in the year after they graduate with the postgraduation employment plans of Fulbrights and nonFulbright foreigners obtaining U.S. Ph.D.s in the SED. We find that the scientists in our sample are remarkably similar to graduating scientists in general. The details of these results are described in the online data appendix and particularly table A-6. 37 It is not realistic to expect this source of bias to affect our estimates of the effect of being in a high-income country (e.g., at the 90th percentile of GDP per capita), since Internet availability in these countries is sufficiently similar to that in the United States.\nIn addition to bias induced by the sources of our productivity data, there may be more general concern that the Fulbright instrument is positively or negatively biased. We have done several things in order to remove or evaluate possible biases due to potential differences in the research potential of Fulbrights and controls. First, we control for explanatory variables likely to be correlated with research ability and proclivity. One such variable is the Ph.D. institution's rank. Since this is identical within the pair, inclusion of this variable serves only to increase the explanatory power across pairs. Second, in most specifications, we control for the GDP per capita of the home country at the beginning of graduate school. This helps to control for variation across home countries in the quality of undergraduate education.\nThird, in some specifications, we also include as control variables measures of students' research output while in graduate school, which we believe to be a good proxy for inherent ability. Including these pregraduation publication variables may overcontrol in the sense that at least some of the Fulbright-control differences in pregraduation publications may also be a result of being a Fulbright. For instance, if Fulbrights believe that they will return home to a nonresearch job, they may be less committed to getting their Ph.D. research published. But if Fulbrights are more concerned about having opportunities to leave their home country after two (or more) years of residence, they may feel they need stronger credentials. Poisson regressions of students' pregraduation research output variables on the Fulbright dummy, region of origin, field, and Ph.D. year indicate a 25.8% lower rate of total publications among Fulbrights that is not significant at conventional levels (pvalue \u00bc .0.064) and an even less significant 16.9% lower rate among Fulbrights for first-authored publications (pvalue \u00bc .178). We believe the first-authored pregraduation publication count to be a more direct measure of student's future research potential."}, {"section_title": "38", "text": "Sensitivity of results to violation of the exclusion restriction. As a further guide to the interpretation of our estimates, in this section, we provide some estimates of the potential effects of bias introduced by correlation between the dependent variable and the instrument. Our approach is based on that of Angrist et al. (1996) , who examine the implications of a violation of the exclusion restriction in the relationship between civilian mortality and draft status. In the interest of simplicity, we assume a linear (2SLS) model. Let Y i represent the research measure for person i (publications, citations), D i be LAGFORLOC, and Z i be the Fulbright instrument (with both D i and Z i being dummies). The coefficient in the simple OLS regression of\nThe 2SLS equivalent of b ols is:\nThe exclusion restriction in our context implies that Fulbrights systematically differ from controls only because they were required to leave the United States post-Ph.D., and therefore without this return requirement, Fulbrights would have had the same outcomes (publications, cites) as non-Fulbrights.\nIf this exclusion restriction does not hold, the IV estimator will be biased. Suppose that the true model is\nwhere Q i is the unobserved quality of the student. Then the 2SLS estimator will be\nassuming Cov(e i , Z i ) \u00bc 0. This says that the IV estimate of the causal effect will be biased by the ratio of the covariance between quality and Fulbright status to the covariance of location and Fulbright status. 39 Assuming\nTherefore:\nwhere g 1 is the additional number of publications from the ''quality effect'' of being a Fulbright and a 1 is the increase in the probability of being outside the United States from being a Fulbright. Note that even if g 1 is nonzero-in other words, the exclusion restriction is violated-the amount of bias will be small as long as the instrument is very strong (a 1 is large in absolute value). Let us assume that the quality effect of being a Fulbright means the Fulbright is either over-or underplaced at his 38 Results are similar for negative binomial models for first-authored publications, while the result has similar magnitude but greater significance for total publications. When we exclude controls for field, year, and region, the coefficient on Fulbright is significant in the total pregraduation publications regression, but insignificant in the regression in which the dependent variable is first-authored pregraduation publications. 39 Angrist et al. (1996) compute 2SLS estimates of the impact of veteran status on mortality using draft lottery number as an instrument. The concern in their case is that the exclusion restriction is violated because draft numbers affect mortality through their influence on years of schooling. They use this method to estimate the amount of potential bias.\nPh.D. institution relative to controls. For example, consider the possibility that Fulbrights are overplaced, that is, they are admitted to programs that would not have admitted them if they were controls, and as a result, Fulbrights from a given institution can be expected to have lower inherent ability than controls from that institution, independent of where they are located after the completion of the Ph.D. program.\nTo determine the magnitude of the bias this would introduce, suppose that Fulbrights are typically admitted by programs that are either higher or ranked lower than the best program that would admit the Fulbright without the fellowship. By definition, controls are accurately matched with their Ph.D. institutions. Regressing controls' research output on institution rank in percentiles and controlling for the year of Ph.D. and the observation year, we obtain the estimated impact on research output of moving up or down a quartile of rank. 40 We then perform sensitivity analysis in which we consider the possibility that Fulbrights on average have either higher or lower inherent research potential than controls. We consider two scenarios, and for each scenario, we compute b 1 \u00bc b 2sls \u00c0g 1 /a 1 . In table 5, we present the results of this sensitivity analysis, using the 2SLS estimates of the effect of foreign location at each of the four income levels discussed in the paper. 41 We find that the qualitative results for scientists from countries of different income levels are the same whether assuming a 25% positive or negative bias. People in countries with the lowest income levels who live abroad are negatively affected, and significantly so in both the statistical and economic meaning of the word. People in the richest countries have small and mostly insignificant differences in research output, and point estimates are often positive. Of course, the size of the negative impact is larger if Fulbrights actually were better than their peers and is smaller than if Fulbrights actually were worse, although the differences in magnitudes due to bias are not large.\nOur overall conclusion drawn from this sensitivity analysis is that for reasonable amounts of potential bias, either positive or negative, the strength of the instrument dominates the bias. As a result, our results are qualitatively unchanged. We recognize that if Fulbrights and controls are much more dissimilar than assumed here, we would have difficulty interpreting our results, especially for countries at the high end of the income distribution. However, given the steps we have taken to ensure comparability of students within the matched pairs and the control variables we have included to account for student heterogeneity, we feel that the presence of a bias of a magnitude large enough to invalidate our results is unlikely in this sample.

Endogenous explanatory variables: LAGFORLOC, LAGFORLOC X ln (lagged) current GDP. Instruments: Fulbright dummy and ln home country GDP five years prior to graduation.\n40 Specifically, we calculate the average percentage change in publications implied by the coefficients across all the publication regressions and multiply this number by 0.25 (one quartile) to get the estimated elasticity of moving up or down a quartile in program rank. This elasticity is estimated at 7% (a 7% reduction in research output associated with a onequartile reduction in rank).\n41 Not controlling for pregraduation publications.\nAdditional robustness tests. In this section we perform a variety of robustness checks. First, although we have clustered errors by individual to correct standard errors, we check whether we get similar results if we collapse the data to the scientist level (panels A-D of table 6). In this specification, the dependent variables are averaged over the years since receipt of Ph.D., and the key endogenous variable is the share of years spent abroad, instrumented by Fulbright status using the IV Poisson model. The independent variables are the same as in our main results described previously. 42 This specification ignores all time-varying covariates, particularly how many years have passed since the Ph.D., due to collapsing the data. Thus, we lose information about which years the person is observed (since each scientist was not necessarily observed each year since Ph.D.). Nevertheless, the results in table 6 (panels A-D) are consistent with those obtained from the panel data, with large, significant effects associated with spending more years abroad for scientists from poor countries and insignificant or positive effects of being abroad for scientists from rich countries. The key difference is that now the impact on lastauthored publications and on cites to those publications is no longer significant. 43 It may be that the aspect of countries most important to the success of scientists located there is not their GDP but instead the commitment of the country to basic science and research. In panels E to H of table 6, we divide countries based on the number of scientific articles per capita produced by the country obtained from NSF (2008) as a proxy Significant at *10%, **5%, ***1%.

Endogenous explanatory variable: % of years abroad. Instrument: Fulbright dummy. Exogenous explanatory variables: scientific field and Ph.D. year dummies, gender, ln(rank of Ph.D. institution) and GDP per capita of home country 5 years prior to graduation. In specified regressions, also include pregraduation total, first, and first high-impact publications.\n42 These are program rank, field dummies, Ph.D. year, GDP per capita of home country five years prior to Ph.D., gender, and pregraduation publications for specified regressions.\nfor this commitment.\n44 High article-per-capita countries are defined as countries whose articles per capita are above the 75th percentile. 45 We find results very similar to the results in the previous panels A to D based on GDP per capita.\nWe also pursue two alternative matching approaches to correct for the possibility that Fulbrights and controls are fundamentally different. Our preferred matching procedure is as described throughout the paper, where we match exactly on Ph.D. institution and field of study and nearly exactly on year of graduation. However, it is possible that by choosing to match exactly on these covariates, we have neglected other factors that could introduce bias-for example, the research productivity of the student while in graduate school.\nOur first alternative matching approach is matching each Fulbright to the non-Fulbright who is the closest to that person in terms of the predicted probability of being a Fulbright. Each of our Fulbrights is matched to the control student in the same broad scientific field with the closest predicted probability of being a Fulbright as based on a logit model of Fulbright status as a function of the exogenous variables previously used. We think of this as a way of collapsing the observable characteristics correlated with Fulbright status into an index that can then be used to identify the most similar control to the Fulbright in question."}, {"section_title": "46", "text": "The average matched control appears 2.3 times. All covariates are balanced (i.e., there is no statistically significant difference in the means of these covariates for Fulbrights and controls).\nThe second alternative matching procedure approach is based on the coarsened exact matching (CEM) procedure used by Azoulay, Graff-Zivin, and Wang (2010) following Iacus, King, and Porro (2012) . In this nonparametric procedure, one selects a set of covariates-in our case, the scientist's field of study, the GDP per capita of the home country (five years before the Ph.D.), the number of first-authored articles written while in graduate school, the year of graduation, and the rank of the Ph.D. program-and creates strata with an approximate (or ''coarsened'') match on these covariates. For each treated observation (where treatment in this case is Fulbright status), a matching control observation is drawn from within its stratum, and nonmatching observations are dropped. The average matched control appears 1.24 times in the new data set. All covariates are balanced, with the exception of the log of the home country GDP per capita.\nFor each of these matching methods, we run two sets of regressions (using the Mullahy estimation procedure). In the first, each of our eight research output variables is modeled as a function of LAGFORLOC and the same set of controls used in the main analyses in table 4. In the second, we run the standard dependent variables on LAGFORLOC and the (lagged log) GDP per capita of the present country, both instrumented as in our table 4 results. The results appear in table 7. The substantive differences from table 4 are that the average impact of being located abroad is no longer significant. This may be partly due to the reduction in the sample size. However, the estimates in panels B and D continue to display large negative impacts of being located in lowincome countries, and no significant effect of being located in high-income countries. 45 Specifically, a scientist is classified as coming from a high articleper-capita country if the scientist's home country is above the 75th percentile of articles per capita in the year of graduation.\n46 This is similar to propensity score matching, but the matching is with respect to the propensity to be a Fulbright (the instrument) rather than with respect to the propensity to be abroad (the treatment). More details about both matching methods are included in the online appendix B."}, {"section_title": "C. Effects by Field of Study", "text": "It is possible that the impact of foreign location depends on the field. We therefore experimented with several different interaction terms between fields and foreign location in our total publication equations. One question we asked was whether the negative impact of foreign location was limited to fields dependent on large laboratories-19% of our sample. We found that in fields with or without big labs, the negative impact of foreign location was strongest in poor countries. However, total and first publications and citations in large-lab fields were less disadvantaged than other fields (at all income levels). In contrast, foreign location negatively affects last-authorship and high-impact authorship in large-lab fields in both poor and rich non-U.S. countries. Since last authorship in science signifies the laboratory head, this suggests that people in large-lab fields located anywhere abroad are less likely to be head of a laboratory compared to those remaining in the U.S. These results are tentative since the scientists in our sample are for the most part in the early stages of their academic careers, at which time few can be expected to be heads of large labs.\nAnother question we investigated was whether foreign location increased publications for those in agricultural and related fields (such as water resources and entomology) because many countries of origin are more rural than the United States, and this might be counteracting larger negative effects in other fields. Dividing the impact of foreign location by whether the field was related to agriculture, we find that the significant negative effect is indeed in the nonagricultural fields. but that this too was true only for poor countries. We found that the impact of foreign location was insignificant in agricultural fields, with the exception of last-authorship and a marginal effect of total cites in the very poorest of countries; signs were often positive. As a result, excluding agricultural fields led to somewhat larger and more significant effects than seen in table 4. The agricultural results should be interpreted carefully since only 12% of observations are in the agricultural fields."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusion", "text": "In this paper, we have examined whether newly minted U.S. Ph.D.s of foreign origin maximize their post-Ph.D. contributions to science if they remain in the United States. Others have documented that the high concentration of star scientists and excellent universities in the United States seems to have led to positive externalities for others' research productivity. This suggests that foreign-born recipients of U.S. doctorates who return to home countries will be less productive than they would have been in the United States. Additional advantages of U.S. location include financial resources, access to top journals and conferences, a culture of research competitiveness, and business support of basic research. This paper compares publication histories for a sample of U.S. Ph.D. recipients from abroad using exogenously determined variation in post-Ph.D. location to identify the causal effect of location on research output. The results suggest that those who remain in the United States are at an advantage in terms of higher rates of publications, citations compared to those in countries with low GDP per capita. This is particularly true in terms of publishing in high-impact journals. However, we cannot reject the hypothesis that those in countries with high GDP per capita, especially countries in the top decile of GDP per capita, are just as likely to publish, to be cited, and to remain current as those remaining in the United States.\nOne caveat to the conclusions in this paper is that we have sampled only foreign-born scientists who received their Ph.D. education in the United States. These scientists are more likely than their compatriots to retain links to the U.S. research world and therefore may be less affected by their location outside the United States. Conversely, their productivity may suffer more from being abroad due to the lack of a local scientific network built up during graduate studies. In our future research, we will study the networks of international collaboration and citation of our U.S.-educated sample of those who are foreign born, measuring how links to the United States and other countries develop and grow, depending not only on the scientists' location but also on their fields, employment sector, and research abilities.\nOverall, our findings suggest that a scientist exogenously located in a country high in the income distribution can expect to be as productive in research as he or she would be in the United States. This finding is fairly surprising in light of the high degree of concentration of top scientists at U.S. universities. It may reflect the mitigating factors discussed in section II, particularly other countries' increasing commitment to excellent science and to higher levels of science education, as well as easier international collaboration made possible by technological developments and encouraged by global ''brain circulation'' of U.S.-educated Ph.D.s returning to their home countries.\nOur results have implications for both the future of global knowledge creation and the future of the position of the United States in the international scientific hierarchy. As less wealthy countries' per capita GDP converges toward wealthier ones, the productivity of scientists located in those countries can be expected to also converge toward U.S. levels. This could vastly increase the number of scientists around the world conducting cutting-edge scientific research. As a result, global knowledge will expand at increasing rates. However, our results suggest that the United States is able to attract many of the world's top scientists because many people enjoy living here, because many foreigners receive their Ph.D.s here and most stay, and because there remains considerable U.S. government financial support for basic scientific research-not because being located in the United States makes scientists more productive than they would be in another high-income country. If governments in Asia and Europe increase their efforts to lure scientists to their countries, particularly by offering large amounts of financial support, and continue to expand and improve their own Ph.D. programs, our findings suggest that the United States could lose its position of dominance in scientific research.\nThe United States will remain at the forefront of science only if it can continue to attract excellent STEM students to its graduate programs and if a large proportion of these graduates continue to choose to live in the United States. This will require both continued government support of excellence in graduate science education and redoubled government efforts to fund scientific research.
