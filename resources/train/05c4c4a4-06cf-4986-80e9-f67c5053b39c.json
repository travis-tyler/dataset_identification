Improved efficiency may result from use of multimodal composite indicators of early AD pathogenesis as well as subtle cognitive decline. One such indicator, the Alzheimer Progression Score (APS), 3 assesses presymptomatic AD progression using Item Response Theory modeling. Predictive validity of the APS method has been demonstrated recently. 3 Among potential preventive interventions in presymptomatic AD, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have retained interest. Numerous observational studies have shown reduced incidence of AD in users of these drugs, at least in relatively young elderly. 4 However, NSAID prevention trials have failed to show benefit, and instead have caused harm to older individuals, 5 or those with imminent symptoms. 6, 7 These findings suggest that NSAID prevention trials must screen (preferably younger-old) participants carefully for cognitive or other prodromal AD symptoms. 8 Such principles were applied when designing Investigation of Naproxen Treatment Effects in Pre-symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (INTREPAD; NCT-02702817), a 2-year double-masked randomized trial of oral naproxen sodium 220 mg twice daily vs placebo for safety and efficacy against progression of AD-related change."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Primary research question INTREPAD was designed to test the safety and efficacy of low-dose naproxen in reducing the rate of change of a composite indicator of presymptomatic AD.

The primary efficacy analysis considered a modified intent-to-treat (mITT) group of 160 persons who remained on assigned treatments until their first follow-up evaluation 90 days after baseline. In all, 166 (85%) completed their participation per protocol (154 mITT and 12 others in the intent-to-treat (ITT) group with 2 years of follow-up and biomarker assessment).

This composite was under development in data from the parallel (nontrial) parent PREVENT-AD Cohort, with near-identical characteristics. 9 Initial power analyses considered a subset of data from the public use ADNI database. We simulated an attempt to demonstrate a true 25% reduction in the slope of the CSF concentration of total tau (t-tau) over 1 year, specifying 85% statistical power. This analysis suggested that the needed power could be provided by a sample of 228 aged cognitively normal participants assigned 1:1 to active drug vs placebo. We assumed that greater power would be provided by 2 (rather than 1) years of observation, and thus specified a target enrollment of 200 with an assumption that ;80% would remain in an mITT primary analysis pool of persons who remained on study treatments through their first follow-up examination (but note below that results belied these assumptions).\nWhen the primary efficacy outcome (APS) 3 was fully specified, we performed a similar simulation in the parallel, nontrial PREVENT-AD Cohort. This simulation now relied on the Cohort's observed slope, random intercept variance, and error variance using a longitudinal random effects model. It suggested that 160 participants would afford 85% power to detect only a 50% difference in slope between 2 study arms, or 68% power to detect a 40% difference.

The APS is a composite that incorporates multimodal imaging, neurosensory, cognitive, and CSF markers, based on an assumption that change in each of these arises from a single underlying latent process (AD pathogenesis). Its scores are scaled as a standard normal distribution, with higher scores denoting increasing severity. Constituent measures are summarized in table 1. At each measurement, a uniform scheme of weightings for individual markers yielded a composite summary score. All available data were used to estimate individual scores, and missing data were accommodated in a process that essentially averaged over missing values. To verify robustness to missing data, Gross et al. 20 had used iterative leave-one-out analyses in a similar outcome measure comprising 6 markers. Leoutsakos et al. 3 also examined effects of missing CSF data on the APS, noting similarly satisfactory findings. The APS approach had been validated using data from the BIOCARD study, 13 before being incorporated into INTREPAD efficacy analyses. In BIO-CARD, the APS approach showed substantial abilities to predict subsequent conversion to MCI or AD dementia. 3 Analyses there also showed temporal measurement invariance. Before applying the PREVENT-AD cohort-derived marker weights to the analysis of INTREPAD, we demonstrated that they provided excellent performance in the trial sample. 3 However, the trial data (table 1) included 2 variables (CSF t-tau and A\u03b2 1-42 levels) that were not available from nontrial participants.

We observed a clear increase over time in the trial's primary efficacy outcome (the APS composite representing several imaging metrics, a neurosensory modality, 3 cognitive measures, and, when available, CSF biomarkers). Assignment to naproxen produced an unambiguous increase in adverse events but no meaningful alteration in the rate of change for this primary efficacy outcome. Overall, our results suggest 2 points for discussion: (1) evaluation of a design intended to increase efficiency of AD prevention trials and (2) the trial's safety and efficacy results, and their ethical implications.\nWe employed several design features intended to improve efficiency for INTREPAD and, by implication, other AD prevention trials. First, we attempted to enrich participants' proportion of persons vulnerable to AD by requiring that enrollees have an affected parent or multiple siblings. 23 Enrichment by requirement of a first-degree relative with AD is not novel, but the INTREPAD family history criteria were stronger. Especially in today's environment of greater longevity and increased awareness of AD-affected status (thus, ready identification), this more restrictive method is increasingly practical. It would seem easier to implement than a requirement of amyloid pathology demonstrable by PET 24 or CSF analysis, or even homozygosity at the APOE e4 risk allele. 25 How this enhanced family history method of enrichment compares with the latter, more costly or invasive methods is unknown. However, we have recently shown that proximity to an index relative's age at symptom onset is related to increased AD biomarker load. 26 This same metric was associated in a separate cohort with brain changes predictive of time to symptom onset. 27 Given the method's reduced costs and subject burden, a cost/benefit comparison with other methods probably deserves consideration.\nSecond, we selected the composite APS as the trial's primary outcome. Relative to any single cognitive or biomarker indicator, composite outcomes of this sort should logically offer greater inference, especially in relatively early-stage presymptomatic AD. We chose the APS in preference to several similar composite indicators that had been less extensively validated. 28, 29 While additional efforts to validate the APS are warranted, it has shown demonstrable utility for evaluation of presymptomatic AD progress. Specifically, in BIOCARD, a 1 standard unit increase in APS predicted a 5-fold greater hazard of diagnostic progression over time. 3 In the parallel PREVENT-AD cohort, we performed several simulations to compare the statistical power of the APS to that of its constituent markers. The APS provided more information than did any single endpoint, including all cognitive measures, and it also offered improved performance over a simple summing of z scores of its individual components (data not shown). We therefore suggest that the APS or similar multimodal composites show promise for prevention trials like INTREPAD.\nNonetheless, post hoc analyses suggested that our methods resulted in a trial with substantially less statistical power than had been originally projected. Our original power estimates were based in part on expectation that considerable information would be contributed by CSF biomarker data, available from more than half of the participants. That turned out not to be the case and, accordingly, the trial outcome's CI was sufficiently broad to suggest a notable possibility of type II error. Now having data on rate of change in the trial's outcomes, we can estimate that 2,250 person-years of observation (e.g., a sample of 1,125 followed over 2 years, or 563 followed for 4 years) would have been required for 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in the rate of APS change. Although much higher than originally estimated, this number still represents a considerable improvement over requirements of conventional prevention trial designs. For example, the ongoing A4 trial will follow ;1,150 persons over ;4.6 years (5,290 person-years) for its primary cognitive outcome. 24, 30 Similarly, the TOMMORROW trial had originally estimated a requirement of 5,800 persons over ;4 years (29,200 person-years). 31 By comparison, even ignoring costs of PET scans in the former or serial detailed psychometric assessments in the latter, and assuming costs proportional only to person-years of observation, the INTREPAD design may achieve cost savings of 57%-90% over traditional methods.\nThe INTREPAD safety results affirm prior data suggesting that, even in relatively low dosage among younger elderly persons, naproxen and other NSAIDs provoke harm in several health outcomes. [32] [33] [34] Our findings that these risks can be held within bounds by careful monitoring does not obviate the ethical concern that NSAID treatments are potentially harmful and should be given for AD prevention only if they produce substantial reduction of AD risk. The INTREPAD results provide no evidence for such a reduction. This result is especially salient, inasmuch as the trial sample was relatively young for this sort of work, and chosen for a favorable risk/ benefit balance in relation to NSAID treatment. Specifically, participants were on average ;10 years younger than their affected parent or first-affected sibling, and were meticulously screened for incipient cognitive disorder. 35 These attributes appear to weaken arguments that earlier NSAID trials failed to show benefit because their aging samples were too old or too near the cusp of symptom onset. [36] [37] [38] The null efficacy outcomes of INTREPAD are reinforced by several observations. The CI around the trial's efficacy rate ratio suggests 95% certainty that the true treatment-related reduction of AD risk in this trial (or, presumably, in similar samples) does not exceed 36%. This conclusion is buttressed by a consistent absence of apparent benefit on any of the trial's secondary or exploratory outcomes. These results recall observations in ADAPT 8 and prior NSAID treatment and prevention trials with null or negative results. While we cannot exclude possible benefits of NSAIDs in middle life, we can now suggest that such benefits would be nearly impossible to demonstrate in randomized prevention trials.\nAs regards our further objective of testing or demonstrating methods for improving efficiency in AD prevention trials, we offer several observations. Our enrichment strategy requiring parental or multiple-sibling family history of AD might have been improved by a further requirement specifying participants' age in relation to their index relatives' onsets. While evidently more informative than any single biomarker, or a composite of only a few such markers, our outcome could today probably be improved by incorporation of newer salient markers of preclinical disease. These might include threshold values for the traditional CSF biomarkers A\u03b2 1-42 , t-tau, or p-tau, or possibly neurofilament light chain as a precondition to enrollment. Power estimation and sample size requirement for such work should be clearer now than when we began this work. In this last sense, INTREPAD may be viewed as providing an approximate benchmark for work with samples having similar baseline characteristics.\nIn all events, this work has left us with extreme pessimism regarding any possible role of NSAIDs in AD prevention. Instead, our results may suggest reconsideration of inflammatory diseases (or a proinflammatory diathesis) as a possible explanation for the reduced AD incidence among NSAID users in observational studies.
