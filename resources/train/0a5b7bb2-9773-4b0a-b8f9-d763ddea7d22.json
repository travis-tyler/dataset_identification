[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Smaller hippocampal volume in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) represents the most consistently reported structural alteration in the brain. Subfields of the hippocampus play distinct roles in encoding and processing of memories, which are disrupted in PTSD. We examined PTSD-associated alterations in 12 hippocampal subfields in relation to global hippocampal shape, and clinical features. PTSD-associated differences in global hippocampal shape were nonsignificant.\nThe present finding of smaller hippocampal CA1 in PTSD is consistent with model systems in rodents that exhibit increased anxiety-like behavior from repeated exposure to acute stress. Behavioral correlations with hippocampal subfield volume differences in PTSD will elucidate their relevance to PTSD, particularly behaviors of associative fear learning, extinction training, and formation of false memories.\n1018"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may experience deficits in declarative memory, such as remembering events, facts or lists, fragmentation of autobiographical or trauma-related memories, and trauma-related amnesia (Elzinga & Bremner, 2002) . The hippocampus plays an important role in memory formation and retrieval that has long been implicated in the clinical presentation of PTSD (Bremner et al., 1997) . Indeed, lower hippocampal volume in PTSD has been a reliably reported structural alteration for over two decades (Logue et al., 2018; Morey et al., 2012) . We sought to attain improved spatial and functional characterization of this structural alteration via two complimentary approaches, (1) quantify the volume of 12 hippocampal subfields, and (2) conduct 3D vertex-based shape analysis of the hippocampus to identify localized surface features associated with PTSD.\nCareful investigation of PTSD-associated alterations in hippocampal subfields and their relationship to differences in hippocampal shape, and clinical features is scant, has met with inconsistent results, and has been beset by limitations (Hayes et al., 2017; Mueller et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2010) . Employing manual subfield segmentation, Wang et al. (2010) reported lower volume in CA3 associated with PTSD; Hayes et al. (2017) found smaller dentate gyrus (DG), whereas Mueller et al. (2015) found PTSD associated no subfield differences.\nThe primary limitation of Wang et al. (2010) was small sample size of n = 36 given the expected range of effect sizes. Hayes et al. (2017) studied the largest sample to date (n = 97), but used subfield segmentation with FreeSurfer v5.3 that suffered from three major shortcomings (Van Leemput et al., 2009) . First, the resolution of the in vivo training data was insufficient for the human raters to accurately distinguish subregions, forcing excessive reliance on geometric boundary criteria for tracing subfields, but on the other hand may be able to overcome image artifacts sometimes overlooked by automated techniques. The second issue was that the delineation protocol was designed for the hippocampal body, which translated poorly to the hippocampal head and tail.\nThe resultant third problem was that the volumes of the subregions did not agree well with histological studies. Therefore, FreeSurfer v5.3 is based on an anatomically incorrect atlas (Wisse, Biessels, & Geerlings, 2014) , notably for CA1. These shortcomings are addressed in the present study by a completely new atlas in FreeSurfer v6.0 that was built with a novel atlasing algorithm and ex vivo MRI data acquired from postmortem brains . Thus, FreeSurfer v6.0 combines ex vivo and in vivo scans, with the former acquired on 15 ex vivo brains scanned at 7 T to attain extremely high signal to noise ration and 130-m 3 isotropic resolution, whereas v5.3 used in vivo atlas from five cases acquired at nearly ninefold lower resolution of 380-m 3 resolution and the manual segmentation studies were acquired at 4 T with 180-fold lower resolution of 400 \u00d7 500 m in-plane and 2,000-m through-plane resolution. These enhancements enable segmentation of 12 subfields with FreeSurfer v6.0 as compared to five subfields with v5.3 or manual segmentation methods.\nSubfields of the hippocampus are involved in discrete aspects of memory encoding and consolidation. For instance, the DG is important in distinguishing features that are different from other memories in order to store similar memories as discrete events-a phenomenon called pattern separation (Schmidt, Marrone, & Markus, 2012; Yassa & Stark, 2011) . Pattern separation deficits may underlie fear generalization (Kheirbek, Klemenhagen, Sahay, & Hen, 2012) , a process that occurs in anxiety and stress based disorders including PTSD . By contrast, the entorhinal cortex (EC) and cornu ammonis subfield-3 (CA3) are crucial in recognizing different events with overlapping features-a phenomenon called pattern completion that has important implications in contextual fear conditioning (O'Reilly & Norman, 2002) and is a widely investigated model of PTSD (Parsons & Ressler, 2013) . Chronic stress in rats produces atrophy and debranching of dendrites in pyramidal neurons of the CA3 (Vyas, Mitra, Shankaranarayana Rao, & Chattarji, 2002) and decreased neurogenesis in the DG (Gould, Tanapat, McEwen, Fl\u00fcgge, & Fuchs, 1998) , which appear to be reversible in these models when stress is alleviated. Preclinical research in rats has shown that the CA1 subfield is involved in context-specific memory retrieval after extinction (Ji & Maren, 2008) .\nThese and other findings clearly point to a major influence of hippocampal CA1 neurons in conditioned fear and its extinction (Furini, Myskiw, & Izquierdo, 2014) . Extinction learning, which relies critically on intact CA1 function (Dillon, Qu, Marcus, & Dodart, 2008; Furini et al., 2014; Tronson et al., 2009) , is impaired in widely adopted experimental models of PTSD and consistent with reexperiencing symptoms of PTSD.\nThe capability for automated, in vivo segmentation of the human hippocampal subfields is now imperative for achieving replicability and reproducibility efficiently in large multisite initiatives (Logue et al., 2015; Whelan et al., 2015) . The recently released FreeSurfer v6.0 makes it possible to estimate the hippocampal subfields from 1-mm T1-weighted MRI. Despite the fact that historically, segmentation of subfields was usually based on higher resolution images that may include T2, with 0.2-0.7 mm and limited contrast between some of the subfields at 1-mm resolution; it has been shown that segmentations estimated from 1-mm scan resolution nevertheless carry useful information on subfield volumes .\nThe segmentation algorithm was validated on three publicly available datasets with varying MRI contrast and resolution (Winterburn et al., 2013) .\nOur goal was to investigate the association between PTSD and 12 hippocampal subfield volumes, as well as the relationship of subfield volume to hippocampal shape among a large cohort of younger U.S. military veterans. Based on the foregoing evidence from animal and human research, we hypothesized the PTSD group would have smaller CA1, CA3, and DG volumes. Given the application of an anatomically incorrect atlas for CA1 in FreeSurfer v5.3 that was corrected in FreeSurfer v6.0, and the unique role of CA1 in context-specific memory retrieval, a strongly implicated behavioral deficit in PTSD, we elevated our prediction probability of smaller CA1 volume relative to CA3 and DG. Furthermore, a complimentary analysis of hippocampal shape was expected to reveal differences for surfaces corresponding to the affected subfields.

Our study demonstrates smaller volume in the L-CA1, L-CA3, and R-CA3 in patients with PTSD. Among the present findings, only L-CA1 had a nontrivial effect size, whereas L-CA3 and R-CA3 had very small effect sizes. While trauma exposure was significantly higher in the PTSD group than the trauma-exposed control group, we found no evidence to support that between-group differences in subfield volumes were correlated to severity of trauma exposure. We found an inverse correlation of the L-DG subfield with age in the combined group, and with L-CA1, and L-DG in the PTSD group, but this relationship was unaffected by PTSD diagnosis. No PTSD-associated differences in hippocampal shape were detected with vertex-based morphometry. Compared to previously published reports of hippocampal subfield volume in PTSD (Hayes et al., 2017) , our study used a sample size that is over Hippocampal subfields CA1-3 are altered by experimental stress in animal studies (Sapolsky, 2001 ) and consistent with human behavioral findings of the preferential impact of early life maltreatment stress in at-risk families (Morey, Haswell, Hooper, & De Bellis, 2015) . One consequence of this type of stress is corticosteroid-mediated impairment of learning and memory including the formation of false memories (Hayes et al., 2011) . The basolateral amygdala, which is critical to associative emotional learning, projects directly and indirectly through the EC to CA1 (Pikkarainen, R\u00f6nkk\u00f6, Savander, Insausti, & Pitk\u00e4nen, 1999) . Pavlovian fear conditioning increases synchronization of the basolateral amygdala with CA1 and facilitates consolidation of declarative memory. On the other hand, repeated exposure to acute restraint stress produced hypertrophy of spine density in the basolateral amygdala and increase in anxiety-like behavior in the mice, it resulted in long term depression and atrophy in CA1 (Oh, Hill, & Zito, 2013; Zhou, Homma, & Poo, 2004) . Preclinical research in rats has shown that the CA1 subfield is involved in context-specific memory retrieval after extinction (Ji & Maren, 2008) . Ventral CA1 is enriched in anxiety cells that are activated by anxiogenic environments and required for avoidance behavior in mice (Jimenez et al., 2018) . Amygdala-hippocampal interactions are important for both nondeclarative and declarative forms of emotional memory. Thus, our finding of lower CA1 volume in PTSD is consistent with the well-designed carefully controlled experiments in animals. In PTSD, the basolateral amygdala and the hippocampus function to control effects of emotion and arousal on consolidation of memories that include spatial or contextual cues about the environment (Roozendaal, McEwen, & Chattarji, 2009 ).\nTo interpret the left lateralization of the present CA1 findings in PTSD, we turn to evidence from humans to adequately consider the unique role of language and verbal memory, which are lateralized to the left hippocampus (Papanicolaou et al., 2002) . Kerchner and colleagues (2012) found that neuronal volume in CA1 alone was associated with for the present results show that previous studies conducted with a sample sizes of n = 36 (Wang et al., 2010) and n = 85 (Mueller et al., 2015) were underpowered. Although our findings recapitulate the ageassociated volume decrease in CA1, we did not find a significant interaction between aging and PTSD for CA3 volume as reported by Wang "}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "An important limitation in interpreting our finding of diminished CA1\nvolume is the lack of correlative behavioral measures of memory.\nLacking such data, only indirect and tenuous associations can be made between PTSD diagnosis and memory disturbance, which can be inferred from symptoms of recurrent intrusive trauma memories and trauma reliving, or by invoking prior reports that demonstrate PTSD is associated with disrupted fear memory (Garfinkel et al., 2014) .\nNonetheless, we feel that the outcome of the present study could generate future work to test these predictions.\nFreeSurfer v6.0 segmentation was qualitatively compared with manual segmentation on a publicly available dataset of high resolution T1/T2 images (Winterburn et al., 2013) and quantitatively compared with the ADNI dataset, which involved discriminating MCI and normally aging elderly subjects. FreeSurfer compares favorably to manual segmentation based on extensive testing of FreeSurfer v6.0 as described by Iglesias et al. (2015) .\nA notable limitation of the FreeSurfer 6.0 scheme for parcellation is that it depends heavily on a shape prior from an atlas composed of 15 ex vivo ultra-high resolution images acquired at 7 T and hence delineates structures that cannot be discerned visually on in vivo 1-mm isotropic images with sufficient clarity to accurately parcellate 12 subfields. This difference of approach is a concern because the algorithm sometimes relies on the shape priors for labeling rather than contrast information detected in the image being segmented . The lack of sufficient contrast features from the in vivo data makes robust QC a challenge even by the most expert manual rater.\nOur results lacked significant shape findings related to PTSD after applying the correction for multiple comparisons. While the corrections are applied to control Type 1 error, the procedure invariably comes at the cost of inflating Type II error. On the other hand, we imposed no correction on the volumetry results for CA1 because of a priori evidence implicating CA1 in PTSD, which eliminated any risk of Type II error. Thus, the first possible explanation relates to the application of multiple comparison correction in the shape analysis but no correction in the volumetry analysis of CA1. It does appear that the uncorrected shape results show differences in the area of CA1. The second explanation is that shape differences are just below the threshold that is deemed significant (e.g., P > 0.05). However, it is possible that the subthreshold vertex-based differences accumulate to produce a volume difference that is significantly different between groups. This is all the more likely given that the effect size of volume differences was small even for the CA1, which was the largest effect size among the subfields. The third possibility is simply some combination of the first two.\nA limitation is our use of three different scanners (two GE 3T and one Philips 3T). We have previously analyzed FreeSurfer v6.0 output from different scanners with evidence that scanner heterogeneity provides robust and consistent results for hippocampal segmentation (Logue et al., 2018) and hippocampal subfield segmentation (Whelan et al., 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Our results provide robust evidence of an association between smaller hippocampal L-CA1 volume and PTSD. Lower CA1 volume in PTSD is consistent with established research in mice that demonstrates atrophy in CA1 and increased anxiety-like behavior results from repeated exposure to acute stress.
