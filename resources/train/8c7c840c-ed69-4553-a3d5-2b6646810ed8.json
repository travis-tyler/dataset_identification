[{"section_title": "", "text": "Science Achievement Gaps by Gender and Race/Ethnicity in Elementary and Middle School:"}, {"section_title": "Trends and Predictors", "text": "Since the 1950s, leaders in education, science, politics, and business have stressed the need for \"scientific literacy\" among the U.S. general public (DeBoer, 2000) . Today, concern over scientific literacy is growing due to the increasing demand for graduates entering careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) (Association of American Universities, 2006) . In the coming decades, science occupations are predicted to grow faster than the average rate for all fields (Lacey & Wright, 2009) , and a significant amount of science and math training will be required for 9 of the 10 fastest growing occupations requiring a bachelor's degree or higher (Wang, 2013) . Statistics such as these led the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (2012) to call for a 33% increase in the number of STEM bachelor's degrees annually.\nDeveloping a more scientifically literate citizenry will require confronting the persistent gender and racial/ethnic gaps in science proficiency (National Center for Education Statistics, 2012a). These gaps have important implications for economic and technological advancement, as well as for social equity. Economists point out that meeting the increasing demand for science graduates will require that a greater share of females and racial/ethnic minorities are interested in, and qualified for, science careers (Muller, Stage, & Kinzie, 2001) . Sociologists emphasize that disparities in scientific understanding and science achievement exacerbate social stratification in today's high-tech global economy (Drew, 2011; Muller et al., 2001) , and that science achievement gaps foreshadow employment barriers for individuals seeking to enter fields offering high pay and prestige (Wang, 2013) .\nDespite the importance of monitoring and closing gender and racial/ethnic gaps in science achievement, researchers and policymakers tend to focus on math and literacy gaps.\nStudies that do examine science gaps often concern postsecondary education or high school, neglecting students' early foundational experiences. There is less research on how science gaps develop as students progress through elementary and middle school, and the extent to which individual background characteristics and contextual factors explain these gaps. Understanding when gaps emerge and what factors predict them are critical first steps toward developing appropriate education interventions and policies. In this paper, we contribute to the literature by analyzing science gaps in elementary and middle school using nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Why Study Science Test Score Gaps?", "text": "In the U.S., White males have traditionally dominated STEM occupations (Riegle-Crumb & King, 2010) (while our interest is in the sciences specifically, we discuss STEM broadly because STEM fields are often analyzed collectively in this literature). Researchers studying the \"STEM pipeline\" into these occupations have found that females are less likely than males to declare a STEM major in college, and little progress in this area has been made over the past 50 years (Riegle-Crumb & King, 2010) . While racial minorities are no less likely than White students to declare a STEM major, racial/ethnic gaps appear in STEM persistence during college (Chen & Weko, 2009; Griffith, 2010) . For example, in 2001, 15 .5% of Black students and 16.3% of Hispanic students who had entered a bachelor's program in STEM obtained a bachelor's degree in STEM, compared to 29.5% for White students and 31.2% for Asian students (Chen & Weko, 2009) . Gender gaps in STEM persistence appear in some datasets but not others (Chen & Weko, 2009; Griffith, 2010) .\nWhile a student's decision to pursue a career in the sciences is influenced by many factors -including cultural norms and stereotypes related to the field and the student's perceived value of scientific occupations (Eccles, 2007) -preparation and achievement in science play key roles (Wang, 2013) . Studies show that high school students' science background, achievement, and attitudes predict whether they will choose a STEM major in college (Riegle-Crumb, King, Grodsky, & Muller et al., 2012; Tai, Liu, & Fan, 2006; Wang, 2013) , and high school achievement and STEM preparation explain large portions of the racial/ethnic gaps in STEM major persistence in college (Griffith, 2010; Price, 2010) . However, much less is known about the trends and predictors of science achievement gaps before high school, when the \"leaky pipeline\" may begin."}, {"section_title": "Documenting and Explaining Gaps", "text": "Most of what we know about science gaps in elementary and middle school comes from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The NAEP-Long Term Trend, which is designed for examining achievement trends over time, included a science assessment from 1969 and 1999. Over those 30 years, there was little consistent progress in closing racial/ethnic or gender science gaps (Campbell, Hombo, & Mazzeo, 2000) . Today, national estimates of science test score gaps come from the Main NAEP, which differs from the NAEP-LTT in that its content is subject to change over time. Results from the 2011 Main NAEP (the most recent for which data are available) showed large eighth grade Black-White (-1.03 sd) and Hispanic-White (-.79 sd) science gaps, and somewhat smaller Asian/Pacific Islander-White (-.10 sd) and female-male (-.15 sd) gaps (Authors' calculations based on data from U.S. Department of Education, n.d.).\nWhen it comes to documenting and explaining test score gaps, however, NAEP data are limited in two important ways. First, the NAEP does not follow the same students over time, preventing an examination of how gaps change as students progress through elementary and middle school. Second, the NAEP does not link students to their past (or concurrent) achievement in other subjects, preventing an examination of how students' foundational math and reading skills may affect their later science learning. The ECLS-K is the only nationally representative study without these limitations.\nExplaining racial/ethnic gaps. Two of the most studied explanations for racial/ethnic gaps in student achievement are racial/ethnic differences in socioeconomic status (SES) and school quality. Students from higher SES backgrounds tend to outperform their lower-SES peers for several reasons. For instance, financial resources enable parents to access -among other things -stimulating learning materials and environments (Entwisle, Alexander, & Olson, 2000) and high quality health care, which promotes cognitive development in utero and in early childhood (Currie, 2005) . Educated parents also tend to use more complex language with their children, a behavior which predicts children's later academic success (Hart & Risley, 2003) .\nAs for school quality, Black and Hispanic students have less access (compared with White students) to school resources that promote science achievement (Jacob, 2007) . They are less likely to be taught by qualified science teachers, are less likely to have important science lab facilities and equipment, and tend to be exposed to less rigorous curricula (Banilower, Smith, Weiss, Malzahn, Campbell, & Weis, 2013; Oakes, Ormseth, Bell, & Camp, 1990; Ruby, 2006) .\nAdditionally, their teachers tend to place less emphasis on scientific inquiry and problem-solving and are less likely to use techniques that promote active student involvement (Oakes et al., 1990 ). This can be detrimental because hands-on learning and group activities inspire students' interest in science (Oakes et al., 1990) and may promote greater learning gains (NCES, 2012a; Stohr-Hunt, 1996) . Unequal access to these resources and experiences often occurs at the schoollevel through de facto segregation (Hanuskek & Rivkin, 2006) and at the classroom level due to inequitable student assignment practices and curricular tracking (Lankford, Loeb, & Wyckoff, 2002; Oakes et al., 1990) . This suggests that racial/ethnic science gaps among students from the same schools or the same classrooms may be narrower than gaps in the general population.\nStudents' science achievement is also partly a function of their math and reading skills (Snow, 2010) . Science classes often require that students perform mathematical calculations and read complex texts with academic language, high information density, and abstract ideas (Fang, 2006; Snow & Uccelli, 2008) . Thus, students with lower math and reading skills will be at a disadvantage in science class. Because racial/ethnic disparities in math and reading develop early on, also due in part to SES and school quality disparities (e.g. Quinn, 2015) , students' prior achievement in these subjects may help explain racial/ethnic science test score gaps."}, {"section_title": "Explaining gender gaps.", "text": "Unlike racial/ethnic test score gaps, gender gaps are unlikely to be explained by SES or school quality because SES and school quality do not differ systematically by gender. Gender gaps in science are more likely to be explained by cultural forces such as societal norms and stereotypes, which affect the encouragement that girls receive to pursue science and the messages they internalize about their potential in the field (Hill, Corbett, & Rose, 2010) . Because such forces also negatively affect girls' math achievement, prior math test scores are more likely to explain science gender gaps than are SES and school quality. Most of the research on explaining gender gaps in science has focused on explaining gaps in science course-taking or degree pursuit, however; less has been done on explaining gaps in science test scores (Eccles, 2007; Griffith, 2010; Ost, 2010; Price, 2010; Riegle-Crumb & Moore, 2014; Riegle-Crumb et al., 2012; Riegle-Crumb & King, 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Summary and Research Questions", "text": "Developing scientific literacy is an important goal for all students, and disparities in science achievement by gender and race/ethnicity are indicators of educational inequity that can foreshadow other inequities in adulthood. Research has shown that high school students' achievement in STEM predicts whether they will enter and persist in a STEM field in college, and high school STEM achievement helps to explain racial gaps in STEM persistence in college.\nThis raises questions about how young students' early experiences lay the foundation for these inequalities, yet little is known about how science gaps may develop as a cohort of students progresses through elementary and middle school, or the extent to which early science gaps may be explained by individual factors (such as student SES and prior math and reading achievement) and contextual factors that vary between school or within school. In this study, we address these school children's academic and social development. The ECLS-K drew a nationally representative sample of 21,409 kindergarteners from nearly 1,000 schools during the 1998-1999 school year and followed these students through eighth grade. Data collection included interviews with parents; surveys of principals, teachers, and students; and direct cognitive assessments of students in math and reading. In grades 3, 5, and 8, students also took science assessments (for more information on the ECLS-K, see Tourangeau, Nord, L\u00ea, Sorongon, & Najarian, [2009] ).\nDependent variable: Science achievement. Our outcome measure is students' scores on the ECLS-K standardized, multiple-choice science test. Assessment items, which were based on other large-scale studies such as the NAEP, covered three main areas: Earth and space science (Earth's structure and systems, Earth's place in the universe), physical science (matter, energy, and their transformations; the motion of light, sound, and physical objects), and life science (cells and their functions, organisms, diversity, and ecology) (Najarian, Pollack, & Sorongon, 2009 ). In order to avoid floor and ceiling effects, students took a set of routing items that determined the difficulty of the questions they would be asked. We use a standardized version of the theta test score metric, which was derived from a 3-parameter item response theory model. Theta reliabilities were .88, .87, and .84 for grades 3, 5, and 8, respectively. For more information on these assessments, see Najarian et al. (2009). 2 Question predictors. Our key predictors include a vector of gender and race/ethnicity indicator variables. Using non-Hispanic Whites as the omitted group, the race/ethnicity vector includes indicators for non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic (race specified or unspecified), Asian, and \"other race\" (due to the small sample sizes for Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and multi-racial, we combined these groups into a single category)."}, {"section_title": "Controls.", "text": "We use two sets of control variables to explain gaps in eighth grade science achievement. The first is a set of student background characteristics, including socioeconomic status (SES) and prior achievement. SES is operationalized as the average of three standardized components (mean 0, sd 1): log household income, parental education, and parental occupational prestige (see Tourangeau et al. [2009] for more information). As prior achievement measures, we include students' scores on the fifth grade ECLS-K math and reading assessments (standardized to mean 0 and sd 1; see Najarian et al. [2009] for more information on these assessments).\ngrades three, five, and eight (n=8721). Other sample restrictions applied to RQ2. In grade 8, approximately half of the sample had information collected about their science teacher, while the other half had information collected about their math teacher. Consequently, half of the students in the sample cannot be linked to an eighth grade science teacher and therefore cannot be included in the teacher or classroom fixed effects models. To stabilize the sample across models for RQ2, in all models we include only students who can be linked to a science teacher and who have non-missing outcome and control data (n= 3853). Results from models for RQ1 that apply the same sample restrictions as RQ2, and results from models for RQ2 that use all available data, are similar to the results reported here (see online Appendix A for these results as well as results from models that use multiple imputation)."}, {"section_title": "Analytic Strategy", "text": "To address our first research question, we fit the following general model (with separate models for each wave of data):\nThe outcome is student i's science theta score (where scores are standardized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 at each test wave). In Model 1, 1 represents the standardized mean gender gap in science (controlling for race/ethnicity). Coefficients 2 through 5 represent the standardized mean gaps between the named racial/ethnic group and non-Hispanic Whites (controlling for gender). To estimate gap changes, we subtract the grade 3 gap for a particular group from the grade 8 gap for that group (for additional methodological detail, including the formula for the standard error of the gap change, see online Appendix B).\nTo address our second research question, we fit taxonomies of regression models by adding to Model 1 the set of individual-level covariates and school-, teacher-, or classroom fixed effects. In these models, we use grade 8 science scores as the outcome because this is the end of the elementary/middle school science pipeline. In all models, we incorporate the appropriate longitudinal sample weights and adjust the standard errors to account for the complex sampling design used in the ECLS-K: 99.\n4"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Descriptive Statistics", "text": "In Table 1 , we present descriptive statistics for the grade 8 analytic sample used in RQ2\nby gender and race/ethnicity.

In Table 3 , we examined the extent to which science gaps in grade 8 could be explained by student SES and prior achievement. Column 1 shows the unadjusted science gaps as a reference (note that estimates differ slightly from those in Table 2 due to the sample restrictions described earlier). As expected, adding the SES composite in column 2 had little effect on the gender gap (-.16 to -.19), but the Black-White gap was reduced by almost 30% (from -1.16 to -.80) and the Hispanic-White gap was reduced by over half (-.66 to -.31). Conditional on SES, Asian students scored .17 sd higher than White students, on average."}, {"section_title": "<Table 3>", "text": "Column 3 of Table 3 displays grade 8 science gaps conditional on grade 5 math achievement. With an 2 of .60, this model demonstrates that prior math achievement explained more variation in science scores than did SES. Prior math achievement explained all of the gender gap in science scores (adjusted gap = -.03 sd, n.s.). The Black-White gap was substantially reduced after controlling for prior math scores, to -.51 sd. The Asian-White gap, which significantly favored Asian students when controlling for SES, reversed direction to significantly favor White students (-.14 sd) when controlling for prior math achievement.\nAs seen in column 4 of Table 3 , reading skills apparently influence science gaps differently from how math skills influence science gaps. Most strikingly, the gender gap conditional on prior reading achievement (-.24 sd) was larger than the unconditional gender gap in science. Prior reading achievement explained slightly less of the Black-White science gap than did prior math achievement (-.56 sd), but explained more of the Hispanic-White gap (-.27 sd) than did prior math achievement. While the Asian-White science gap conditional on math scores was significant favoring White students, the Asian-White gap conditional on reading scores was significant favoring Asian students (.15 sd).\nIn column 5, we condition on both prior math and reading scores. Here, the adjusted gender gap (-.14 sd) is similar to the unadjusted gender gap. Controlling for both math and reading yields conditional Black-White and Hispanic-White science gaps that are slightly narrower than the gaps seen when conditioning on either subject alone. In column 6, we add SES to the model, which explained very little additional outcome variation above and beyond prior math and reading, and only slightly reduced the Black-White and Hispanic-White gaps."}, {"section_title": "Fixed effects.", "text": "In Table 4 , we examined the extent to which gaps persisted after controlling for school, science teacher, or science classroom. Columns 1 through 3 control for fixed effects of school, teacher, and classroom, respectively; columns 4 through 6 repeat these models while also controlling for the full set of individual control variables. With an adjusted 2 of .50, column 1 shows that schools explain a substantial amount of variation in science scores (approximately 30 percentage points more than race/ethnicity and gender alone). As expected, the gender science gap within schools was similar to the gender gap overall (-.18 sd). The magnitude of the mean within-school Black-White gap (-.71 sd) was approximately 60% of the overall Black-White gap and the within-school Hispanic-White gap (-.22 sd) was not statistically significant (though note the small sample size) 6 . Controlling for science teacher and classroom fixed effects (columns 2 and 3, respectively), the Hispanic-White gap remained non-significant.\nTeacher fixed effects had only a small effect on the Black-White gap, but classroom fixed effects reduced this gap to -.51. Teacher and classroom fixed effects explained much of the variation in science scores, with an adjusted 2 of .63 for the teacher fixed effects model and an adjusted 2 of .70 for the classroom fixed effects model. As discussed below, some of this explanatory power is likely due to the intentional assignment of students to achievement tracks."}, {"section_title": "<Table 4>", "text": "In columns 4 through 6 of Table 4 , we present school, teacher, and classroom fixed effects models that also adjust for the individual control variables.

The gender gap was also not statistically significant, though the significance is sensitive to modeling strategy. 7 Column 6 shows that a model with classroom fixed effects and all individual controls explains most of the variation in science achievement, with an adjusted 2 of .83."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study, we sought to: 1) describe national trends in science test score gaps by gender and race/ethnicity from Grade 3 to Grade 8, and 2) determine the extent to which Grade 8 science gaps could be explained by SES, prior achievement, and differences in school-, teacher-, (Robinson & Lubienski, 2011) .\nWith our parsimonious set of controls, all eighth grade science gaps were greatly reduced and no longer statistically significant. The gender gap in science appears to be closely related to the gender gap in math, as fifth grade math achievement explains the entire eighth grade femalemale science gap. Prior math and reading achievement, SES, and classroom fixed effects together reduce the gender gap, the Black-White gap, and the Hispanic-White gap to nonsignificance in grade 8 (though again, the significance of the gender gap is sensitive to modelling approach)."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Before turning to a discussion of these findings, we note some limitations of the study.\nFirst, as with most longitudinal studies, the ECLS-K experienced high levels of attrition.\nAlthough the longitudinal sampling weights are designed to adjust for attrition, such adjustment is not perfect and bias can still appear. If science gaps among attriters differed compared to science gaps among those who remained in the study, the gaps estimated here may be biased.\nSimilarly, if the relationships among the covariates and science scores differed among attriters compared to non-attriters, our estimates of adjusted gaps may be biased. Secondly, although the ECLS-K offers the best data available for answering this study's research questions, the students in this sample were eighth graders in 2007, and may not be representative of eighth graders today. Finally, as is always the case with observational studies such as this, the possibility of omitted variables bias prevents us from interpreting parameter estimates causally. Scholars have previously established sound theory describing how students' math and literacy skills may affect their science learning (Fang, 2011; Snow, 2010; Snow & Uccelli, 2008) . Our analyses offer the first empirical estimates of the extent to which math and reading skills explain later science gaps in a nationally representative sample. While we cannot infer that closing fifth grade math and reading gaps would result in subsequent narrowing of the eighth grade science gaps of the magnitudes seen in these models, the fact that math and reading scores behave differently in explaining various gaps suggests that these variables' explanatory power may derive from more than just their covariance with general cognitive skills. Future research should explore this area more fully. Additionally, our results show that while math and/or reading skills help explain large portions of the science gaps, meaningful Black-White and Hispanic-White gaps remain after controlling for math and reading. Gaps in science achievement should therefore be investigated separately from math and reading gaps, as they appear to have distinct influences. Some of these separate causes likely relate to subject matterspecific inequities at the school-and classroom-levels."}, {"section_title": "Explaining", "text": "School and classroom effects. The results of our school, teacher, and classroom fixed effects models are consistent with past research demonstrating that, compared to White students, Black and Hispanic students tend to experience less rigorous and engaging science curricula and have access to fewer or lower quality science facilities and less-qualified teachers (Banilower et al., 2013; Jacob, 2007; Oakes et al., 1990) . For Hispanic students, school-level variables appear to play an important role in science gaps; while White students scored .19 sd higher than Hispanic students with similar SES and prior achievement (column 6 of Table 3 ), this gap switched direction and lost statistical significance when school fixed effects were added to the model (column 4 of Table 4 ).\nClassroom-level variables may be relatively more important in shaping the Black-White science gap. School fixed effects reduced the Black-White gap by only .10 sd (when added to a model conditioning on SES and prior achievement), and the adjusted within-school Black-White gap remained statistically significant. In contrast, classroom fixed effects reduced the adjusted Black-White gap such that the gap was statistically indistinguishable from zero. This classroom effect is consistent with a situation in which White students tend to receive higher quality instruction than Black students who attend the same school. However, if students were assigned to eighth grade science classrooms based on their prior science achievement, part of the observed classroom effect will be due to this sorting process (it is also worth noting that a sizeable BlackWhite science gap still exists within classrooms in models that do not control for SES and prior achievement). At the very least, these results demonstrate that more could be done to equalize the science achievement of Black and White students within schools."}, {"section_title": "Unmeasured psychological factors. Past research points to additional factors", "text": "influencing test score gaps that we were unable to examine in the ECLS-K data. For example, stereotypes of Black and Hispanic students as low-achievers, and of females as being less suited for science than males, are well documented (Hill et al., 2010; Nguyen & Ryan, 2008) . These stereotypes can affect observed science test score gaps through various channels, including stereotype threat, whereby scores of students from stereotyped groups are temporarily depressed through the activation of stereotypes prior to test-taking (Nguyen & Ryan, 2008) . Stereotypes can also lower students' motivation to learn science, either because they wish not to enter a field in which, according to stereotypes, members of their racial/ethnic group or gender do not belong, or because they have internalized these biases themselves (Hill et al., 2010) . Such damage to students' self-efficacy can cause them to give up on scientific endeavors more easily and can prevent them from pursuing experiences from which they would develop skills in science (Hill et al., 2010) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The urgency of developing a scientifically literate citizenry stems from the demands of living in a high-tech and global economy (DeBoer, 2000; Muller et al., 2001) , and science achievement gaps raise concerns about equity, efficiency, and the nation's future. In this study, we found that science gaps by gender and race/ethnicity tended to remain stable or narrow as students progressed through elementary and middle school. However, the overall sizes of these unadjusted gaps were often larger than gaps in mathematics and reading. Our findings indicate that the \"leaky\" science pipeline may begin as early as third grade, suggesting that interventions aimed at closing gaps should begin when students are young. The results of our explanatory analyses point to areas of potentially fruitful future research on the causal roles that prior math and reading skills, school quality, teacher quality, and curriculum may play in expanding or closing science achievement gaps. Such research could eventually result in an understanding of the malleable factors that can be manipulated so as to equalize opportunity within the scientific fields.\nWhile this study was motivated in part by the fact that students' early preparation in science predicts their attainment of a science bachelor's degree, we close with a reminder that inequities persist beyond degree attainment and entry into a scientific occupation. For example, White chemists earn higher pay than Black or Hispanic chemists; for Hispanics, the pay gap seems to be explained by training, and for Blacks the gap appears to be due to discrimination (Broyles & Fenner, 2010) . Gender pay gaps also exist in STEM fields, and people tend to hold negative opinions of women who enter what are perceived to be masculine occupations, such as those in STEM fields (Hill et al., 2010) . Women in these jobs must therefore out-perform their male colleagues in order to be judged equally competent (Hill et al., 2010) . Eliminating science test score gaps and improving rates of STEM entry and persistence therefore cannot be the final goals; efforts directed towards these outcomes must also be accompanied by efforts to correct inequities in the STEM workforce itself.\nand reading skills affect students' ability to develop and express understanding of grade 8 science objectives. In supplementary analyses, we replaced grade 5 scores with grade 1 scores;\nas expected, grade 1 math and reading scores help to explain science gaps in grade 8, but not to the same extent as do grade 5 scores. 4 In models estimating gaps changes, we use weight C567CW0. In models explaining grade 8 gaps, we use weight C67PW0. We incorporate strata and PSU variables through the svy command suite in Stata; in models with school, teacher, or classroom fixed effects, we use the sampling weight with robust standard errors.\n5 Results that adjust gap changes for the differing theta reliabilities at each time point yield similar results. 6 Note that the school fixed effect model does not imply that closing the mean within-school gap would result in a proportional closure of the overall gap in the population (see Hanushek and Rivkin, 2006) . 7 The adjusted within-classroom gender gap is significant (with nearly identical magnitude) when indicators for all groups are used, as opposed to the \"other race\" indicator.\n8 Overall, models using grade 5 science scores as the outcome show similar patterns of results as those seen in Table 4 . In grade 3, prior math scores and teacher fixed effects explain somewhat less of the gaps compared to later grades. "}]
