Weiner, MD. The goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can measure progression to MCI and early AD. Next to the primary analyses in ADNI, we selected from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC) all MCI reverters with follow-up after reversion.

Follow-up after reversion seemed slightly shorter for stable MCI reverters (p = 0.11). Repeating analyses including this covariate did not essentially change the results (table e-1, doi.org/10.5061/dryad. 04n8502).\nPost hoc analyses further showed that biomarkers of MCI reverters were on average more similar to NC than nonreverting MCI, except for amyloid, which was more often abnormal in MCI reverters than in NC (table e-2, doi.org/10. 5061/dryad.04n8502). Still, MCI reverters showed higher clinical progression rates (110/1,000 person-years) compared to baseline NC (52/1,000 person-years, hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 2.3 [1.4-4.0], p = 0.002) (table e-3 and figure e-1, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.04n8502).

MCI reverters showed higher clinical progression rates than NC individuals, which is in line with previous reports.\n1,4 MCI reverters with subsequent decline had an increased amyloid PET burden and CSF tau compared to reverters remaining normal. Between amyloid markers, amyloid PET showed a significant association with the subsequent decline group in MCI reverters, while this association was significant for CSF A\u03b2 in NC. Although previous research suggests that CSF amyloid becomes abnormal before PET, 17, 18 the findings are in line with other reports that this may not apply to all individuals, 19, 20 which contributes to the notion that CSF A\u03b2 1-42 and amyloid PET may represent different AD-related processes.\nAn outstanding question is why individuals with underlying AD temporarily improved. Our results suggest that at baseline, MCI reverters were more similar to NC than nonreverting MCI. Furthermore, biomarker values associated with subsequent decline were similar for reverting MCI and NC, while cognitive measures were less consistent. Possibly, reverters with decline received an MCI diagnosis very early in their clinical disease course, as their biomarker profiles were like the nonreverting MCI. A modest improvement, for example, due to learning effects, resolving of (subthreshold) depressive symptoms, or measurement error, may have contributed to reclassification as normal. Here we observed that when AD is present, such improvement is often not lasting. "}, {"section_title": "Continued", "text": "Furthermore, it remains unclear as to why individuals who reverted and remained NC over time were initially diagnosed with MCI. Aside neurodegenerative diseases, depressive symptoms are a common cause of MCI. Low depressive symptoms scores in ADNI reflect inclusion criteria. In the ADC, subthreshold depression was more common. Another possibility is that distress or insecurity led to a suboptimal performance. The question remains how to deal with the classification of these individuals in the context of AD progression research, when MCI is often regarded as an intermediate disease stage. A practical implementation could be to classify reverting MCI with normal biomarkers as NC. Alternatively, including stability of the diagnosis in the classification has been suggested. 4 A limitation of this study is the relatively short follow-up time, and so we cannot exclude the possibility that some individuals in the stable group may progress again. Compared to populationbased studies, reversion rates in both cohorts were low. 3 Possibly, this reflects that clinicians will not easily reverse a known diagnosis. Reversion rates may even be lower, because we based reversion rates on individuals with MCI who met our inclusion criteria. Individuals with MCI excluded from these analyses as they were lost to follow-up were somewhat older and more cognitively impaired, which are characteristics that associate with decline 1 (table e-5, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.04n8502). Although further replication in large population-based studies is necessary, our results suggest that AD biomarkers aid in the prognosis of MCI reverters, and could help to identify those with a good short term prognosis and those likely to decline again in the longer term."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgment", "text": "The authors thank the participants and patients for their contributions, as well as staff involved at ADNI and the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort for data collection and data sharing.
