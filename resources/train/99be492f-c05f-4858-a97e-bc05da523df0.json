Due to the enormous attention given to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for the past couple of decades, recently found blood-based AD biomarkers like CLU have not yet been reported for biosensors. Herein, we report the electrochemical detection of CLU for the first time using a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) modified with 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pyr-NHS) and decorated with specific anti-CLU antibody fragments. This bifunctional linker molecule contains succinylimide ester to bind protein at one end while its pyrene moiety attaches to the carbon surface by means of \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. Cyclic voltammetric and square wave voltammetric studies showed the limit of detection down to 1 pg/mL and a linear concentration range of 1-100 pg/mL with good sensitivity. Detection of CLU in spiked human plasma was demonstrated with satisfactory recovery percentages to that of the calibration data. The proposed method facilitates the cost-effective and viable production of label-free point-of-care devices for the clinical diagnosis of AD."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Clusterin (CLU), also known as Apolipoprotein J (Apo J, a highly conserved heterodimeric glycoprotein with molecular weight of 75-80 kDa), has attracted significant scientific attention as it is involved in lipid export during cell differentiation and cell death [1] and can stabilize stressed proteins in a refolding-competent state [2] . It is also implicated in aging and age-related diseases such as neurodegeneration, diabetes, and atherosclerosis [3] [4] [5] , and acts as a biomarker of cellular senescence and oxidative stress [6] . CLU content in the plasma is found to be associated with atrophy of the entorhinal cortex, baseline disease severity, and rapid clinical progression in Alzheimer's disease (AD) [7] . It is also found in longitudinal brain atrophy in mild cognitive impairment [8] . In addition, CLU gene variants in association with amyloidogenic peptides and CLU contributes to limit amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) species misfolding and facilitates their clearance from the extracellular space [9] .\nTo date, most biomarker studies on AD have focused on the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasma levels of \u03b2-amyloid, tau, and phosphorylated tau in relation to clinical symptoms and survival as diagnostic specimens [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, prominent companies and research groups are now realizing that the simplistic amyloid cascade hypothesis that was reasonable to propose 26 years Herein, we report for the first time an electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of CLU. A simple, low-cost biosensor was developed by modifying the carbon electrode with 1-pyrenebutyric acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Pyr-NHS) and immobilizing F(ab') 2 fragments of CLU antibody to detect CLU antigen specifically. The Pyr-NHS linker utilizes a bifunctional molecule containing succinylimide ester and a pyrene moiety to bind proteins to the carbon surface. Pyrene attaches to the carbon surface by means of the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking or hydrophobic interactions and does not significantly disturb the electronic structure of the screen-printed carbon working electrode. F(ab') 2 fragments of an antibody possess some advantages over whole antibody in terms of close proximity to the surface (within Debye length limit) [30] , higher structural stability [31] , improved detection limit [32] , and additionally reduce non-specific binding from Fc interaction. Wasowicz et al. showed that the Fab' oriented immobilization for the detection of protein improves the detection limit in comparison to an immunosensor incorporating the whole IgG antibody [32, 33] . Jarocka et al. also presented similar results in their study in addition to a comparative study from earlier reports [34, 35] . In our study, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square wave voltammetry (SWV) measurements were used to monitor the generation of each sensing layer and detection efficiency of CLU antigen in the presence of a [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3\u2212/4\u2212 redox system. The obtained results show the successful development of an electrochemical biosensor with good selectivity and sensitivity to detect CLU. Compared to other assays, label-free electrochemical biosensors offer great promise as a robust tool for rapid, sensitive, cost-effective analysis towards a truly disposable tool for screening of AD patients, and can be promoted for point-of-care (POC) application."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Chemicals", "text": "Pyr-NHS, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) tablet, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), potassium ferrocyanide (K 4 Fe(CN) 6 ), potassium ferricyanide (K 3 Fe(CN) 6 ), potassium chloride (KCl), ethanolamine, human plasma, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) at biochemical grade were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Dorset, UK); 100 \u00b5g CLU peptide (ab45815) and 1 mL of 0.02 mg/mL complementary anti-CLU (ab39991) in PBS buffer were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) and the prepared aliquots were stored at \u221220 \u2022 C.

These results confirm the selectivity of the fabricated biosensor to detect CLU protein. To test the analytical applicability of the proposed method, human plasma sample (reconstituted from lyophilized plasma, Sigma-Aldrich p9523, Dorset, UK) serving as blank was spiked with CLU antigen in two different concentrations: 10 pg mL \u22121 and 100 pg mL \u22121 . This was performed in triplicate, and only by following SWV data. The recoveries obtained were 62.60% and 77.70%, respectively, to that of the calibration data ( Table 2) .

For pg mL \u22121 concentration level, these recovery percentages are expected [48] . Overall, the results were found accurate in close-to-real conditions and validate the analytical applicability of the proposed method. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The present work reports a proof-of-principle electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of CLU on SPCEs for the first time. This platform-which is based on modified screen-printed electrodes-is a low-cost and robust detection platform. The immunosensor shows broad detection range (1~100 pg mL \u22121 ), high sensitivity (0.013 \u00b5A pg \u22121 mL \u22121 ), and selectivity to CLU. Additionally, the detection limit (1 pg mL \u22121 ) is very low compared to the average concentration of CLU found in AD patients (~2.50 \u00b5g mL \u22121 according to ADNI database). The detection of protein in spiked plasma was demonstrated, and satisfactory recovery percentages of 62.60% and 77.70% for 10 pg mL \u22121 and 100 pg mL \u22121 concentrations were obtained, respectively, to that of the calibration data. Related to AD biomarkers in blood, the possibility of measuring a group or panel of different proteins is a desirable objective to provide faster and more accurate diagnostics. Simultaneous detection of the possible AD biomarkers in blood such as complement factor H, \u03b1-2-macroglobuline, apolipoprotein E, pancreatic polypeptide, and clusterin would be necessary on a multiplexed electrochemical immunosensor platform. However, additional efforts are necessary for the simultaneous detection of biomarkers, since each protein type might have high differences in threshold levels and would vary in their detection sensitivity levels [49] . Along with this electrochemical system, paper-based and amperometry-based microfluidic methods would provide the advantages of working on small volumes, with short assay period, high sensitivity, and accelerated kinetic processes [50] [51] [52] . Finally, the obtained results should facilitate the application of these antibody-functionalized SPCE surface modifications for biosensing and the development of a promising platform for clinical diagnosis in the future."}]
