[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract-Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has recently witnessed a great deal of activity focused on developing new statistical learning tools for automated inference using imaging data. The workhorse for many of these techniques is the support vector machine (SVM) framework (or more generally kernel-based methods). Most of these require, as a first step, specification of a kernel matrix between input examples (i.e., images). The inner product between images and in a feature space can generally be written in closed form and so it is convenient to treat as \"given.\" However, in certain neuroimaging applications such an assumption becomes problematic. As an example, it is rather challenging to provide a scalar measure of similarity between two instances of highly attributed data such as cortical thickness measures on cortical surfaces. Note that cortical thickness is known to be discriminative for neurological disorders, so leveraging such information in an inference framework, especially within a multi-modal method, is potentially advantageous. But despite being clinically meaningful, relatively few works have successfully exploited this measure for classification or regression. Motivated by these applications, our paper presents novel techniques to compute similarity matrices for such topologically-based attributed data. Our ideas leverage recent developments to characterize signals (e.g., cortical thickness) motivated by the persistence of their topological features, leading to a scheme for simple constructions of kernel matrices.

INTRODUCTION", "text": "A LZHEIMER'S disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. Early clinical diagnosis is challenging because AD-specific changes begin years before the patient becomes symptomatic [1] - [5] . Therefore, a major focus is to identify such changes at the earliest possible stage by leveraging neuroimaging data [6] . One specific interest is to go beyond group analysis (i.e., between clinically different groups), rather to \"learn\" patterns characteristic of neurodegeneration using machine learning (ML) methods. Of course, AD is just one potential application and image-based machine learning methods are applicable to a variety of neuroimaging problems.\nStatistical machine learning methods provide means for learning a hypothesis (or concept) from a set of training examples. In the context of a specific disorder (e.g., AD), the training data is given as a set comprised of both diseased and control subjects and our objective is to learn a pattern in such examples to help predict the target variables for new \"test\" cases. Some work in the last few years has focused on making use of a popular machine learning algorithm called support vector machine (SVM) learning for inference problems, such as classification, regression, etc. A main focus of recent efforts has been directed towards classification of AD and control subjects in the hope that this will lead to earlier predictions of which subjects will go on to develop AD. Beyond the classification domain, however, there are other significant scientific questions which may be addressed via kernel methods, e.g., analyzing subtle interactions between biological or psychological measures and brain topology. We provide a brief review of these strategies next to highlight their key advantages and limitations, especially in the context of the data types (and the inference problems) of interest in this paper. The review will not only help establish the discriminative power of imaging data (especially cortical thickness), but highlight the growing consensus towards the design of automated tools, so as to use other markers of histological changes (plaques, tangles, etc.) in a disease's presymptomatic phases by adapting extensions of ML algorithms.\nU.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright."}, {"section_title": "A. Related Work", "text": "The need to represent, manipulate and analyze complex brain data has led to a set of novel techniques for brain surface parameterization. These algorithms provide a smooth functional representation of the complex inherent geometries of brain surfaces [7] - [9] and have successfully been applied to discover disease-specific regions in group analysis [10] . On the other hand, a number of recent efforts have focused on utilizing domain knowledge. For instance, in [11] , the authors exploited the fact that the hippocampal volume was atrophic in AD and reported 82%-95% classification accuracy on a data set of 39 subjects (19 AD, 20 controls) . Numerous MR imaging-driven volumetric studies have used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) [12] to perform disease specific statistical analysis using clinically relevant measures at the voxel level (such as gray matter density [13] ) and show differences in regional gray matter loss between the two groups [14] . However, [15] - [17] have independently shown that classification models that depend on voxel-by-voxel evaluation of the neurological data require extensive feature reduction either by recursive elimination [18] or by manipulating the weights learned by a linear SVM [16] . Kl\u00f6ppel et al. [16] achieved 95% accuracy on a data set of 90 subjects (33 AD, 57 controls). Likewise, classification performance of methods based on PCA [19] , [20] show a dependence on selection criteria of principal components of the dataset, while [21] proposes that improvements in accuracy can be obtained via a spatial regularization (Markovian interaction between voxels) and reported an increased classification accuracy of 82% on a subset of 183 subjects from ADNI. While feature selection (or dimensionality reduction) is extensively used, it involves a careful selection of parameters to preserve the important components of the signal. Also, the performance must not be too dependent on the sample size and the number of features must remain stable across datasets [22] . Nonetheless, the above papers demonstrate that good classification accuracy on certain types of neuroimaging data can be obtained via novel preprocessing or by incorporating additional domain specific modifications in the learning algorithm. Next, we make the case that the above techniques are not easily extensible to a class of (clinically interesting) neuroimaging data for many inference tasks and new methods are needed to exploit the discriminative components of the signal.\nRecent evidence suggests that neurological measures defined on cortical surfaces, such as cortical thickness values [23] - [27] are a clinically meaningful measure of the underlying brain morphology and a reliable measure of gray matter atrophy [28] , [29] , but are not yet fully utilized for automated inference in the context of AD. To address this problem, we focus on methods for extraction and precise characterization of important topological features for such data-with cortical thickness values as an example, we design new methods for \"kernelizing\" signals defined on cortical surfaces. Using characterizations inspired from the \"persistence\" of topological surface features, we present a framework for construction of affinity (or weight) matrices between subjects' distributions of cortical thickness (or other measures 1 ), each defined on surfaces. This permits using such data systematically within any off-the-shelf statistical toolbox, without manual parameter or feature selection. The construction of similarity measures based on a topological signal such as cortical thickness allows the inclusion of topological data along with other biomarkers in predictive models. The inclusion of such highly independent covariates offers the potential to aid machine learning methods that operate with ROI measures, gray matter maps, and so on, by providing additional information which is not detected by other feature extraction methods. Note that our goal is not to argue that cortical thickness is better than existing features, rather, the machinery developed here presents methods to construct representations for such data which may then be used in conjuction with other features of choice. Indeed, since cortical thickness is a clinical measure, its relevance will be different in different application scenarios. Finally, the proposed algorithm achieves a general purpose characterization of any topology-based signal in a mathematically elegant framework-which is in fact the primary focus of the proposed method.\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows. 1) We give topology-based kernel construction algorithm for measures defined on cortical surfaces. 2) On a dataset of AD and control subjects (ADNI), we investigate the effectiveness of proposed characterization in group level studies, standard regression and classification. This avoids the difficulties of extensive preprocessing and regularization, as when using standard ML tools. In an additional set of experiments with standard ROI-based features, we evaluate the utility of proposed topology-based features. 3) We provide an implementation for performing inference (classification, regression, linear models, and so on) on complex data such as signal defined on cortical surfaces. The goal of this work is neither to assert that cortical thickness is the best discriminator of AD, nor to claim that the proposed method is the best mechanism for classification purposes. Rather, it is a general purpose nonparametric method for constructing similarity measures on topological signals which can be included in multi-modal or multi-variate models to boost the signal of interest."}, {"section_title": "II. MAIN IDEAS", "text": "In the following section, we draw an outline for the motivation behind our method in the context of AD-related statistical inference. We will present the complete formulation of topology-based kernel construction using cortical thickness signal in the next section.\nIn the context of Alzheimer's disease as well as other disorders [30] - [32] , numerous findings confirm fundamental differences in the patterns of cortical volume loss and regard cortical atrophy a useful biomarker for AD [10] , [33] . Cortical thinning leads to localized changes in the spatial distribution of gray matter and hence a geometric realization of topological measures on the cortex can induce separability between diseased and healthy brains. The goal is to use such clinical signals to derive similarity measures. Because cortical thickness is a highly attributed marker, most of the existing models have used this anatomically relevant aspect of disease progression in a generative setting by assuming co-registered surfaces and by performing statistical tests to evaluate the discriminative power of each feature, where the feature vector's dimensionality equals the number of cortical surface vertices and the thickness values at the vertices give the magnitude of each corresponding entry. One may then calculate inter-subject distances (or similarities) in terms of geometric distances based on top discriminative features (or inner products), which may then be fed into a standard SVM procedure. Notice the two major difficulties with this approach. First, we must account for the mismatch between the training set size and the dimensionality of the distribution via feature reduction [19] , [22] or introduction of bias [21] . Second, during the reconstruction step of cortical thickness using automated software tools, point-wise correspondence of mesh topology among the training subjects may be unavailable. This will lead to different number of vertices at different coordinates for different subjects. One approach to this problem is to try mapping cortical thickness onto a sphere with a fixed number of vertices, re-sample and interpolate the cortical thickness measure for each subject so as to allow a direct point-wise comparison. However, the procedure not only attenuates vertex-wise signal but also ignores the higher order interactions between subsets of vertices that vary between the two groups. Also neurodegeneration is an exclusive event and exact locations (coordinates of affected vertices) also vary among the population, obscuring the statistical concept under study. More importantly, in the context of cortical thickness, vertex-wise thickness values may be less relevant-in some settings separability between classes likely comes from variation between topological features (comprised of more than one vertex). In other words, subtle losses of gray matter may affect the shape or topology or cortical surfaces before they significantly affect the thickness measures 2 . A naive alternative is to look at all possible groups of vertices and evaluate the significance of their variation, which is clearly intractable. Our approach below seeks to characterize brain images by deriving a representation of \"groups\" of vertices on each individual cortex. Briefly, we determine whether a localized region in the brain exhibits any gray matter atrophy via construction of a simplex on critical points-which provide information on the global topology.\nOur method is based on topological persistence of brain measurements defined on cortical surfaces. Within the framework of signal filtration, if one considers the cortex as a complex then the spatial properties of cortical thickness can be represented as the history of a growing complex using notions of \"birth and death\" of homological classes. It is reasonable to expect that inferences based on such topological changes which occur during the growth either as critical points or noise as a function of their lifetime, will capture the differences between clinically different groups well on a global level. Our algorithm seeks to characterize such changes to derive a precise representation of the topological features on the signal. Once such a representation is obtained, we can easily construct similarity measures (kernels) and leverage emerging ML tools (e.g., MKL) for inclusion in statistical inferences."}, {"section_title": "ALGORITHM", "text": "Summary: Let us denote the set of cortical data in the training set as with known target variables , where (or ) in a classification (or regression) setting.\ncomprises the cortical data of both AD and control groups. The original signal defined on the cortical surface is noisy and it is necessary to estimate the unknown signal to increase signal-to-noise ratio and smoothness of the signal for subsequent analysis. This is achieved via image smoothing over . Making use of the mean signal is not ideal for constructing similarity matrices which promote separability, due to signal attenuation. Such a process will make it rather difficult to identify subtle, but clinically relevant variations. Further, substantial overlap in the class distributions confounds inference. In contrast, our proposed method is motivated by the topological characterization of the signal which makes no assumption on point-wise correspondences of cortical measure on a naturally formed spherical atlas. Hence, no assumption is made regarding a specific preprocessing tool for extraction, allowing the proposed framework to handle disparities among spherical atlases of individual subjects (generated by some preprocessing tool of choice). As a result, the collection of critical points on the mean signal is adequate to characterize the topology of the signal. By pairing the critical points in a nonlinear fashion, we construct scatter plot for each image, which encodes the topological properties of the input signal. The concentration maps of such scatter plots are then used to learn the disease patterns by employing off-the-shelf ML toolbox. We now present details of the algorithm in the following subsections."}, {"section_title": "A. Heat Kernel Smoothing", "text": "Existing methods model the cortical measurement as signal plus noise:\n, where is the signal and is noise. In the following analysis, is the cortical thickness mapped onto a spherical surface, i.e., as shown in Fig. 1 (right) .\nWe used heat kernel smoothing to estimate the signal [7] , [34] . The heat kernel is essentially Green's function of the isotropic diffusion equation [34] . The solution of which with the following initial conditions provides the heat kernel as (1) where is the eigenvalue and are eigenfunctions of the operator known as spherical harmonics. Spherical diffusion of a given functional measurement i.e., a smooth estimate of denoted as is written as a convolution: . The finite estimate of the continuous convolution is called the weighted Fourier series (WFS) (2) where is the Fourier coefficient. This is a more flexible spectral approach that explicitly represents the solution to the diffusion equation analytically.\nIn principle, series approximation of smoother cortical signal improves by increasing the number of coefficients in the summation. The optimal choice of the degree is useful to save computational time, Fig. 2 (top row) shows the finite expansion approximation of the cortical thickness shown in Fig. 1 as the degree increases from to (bandwidth ). The spatial smoothness of the thickness is controlled by . Fig. 2 (bottom row) shows the thickness data as varies in the range . The goal is to estimate the signal using WFS to suppress noise. An optimal selection of is required to avoid over-fitting and not to lose the discriminative features during smoothing step. We used and corresponding degree in our experiments based on [7] ."}, {"section_title": "B. Scatter Plots of Persistence", "text": "We will characterize the signal in terms of its critical points and the sublevel sets. The sublevel sets of a signal are defined as where is the signal (i.e., the corresponding cortical thickness measure) and is its inverse. In other words, a sublevel set is the set of all points for which . Observe that critical points of the signal (i.e., local minima and maxima) provide information about local variations in signal. But we are interested in points which preserve information about the connected regions of its sublevel sets. We can define the time-point (thickness value) at which a critical point will be \"visited\" in a filtration of the signal [35] . As we increase , the critical points of the signal are visited (in order) and homology of changes (with ) i.e., signal value is critical if the rank of homology groups of sublevel set change by visiting , i.e., if a homology class is born (or dies) by visiting . Clearly, the critical points are markers of the creation and deletion of connected components in the sublevel sets, with increasing values of the filtration. More importantly, unique pairings of these critical points are sufficient to identify each topological feature in the signal. Our pairing rule is defined using persistence of critical points [36] , [37] and is formulated as follows.\nConsider an ordered set of all critical points of (i.e., cortical thickness), . This defines a sequence of connected components and a corresponding sequence of homology groups. Our aim is to store the history of homological changes within this sequence i.e., a history of homology classes. A class is born at if it did not exist in sublevel sets such that where . A class dies entering if it existed in sublevel sets such that but did not exist in sublevel sets with filtration value in subset . Now we can represent the \"life duration\" of a class born at and dies at by pairing the critical points . Furthermore, we can present the history of each class by drawing these pairs of critical points in 2-D plane \"scatter plot.\" The construction of a scatter plot for an arbitrary 1-D function is illustrated in Fig. 3 . To facilitate the construction of scatter plots using cortical thickness for each subject, we first calculated critical points of the cortical thickness. Critical points in this setting are defined as those points where the cortical thickness is maximum/minimum relative to its immediate neighbors. We used Delaunay triangulation [38] to generate a simplical complex of critical points. The signal value was used to define the \"filtration\" on the complex. We used publicly available software [39] to calculate the persistent homology in degree-0 for each subject. The procedure essentially provides a unique pairing of critical points which preserve the information of connected regions as discussed above. That is, preserving only the paired critical points (birth-death pairs) and the corresponding filtration step at which they were visited i.e., thickness values. This procedure yields a collection of topological feature descriptors (i.e., connected regions of a sublevel set) for each subject which can be represented as a scatter plot (also known as a plot of Betti intervals). In the scatter plot representation, each feature is described in terms of its birth and death \"time,\" i.e., the filtration values of the paired critical points. Now, by comparing the scatter plots of such paired values, we can establish the desired similarity measure between subjects.\nWe construct a concentration map from the scatter plot by using kernel density estimation (KDE); we estimate the distribution of pairs on a uniform grid. Vectorization of the concentration map provides a probability distribution function (PDF) for each subject. This is PDF of the scatter plot and does not directly tie to the high and low thickness values. By choice of a suitable KDE similarity measure, we can now compute similarity inter-subject measures, that will give a positive semi-definite (PSD) kernel matrix; where entries are the similarity between these PDFs. If the topology of cortical thickness is discriminative then many of these cortical topology measures will show a variation (between AD and controls) resulting in measurable group differences in the clinical populations in terms of their critical point pairings. Observe that with the similarity measure and kernels constructed above, the application of kernel regression or classification (also, group analysis) on this data is quite simple. In Fig. 4 we have demonstrated the various steps involved in the algorithm."}, {"section_title": "III.

As an illustrative example, we focus on inference problems in AD such as classification, regression and group studies on clinically different groups. The purpose here is not to achieve the best classification accuracy for AD (or that cortical thickness is the most discriminative feature) rather to show how topologically-based data can be systematically used within image-based statistical analysis. We performed experiments using cortical thickness signal defined on cortical surfaces for each subject employing our algorithm discussed in Section III. The initial processing of weighted MR images was performed using FreeSurfer. To learn discriminative topological characteristics we used a set of 356 subjects (160 AD, 196 controls) in our evaluations. We made use of ground truth diagnosis of each subject (i.e., class labels), based on given clinical evaluation of cognitive status for each subject.

FreeSurfer models the boundary between white matter and cortical gray matter, tessellates the resulting surfaces and calculates distances between the surfaces (i.e., thickness values) at each vertex. This procedure gives a cortical thickness measure at each point on the cortex for each subject's cortical surface (in fact, for each pair of left and right hemispheres) in our dataset 3 . For improved visualization, a cortical surface-based spherical atlas has been defined based on average folding patterns (see Fig. 1 ). Surfaces from individuals were aligned with this atlas with a nonlinear registration algorithm. The registration is based on aligning the cortical folding patterns and therefore directly aligns the anatomy instead of image intensities. The spherical atlas forms a coordinate system in which point-wise correspondence between subjects can be achieved by interpolation, though such correspondence is not required for our algorithm."}, {"section_title": "C.

The entire process described above was carried out separately for the right and left hemispheres of each subject's brain, giving two trained SVM classifiers. While sophisticated methods to combine different types of kernels exist, our final prediction label for a test example was derived by averaging the two classifier outputs-i.e., winner (classifier with a higher confidence) takes all.

ROI-data from ADNI consists of volumetric numerical summaries of hippocampus and temporal lobes.

Correlation Between Algorithm Outcomes and Cognitive Biomarkers", "text": "From both a therapeutic and a research standpoint, it is important to identify signs of a disease at its predementia stage.

Other neuropsychological scores (Category fluency, Trail making, Rey auditory, Boston Naming, etc.) are not used in diagnosis, however, as measures of cognitive status we nevertheless expect such scores to be highly correlated with the diagnosis (i.e., ground truth) and regard them as \"pseudo-ground truth\" due to this confounding influence. Recent studies have suggested that in early stages of AD, cognitive impairment does not correlate with brain structure delineation, which explains the weakness of cognitive scores particularly with early AD onset identification. Fig. 8 , illustrates statistical correlation of many cognitive scores with the classification confidence output by an SVM trained on the proposed imaging-based topological features.

CONCLUSION", "text": "In this paper we have proposed a new method for constructing kernels using cortical thickness measures defined on brain surfaces. This type of feature extraction will allow the inclusion of highly attributed brain signals into statistical inference machinery. We have demonstrated the value of these features in the context of mild AD via kernel-based analysis methods. Our method offers a discriminative, yet compact representation of cortical surfaces, using persistence of the topological features induced by cortical thickness signal. The method is self-governing with respect to any point-wise correspondence of the mesh topology among subjects and any kind of feature reduction. The underlying concept of our method enables easy computation of meaningful similarity measures in a non-generative manner for use within machine learning methods, not offered by most existing methods. Due to this reason, our experiments show possible and scientifically important inferences that can be derived using proposed features, using AD as an illustrative example. Our experimental results demonstrate the strength of topological features in capturing subtle anatomical variations present in complex data. Given that cortical thickness measures are suspected to be relevant for neurological disorders. In its present form, the paper outlines machanisms to exploit such data, if available.
