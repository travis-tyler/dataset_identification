[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "While the increase in mean sea level (MSL) has been well documented (Church et al., 2004;IPCC, 2007;Rahmstorf, 2007;USACE, 2011;Woodworth, 2006), determining the value of mean sea-level rise (SLR) acceleration has been much debated (Houston and Dean, 2011;Rahmstorf and Vermeer, 2011). A mean sea-level elevation that is accelerating has enormous implications for the onset and severity of future flooding events. Indeed, tidal fluctuations, storm surge, and other sources (usually climatological) of local fluctuating sea levels, when superimposed on this background relative MSL rise, would cause increasingly severe coastal flooding (Nicholls and Cazenave, 2010), even if there is no increase in major storm severity or frequency (Zhang, Douglas, and Leatherman, 2000). Therefore, assessing the relative impact of MSL acceleration on flooding frequency is of prime importance. The combined effect of sea-level rise and storm tides has been considered recently in several studies. Since historical data of extremes are correlated with the rise in mean sea level, and assuming this trend holds into the future, Obeysekera and Park (2013) calculated future return periods of extreme sea levels from MSL acceleration scenarios and storm tide statistics. This included a temporal variation of the return period with time. They then applied this method to a few U.S. coastal locations. In Menendez and Woodworth (2010), they calculated statistics of a global network of historical tide gauges, including statistics of the peak storms or maxima of the gauge time series. They concluded that there has been an increase in extreme high water levels worldwide since 1970. Furthermore, by removing the annual median sea level from the maxima of the gauge time series, they showed that MSL rise is the major reason for the rise in extreme high water at most stations. In this paper, we wish to expand upon earlier work (Kriebel and Geiman, 2013), where a ''coastal flood stage'' was proposed for all historical tide gauge sites. A major flood stage, defined by the National Weather Service (NOAA, 2013) as flooding that causes serious widespread damage to roads and buildings, is defined with respect to a fixed tidal datum, such as NAVD88. In the previous paper (Kriebel and Geiman, 2013), this elevation was shown to be correlated at over 29 U.S. East Coast sites with the statistical stage of l \u00fe 3r, where l is the mean value of the detrended (with respect to the MSL) monthly extreme water tide, and r is the standard deviation of the monthly extreme high tide. In some sense, the major flood stage is an elevation that separates outlier flood events from the ''common'' monthly high water levels and appears to work for a wide range of locations on the U.S. East Coast. We wish to use the major flood stage in Annapolis, Maryland, to assess frequency of past flooding of this threshold, as well as project future flooding probabilities using SLR scenarios (IPCC, 2007;USACE, 2011), along with the probabilities of the monthly maximum high tide. Several authors, including Menendez and Woodworth (2010), Bernardara, Andreewsky, and Benoit (2011), and Obeysekera and Park (2013), have modeled the extreme water levels with the generalized extreme value distribution (GEV). Here, we compare the fitted GEV distribution with a two-population distribution in which the bulk of the distribution is defined empirically, but the extreme tail is fit with a Pareto tail. After assessing the goodness of fit of the data to these two different distributions, we then simulate storm tides taken from a random sample of the chosen distribution on top of mean sea-level rise scenarios proposed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE, 2011(USACE, , 2014. We then project monthly exceedance probabilities for major flooding in Annapolis, Maryland, into the future."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sea-Level Rise Scenarios", "text": "Four future sea-level rise scenarios are considered here. The first, which will be denoted NRC-0, is a continuation of the existing linear trend without SLR acceleration. The second, third, and fourth are scenarios for accelerated SLR included in USACE (2009) based on recommendations from National Research Council (NRC), here termed NRC-I, NRC-II, and NRC-III. In these NRC cases, the historic linear rate of relative SLR in Annapolis was augmented with an acceleration term following methods outlined in USACE (2009) as a scenariobased assessment of future SLR. This method can be stated explicitly. First, the linear trend in relative mean SLR m l (t) is calculated where m p and t p are the values of the mean sea-level trend and time at the end of the last tidal epoch, 1992. Here, s is the slope of the linear trend, which includes both eustatic SLR as well as local ground subsidence. The global eustatic sea-level trend, m e , is given by and following USACE (2011), a value of s e \u00bc 1.7 6 0.5 mm/y is adopted for the eustatic slope in SLR. This is then compared to m l , and the SLR trend due to local land subsidence is computed via This added land subsidence is then added into any of the four scenarios (0, I, II, III). These scenarios can be written succinctly as where a J \u00bc (a 0 , a I , a II , a III ) \u00bc (0, 2.71, 7.0, 11.3)3 10 \u00c05 mm/y 2 are the acceleration values of SLR considered by USACE (2011). NRC-III obviously represents the most extreme SLR acceleration scenario, while NRC-0 once again represents a continuation of the historic linear SLR scenario. We note that m r is added to the acceleration scenario, since an increase in land subsidence increases the relative MSL."}, {"section_title": "Annapolis Monthly Tidal Data", "text": "In this section, we focus on the monthly sea-level time series in Annapolis, Maryland, using data from the NOAA tide gauge that was installed in 1928. In Figure 1, we show the monthly MSL and monthly extreme high water (EHW) with respect to NAVD88 from 1928 to 2012, or up to the present tidal epoch. The historic relative MSL trend is indicated with a black linear trend, as well as the four SLR scenarios proposed by USACE (2009) and given by Equation (4). In a previous paper (Kriebel and Geiman, 2013), we used the historic monthly EHW statistics to estimate moderate and major coastal flood stages. For the major flood stage f, this was estimated to be f \u00bc l \u00fe 3r, with l and r being the mean and standard deviation of the EHW data detrended to remove the historic MSL trend. For Annapolis, the major flood stage was calculated to be roughly 1.02 m above NAVD, a value that correlates well to flooding of roadways and some buildings in Annapolis. It is noted from the historical record (see Figure 1) that nine storms exceeded this coastal flood stage and resulted in flooding of local infrastructure. Two events led to major flood damage-one hurricane in 1933, and Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Other events were ''nuisance'' flooding events controlled by sand bags. The monthly relative MSL trend up to the current tidal epoch is s \u00bc 3.5 6 0.3 mm/y, with the error giving the 95% confidence interval. The trend in monthly maxima, denoted by EHW in Figure 1, is roughly 3.6 6 0.4 mm/y. While this value is slightly higher than the value for MSL rise, it is certainly within the error limits of the mean SLR and is supported by the findings of Menendez and Woodworth (2010), and so we assume that the linear trend in monthly maxima is attributable to mean SLR. A climatological study (Zhang, Douglas, and Leatherman, 2000) speculates that there has been no increase in the frequency of extreme events on the U.S. East Coast in the twentieth century, even though mean SLR may be contributing to an increase in the flooding severity from extreme events. Conversely, a study in the U.S. Pacific Northwest by Ruggiero (2013) asserts that accounting for increasing storm activity is just as essential as relative SLR along this coastal location. Since we are focusing on an East Coast site at Annapolis, Maryland, we ignore the effects of increased storminess, as proposed by Zhang, Douglas, and Leatherman (2000)."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "The four scenarios (0III) represent increasingly severe projections of SLR, starting with the conservative estimate of a continuation of the linear trend from the most recent tidal epoch. The obvious effect of SLR acceleration is to decrease the ''freeboard,'' or elevation between the MSL and the coastal flooding elevation, making relatively minor future storms potentially severe. We note that while scenarios 0 or I never Similar to Kriebel and Geiman (2013), we compare the cumulative probability distribution function (CDF) for the probability of exceedance of the detrended monthly EHW level with the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution, which has also been used in other extreme statistical studies (Bernardara, Andreewsky, and Benoit, 2011;Menendez and Woodworth, 2010). The GEV distribution arises naturally in studies where batch maxima are taken of a given sample, such as the present case, where the highest tide gauge recording is extracted from the entire time series in a given month. We plot the empirical CDF and maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) of the GEV distribution (given by the dashed curve) in Figure 2. We see that the data naturally follow a GEV distribution until roughly 1.0 m, which (coincidently) is about equal to our major flood stage of 1.02 m. However, the GEV distribution fails to accurately capture the very long tail seen in the observations of extreme storm events. A better method is to fit the body of the empirical distribution and model the extreme tail as a generalized Pareto distribution and interpolate the two distributions using the Matlab function PARETOTAILS( ). In our case, the Pareto tail captures the highest 10% of the observed extreme monthly high water events. The interpolated Pareto distribution is given by the solid curve in Figure 2. We see that the probability of very extreme events exceeding 1.5 m under the GEV distribution is one to three orders of magnitude smaller than the empirical distribution with the Pareto-interpolated tail. Though not shown in this paper, similar results were found at other U.S. East Coast tide gauge sites. Knowing the frequency of severe monthly storm events is critical for any assessment of flooding frequency. For this reason, all calculations of exceedance probabilities in this paper are based on the interpolated Pareto-tail distribution. Changes in flood frequency with time can be illustrated by projecting the MSL forward in time with different SLR scenarios (which implicitly include local land subsidence), while adding hypothetical storm tide scenarios to the future mean sea level. This method assumes that monthly MSL and monthly EHW are independent, which they of course are not. However, this effect is negligible since the mean is only slightly modified by outliers in the monthly tidal record. Starting from the end of the last tidal epoch, 1992, we project the MSL forward from 1992 to 2112 using any of the four scenarios detailed in the previous section following methods from USACE (2009). We then generate a random sequence of storm events x j for each month, starting with present day, or 2012, by sampling the Pareto distribution that was empirically fit to the existing data from Figure 2. These storm events x j are added onto any of the four MSL scenarios to simulate a sequence of future monthly storms via with the MSL trend, m K is obtained from Equation (4), which includes local land subsidence. In Figures 3-6, we show results of these simulations for the four MSL scenarios. Each plot shows the existing MSL trend, the future MSL trend for that particular scenario, a realization of one particular random sample from the empirically fit Pareto distribution, and the 10, 100, and 500 year recurrence intervals based on this distribution. By resampling this distribution 10,000 times, it was estimated that the mean EHW was 0.54 6 0.16 m. The recurrence interval is calculated from the time interval r by finding the value of x that satisfies , where the CDF is given by the fit Pareto distribution in Figure 2, and r \u00bc 50, 100, or 500 years. The flooding elevation of 1.02 m NAVD is also shown to indicate events that would lead to flooding of Figure 2. Plot of the CDF for the empirical distribution of detrended extreme high water (black dots), the GEV (dotted line), and the interpolated distribution that combines the empirical fit with a Pareto distribution tail (solid line). We see that the tail of the distribution is more closely modeled by the Pareto tail, rather than the GEV distribution. Figure 3.

As noted, this elevation represents a tidal elevation that corresponds to known flooding of buildings at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We see that for the most conservative scenario, NRC-0, neither the monthly MSL nor the mean of monthly EHW intersects with the flooding elevation for the time period considered. This implies, roughly, that an ''average'' monthly storm is still well below the flooding elevation, even 100\u00fe years into the future for this scenario. Obviously, even with continuation of the linear trend, many more monthly flood events can be expected in the future compared to the past. As noted in regard to Figure 1, nine events have crossed the major flood stage threshold in the past 84 years . Based on our representative sample from the empirical Pareto distribution with the NRC-0 MSL continuation, the next 88 years (2012-2100) may expect approximately 37 flood events to cross the threshold. Thus, there is a fourfold increase in flooding over a similar time period resulting from a continuation of the relative MSL trend without any consideration for changing storm climatology. By introducing even just a mild SLR acceleration in NRC-I, as seen in Figure 4, there are noticeable increases in future flooding. In particular, the mean monthly storm tide now exceeds the coastal flooding stage by the year 2080, and approximately 84% of all months after 2080 will experience a major flood. Similar results hold for NRC-II in Figure 5, where now an average monthly storm will result in major flooding by 2060. In fact, the MSL itself will eclipse the major coastal flooding stage around 2090, which roughly means that flooding will occur for half the year during every daily high tide. Lastly, scenario NRC-III is shown in Figure 6. This extreme scenario results in major flooding for a ''typical'' monthly storm by the year 2045 and a MSL above the flood stage by 2070. By 2112, a 500 year storm tide will reach nearly 2.0 m higher than any observations from 1928 to 2012, including Hurricane Isabel in 2003, which to date is the most severe flooding event experienced in Annapolis. A better way to visualize each scenario collectively is to compute exceedance probabilities of flooding for each scenario as a function of time. The probability for a monthly maximum storm tide to exceed the flood stage for each month and scenario is computed and displayed in Figure 7. While the increase in flooding probability with increased MSL acceleration is obvious, it is striking how drastically the probability increases. For example, by comparing the exceedance curve for scenario III to scenario 0, we see that in 2062, it would be nearly 19 times more likely for a monthly flooding event under the former scenario compared to the latter. Additionally, we can assess the increase in the percentage of exceedances from past storms to future storms under each scenario. For example, the 84 years from 1928 to 2012 saw roughly 1.0% of all months exceeding the coastal flooding elevation. Continuing with the existing linear trend under scenario NRC-0 for the next 88 years, we find that this number is 6.0% from 2012 to 2110. For NRC-I, NRC-II, and NRC-III, this percentage rises to 27.0%, 52.1%, and 63.7%, respectively. These figures are somewhat misleading, as it is apparent that the months closer to present day see only sporadic flooding, while months after 2040 are inundated much more frequently. However, these percentages illustrate in a simple way the dramatic increases that would occur under each scenario. This analysis is based on the assumption that storm statistics of EHW are stationary. It is worth noting that this flooding threshold about which the threat of inconvenient or damaging flooding has been benchmarked may vary with the implementation of adaptation or mitigation measures, aimed at offsetting a proportion of equivalent SLR. Such measures might range from more direct action such as shore-based capital works (such as elevating landforms or revetment crests, nonreturn valving on storm-water drainage systems) to more a more complex approach, such as extensive tidal exchange modifications at the head of estuarine systems (such as the Thames barriers). Once credible predictions of any changes in storm severity or changes in flooding threshold due to adaptation or mitigation measures are developed, these can be incorporated into this analysis. At present, barring any widely accepted scenario for increased storm severity or frequency in Annapolis, we simply address future flood hazards on the baseline assumption that future EHW will be statistically similar to the present. The sensitivity of the exceedance probabilities to the MSL acceleration leads to the important question: Which scenario is most likely? Here, we do not wish to speculate on the probability of each scenario, but we offer a method to synthesize the conditional probabilities pertaining to each scenario with an overall ''flooding probability'' over all scenarios. We assume that the probability of each MSL acceleration scenario occurring can be assigned a probability P(S J ) with J \u00bc 0, I, II, III. Let the probability of flooding in month k be denoted P(f k ). Then we can write where P(f k jS J ) is the conditional probability of flooding, given that the MSL follows scenario J. Therefore, P(S J ) acts as a weight for the four different curves in Figure 7. A naive but reasonable estimate of the P(S J ) would be P(S 0 ) \u00bc P(S I ) \u00bc P(S II ) \u00bc P(S III ). This would amount to taking the average of these four curves. Once some prediction of the value of each P(S J ) is estimated, the full flooding probability can be calculated. The estimation of the value of the SLR acceleration is a subject of much debate (Houston and Dean, 2011;Rahmstorf and Vermeer, 2011), and therefore it is the most difficult term in Equation (6) to pin down. Some attempts have been made by Titus and Narayanan (1995) to estimate added SLR due to climate change and assign probabilities to various increases in MSL at future times. In their study, a climate-added SLR is combined with the existing MSL trend. Ranges of probabilities are then assigned to climate-added SLR scenarios."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "This paper explored the frequency of flooding under SLR scenarios proposed by the Army Corps of Engineers at the case site location in Annapolis, Maryland. The coastal flood stage was established in a previous paper (Kriebel and Geiman, 2013), relative to a fixed datum. This flood stage indicates a level where major damage to local roads, buildings, and infrastructure is initiated. Once the flood stage is established, the effects of storm tides coupled with future MSL rise can be analyzed as a thresholdcrossing problem to determine future flood frequency and flood depths. Results are shown for four future scenarios in Annapolis, including a continuation of the existing linear trend in relative MSL plus three scenarios with accelerated SLR as outlined by recent Army Corps of Engineers guidance for sealevel change. Past storm events were analyzed by subtracting the existing trend in relative sea level rise from the historic monthly extreme water levels. This detrended set of storm events was then fit to a distribution with a tail modeled as a generalized Pareto distribution, and random samples from this distribution were then added to alternative SLR scenarios, based on the assumption that there is no statistical change in future storm climatology. Curves for monthly probability of flooding were then calculated for each scenario based on the fitted Pareto distribution. While the effect of SLR acceleration on coastal flooding is apparent, the degree to which flooding frequency increases is not as apparent. For example, the simulations indicate that by 2062, coastal flooding in a given month under scenario III is nearly 19 times more likely than under scenario 0. The difference between exceedance probabilities for these two scenarios only increases with time. Results show that a continuation of the existing SLR trend will have a noticeable effect on future flood events that will increase flood depth and frequency, but in a range where adaptation may be possible.

(Color for this figure is available in the online version of this paper.) assessed in Annapolis, the percentage of monthly extreme tides that cross the flood stage rises from 1% of events in the past to 6% in the 88 years to come in the NRC-0 scenario. The accelerated SLR scenarios illustrate a much more dramatic increase in flood depth and frequency. For example, for NRC-III, we find that this percentage rises to 64% of all months over the next 88 years, while a 100 year storm would inundate the local flooding elevation by over 2.0 m by 2100. Such an increase in flood frequency is probably in a range where simple adaptation will be difficult without major changes to infrastructure or to flood defense measures."}]
