Method: Data come from the nationally representative kindergarten and first-grade waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (2010)(2011); 11,958 children attending 1289 schools are included. Statistical analyses involve using a novel framework for measuring the transitional dynamics and depth of food insecurity to predict children's developmental outcomes using hierarchal linear models, which adjust for child-and school-level confounders. Results: Deepening food insecurity (DeepenFIS) was detrimental to children's self-control (20.208, p < 0.01), math (20.153, p < 0.01), and working memory (25.202, p < 0.05) scores. Remitting marginal food insecurity was associated with negative effects on children's self-control (20.082, p < 0.05) and interpersonal skills (20.098, p < 0.01) but not on math or working memory. Persisting marginal food insecurity (PersistMFIS) negatively impacted children's self-control (20.106, p < 0.05) and interpersonal skills (20.115, p < 0.05). Emerging food insecurity (0.146, p < 0.01) and persisting food insecurity (0.071, p < 0.05) had detrimental effects on children's externalizing behaviors. Conclusion: Based on a novel food insecurity transitions framework and examination of multiple developmental outcomes, this study highlights the importance of examining both depth and transitional dynamics of food insecurity. Findings indicate that DeepenFIS and PersistMFIS may have potentially the most harmful effects on children's developmental outcomes. Clinically, findings support the need for addressing food insecurity in early childhood, even if the food insecurity challenges are marginal and just emerging. "}, {"section_title": "", "text": "It is well established that food insecurity affects children's learning, behavior, and development. A lack of adequate nutrients can have negative and persisting impacts on children. A recent systematic review synthesized across 23 studies concluded that household food insecurity, even at marginal levels, is associated with behavioral, academic, and emotional problems from infancy to adolescence in Western industrialized countries. 1 For example, food insecurity has been associated with lower reading and math scores 2, 3 and more internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. 4 Although math, reading, and social skills have been well studied, there are comparatively fewer studies on the role of food insecurity in executive functioning. Executive functioning is important because it relates to overarching cognitive processes and reasoning. 5 Executive functions work together to regulate and orchestrate cognition, emotion, and behavior and help a child to learn in the classroom. Some of the only research on this topic comes from a cohort study of older Puerto Rican adults in Massachusetts. Researchers found that food insecurity was associated with worse cognitive performance 6 and faster cognitive decline 2 years later. 5 "}, {"section_title": "FOOD INSECURITY TRANSITIONS", "text": "Food insecurity is predominantly a transient phenomenon, with most children moving into and out of food security throughout childhood as their family circumstances change. 7 In a nationally representative sample, only 1.15% of US children were food insecure across kindergarten (1999), third grade (2002), fifth grade (2004) , and eighth grade (2007), whereas 21% had been food insecure at a minimum of 1 of those checkpoints. 7 In comparison with the literature that treats food insecurity as a static phenomenon in relation to children's developmental outcomes, research on how transitions into and out of food insecurity influence children's development is less established. 2, [8] [9] [10] When examining a nationally representative sample of kindergarten children living at or below 300% of the poverty level who were followed into first grade, Kimbro and Denney 9 found that neither persistent food insecurity nor transitions into or out of food insecurity were associated with reading, math, or science assessment scores. On the behavioral side, becoming food insecure in first grade after being food secure in kindergarten was associated with worse interpersonal skills, lower self-control, and more externalizing behaviors (e.g., bullying). Persistent food insecurity at kindergarten and first grade was associated with internalizing behaviors (e.g., sadness). 9 Across the handful of studies on food security transitions, a consistent and limiting methodological feature is the use of 1 dichotomous definition of food insecurity (either 31 items [food insecure 7, 9 ] or 11 item [marginally food insecure 2, 10 ] on a well-established food security scale) to create 4 categories of transitions: never food insecure, becoming insecure, becoming secure, and persistently insecure. 2, 8, 9 When predicting child health outcomes in a cross-sectional study, other analysts created a set of 3 mutually exclusive food insecurity indicators-food secure (0 items on scale), marginally food insecure (1 or 2 items), and food secure (31)-but did not capture transitions."}, {"section_title": "10,11", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "THE CURRENT INVESTIGATION", "text": "Using a nationally representative sample of US children through the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010 to 2011 (ECLS-K:2011), the present study explores transitions into and out of varying degrees of food insecurity during the kindergarten and first-grade years and how the transitional dynamics and depth of food insecurity impact students' developmental outcomes. Outcomes studied include directly assessed academic competencies in reading, math, and science; 2 directly assessed measures of executive functioning; and 4 teacher-reported measures of social skills. This article contributes to existing literature in 3 regards. First, it introduces a refined operationalization of food insecurity transitions into 9 categories, which combine a focus on transitional dynamics into and out of food security while gauging the intensity of the transitions. Second, it examines 2 measures of executive functioning, which are directly assessed and available in the ECLS-K:2011 but have not been used in previous studies of food insecurity using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (e.g., 9). Third, we control for school-level contextual factors, which have been neglected in previous studies, although school characteristics-e.g., parental involvement, 12 school location, 13 and sense of safety 14 -are welldocumented influences on children's academic achievement and development.

Working memory was assessed with the Numbers Reversed test, 15, 16 in which children were asked to repeat increasingly long strings of orally presented numbers in reverse order.

Although it would be technically possible to also include extreme food insecurity (8 or more items on the scale), there were few cases of this in our data set, and so it was not possible to examine; only 2.6% of children scored 8 or more on the household food insecurity scale in first grade.

In terms of parent/household characteristics, single-parent household is coded as 1 5 1 parent or 0 5 2 parents. Parental nativity is represented categorically as both parents/single parent are/is foreign born, 1 parent is foreign born and 1 is US born, and both parents/single parent are/is US born. US-born parent(s) is the reference category in the statistical model. Household size indicates the number of children younger than 18 years in the household. Teen mother was constructed by recoding the mother's age categories mother was younger than 20 years when the focal child was born or 0 5 mother was aged 20 years or older when the focal child was born. Parental depression was captured by asking about how often the parent felt depressed in the last week and is gauged on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 5 never to 4 5 most of the time. Parental health status was also included, which is on a Likert-type scale with higher scores corresponding to better health (1 5 poor to 5 5 excellent). Socioeconomic status was measured using the ECLS-provided standardized family socioeconomic scale. 15 In terms of child characteristics, we used 5 mutually exclusive race/ethnicity categories, each coded 1 5 yes or 0 5 no: (1) black or African American, non-Hispanic; (2) Hispanic; (3) Asian, non-Hispanic; (4) other (nonHispanic), which includes the smallest racial groupings (i.e., Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian, Native American, Multiracial, and Unknown); and (5) white, non-Hispanic, which is used as the reference group. Child sex was coded as female 5 1 or male 5 0. The child's age in months was calculated by comparing the exact date the child completed the ECLS-K:2011 spring 2012 direct academic assessment with the child's date of birth. Low birth weight was coded as 1 5 child was 5.5 pounds or less at birth or 0 5 child was more than 5.5 pounds at birth. Disability reflects whether the child had a disability diagnosed by a professional (1 5 yes and 0 5 no). Attendance in a prekindergarten program was noted based on whether the child had attended a child care center in the year before kindergarten; it is coded 1 5 yes or 0 5 no.

We then used hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to predict the developmental outcomes after using multiple imputation (MI) to address missing values and nonresponse bias in the child-level data set. MI creates multiple sets of values for missing observations using a regression-based approach. It also avoids the bias that can occur when missing values are not missing completely at random. 20 In IBM SPSS Statistics 24, 10 imputed data sets were specified, and 200 between-imputation iterations were used. We analyzed multiply imputed data for 11,958 children attending 1289 different schools. HLM7 was used to analyze each of the 10 individual-level data sets separately and to calculate pooled results. When using imputed data, we analyzed the originally ordinal measures (e.g., parent depression and parent health status) as continuous predictors. This is a best practice when imputing missing data and estimating model parameters because rounding off imputed values based on discrete categorical specifications has been shown to produce more biased parameter estimates in analysis models. 20 Hierarchical linear modeling is the most appropriate statistical technique for analyzing multilevel data 21 because when examining effects at multiple levels, traditional regression techniques may result in inaccurate parameter estimates. 22, 23 HLM is appropriate for this study because our data had a multilevel structure, with Averting food insecurity Food secure in kindergarten and first grade 0 0 AvertFIS children at level 1 nested within schools at level 2.

It was specifically DeepenFIS that was most detrimental. The findings for working memory are relatively novel and should be examined in future studies. Surprisingly, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS) executive function measures have not been used in studies of food security, but they represent an important avenue for future research. These findings for executive function are concerning, given that working memory is an important element of school success 24 and math performance specifically. 25 Declining executive functioning could be related to food insecurity through stress, as prefrontal cortex activity is impaired by high concentrations of dopamine and glucocorticoids. 5 Food insecurity has been linked to math scores in other studies. 2, 26, 27 In a previous study using a definition of food insecurity based on .1 item on the food security scale, children who were persistently food insecure in kindergarten and third grade and those who became food secure in third grade after being insecure in kindergarten had significantly lower math scores than children who had never been food insecure at either time point. The authors concluded that there may be a long lag time in the effects of food insecurity on math because being food insecure in kindergarten mattered more for third-grade math scores than did change in status over time. 2 In our analysis, a status change reflecting DeepenFIS was instead linked to math scores. We did not have any significant food security findings in the multivariate model for science scores, as was the case in another article. 9 In the bivariate analyses, science scores were lower for children who had experienced any type of food insecurity compared with those who had not. This suggests that the bivariate science findings were likely driven more by family socioeconomic circumstances and school context than by food insecurity per se.\nOverall, social skills were more strongly related to food insecurity and food insecurity transitions than were the direct assessments of academic competencies and executive functioning in the multivariate models. This pattern was also found in another study 9 in which the authors found that behavioral outcomes were more sensitive to food insecurity than longer-term, more durable outcomes such as academic scores. We would have missed this finding had we relied only on the bivariate results because all food insecurity transitions were significantly associated with lower directly assessed scores relative to averting food insecurity.\nOur analyses uncovered that it is actually DeepenFIS that was most closely associated with significantly worse self-control compared with children who had averted food insecurity. This may have been masked in previous studies because marginally food insecure and food insecure children were not distinguished. 9, 10 We also found that remitting marginal food insecurity was associated with worse self-control and interpersonal skills, although the strengths of the associations were weaker than they were for DeepenFIS in both the bivariate and multivariate models, suggesting a smaller effect. The finding suggests that the adverse effects of food insecurity may not disappear as soon as sufficient food becomes available. It may be that once children experience food insecurity, the fear that it might reemerge persists and has negative effects. In terms of other studies looking at improvements in food security and their effects on social skills, the findings are mixed. Some find no effects for \"becoming food secure\" 9 and another failed to model that effect. 10 Another found that becoming food secure between kindergarten and third grade was associated with worse social skills for boys but better social skills for girls compared with children who were persistently food secure. 2 These studies vary in how food insecurity transitions were measured, in analysis approaches, and in the treatment of school-level variables. More research studies are needed to assess whether there is a replicable adverse impact associated with remitting food security for children's social skills development and to determine which contextual variables might explain such an impact if 1 is found.\nOur findings suggest that self-control was the most sensitive to food insecurity (3 significant findings), followed by interpersonal skills and externalizing behaviors (2 significant findings each). Internationalizing behaviors were not sensitive to food insecurity in our analysis (no significant findings). The effects of food insecurity on social skills likely relates to a mix of unhealthy changes in diet and psychological stress. 10 The findings are concerning, being that limited social skills development can make it harder for children to learn in the classroom and the effects can cascade into adulthood. 28 Although food insecurity was not related to internalizing behaviors, persistent food insecurity and EmergFIS were associated with externalizing behavior. Externalizing behaviors in childhood have been shown to undermine academic competency by adolescence, which is, in turn, related to the presence of internalizing problems in young adults. 28 Children engaging in externalizing behaviors can also harm their peers and themselves, diminishing their opportunities to succeed at school. 29 With its expanded food insecurity transition framework and consideration of multiple student outcomes using a nationally representative data set, this study highlights the vulnerable status of children who are marginally food insecure in kindergarten. For the kindergarteners in this study, a slip into food insecurity the next year was associated with lower math and working memory scores, but a move out of marginal food security was not. For self-control, children who were marginally food insecure in kindergarten were negatively affected the next year, whether they moved out of marginal food insecurity, became food insecure, or stayed marginally food insecure. For interpersonal skills, staying marginally food insecure and moving into food security were both associated with lower scores in first grade when children were marginally food insecure in kindergarten. This may suggest that marginal food insecurity in kindergarten matters more than subsequent transitions in terms of self-control (and, to a lesser degree, interpersonal skills) in first grade.\nKindergarten is likely a particularly sensitive time for children's socioemotional development because children are adjusting to a new school context with emerging social dynamics. How well children adapt to their first school experiences has long-term consequences in terms of their subsequent school performance, academic adjustment, and odds of dropping out of high school. 30, 31 Marginal food insecurity may be associated with the least stable, most disrupted home lives as families struggle to grapple with emerging challenges related to poverty or health. This may lead marginal food security to have greater impacts on children's development than deeper levels of food insecurity because it is hypothetically possible that households who experience food insecurity and especially PersistFIS have better established strategies to access resources and social services to help them cope compared with marginally food insecure households. Others have suggested that marginal food insecurity should not be overlooked and should be treated as a serious indicator of lack of access to enough food for a healthy life. 11 Our results support that conclusion.\nThere are several limitations associated with our analysis. Future studies should examine the intensity and duration of food security transitions over a longer period than the 2 years we studied. We were limited by the available waves of ECLS data that had been released at the time of the analysis. Consideration of extreme food insecurity could theoretically be added to our transitions framework and operationalized in future analyses, but there were not enough households in that category to consider in the current analysis. Although the data used were recently released by the ECLS, they pertain to 2010, 2011 and 2012. Since then, the United States has undergone a leadership change, which may be dramatically altering economic conditions and the social service landscape, potentially affecting food insecurity in the United States.\nFrom a clinical perspective, findings offer support for the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation that providers assess the stress of food insecurity in families by incorporating a screening tool into their practice. 32 They suggest a practical 2-item screening tool, which is nearly as accurate as the 18-item scale used in this article. 33 They also recommend that physicians familiarize themselves with community resources so that they can refer children who screen positively to relevant services. 32 If children who are beginning to experience food insecurity (i.e., are marginally food insecure) are identified and enabled to return to food security, our results suggest that they may be buffered from some negative learning and behavioral outcomes."}]
