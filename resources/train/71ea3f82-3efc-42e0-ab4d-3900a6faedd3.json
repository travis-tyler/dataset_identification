[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Focus of this Report", "text": "This report presents selected findings from the second follow-up of the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09). HSLS:09 follows a nationally representative sample of students who were ninth-graders in fall 2009 from the beginning of high school into higher education and the workforce. Key research topics for HSLS:09 include secondary to postsecondary transition plans and the evolution of those plans; paths into and out of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) studies and careers; and the relationships between students' school experiences (educational and social) and their academic, work, and life plans and paths. The second follow-up data collection was conducted from March 14, 2016, through January 31, 2017, approximately 3 years after high school graduation for most of the cohort. The data collected allow researchers to examine an array of young-adulthood outcomes among fall 2009 ninth-graders, including delayed high school completion, postsecondary enrollment, early postsecondary persistence and attainment, labor market experiences, family formation, and family financial support. Analyses of these outcomes can capitalize on the large amounts of data gathered about the students in fall 2009, in 2012 (when most were spring-term 11th-graders), and in summer and fall 2013 (when most had completed high school). Analyses can also be augmented with information collected from parents, teachers, administrators, counselors, and high school transcripts. This report highlights selected findings from the HSLS:09 second follow-up data with the goal of encouraging interested researchers to explore the data for their own analytic purposes. Therefore, the report provides information on a range of outcomes, although HSLS:09 offers much more data than those used in the analyses in this report. Readers should note that, because this report is descriptive in nature, it is not appropriate to draw causal inferences from the results presented. For example, many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships among the variables have not been explored in these analyses. All results have been weighted to reflect the sample design and to account for nonresponse and other adjustments. Comparisons drawn in the selected findings have been tested for statistical significance at the .05 level using Student's t statistics to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to INTRODUCTION sampling variation. While the selected findings only include statistically significant findings, they do not include every statistically significant comparison. There were no adjustments for multiple comparisons. Detail may not sum to totals because of rounding. Additional information about the HSLS:09 dataset and the methods employed in collecting and processing the data can be found in appendix C, and greater detail is available in the HSLS:09 Base-Year to Second Follow-Up Data File Documentation (Duprey et al. 2018), at https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsls09/."}, {"section_title": "Study Design", "text": "HSLS:09 is a longitudinal study of a nationally representative sample of approximately 20,000 ninth-graders. HSLS:09 used a two-stage sample design. First, high schools, defined as schools with both a ninth and an eleventh grade in fall 2009, were sampled, and then students were sampled from each school's ninth grade in the fall term. The sampled schools consist of private and public schools, including charter and magnet schools, that provided instruction in the 50 states and District of Columbia. More information about the sample design, including classification of ineligible cases, is available in appendix C. The HSLS:09 dataset contains data, collected from several sources, on students and their school and home environments. The base-year data collection featured a student survey and mathematics assessment as well as surveys completed by school administrators, school counselors, science teachers, mathematics teachers, and parents of the sampled students. The first follow-up of HSLS:09 occurred in spring 2012, when most sample members were in the 11th grade, and included a student survey and mathematics assessment, as well as surveys completed by school administrators, school counselors, and parents of the sampled students. The 2013 Update data collection was a brief, between-round status update consisting of a short survey to be completed by either the sample member or the sample member's parent. It occurred in summer and fall 2013 and captured information on sample members' high school completion status and employment or postsecondary education plans. Transcript data were also collected in 2013 and 2014 from all high schools where sample members were known to have attended. The second follow-up survey of HSLS:09 was conducted between March 2016 and January 2017, about 3 years after most sample members had graduated from high school, and is highlighted in this First Look. Although most of the estimates in this First Look were generated from student survey data, the report does include estimates that incorporate data collected in prior rounds from parents and high school transcripts. The number and timing of future follow-ups are yet to be determined; however, HSLS:09 is also collecting students' postsecondary financial aid records and transcripts in 2017. A First Look report and data from the collection of students' postsecondary financial aid records and transcripts are scheduled for release in 2019."}, {"section_title": "This page intentionally left blank", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Selected Findings", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Among all fall 2009 ninth-graders by February 2016, \u2026", "text": "\u2022 Ninety-two percent of all fall 2009 ninth-graders had earned a high school diploma by February 2016; of those who scored in the lowest fifth on the 2012 HSLS mathematics achievement test, however, 81 percent had earned a diploma, compared with 99 percent of those who scored in the highest fifth (table 1). \u2022 Four percent of all fall 2009 ninth-graders had not earned any type of high school credential by February 2016.

The remainder (7 percent) attended a for-profit or other type of institution. \u2022 Fall 2009 ninth-graders who had enrolled in a postsecondary degree or certificate program after high school pursued a variety of fields of study. For example, when asked what fields they studied in the postsecondary education program in which they had most recently enrolled, 17 percent first listed a health field, 14 percent first listed business, and 20 percent first listed any of a number of other applied fields (e.g., personal and consumer services; manufacturing, construction, repair, and transportation; military technology and protective services, architecture; communications; public administration and human services; design and applied arts; law and legal studies; library sciences; and theology and religious vocations) (table 10). \u2022 Among fall 2009 ninth-graders who had enrolled in postsecondary education after high school, 5 percent had earned an undergraduate certificate and 5 percent had earned an associate's degree as their highest credential attained at the first institution in which they enrolled as of February 2016 (table 11).

Interpret data with caution. Estimate is unstable because the standard error is more than 30 percent but no greater than 50 percent of the estimate. \u2021 Reporting standards are not met either because the standard error was greater than 50 percent or there were too few cases for a reliable estimate. 1 Among those who had a high school diploma, high school departure date is the month and year this credential was awarded. Among those who had no high school diploma but had a high school equivalency or had a certificate of attendance or completion, high school departure date is the month and year this credential was awarded. Among those who did not have any of these credentials, high school departure is the month and year last attended high school.                    The first follow-up of HSLS:09 took place in 2012, when most sample members were in the spring term of the eleventh grade. Students who transferred to another school, who became homeschooled, who completed high school, who earned a high school equivalency, and who dropped out were followed, as well as those who remained in the base-year high school. Sample members were eligible to complete both a questionnaire and a mathematics assessment. In addition to the student questionnaire and mathematics assessment, surveys were also administered to sample members' parents, administrators, and counselors. The 2013 Update survey took place between June and December 2013. The survey, which could be completed by the sample member or a parent, was designed to gather basic information about sample members' high school completion status or plans, postsecondary education and work plans, and the college application and financing process. Questions were designed so that sample members could provide information about themselves, or parent respondents could provide information about their child's activities and plans. Some of these questions were subjective (e.g., reasons for choosing a college), and parents' and students' responses to these questions may differ systematically. The survey was administered over the course of several months that preceded and overlapped with the traditional start of college classes in the fall; therefore, a number of questions were anchored to November 1, 2013 to ensure that respondents had a common reference point. Between fall 2013 and spring 2014, high school transcripts were gathered from all high schools that students had attended, including schools known from prior data collection rounds, schools identified by the student or parent during the 2013 Update survey, and schools identified during the request for transcripts from already known schools. Coursetaking records from transcripts were keyed and coded using the School Courses for the Exchange of Data (SCED), a system for classifying elementary and secondary school courses into standard 12-digit codes reflecting their course content and placement within subjects. HSLS:09's use of SCED marked NCES's first use of SCED on any of its transcript studies. Course credits, course grades, and other measures derived from transcripts were standardized to ensure comparability across schools. 2 In addition, student records were matched to external data sources to obtain SAT and ACT scores, Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) data, and GED completion data. The second follow-up, conducted between March 2016 and January 2017, was designed to collect information from the cohort approximately 3 years after the modal high school completion date. The second follow-up survey explored a variety of academic and employment-related topics that include, but are not limited to, high school completion and experiences, college enrollment history and future enrollment plans, and employment and unemployment history. The second follow-up survey collected information on each of these diverse activities while continuing to capture information on students' experiences and the influences and constraints on their decision-making about postsecondary education, fields of study, and occupations. Selected survey items paid particular attention to students' experience with and choices related to STEM fields. Respondents were asked to anchor their responses for a number of questions to the end of February 2016 (the month before data collection began), and many questions asked specifically about the respondent's activities and status in that month. The second follow-up also covered a range of topics related to family, community, and personal characteristics including marital and parental status, household composition, financial well-being, community engagement (e.g., citizenship, voting registration, volunteering), personal characteristics and values (e.g., disabilities, sexual orientation and gender identity, experiences of discrimination, life values), and significant life events (e.g., job loss, death, serious injury or illness). In addition to information obtained from sample members who participated in the second follow-up survey, data were obtained in 2017 from postsecondary institutions as part of the student financial aid records and postsecondary transcript collection. Financial aid data records include data collected from the institutions sample that members attended, and federal student loan records from the Department of Education's Office of Federal Student Aid. Records collected from the institutions attended by HSLS:09 sample members provide detailed information about students' enrollment patterns, degree programs or other programs of study, progress toward degree, and costs of attendance. The postsecondary transcript data 3 cover postsecondary coursetaking through 2016 and provide detailed information on students' academic experience, including coursetaking, academic performance, credit accumulation, enrollment periods, and transfer between institutions. These data are scheduled for release in 2019."}, {"section_title": "C.2 Instrumentation", "text": "The goal for developing the content of the second follow-up instrument was to design a web survey that, in conjunction with data collected in previous rounds of the study, could provide information on sample member's choices related to secondary education completion, postsecondary education, entry into the workforce, and family formation. The second follow-up survey not only collected new information about sample members' activities, but also updated information obtained in previous data collections and gathered information that was missing in prior rounds of the study (either from item-or unit-level nonresponse). The survey was designed for self-administration on the Web as well as interviewer administration via telephone or in-person interviews. The web instrument could be completed on a desktop or laptop computer or a mobile device such as a tablet or smartphone. The survey did not have to be completed in a single session or in a single mode. Respondents could begin the survey, log out, and resume where they left off at a later time. Moreover, respondents could switch modes across survey sessions. For example, they could begin the survey on their own and later complete the survey with an interviewer. For sample members who decided to complete the survey over the phone or in-person, trained interviewers administered the survey, following instructions on each screen that indicated how each question was to be administered (e.g., whether the response options were to be read aloud, and when to probe for more information). In developing the survey instrument, a primary challenge was to minimize respondent burden while collecting as much information as possible. One way to do this was by routing the survey around questions when the answer could be logically inferred from the answer provided to an earlier question. Additionally, the full-length survey instrument was used from the beginning of data collection through December 11, 2016, at which time it was replaced by an abbreviated instrument to encourage the remaining nonrespondents to participate. Survey respondents who partially completed the full-length instrument before that date and resumed after that date were automatically switched from the full-length to the abbreviated survey."}, {"section_title": "C.3 Sample Design", "text": "In the base year of HSLS:09, students were sampled through a two-stage process. First, stratified probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling was used to select schools. Sampling and school recruitment resulted in the identification and contacting of 1,889 eligible base-year schools. A total of 944 of these schools participated in the study, resulting in a 56 percent weighted (50 percent unweighted) school response rate. The target population at the school level was defined as regular public schools, including public charter schools, and private schools 4 in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, that provided instruction in both ninth and eleventh grades. HSLS:09 base-year school and student samples are nationally representative and state representative for 10 states. The target population of students was defined to include all ninth-grade students who attended study-eligible schools in the fall 2009 term. In the second stage of sampling, students were randomly selected from school enrollment rosters, and 25,206 students (or about 27 students per school) were determined to be eligible. Of the 25,206 base-year sample members, 25,184 were eligible for the first follow-up (22 were deceased or ineligible 5 ), 25,168 were eligible for the 2013 Update (a cumulative total of 38 were deceased or ineligible), and 25,167 were eligible for the High School Transcript Study (a cumulative total of 39 were deceased or ineligible). By the time of the second follow-up, 25,123 sample members were eligible because a cumulative total of 83 were found to be deceased or ineligible.

A First Look at Fall 2009Ninth-Graders in 2013, weighted response rates were calculated using the analytic weight, rather than the student base weight, for these five instruments.

When appropriately weighted, estimates from the HSLS:09 are generalizable to the U.S. population of ninth-graders who were attending schools with both a ninth and eleventh grade in fall 2009. Estimates in this report were produced using the base-year to first follow-up to 2013 Update to second follow-up weight (W4W1W2W3STU). This weight is appropriate for analyses involving base-year, first follow-up, 2013 Update, and second follow-up data; nonrespondents to one or more of these survey components are given a zero weight and do not count toward estimates. The weight's corresponding balanced repeated replicate (BRR) weights were used to compute standard errors. All estimates were computed in PowerStats.

Advantages of using imputed values include the ability to use all study respondent records in an analysis (complete-case analysis), which affords more power for statistical tests. Additionally, if the imputation procedure is effective (i.e., the imputed value is equal to, or close to, the true value), the analysis results are likely less biased than those produced with the incomplete data file. (On both the benefits and techniques of imputation, see, for example, Little and Rubin 2002.) To alleviate the problem of missing data from a respondent record, statistical imputation methods were employed for the second follow-up that were similar to those used for the HSLS:09 base year, first follow-up, and 2013 Update.

There were no adjustments for multiple comparisons. The conclusions stated in this report are supported by a two-tailed test of statistical significance, specifically, Student's t test. Whether the statistical test is considered significant is determined by calculating a t value for the difference between a pair of means or percentages and comparing this value to published tables of values, called critical values. The alpha level is an a priori statement of the probability that a difference exists in fact rather than by chance. The t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables can be computed by using the following formula: where 1 x and 2 x are the estimates to be compared (e.g., the means of sample members in two groups), and SE1 and SE2 are their corresponding standard errors. This formula is valid only for independent estimates."}, {"section_title": "C.10 Variance Estimation", "text": "The HSLS:09 sample design included stratification, disproportionate sampling of certain strata, and clustered (i.e., multistage) probability sampling. Therefore, the statistics generated from HSLS:09 data are more variable than they would have been if they had been based on data from a simple random sample of the same size. Analysts can use any of several procedures to calculate estimates of sampling errors for complex samples such as HSLS:09. These procedures include both Taylor Series approximations and replication techniques (i.e., balanced repeated replicate [BRR], jackknife repeated replication, and bootstrapping), which can be found in advanced statistical programs such as Stata, SAS, SUDAAN \u00ae , AM, or WesVar. The standard errors for estimates in this report were calculated using replicate weights generated with a bootstrap technique."}]
