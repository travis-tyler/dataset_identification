It is difficult to overstate my gratitude to Dr. Jenny Lee, whose mentorship has been a defining feature of my time as a PhD. Through sound advice and example, Jenny helped shape my research trajectory, and her gentle wisdom guided me at times when I felt adrift as a student and as a human being. Thank you so much for your friendship and generosity. Likewise, I am indebted to Dr. Ozan Jaquette for graciously agreeing to join my committee even though he had no previous experience working with me. Ozan's invaluable suggestions and comments spurred a period of great learning and growth as a scholar. To my family, as usual, thank you for maintaining a loving and supportive home for me to come back to whenever I've needed it. To my mother in particular for instilling in me the love of learning and independent spirit that have guided me in life. To my dear Baz, thank you for your unconditional love and patience. It's been a strange, rough, wondrous journey and I'm glad to share it with you. To Mika, Ruthann, La Monica, Danielle, Tanisha and Annette, the wonderful women of the Bright Alliance of Doctors Achieving Scholarly Success (BADASS), thank you so much for your friendship and unflinching support. My time at the U of A was so much the richer for knowing you, and I'm blessed to have you in my life. I'd also like to give a very special thank you to Dr. Aurelia Kollasch, my partner in crime in many (mis)adventures, and to Edna Parra, without whose friendship and expertise I may have simply given up on the dissertation. To my friends Ke, Nina, George, and Henry: Thank you for celebrating the ups with me and helping me weather the downs.

Through a series of cluster analyses and Chisquare tests on data drawn from the 2008 Survey of Income Program Participation (SIPP), the study found evidence of segmentation in the highly-skilled STEM and non-STEM samples, which included workers with a subbaccalaureate diploma or above. The cluster analyses show a pattern consistent with Labor Market Segmentation theory: Higher wages are associated with other primary employment characteristics, including health insurance and pension benefits, as well as full-time employment. In turn, lower wages showed a tendency to cluster with secondary employment characteristics, such as part-time employment, multiple employment, and restricted access to health insurance and pension benefits. The findings also suggest that women have a higher likelihood of being employed in STEM jobs with secondary characteristics. The findings reveal a far more variegated employment landscape than is usually presented in national reports of the STEM workforce. There is evidence that, while STEM employment may be more resilient than non-STEM employment to labor restructuring trends in the new economy, the former is far from immune to secondary labor characteristics. There is a need for ongoing dialogue between STEM education (at all levels), employers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to truly understand not only the barriers to equity in employment relations, but also the mechanisms that create and maintain segmentation and how they may impact women, underrepresented minorities, and the foreign-born."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION", "text": "One of the main functions of higher education in the United States is to educate a workforce that will help the country maintain its competitiveness in an increasingly global marketplace. A cursory reading of any major policy report on science and technology (S&T) training or workforce development will attest to this observation. Over the past decade, a plethora of briefs, reports, and white papers have alerted against the gradual erosion of the country's leadership position in regards to scientific and technological development (National Science Board, 2010;National Academy of Science, 2007;Anderson & Kim, 2006;National Summit on Competitiveness, 2005;American Electronics Association, 2005; National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, 2000; Jackson, 2002). A frequent thread in these reports is that the U.S. is preparing too few domestic scientists and engineers to meet economic needs and remain competitive in a globalized economy. There is much emphasis on the ways in which educational and technological competition from abroad-especially from China and India-is increasing, and that this situation poses a serious threat to U.S. national security and economic predominance. For example, in its 5-Year Strategic Plan, the Federal Coordination in STEM Education (FC-STEM) Task Force states that \u2026 [T]he United States confronts a fiercely competitive international marketplace where the advantage goes to companies that are the first to invent and produce innovative products. Inadequacies in education pathways leading to STEM degrees and into the workforce amplify concerns that the United States is failing to keep pace with its international competitors in producing a workforce with the necessary skills and knowledge to advance STEM fields (National Science and Technology Council, 2013, p. 1) As a response to the perceived threat to the nation's scientific and technological competitiveness, there has been considerable public investment in these areas. For  Among other provisions, the legislation authorized the appropriation of $5.5 billion over the 2011-2015 period for education and human resources programs administered by the National Science Foundation. In 2010, those programs received an appropriation of $873 million to support and expand information regarding STEM workforce and education (Congressional Budget Office, 2010). Similarly, in response to the notion that the U.S. is preparing too few scientists and engineers to maintain the country's global competitiveness, there have been repeated calls to drastically upgrade science and math education at the K-12 level, to improve access to university degrees in science and engineering, and to increase the number of U.S. citizens in graduate STEM programs (National Science and Technology Council, 2013;National Academy of Science, 2007;National Summit on Competitiveness, 2005;American Electronics Association, 2005; National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century, 2000;Jackson, 2002). This pervasive \"supply-side\" focus on recruiting and retaining potential STEM students is problematic in several ways. According to Metcalf (2011), the exclusive focus on attracting and retaining STEM students in higher education as a way to maintain national competitiveness is a shortsighted measure, because little thought is given to the issue of demand once these students graduate. Further, much of the research that seeks to assess the state of the STEM labor market tends to rely exclusively on wages and employment/unemployment rates. While important, the exclusive use of these measures can blind researchers to momentous changes in the employment relations model that dominated most of the 20 th century labor landscape, and their impact on STEM employment. Crucial amongst these changes have been corporate restructuring and the growth of contingent and nonstandard work arrangements in the new economy. The rise of \"peripheral workers\"-those in part-time or intermittent work arrangements-plays an important role in providing the flexibility needed in a service-based economy. Yet, at the same time, this type of employment has traditionally been considered part of what labor economists call a secondary labor market, \"a set of jobs characterized by high turnover and little opportunity for advancement\" (Tilly, 1992, p. 15). Peripheral or secondary workers often lack much o f the status, job security and benefits commonly associated with full-time, continuous employment (Morse, 1969; Barker, 1998). There is a common assumption that most parttime jobs are low-wage and low-skill. However, the last few decades witnessed \"the emergence of a highly-skilled, technical or white-collar secondary workforce\" (Barker & Christensen, 1998, p. 2). Thus a growing number of professionals and managers, who had historically enjoyed the status, privilege, and protections accorded to primary lab or market employees, find themselves amongst the ranks of peripheral or secondary labor. The impact of contingent employment on professional employment is welldocumented in an employment sector of crucial importance to STEM training: academia . The \"casualization\" of the academic labor market (Bousquet, 2008) refers to the restructuring of tenure-track faculty jobs into in non-tenure-track adjunct positions. This phenomenon is linked to declines in government spending on education and the growing corporatization of colleges and universities (Slaughter, 1993;Slaughter & Leslie, 1997;Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004;Anderson, 2001). Indeed, the growth of this sector of academic workers has led scholars like Gary Rhoades, former Secretary General of the American Association of University Professors to assert that \" [T]he future of the academic profession is connected to the working conditions of contingent faculty\" (Rhoades, 2008). Part-time faculty constitute a growing proportion of academic work, particularly in teaching. In 1970, contingent faculty were less than one-fourth (22.l%) of faculty in American higher education institutions. By 2009, this proportion had increased to 41.1% (NEA, 2007;U.S. Department of Education, 2009). Without exception, the number of parttime faculty increased between 2003 and 2009 at all institutional types in both the public and private sectors (Knapp, Kelly-Reid & Ginder, 2010). According to the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF) 1 survey of 2003-2004, the latest year for which data is available, the proportions of part-time faculty differ significantly depending on academic department. Across all disciplines, faculty most likely to be working part-time in 2003 were in departments of education (56%), fine arts (53%), and business (51%). In STEM fields, 1 The NSOPF survey was conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics in 1987Statistics in -88, 1992Statistics in -93, 1998Statistics in -99 and 2003. The survey gathered information regarding the backgrounds, responsibilities, workloads, salaries, benefits, attitudes, and plans of full-and part-time faculty. Counselors, librarians and other non-teaching staff members on the faculty pay scale are excluded from the survey, as are teaching and research assistants with classroom responsibilities. However, faculty who primarily oversee or advise students are included. field\" or \"training in an area outside of doctorate field\" as reasons for accepting their appointment. These reasons are consistent with the traditional intent of a postdoc position as a type of apprenticeship. However, by 2008, 10% of SDR respondents in a postdoc position checked \"other employment not available\" as the reason for taking their current postdoc position. This reason was given by \"9% of postdocs in the biological and agricultural sciences, 5% in the health sciences, 12% in computer sciences and mathematics, 12% in the physical sciences, 6% in the social sciences, and 16% in engineering\" (NSB, 2012, p. 167). The growth of contingent teaching appointments and postdoctoral positions represent significant shifts in the quality of employment available to some of the most highly-trained STEM workers in the U.S. However, the extent to which similar shifts in employment patterns are present in non-academic STEM employment, or at other levels of postsecondary degree attainment, is unknown. These are significant gap in the literature, considering that most of the non-professorial STEM work in the country is conducted by individuals with postsecondary qualifications other than the doctorate (National Science Board, 2010), and outside academia. Because science and engineering occupations include workers with a range of educational qualifications, and who do not work in higher education institutions, it is important to assess the extent to which phenomena like casualization and peripheral work affect STEM workers across different levels of educational achievement and in the STEM labor market as a whole. There are indicators that suggest the need to investigate the issue of contingent employment (and related trends) in STEM at a broader level. For example, The National Science Foundation (NSF) indicates that in 2006, out a total of 10,156,000 individuals employed in science and engineering fields, 13.5% (1,367,000) were employed part -time. A large majority of those employed part-time are females (National Science Foundation, 2011, p. 26, detailed statistical tables). Moreover, a report by the STEM Workforce Data Project estimates that temporary staffing agencies now supply the services of more than 100,000 STEM professionals (CPST, 2006). 2 While these numbers are small in relation to the total U.S. workforce, they nonetheless signal a departure from the secure type of employment normally associated with STEM professions. 2 The growing presence of part-time and contingent scientific labor is further suggested by the emergence of employment services agencies catered to the STEM occupations, such as Kelly Scientific Resources (KSR), a $300 million global business unit of Kelly Services, Inc. This firm claims to place \"over 400 clinical trials professionals and 4.500 scientists in temporary, temporary to hire, and direct hire positions from more than 100 locations in North America, Europe, and the Pacific Rim.\" In short, the types of questions that we ask (or fail to ask) of the available data create a picture about this important sector of the labor force; a picture with concrete consequences for higher education policy and practice. Hence, by failing to ask questions that take us beyond the supply of workers with STEM degrees, or academic employment, our picture of the STEM labor force may be sorely incomplete. There is a need to examine the degree to which the restructuring of the overall labor market over the past decades has impacted the type and quality of jobs available to highly-skilled STEM workers. How prevalent are secondary employment characteristics (such as low-pay, no benefits) among STEM jobs? Are certain groups-such as women, underrepresented minorities, and the foreign-bornmore likely to be employed in \"peripheral\" arrangements? Is there a relationship between a STEM worker's educational attainment and his or her likelihood to be employed in peripheral work? These are some of the questions explored in this study."}, {"section_title": "Purpose of the Study", "text": "The present study examined the extent to which the U.S. STEM labor market is stratified in terms of quality of employment. The study draws on Labor Market Segmentation (LMS) theory and on the literature on labor relations in the new economy. LMS theory asserts that the U.S. labor market is divided between a primary market characterized by high wages, career structures, and stable and secure employment, and a secondary market marked by low wages and fringe benefits, high labor turnover, and few possibilities for advancement or the acquisition of skills. The study examined data on individuals employed in STEM occupations to determine the degree to which the STEM workforce exhibits characteristics associated with a segmented labor market. The study addressed three main questions: The descriptive chapter compares the employment and individual characteristics of the STEM and non-STEM workers who held a postsecondary certificate or above. Because the main population of interest included STEM workers who hold STEM degrees, the second and third stages of the study focused on this group exclusively. The second stage consisted in a cluster analysis of the characteristics of the STEM and non-STEM jobs represented in the 2008 SIPP database. The main objective of the cluster analysis was to identify \"bundles\" of primary-and secondary-labor market characteristics among STEM and non-STEM jobs. The third stage was inferential in nature, and presents as series of chisquare analysis testing the likelihood of individuals with certain characteristics to be employed in each of the segments identified during the cluster analysis. The organization of the dissertation differs somewhat from the traditional pattern of Introduction, Literature Review, Theoretical Framework, Methods, Findings, and Discussion. The 3-stage structure of the research questions dictates the organization of the findings, literature review, and conclusions. The findings section will thus be divided into three stand-alone sub-chapters-descriptive statistics, cluster analysis, and chi-square analysis. Each sub-chapter will introduce a review of the literature relevant to the stage of data analysis and conclude with a preliminary discussion of the data. Then, the three sub-chapters will be linked in a final discussion and conclusion section. It is my hope that this arrangement enhances the clarity and readability of manuscript."}, {"section_title": "Justification", "text": "The reliance of highly-industrialized societies on the creation, management, and dissemination of information has increased their need for a workforce with spec ialized scientific and technological skills. Although the science and engineering workforce makes up only about 6% of the total U.S. civilian labor force (Cover, Jones & Watson, 2011), its impact on society is disproportionate to its size because of its enormous contribution to economic growth and technological innovation. Since the 1950s, occupations in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields have played an instrumental role in scientific research and development, the development of new products, and the generation of technological progress. Accordingly, the size of the STEM labor force grew dramatically in the second half of the 20 th century. From 1950 to 2007, employment in science and engineering occupations in the U.S. increased at an average annual growth rate of 6.2% (National Science Board, 2010). This sustained growth, which is expected to continue, greatly exceeded the 1.6% average growth rate for the total workforce in the same period. Employment in STEM fields is widely considered to be amongst the most desirable in terms of its higher wages and relative stability compared to other occupations. Although some differences exist by field of expertise, STEM occupations are by and large highpaying occupations. The average annual wage for all STEM occupations was $77,880 in May 2009 (Cover, Jones & Watson, 2011), compared to the $45,559 annual average for the entire population (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009). Likewise, unemployment among science and engineering occupations has been low when compared to the overall U.S. workforce. In the 22-year period from 1983-2004, the unemployment rate for all individuals in science and engineering occupations ranged from a low of 1.4% in 1999 to a high of 4.6% in 2003. In contrast, the unemployment rate for the entire U.S. workforce raged from 3.9% to 9.9% in the same period (National Science Board, 2006). Employment rates generally increase with educational level and are highest for doctoral graduates (Auriol, 2010) and professional degree holders (Mullin, 2011). Despite the generally optimistic outlook for STEM occupations presented by national agencies and policymakers, it is necessary to take a more critical look at the current state of the STEM workforce in the U.S. As I mention in the introduction, there is a need to examine the type and quality of jobs available to highly-skilled STEM workers beyond average wages and the employment/unemployment dichotomy. Likewise, the very definition of \"STEM workforce\" requires reconsideration, particularly in terms of the educational attainment of those counted as STEM workers. For example, the STEM Workforce Data Project cited above does not indicate the educational attainment of the STEM professionals employed by temporary staffing agencies. This omission is significant. Too often, discussions of science and engineering workforce often focus exclusively on individuals who hold baccalaureate and post-baccalaureate degrees. Because of its importance to R&D, the doctoral degree is often singled out for analysis (National Science Board, 2006). 3 STEM workforce studies and reports that include sub-baccalaureate degree attainment are rare. However, outside academia, only 10% of individuals working in science and engineering had a doctorate degree in 2000. That same year, 45% of the nonacademic science and engineering workforce had bachelor's degrees, 20% had master's degrees, and about 23% had not earned a bachelor's degree (CPS, 2000). According to a report issued by the National Science Board, \"many individuals who have not earned a bachelor's degree enter the labor force with marketable technical skills from technical and vocational school training (with or without earned associate's degrees), college courses, and on -the-job training\" (2006, p. 3-16). Although many STEM occupations require a bachelor's degree or higher, it is necessary to keep in mind that the science and engineering workforce comprises not only researchers and educators, but also technicians, technologists, and managers. The educational requirements for these latter occupations vary and include sub-baccalaureate education, including high school diplomas, certificates, and associates degrees. Failing to include this important component of the STEM workforce constitutes a significant ga p in our understanding of this important group. Because science and engineering occupations include workers with a range of educational qualifications, it is important to assess the extent to which phenomena like casualization and peripheral work affect STEM workers across different levels of educational achievement. By going beyond both supply-side workforce estimates and the employment/unemployment dichotomy, the proposed study veers from previous STEM workforce studies, and instead seeks to reach a more complete picture of the employment landscape for individuals in STEM occupations. The theoretical lens of the segmented labor market redirects our attention to the \"grey areas\" of STEM employment such as part -time employment, second job tenure, and access to benefits."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "One of the main limitations of this study is that it presents a snapshot of the STEM labor market at a fixed point in time. Although the SIPP dataset is a longitudinal instrument with great potential to create panel datasets, time constraints forced me to focus exclusively on the 2008 survey (waves 1, 2, 3 & 6). Moreover, the STEM sample included only those individuals who were employed at the time the SIPP 2008 survey took place, and who remained both in the SIPP universe AND employed in the subsequent waves of interest (2, 3, and 6). That means that the findings of the study are only generalizable for these respondents, and cannot be extended to workers who may have left the SIPP universe (e.g. became institutionalized or left the country), or who may have been employed in one SIPP wave but not in another. This is an important caveat, in that the 2008 -2009 period (which comprises the SIPP waves used in this study) was marked by extraordinary turbulence in both the US and global labor markets. The present study cannot account, for example, for SIPP respondents who were employed at the time of the first wave, but who lost their jobs at a later point. I hope to redress this shortcoming in future research by focusing in changes in STEM employment across time. At the same time, using SIPP to study STEM employment presents a number of challenges and limitations to the researcher. As a non-dedicated STEM survey, SIPP does not collect data on variables of great relevance to STEM, such as the postsecondary institution(s) attended by the respondents (which could provide valuable information regarding institutional selectivity or academic competitiveness), or questions which explicitly ask whether the respondents work in the same field of study as their highest degree. As I mention in Chapter 4, an important indicator of STEM labor market conditions is the proportion reporting that a job in their degree field was not available. The involuntarily out-of-field (IOF) rate is a measure unique to NSF's labor force surveys, and can be a valuable indicator of labor market conditions for STEM workers because the latter often prefer, but cannot always find, work that uses knowledge and skills related to their education (NSB, 2010). Likewise, because it is not focused exclusively on STEM employment, it is possible that the sampling strategy used in SIPP underestimates the number of minorities in STEM occupations. Similarly, some of the variables included in SIPP limit the type of analyses that a researcher can make. For example, SIPP asks respondents to report their highest degree of educational attainment and the corresponding field of knowledge. As such, in this study, I had to use highest degree to determine whether an individual had a STEM degree or a non-STEM degree. The analysis therefore could not distinguish between individuals who may have, for example, a STEM bachelor's degree and a non-STEM graduate degree, or vice versa. Finally, the study's exploratory design does not control for the influence that variables such as age, occupational field, work experience, or workers' ability might have in determining cluster allocation."}, {"section_title": "Scope of the Study", "text": "My interest in this topic is sociological rather than econometric. This means that, in designing the study, I was more interested in identifying segmentation trends (if present) than in proving the existing of distinct wage-setting structures for different segments of the labor market, or the existence of mobility barriers between segments. These are areas o f research that have long occupied LMS scholars in the field of economics, and over which many debates have ensued (Pedace, 2006). The present study is not an attempt to contribute to those debates; rather, its objective is far more modest. The aim is to u se core elements of LMS theory to create a more complete picture of the state of STEM employment in the U.S. in light of employment restructuring trends of the past three decades, such as the growth of part-time and contingent work. These trends are known to have changed traditional work arrangements among professionals and other white-collar jobs. By going beyond both supply-side workforce estimates and the employment/unemployment dichotomy, the proposed study moves away from previous STEM workforce studies, and instead seeks to reach a more complete picture of the employment landscape for STEM workers. The present study falls under the body of work that has focused on the quality of employment rather than manpower tallies and projections (Freeman, 2004(Freeman, , 2006. It is therefore crucial to note that the purpose of this study is not to predict future employment trends in STEM fields. Over the past three decades, labor economists, governmental agencies and professional associations have presented forecasts of STEM workforce needs and prospects (e.g. CPST, 2006). Most of these analyses have been fraught with methodological problems, and they disagreed not only about the scope and nature of future STEM workforce needs, but about whether there would be shortages or surpluses Teitelbaum, 2003;Zusman, 2005). Indeed, the fluid economic, political and demographic environment makes projections of the labor market for scientists and engineers very difficult. On the demand side, for example, unexpected external events such as wars, new technologies, or changes in national and state priorities can steer demand towards certain fields and away from others. On the supply side, predictions about PhD workforce are further complicated by the fact that there is no single labor market for STEM graduates. Zusman (2005) observes that, \"whether the outlook is strong or weak depends on very particular subfields and differs by type of position, type of institution, and region of the country.\" Similarly, significant differences might exist by type of industry (e.g., academic vs. non-academic, for-profit vs. nonprofit) and the demographics of STEM-degree holders . Finally, workforce projections themselves can \"influence decisions by individuals, institutions, and government, thereby altering the future demand/supply ratio\" (Zusman, 2005). Student and worker supply, for example, is subject to \"boom and bust\" cycles (Freeman, 1976) closely tied to perceptions about the job market. For example, when jobs in a certain field appear plentiful, many more individuals might apply to university programs in that field. However, because of the lag between job market needs and degree production, \"job shortages are inevitably followed by surpluses and surpluses by shortages\" (Zusman, 2005). In this respect, it is important to note that public perception about future career prospects can weigh as much in a student's decision to pursue or not a STEM degree as tallies of current jobs available. These perceptions \"are not just the result of inflamed media commentators\" ; rather, they are legitimized by official projections and corporate announcements about workforce needs and prospects. In short, it is extremely difficult-if not currently impossible-to forecast employment and trends with sufficient accuracy to be helpful for either potential students trying to decide whether or not to pursue careers in science and engineering, or for policymakers trying to inform decisions about funding for these fields. This is not to say that the study of employment patterns is not possible or useful. The present study approaches STEM employment from a \"total compensation\" perspective (Ghillarducci & Lee, 2005) that considers not only wages, but other important aspects such as unionization, second job tenure, part-time employment, and access to health and retirement benefits. The objective is to create a fuller picture of the employment landscape for individuals in STEM professional, technical, and health-related occupations."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2: THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK", "text": "In this chapter I introduce the theoretical framework that will guide the study. First, I identify the historical evolution on LMS theory, and identify its main tenets. Next, I discuss the diversity of employment characteristics inherent within the primary labor market, and importance of acknowledging this diversity to reach more subtle understanding of segmentation among highly-skilled jobs. Finally, I stress the importance of adapting LMS concepts to better capture some of the momentous changes in labor relations brought about by the new economy."}, {"section_title": "Labor Market Segmentation Theory", "text": "Labor market segmentation (LMS) theory was advanced in the early 1970s as a challenge to human capital theory and neoclassical economic theory, the leading frameworks for studying labor markets at the time. The basic premise of human capital theory is that education endows individuals with skills and knowledge that make them more productive; higher productivity is then rewarded through higher earnings. As educational rates in a country increase, the markets will adjust to equalize productivity and compensation for workers with higher levels of education or training. Finally, human theory assumed that access to labor market sectors is open to all qualified workers, regardless of other personal characteristics such as race or gender (Olson, 1997;Strober, 1998 ). In contrast, LMS theory advanced the notion that access to jobs in certain sectors is not be completely open, but may be subject to non-price rationing-that is, rationing of scarce goods (jobs) among competing users , as well as t o overt and covert discriminatory mechanisms. Early proponents of LMS theory observed that certain social groups, such as ethnic minorities, women, and low-income individuals had access to different types of jobs than their White male counterparts. The jobs available to the former groups were characterized by less desirable working conditions, promotional opportunities, and wages (Reich, Gordon & Edwards, 1973). The persistent labor marginalization of women, minority and low-income individuals stood in direct opposition to the neoclassical economy prediction that, as profit-maximizing employers evaluate workers in terms of their individual human capital characteristics (such as years of education, degrees, and training), group characteristics such as gender and race would become irrelevant in a competitive labor market. LMS scholars observed that, by and large, this prediction failed to be reflected in the American labor market. LMS researchers also questioned the neoclassical assumption that wages, like pric es, are flexible, and that labor markets tend to equilibrate (\"clear\") supply and demand of existing jobs through wage fluctuations. In the neoclassical view, unemployment is a selfcorrecting problem: an excess supply of labor exerts a downward pressure on wages, while a reduction in wages in turn reduces unemployment by raising the quantity of labor demanded (Mankiw, 2008). LMS researchers countered that wages do not always adjust to clear the market, and that they may be determined by more than simply supply and demand. For example, in sectors where there is a high cost (i.e. search, recruitment, and training costs) associated with replacing highly skilled or specialized workers, employers may offer above-market wages, as well as other incentives (e.g. benefits) to increase worker efficiency and loyalty. In this way, the influence of wages on worker efficiency and retention could partly explain why firms may fail to cut wages despite an excess supply of labor (Mankiw, 2008). Implicit in the efficiency wage hypothesis proposed by LMS scholars was the idea that high wages are usually correlated to other good job characteristics, such as employment stability or access to employer-provided benefits (Tilly, 1996;Hudson, 2007). Indeed, one of the major principles of LMS theory was the \"bundling\" of desirable job characteristics: firms that offer high wages in exchange for highly specialized effort are also likely to exhibit low-turnover and other \"good job\" characteristics, such as employment stability and internal job ladders. In contrast, firms that offer low-wages are also likely to have highturnover, poor working conditions, and little chance of advancement. This concept constituted an important difference from neoclassical models of the labor market, whic h assumed that workers in jobs with otherwise undesirable characteristics receive compensating (higher) wages. Thus, the fundamental tenet of LMS theory is that labor markets are divided into essentially distinct segments characterized \"not only by earnings differentials, but also by qualitative differences in working conditions, methods of skill acquisition, job mobility patterns, and work norms or rules\" (Gray & Chapman, 2004, p. 117, emphasis mine). The classical formulation of segmentation by Doeringer and Piore states that \u2026the labor market is divided into a primary and a secondary market. Jobs in the primary market possess several of the following characteristics: high wages, good working conditions, employment stability, chances of advancement, equit y, and due process in work rules. Jobs in the secondary market, in contrast, tend to have low wages and fringe benefits, poor working conditions, high labor turnover, little chance of advancement, and often arbitrary and capricious supervision (1971, p. 165). LMS theory also proposed that the boundaries between segments are rigid and \"ensure that workers and jobs are matched within segments, regardless of demand -supply processes in other segments\" (Bauder, 2001, p. 38). While potential employees may compete with each other within each segment, there is little competition and therefore little mobility across segments (i.e. from the secondary market to the primary and vice versa). From a sociological perspective, segmentation can be viewed as a form of social closure-the action whereby collectivities with privileged access to rewards or opportunities exclude outsiders and maintain privileges to their own kind. The professions are a classic example of this exclusionary mechanism (Parkin, 1974). LMS theory extends the notion of social closure by proposing that closure is not only promoted by the members of a privileged group (e.g. professionals), but by the employers themselves. In this regard, unions and professional organizations can be seen as contributing to the creation and maintenance of segmentation by \"ensuring that companies adopt employment practices that are beneficial to their members and protecting their members against competition from new arrivals in the labor market\" (Abercrombie, Hill & Turner, 2006, p. 215)."}, {"section_title": "Dual Market Theory and the Sub-Division of the Primary Market", "text": "LMS theory shares a conceptual heritage and vocabulary with dual market or dual economy theory (Averitt, 1968;Galbraith, 1973). Both approaches were concerned with the persistence of poverty and underemployment in the U.S. in spite of general economic prosperity in the post-World War II period (Gray & Chapman, 2004, p. 118). This interest led to the development of a framework that would help examine \"the historical process whereby political economic forces encourage the division of the labor market into separate submarkets, or segments, distinguished by different labor market characteristics and behavioral rules\" (Reich et al., 1973, p. 359). Proponents of each approach developed different causal arguments about the origin and maintenance of this labor market \"balkanization.\" For dual market theorists, labor market structure was a reflection of industrial structure. The latter was conceptually divided into \"core\" and \"periphery\" sectors. \"Core\" industries were highly monopolistic, productive and profitable, whereas those in the \"periphery\" were characterized by high competitiveness, low-productivity, and low-profitability. These differences in turn were supposed to determine the types of jobs available in each sector. \"Thus, those in the periphery (competitive) sector will receive lower incomes and lower returns to education, and do so in more dangerous, less pleasant, and more precarious jobs than those employed in the core (monopoly) sector\" (Friedman, 1984, p. 185). In other words: \"core\" industries would tend to offer primary market jobs and \"periphery\" industries to offer secondary market ones. However, the empirical evidence suggested a far more complex picture-for example, \"core\" firms may also offer significant number of secondary market jobs. In response, LMS theorists shifted their attention away from industrial structure to a more systematic focus on the nature of jobs available in each of the market segments. This entailed addressing the fact that many primary market jobs may have characteristics of secondary market jobs and vice versa. Although further refinements of the segmentation model tend to adhere to the basic division between primary and secondary markets, subsequent models proposed subdividing the primary and secondary markets into upper and lower tiers (e.g. Piore, 1973Piore, , 1975Osterman, 1975). Later scholarship also suggested tripartite (Rumberger & Carnoy, 1980) and quadruple (Lee & Wrench, 1987) segmentation models, as well as hierarchical segmentation models (Gittleman and Howell, 1995)."}, {"section_title": "The Position of Women, Ethnic Minorities, and Immigrants in the Labor Market", "text": "Something common to all segmentation models is that they focus on the nature of jobs (demand side), which also means moving away from focusing on the nature of the people in those jobs (supply side). Gray and Chapman (2004) assert that this is not a simple difference in emphasis, but rather a fundamental point of departure from the neoclassical labor market models. In contrast to the neoclassical \"wage-competition model,\" LMS theorists such as Thurow (1972) posited a \"job-competition model\" focused on the demand side and structure of occupational opportunities. In this model, an individual's wage is determined not by demand and supply by \"by the distribution of job opportunities in the economy and an individual's relative position in the [job] queue\" (Gray & Chapman, 2004, p. 120). In other words, access to primary market jobs is restricted in the sense that not all who want or are qualified to work there are able to do so. The wage efficiency hypothesis-the idea that wages are determined by more than supply and demand moving towards equilibrium-is relevant in this respect. The hypothesis presupposes that firms with higher wages are likely to attract more able job-seekers. In a situation where there are more qualified applicants than positions available, the employer can pick and choose among applicants to hire the best possible. In this scenario, there will still be many qualified workers who do not get hired. 4 This situation results in \"queuing\" for these jobs in the form of unemployment, sub-employment, or job queues among employed workers (Thurow, 1972;. Thurow (1975) suggests that an applicant to a job cannot increase the odds of being hired by lowering his or her asking wage; this is because wage levels are determined by institutional and market forces, such as those posed by the efficiency hypothesis described above. In situations where there is an excess of applicants for a particular job, there is a queue of candidates at the firm's door. In these circumstances, \"[a]pplicants are sorted according to what the firm perceives as hiring and on-the-job training costs associated with each individual, with the least costly put at the front of the line\" (Lee, 1993, p. 74). Significantly, gender and racial prejudice can also determine an individual's position in queue. The concept of \"queuing\" offers some insight into the mechanisms th rough which women, members of racial/ethnic minorities, and immigrants can be allocated to secondary labor markets. For example, immigrants-as new entrants in the labor market-have historically been in weak positions and tended to be found in the secondary labor markets (Hudson, 2007). In recent decades, new migratory policies sought to encourage the migration of highly-skilled individuals into the U.S., most notably in STEM fields. Despite these policies, there are additional costs and red tape to hiring foreigners, which might discourage employers from hiring them. Similarly, most new immigrants do not meet the citizenship requirements of firms with defense contracts (Lee, 1993), which constitute a significant source of funding in a range of STEM fields. Hudson (2007) argues that, as discrimination along gender, racial and ethnic lines becomes socially and legally discouraged, new ways of meeting the demands of both public and private employers for low-wage, low cost workers have evolved-namely nonstandard and noncitizen labor. As mentioned above, at the heart of nonstandard labor is a fundamental restructuring of the employer-employee relationship in which employment becomes increasingly contingent. The result is that \"organization membership is no longer a dichotomy but a matter of degree. Workers are attached to work organizations at various levels and through various forms of affiliation\" (p.289). The rise of nonstandard labor is a hallmark of neoliberal labor policies that seek to maximize employer flex ibility in an economy driven by rapid technological innovation. This \"new economy\" has so radically altered labor relations that some of the central tenets of classical LMS theory require reconsideration. I explore this issue in greater detail in the next section."}, {"section_title": "LMS Theory in the New Economy", "text": "Many of the conceptual underpinnings of LMS are so widely accepted in sociological work that they have become commonplace shorthand in discussions of stratification and social mobility. For example, the division of primary and secondary labor-markets has now passed into conventional thought, with the primary labor-market generally denoting secure jobs and good conditions. Jobs in the secondary market are in turn understood to include \"small employers, non-unionized sectors of the economy, and highly fragmented and competitive industries such as retailing, where jobs are less secure and conditions of work and pay generally poorest\" (Marshall, 1998). However, scholars like Tilly and Tilly (1994) have stressed the fact that much of the theoretical work in labor market-including LMS theory-have failed to keep up with the great changes taking place in employment relations worldwide. The analytical distinction between an upper and lower tier in the primary market offers a case in point. The division is certainly more nuanced-and therefore more analytically useful-than the \"good jobs\" and \"bad jobs\" dichotomy proposed by early segmentation work. Indeed, the considerable decline in manufacturing employment in the U.S. make the analytical division of the primary sector indispensable to analysis of contemporary labor markets (Gray & Chapman, 2006). However, the categorical subdivision of the primary market may not adequately reflect the momentous changes that have taken place in modes of production and employment relations over the past 30 years-changes linked to what is popularly known as the \"new economy.\" Also known as \"the new global economy,\" the new economy refers to the shift from an industrial/manufacturing-based wealth producing economy into an export-oriented, technology-driven mode of production that relies primarily on a highly-qualified and flexible workforce (Torres & Schugurensky, 2002). The information technology revolution entails more than the advent of new technologies such as cellular phones, personal computers, and the Internet. It also means that national economies are more strongly dependent on knowledge production, distribution and use than ever before and that knowledge intensive service sectors (especially education, communications and information) are the faster growing parts of western economies, which, in turn, are attracting high levels of public and private investment (Olssen and Peters, 2005, p. 334). Concurrent with the rise of a knowledge-driven mode of production was the introduction of a series of policies based on a theory of political economy which predicted that social and individual well-being could be improved \"by maximizing the reach and frequency of market transactions\" (Harvey, 2005, p. 3). Proponents of this ideology, commonly known as \"neoliberalism,\" view the market as the core institution of modern capitalist societies, and believe that freedom of the market and trade guarantee individual freedoms and prosperity. Neoliberalism proposes that national and international policies should be subservient to the needs of the markets, and consequently emphasizes deregulation and reduction of the state as a way of promoting competition and efficiency. At the domestic level, competition implies that the public sector must be reduced to a basic regulator role to ensure the conditions for a free market. At the international level, competition is to be promoted through three broad measures commonly associated with structural adjustment policies: free trade in goods and services, free circulation of capital, and freedom of investment across borders (George, 1999). The concurrent ascendance of knowledge as global capital and of neoliberal policies marked a fundamental departure from industrial era notions of business organization and work arrangements. Among the main changes are the decline of unions, the growth of contingent labor, and the increase of immigrant labor (Hudson, 2007). For example, as a consequence of the shift from a manufacturing to a service-based economy, the proportion of U.S. wage and salary workers affiliated with a labor union has steadily declined over the last decades. In 1955, 33% of the U.S. workforce was affiliated with a labor union (Hudson, 2010). By 2010, the union membership rate had declined to 11.9% (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2011). Because union membership has been historically associated with important benefits to the worker-such as higher wages better fringe benefits, and greater job tenure (Mayer, 2004), its decline has contributed to the wage and benefit bifurcation in the U.S. workforce. Further, a common criticism of the neoliberal regime is that individuals must gain access to benefits access to benefits such as education, health, and contentment in old age \"through purchase in a competitive market\" (Rose & Miller, 2008, p. 101) rather than through government intervention. In this view, neoliberalism as a mentality of government in which the well-being of both political and social existence is to be ensured not b y centralized planning and bureaucracy, but through the 'enterprising' activities and choices of autonomous entities-businesses, organizations, persons-each striving to maximize its own advantage by inventing and promoting new projects by means of individual and local calculations of strategies and tactics, costs, and benefits (Rose, 1998, p. 153). Under neoliberalism, then, individuals are responsible for their own success in the labor market, with little consideration for existing social structures (e. g., gender, race, socioeconomic status) that may prevent individuals from accessing education and other essential resources (see Cruikshank, 2002;Fenwick, 2004). Likewise, because under a neoliberal regime individuals are responsible for their personal well-being, new policies introduced \"do-it-yourself\" pension systems, such as defined contribution 401(k) retirement accounts. 5 In 1986, Congress replaced the defined benefit plan for federal civilian workers (CSRS) with a less generous defined benefit plan (FERS) and a generous 401(k)-type plan (TSP). This decision constituted an explicit \"endorsement\" of the sustainability of defined contribution plan to which employees can contribute an amount of their choice. It encouraged private-sector employers to be confident about the long-term survivability of 401(k)-type plans, which had been the subject of regulatory disputes for years. Since that time, 401(k) plans have become the fastest growing type of retirement plan in the United States (Employee Benefit Research Institute, 2005). Two final organizational changes that have characterized the new economy are corporate restructuring and the use of contingent and nonstandard work arrangements. At the heart of these changes \"is a fundamental restructuring of the employer-employee relationship in which many jobs, and the workers who fill them, have become increasingly contingent\" (Hudson, 2007, p. 289). The shift to greater reliance on nonstandard work arrangements has important implications in terms of the configuration that labor market segmentation can take. As mentioned earlier, one of the major contributions of LMS research was calling attention to how race and sex have been used historically to allocate workers to specific labor market segments. However, contemporary LMS researchers like Hudson (2007) believe that nonstandard labor has largely replaced overt gender and racial discrimination as a way of maintaining a low-wage, low cost workforce. A steady supply of 5 A 401(k) plan is a cash or deferred arrangement under which a covered employee can elect to have a portion of his or her compensation (otherwise payable in cash) contributed to a qualified retirement plan as a pre -tax reduction in salary. Employers have the discretion whether or not to make matchi ng contributions to their workers' 401(k) accounts. Assets may be invested in a wide variety of investment vehicles such as stocks and bonds, among others. The plans are named after the section of the Internal Revenue Code in which they appear, and apply to private-sector employers. Similar salary-deferral retirement plans are authorized in the tax code for public-sector employees (known as 457 plans) and nonprofit-sector employees (known as 403(b) plans) (EBRI, 2005). noncitizen-immigrants seems to play a similar role. Indeed, by 2010 immigrants comprised 12.9% of the U.S. population and 15.6% of the total civilian labor force (MPI, 2011). Because noncitizen and immigrant workers have great difficulty obtaining jobs in the primary labor market, they tend to concentrate in low-wage, low-skill occupations."}, {"section_title": "The New Economy and STEM training and labor", "text": "The broad changes brought about by neoliberalism in the new economy have profound implications for STEM training and labor. As knowledge becomes the most important form of global capital, a fundamental rethinking of the traditional relationships between education, learning and work takes place (Olssen & Peters, 2005, p. 334). As the main producer of a highly-skilled workforce, postsecondary education is of key importance here. For example, the reliance of highly-industrialized societies on the creation, management, and dissemination of information has increased their dependency on postsecondary education for training, research, and high-technology innovation (Slaughter, 1998). Similarly, in response to the shift from a nation-state, industrial-based production model to a global postindustrial production model, higher education itself is moving into new modes of production based on market logic, revenue generation, competition, and private sector gains (Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004;Slaughter & Leslie, 1997). The increased focus on competition and efficiency has resulted in a significant restructuring of the academic labor force (Gappa, 2000), shaped by three interrelated phenomena: 1) Drastic reductions in the numbers of tenured and tenured-tracked positions relative to numbers of part-time and contingent positions, including adjunct and postdoctoral positions; 2) A concomitant degree of job instability and few opportunities for collective action (such as unionization) for part-time and contingent laborers; and 3) a growing internationalization of academic and scientific labor markets through steady inflow of international students and scientists. Beyond academia, the impact of the new economy on traditional labor relations has also been felt among the high-skills primary labor market, to which scientific and technological employees are commonly assumed to belong. Scholars have called attention to the corporate restructuring and the use of contingent and nonstandard work arrangements even amongst occupations traditionally associated with primary market employment ( Barker and Christensen, 1998). In the case of the U.S., some of the features associated with the primary market (such as internal markets and career ladders) have been altered by the ongoing restructuring initiated by large corporations in the 1990s. Over the past 20 years, the downsizing of \"core\" companies-traditionally seen as the main sources of primary jobs-resulted in a significant erosion of job security in this segment of the labor force. Among the trends away from \"classic\" forms of employment and production which have drastically changed the employment landscape-and consequently outdating many theoretical assumptions-are temporary or part-time labor, franchises, deliberate stimulation of turnover to reduce seniority payments and worker organization, commission sales, and household production by means of computers and telecommunications\" (Tilly & Tilly, 1994, p. 307). Even though precise estimates of the spread of contingent work are difficult due to the absence of longitudinal data, three observations seem warranted: 1) a significant proportion of the U.S. population is employed contingently; 2) this proportion has increased over the past two decades; and 3) technicians, professionals and managers constitute a greater proportion of the contingent labor force than in the past (Kunda et al., 2002;Barker and Christensen, 1998). In 1990, most part-time and temporary workers worked for one organization or employment agency. About two-thirds were employed in fast food services or in retail sales. In contrast, by the early-2000's, a growing proportion of part-timers and temporary workers were self-employed and worked in occupations requiring high levels of training and skill, such as webpage design, public relations, and consulting (Ho, Ang, & Straub, 2003). The changes in labor relations over the past three decades pose an important challenge to classical LMS theory, which traditionally assumed that characteristics such as job instability and contingent work were restricted to low-skill secondary employment. A second complication is that the distinction between \"good\" and \"bad\" job characteristics seems to be more fluid than in the 1960s and 1970s. There is a degree of ambiguity over the extent to which the marginalizing effects of non-standard employment (e.g. unequal pay, training, career opportunities) apply to professional and managerial occupations. Some scholars argue that the shift to contractual labor is still likely to result in marginalization and unequal treatment at work-in terms of training opportunities, career advancementespecially for women (Hoque & Kirkpatrick, 2003). In contrast, other scholars find that the negative consequences of contingent work are likely to be less pronounced among professionals and managers. Among the highly-skilled contingent labor can have many advantages, such as more opportunities to balance work and life commitments, higher compensation levels, and increased flexibility (e.g. Albert and Bradley, 1997). The common ground between these perspectives is that, unless researchers take into account the existence and growth of highly skilled contingent work, the literature will be missing an important aspect of contemporary labor markets. By overlooking highly skilled contingent work, researchers run the risk of \"confounding the effects of contracting with the correlates of low-skill occupations\" (Kunda et al., 2002, p. 237). Together, these suggest the need for analyses that emphasize the complexity and change that characterize STEM employment. With this in mind, my intention in this study is to use LMS theory as a departure point to investigate current trends in STEM occupations. This approach calls for a significant adaptation of LMS theory to the STEM labor submarket. In the following chapter, I present an overview of the difficulties in defining who counts and who does not count as a STEM worker, and I discuss the impact different definitions have on estimating the size of the STEM workforce. I then outline the definition of STEM I used in the study before moving on to the data analysis chapters."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3: THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE STEM WORKFORCE AND STEM POSTSECONDARY PRODUCTION", "text": "In this chapter, I provide an overview of the literature on STEM postsecondary degree production, and the challenges of defining the STEM labor market.

In addition to knowledge creation (through research and knowledge development) and dissemination, two functions of postsecondary educati on generally highlighted in policymaking are the training of a highly-skilled workforce and, particularly in the case of graduate education, maintaining the research capability necessary for scientific and technological innovation (National Science Board, 2010;OECD 2008). In 2007, STEM degrees accounted for about 23% of more than 2.9 million associate's, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees awarded in the U.S. (NSB, 2010). Following is a brief overview of trends in STEM degrees at the undergraduate and graduate levels. As noted in the introduction, most discussions of science and engineering workforce tend to focus exclusively on individuals who hold baccalaureate and postbaccalaureate degrees. However, \"many individuals who have not earned a bachelo r's degree enter the labor force with marketable technical skills from technical and vocational school training (with or without earned associate's degrees), college courses, and on -the-job training\" (National Science Board, 2006, p. 3-16). Because of the relative scarcity of the literature focusing on the role of community colleges in contributing to the STEM workforce, the distribution of associate's degrees in STEM fields is given special attention."}, {"section_title": "STEM Postsecondary Production at the Bachelor's Degree Level", "text": "The baccalaureate accounts for more than 70% of all STEM degrees awarded in the U.S., thus making it the most prevalent type of degree in these fields. In 2007, a total of 485,800 STEM degrees were awarded, compared to 366,000 in 1993 (NSB, 2010). Science and engineering bachelor's degrees have consistently accounted for about one-third of all bachelor's degrees for the past 15 years. As Table 1 shows, in 2007, a total of 485,772 degrees were granted in STEM fields. Of these, a large proportion was awarded in social sciences 6 (31%) and psychology (18.6%). Agricultural and biological sciences accounted for 20% of all earned bachelor's degrees, followed by engineering at 14%, and mathematics and computer sciences (12%) (NSB, 2010). Community colleges, which enroll 44% of all U.S. undergraduates and 41% of all first-time postsecondary students, represent the fastest growing segment in higher education (AACC, 2009). As of January 2009, there were 1,117 community colleges in the U.S. (Snyder & Dillow, 2011). In addition to preparing students for transfer to 4-year institutions, community colleges also provide terminal programs in professional or technical fields. Community colleges represent an important entry point to higher education for many underrepresented populations in higher education. A large proportion of students who belong to ethnic and racial minorities are concentrated in 2-year colleges: 52% of all Native American undergraduates are enrolled in community colleges, as are 45% of all Asian/Pacific islander undergraduates, 43% of all Black undergraduates, and 52% of all Hispanic postsecondary students (AACC, 2009).Compared with 4-year institutions, community colleges enroll greater proportions of low-income, first-generation, minority, immigrant, part-time, older, and academically underprepared students (NSB, 2010). The National Science Board (2010, 2012) stresses the significant role of community colleges in providing the education and training needed for STEM or STEM-related occupations that require less than a bachelor's degree (such as certificates or associate's degrees). Furthermore, community colleges provide the first 2 years of many students' education before they transfer to an STEM program at a 4-year institutions (AACC, 2009;Karp, 2008;NSB, 2010 Similarly, attendance is higher among Hispanic and black S&E graduates than for whites or Asians. Finally, \"more than half of the S&E graduates who reported that their fathers or mothers had less than a high school diploma attended a community college, compared to about one-third of those whose fathers or mothers had a professional or a doctoral degree\" (NSB, 2012, p. 2-8). According to estimates by the National Science Board (2012), in 2009 associate's degrees accounted comprised 7.5% of all STEM degrees awarded in the US, making it the third largest level of degree attainment in science and engineering (Table 2).

After the National Science Board, in this study I use a definition of the STEM workforce that is broader than those being employed by some other agencies, including the National Science Foundation. The National Science Board advocates for a definition of STEM that includes \"all individuals educated in S&E fields and using their skills in their jobs, not just those officially classified as a 'scientist' or 'engineer'\" (Crosby & Pomeroy, 2004, p. 25). Per this definition, individuals trained in the health and medical professions are included among the STEM workforce, even though the medical workforce is large and complex in itself. At the same time, the definition includes individuals who rely on STEM training/knowledge in their work activities, such as technicians and technologists in a variety of fields. The definition proposed by the National Science Board takes us closer to a consideration of \"science and technology occupations\" rather than \"scientific occupations. This distinction is more than just semantic as \"science and technology occupations\" covers not just scientists but also science technicians. Likewise, engineering and surveying occupations include engineering technicians and drafters, and computer occupations range from computer support specialists to computer software engineers (Langdon, McKittrick, Beede, Khan & Doms, 2011). To determine those professional and technical occupations that would be considered in the study, I first combined those occupations recognized as STEM by the NSF and the NSB, respectively. The NSF's definition is the most conservative: included are professionals in computer and mathematical science, engineers, life scientists, physical scientists, social scientists. To these occupations, the National Science Boa rd adds Health Diagnosing and Treating professionals, including physicians and surgeons and dentist, among others. The rationale for their inclusion is the broad knowledge and skills in areas such as biology, chemistry and physics among these professionals, which may begin to develop as early as high school and is an important part of their postsecondary training. The NSB also recognizes more technical occupations as part of the STEM workforce than the NSF. However, there are a number of technical occupations which the NSB does not include in its list of STEM occupations, but which fit the STEM knowledge/skills criteria outlined by the Board. I have included these technical occupations in a separate category called \"Other STEM technicians/technologists,\" as shown in Table 7. Including not only individuals who had at least one degree in an S&E field, but also those in related fields, such as health and technology, may result in a more accurate representation of the many ways science and technical knowledge is used in the United States. With this definition in mind, I isolated the science and technology occupations that were included in the SIPP database. The SIPP 2008 database uses the 2000 Bureau of Labor Statistics' Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). This classification went through several revisions in 2010, in that some broad occupational fields were subdivided into more detailed categories, while some occupations that had stood alone in the 2000 classification were consolidated in the 2010 revision.  The criteria of use of STEM skills and knowledge also led me to not include some technical fields that at first glance are quite similar to those included in Table 7. For example, I did not include the \"Nursing, psychiatric, and home health aides\" category because this SOC 2000 category includes two occupational types with different training/skills. On the one hand, nursing aides require some postsecondary certificate in which they learn the basic principles of nursing; on the other hand, however, home aides typically require no formal training and may or may not use STEM knowledge/skills i n carrying out their duties. Finally, although the National Science Board advocates for including lawyers who rely greatly on STEM knowledge in their practice, I excluded the category of \"lawyers\" from my working definition. This is because SIPP does not contain enough information to determine which lawyers use their STEM expertise and which do not. Because of data limitations, K-12 teaching jobs are not included. Although the 2008 SIPP collected detailed information on workers' occupations, it does not break out educators by their specific field. As a result, it is not possible to distinguish math and science teachers from other teachers. In the case of postsecondary teachers, an approximation was possible, since professors tend to teach within their major field of study (see Appendix). In the following chapter, I present the descriptive statistics for the STEM and non -STEM workforces from inspection of the 2008 SIPP database. I frame the findings with a brief overview of measures for assessing the state of the STEM labor market used by highimpact STEM reports on the one hand, and LMS research, on the other."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 4: DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS", "text": "As mentioned in the introduction, this study seeks to explore the degree to which job characteristics usually associated with secondary markets permeate STEM employment in the US, under what circumstances, and for whom. To answer this question, it is necessary to establish first the main characteristics of the STEM workforce, especially in relation to their non-STEM counterparts. The aim of this chapter, then, is to create an overall picture of the STEM and non-STEM workforces from inspection of the 2008 SIPP database. This descriptive stage is a necessary first step to identifying secondary-market characteristics among STEM jobs, as evidenced in the proportion of STEM employees with no employerprovided benefits and the prevalence of part-time employment, among others. In the first part of this chapter, I provide a brief overview of measures for assessing the state of the STEM labor market frequently used by US Federal agencies-namely unemployment rates, earnings, and working out of field of STEM training. I also discuss the need for using alternate measures-including indicators of multiple employment, union membership, and access to employer-provided benefits-that help researchers create a fuller picture of the characteristics of STEM employment in the US. This discussion serves as a useful background to introduce the variables I applied in the different stages of data analysis. In the data analysis section, I describe the demographic characteristics (gender, racial/ethnic background, citizenship status, age, marital and family status, education) of STEM and non-STEM workers in the 2008 SIPP sample. In addition, I also consider the following employment variables: employer characteristics (sector); employment status (fulltime, part-time, multiple employment); monthly wages; and availability of employer-provided retirement benefits, health insurance, opportunities for training, and union coverage for both STEM and non-STEM workers. The descriptive section will compare the employment and individual characteristics of these different groups to create a broad view of STEM employment from an LMS perspective."}, {"section_title": "Assessing STEM Labor Market Conditions", "text": "Beyond establishing the size of the STEM labor market, one of the main interests for scholars is assessing the overall conditions of the latter. This task generally involves analysis of indicators such as earnings, employment and unemployment rates, and involuntarily out-of-field rates. In this section I briefly discuss some of the most commonly used indicators in NSF, Census Bureau, and BLS reports: wages, unemployment rates, 11 and involuntarily working out-of-field (IOF) rates. the lowest-paying STEM occupations were not far below the U.S. mean for all occupations ($43,460) there were considerable differences between the wages of the highest -paying and lowest paying STEM occupations. The lowest-paying STEM occupations were technician and technologist positions, including forest and conservation technicians, agricultural and food science technicians, surveying and mapping technicians, and biological technic ians (Cover, Jones, & Watson, 2011). The difference in wages between the highest -paying and the lowest-paying occupations could partly be related to the level of education and training in each. Like occupations in other disciplines, STEM occupations that require more education usually pay more than those that need less (NSB, 2012). Second, unemployment among science and engineering occupations has been low when compared to the overall U.S. workforce. In the 22-year period from 1983-2004, the unemployment rate for all individuals in science and engineering occupations ranged from a low of 1.4% in 1999 to a high of 4.6% in 2003. In contrast, the unemployment rate for the entire U.S. workforce raged from 3.9% to 9.9% in the same period (National Science Board, 2006). Employment rates generally increase with educational level and are highest for doctoral graduates (Auriol, 2010) and professional degree holders (Mullin, 2011). However, although STEM qualifications certainly help workers weather recessions, \"they d o not make them immune to the adverse labor market conditions that recessions bring. The estimated 4.3% unemployment rate for STEM occupations in April 2009, although low relative to other occupations, was the highest in 25 years\" (NSB, 2012, p. 159). A third frequently used indicator of labor market conditions is the proportion reporting that a job in their degree field was not available. The involuntarily out -of-field (IOF) rate is a measure unique to NSF's labor force surveys, and can be a valuable indic ator of labor market conditions for STEM workers because the latter often prefer, but cannot always find, work that uses knowledge and skills related to their education (NSB, 2010 "}, {"section_title": "Alternate Measures of STEM Labor Market Status", "text": "In the previous sections I described some of the most common measures to assess the state of the STEM labor market: salary, employment and unemployment rates, and IOF rates for STEM workers. Although of great importance, these measures provide an incomplete picture of employment trends for scientists and technologists. In the past, some studies have considered alternate measures in an attempt to complement the data on wages, unemployment, and IOF rates. For example, an alternative yet rarely measure of STEM labor market conditions is the proportion of working scientists and engineers who hold second jobs. A report issued by the NSF in 2001 found that 1 in 9 (11.5%) scientists and engineers had second jobs. Social scientists were most often found working in second jobs (21.6%), followed by life scientists (10.2%). Doctorate holders, women, and underrepresented minorities showed a slightly greater than average propensity for working in a second job (Kannankutty & Morgan, 2001). Although it is certainly possible that some of the STEM workers who hold second jobs-or part-time or temporary work, for that matter-choose to do so willingly, the NSF analysis found some indication that lower income and salary on the principal job may be factors in the decision to hold a second job. Second-job-tenure provides a window into contingent work, a type of work relationship introduced by the new economy, which can also provide an alternate reading of the STEM labor market's pulse. Holding a second job is often associated with contingent and part-time work for two reasons: 1) the salary from a single job is insufficient; or 2) in the case of freelancers, because holding multiple contracts is in the nature of their work. In the 1980s, when researchers first turned their attention to contingent work, only about 6% of the contingent workers held 2 or more jobs simultaneously (Tilly, 1991). For this reason, early research on contingent work focused on exclusive, \"dyadic\" relationships between a worker and a single employer (Feldman, 2006). However, in the new economy, labor relations for part-time and contractual workers are often more complex. For example, contractual work among the highly skilled is often triadic rather than dyadic. Kunda, Barley and Evans (2002) observe that it is quite common for engineering and information-technology contractors to be hired by a firm through an intermediary, such as staffing agency. In fact, some firms recruit their own contractors, but then demand that the latter register with a staffing firm for the duration of the contract. The staffing firm \"becomes the contractor's employer of record and takes on the legal responsibilities of an employer, including the withholding of taxes and social security payments.\" The client firm-the organization for which the contractor actually performs work-\"pays the staffing firm a fee that includes the contractor's wages as well as the staffing firm's 'mark-up.'\" (p. 240). There is evidence that intermediary employment agencies are becoming more prevalent in the STEM labor market (CPST, 2006). Finally, a number of rarely used measures of STEM labor market status are suggested by LMS theory. LMS proposes that, by itself, a high wage is not enough to determine that a job belongs to the primary market (Rosenberg, 1980;Van Ophem, 198 7). Rather, there must be a cumulative set of job attributes that clearly establish a job a enjoying a high degree of security for the employee. At the heart of this assumption is the idea of a \"decent work agenda\" which includes access to retirement and health insurance benefits, employment stability, and the right to training (Rodgers, 2006;Boyer, 2006). Why are measures of health insurance and retirement benefits significant? Inequality in access to employee-provided health insurance and pension coverage has grown significantly in recent years (Calabrese & Medoff, 2001). According to Ghillarducci and Lee (2005), between 1978 and 1998, both blue collar and white-collar workers lost employee benefit coverage, although the loss was greater for blue-collar workers. In these 20 years, blue collar health insurance coverage rates fell from 66% to 49%, while whitecollar rates fell from 69.3% to 60.3%. As far as pension coverage, blue-collar workers rates fell from 46.4% in 1979 to 33.6% in 1998, while white-collar coverage rate was maintained at over 49% (p. 19). Using data from the 2008 U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), Saab and Ghilarducci (2012) analyzed defined contribution retirement account balances of near retirees (ages 50 to 64). Their findings show that downward mobility in retirement is a looming reality for both middle-and higher-income workers. In 2008, 75% percent of near retirees with annual incomes below $52,201 had an average total retirement account balance of only $26,395. The authors stress that, when distributed into an annuity over an average retirement lifetime, the latter sum cannot provide a significant addition to a monthly Social Security benefit. In the case of individuals with incomes over $52,201 per year, the average retirement account balance was just $105,012-again, too small an amount considering that people need ten times their income at retirement to maintain their standard of living. Because only a few people in the sample had very high balances, the median balance was much lower: 50% of people in the top 25% of the income distribution had retirement account balances of only $52,000. In fact, the median value of retirement account balances for half of near retirees was zero. Saab and Ghilarducci (2012) stress that average American near retirement age will use all financial assets available to them to supplement their monthly Social Security benefits. However, their findings show that almost half of middle-class workers (49%) \"will be poor or near poor in retirement, living on a food budget of about $5 a day\" (Ghilarducci, 2012). These findings are supported by another recent report by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which analyzed the level of individual's assets in the last years of life (Poterba, Venti & Wise, 2012). The study found that a substantial fraction (46.1%) of persons in the observed households died with virtually no financial assets (less than $10,000). The intersection of retirement well-being and health expenses is made clear in this study. In addition to having no housing wealth and relying almost entirely on Social Security benefits for support, households with the least assets were disproportionately in poor health. Moreover, many of these households \"may be deemed to have been wellprepared for retirement\u2026 [y]et with such low asset levels, they had little capacity to pay for unanticipated needs such as health expenses\" (p. 1) From an employment perspective, it is important to stress that the vast majority of In this section I have briefly described a number of possible measures with which researchers can piece together the current status of the STEM labor market. Unfortunately, a currently insurmountable challenge is that these measures rarely (if at all) are available within a single database. It is important to remember that the different sources of STEM workforce data-such as those managed by the NSF and those collected through the U.S. Census, for example-were designed with different purposes in mind, and therefore they provide different lenses with which to analyze the STEM workforce. The sources of available data can be divided into two broad classes. First, some data sources were specifically dedicated to oversight and support for science and technology. This is the case of the National Science Foundation, which in the 1990s developed some important STEM databases, including the Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT). SESTAT provided unprecedented details about characteristics of the STEM workforce in 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999. Second, there are a number of data sources that collect data on the U.S. economy as a whole, but which also provide useful measures of STEM activities and trends. These non-dedicated sources of STEM workforce information include the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the National Center for Education Statistics, among others (CPST, 2007, definitions). The non-dedicated data sources are usually rather limited in terms of collecting data relevant to some of the more idiosyncratic conditions of STEM professions. Detailed data on the academic profession constitutes one of the most significant limitations. Likewise, non-dedicated data sources such as SIPP do not collect information on whether a worker is involuntarily employed out of his or her field or study. Analysis of these kinds of work arrangement is more feasible with more narrowly focused, dedicated databases like SESTAT (Ellis, Babco, Frehill, & Bell, 2007). In turn, one of the main limitations of the SESTAT databases is that they only include data on individuals with a bachelor's degree and higher, thus leaving out a significant proportion of the STEM workforce with subbaccalaureate status. Thus, estimating the size of the STEM workforce-and, indeed, analyzing many aspects of it-calls for a number of compromises in terms of what data are available in any given source. In this study, two overriding concerns determined my choice of the S IPP database to explore the status of the STEM labor market: 1) SIPP collects data on variables of crucial importance in LMS research, including wages, access to benefits (health insurance, retirement pensions), unionization, and access to training. Likewise, it collects data on workers' part-time or full-time work status, as well as multiple employment. Finally, unlike the NSF workforce databases, SIPP allows researchers to identify respondents' level of degree attainment ranging from a subbaccalaureate certificates to a doctoral degree."}, {"section_title": "Establishing the Final STEM and non-STEM Subsamples for the Study", "text": "After database transformation and clean-up (see Appendix), I identified the preliminary sample for the study. The preliminary sample included all non-institutionalized, non-self-employed 13 adults (defined by SIPP as 15 years of age and older), who were employed at the time the first 2008 SIPP wave took place, and who were also present in the subsequent waves of interest (2, 3, 5 and 6). SIPP 2008 yielded a total of 30,609 working adults. Close to 86% (26,266) of these were employed in non-STEM occupations, and 14% (4,343) were employed in STEM occupations (see Table 7 in Chapter 3 for definitions). This classification of STEM and non-STEM fields includes all working individuals regardless of educational attainment. In this sense, the preliminary sample is constructed in a manner similar to prior LMS studies, which have examined labor segmentation patterns in the workforce as a whole. However, the present study is concerned with a particular subset of the US workforce, namely that comprised by workers in science and technology fields. The latter tends to be a highly skilled group of workers, as attested by the educational attainment percentages in Table 8. 13 Although SIPP 2008 also provides detailed data for self-employed individuals (i.e. business owners), this group is not included in the preliminary sample because there are no variables to determine whether the business falls within a STEM or non-STEM category. However, it is possible to determine the type (STEM or non-STEM) and degree level of business owners. This information is presented in the conclusion chapter as part of the discussion on further research. As expected based on previous literature, the mean and median monthly wages for the STEM workforce were higher than those of the non-STEM workforce. The median monthly wage among STEM workers was $4,333, compared to $2,244 for non-STEM workers. As Table 9 shows, the distributions for the wages variable are positively skewed; this is because the value for monthly wages cannot be less than zero and because of individuals with very high monthly salaries ($10,000+). The standard deviation for both STEM and non-STEM monthly wages is extremely high ($4,294 and $3,223 respectively), indicating a great degree of variation within each workforce group. For the STEM workers in particular, the high standard deviation also points to considerable differences between the wages of the highest-paying and lowest-paying STEM occupations. This is an aspect of the distribution of wages in the STEM workforce that can be obscured when only the mean or median wage for is reported. It is important to bring attention to the very high kurtosis in the monthly wage distributions for both groups. The kurtosis in a normal distribution is 3.0, yet for STEM monthly wages is 18.23, and 33 for non-STEM wages. This situation arises because a large number of workers earn monthly wages on the lower end of each distribution, as shown in The extremely high kurtosis for the non-STEM group is partly explained by the difference in earned wages among individuals with and without higher education degrees. Table 10 shows the distribution of monthly wages for STEM and non-STEM workers who hold an associate's degree or above. Notice that although the median monthly wages for both groups are higher, the difference between the STEM and non-STEM median wages is significantly lower ($1,544) among workers with a postsecondary degree than when all levels of educational attainment are included ($2,089). In other words, even though non-STEM workers with a postsecondary degree tend to earn less than their STEM counterparts, they do not differ as starkly from the latter as non-STEM workers who do not hold a postsecondary degree. Thus, as a set of workers with similar educational attainment, non-STEM workers with postsecondary degrees represent a closer comparison group against which to describe the characteristics of the STEM workforce included in the SIPP 2008 survey. With this in mind, the final sample for the present study is defined as all noninstitutionalized, non-self-employed adults who were employed at the time the first 2008 SIPP wave took place, who were also present in the subsequent waves of interest (2, 3, 5 and 6), and who held a postsecondary degree (associate's, bachelor's, master's, professional or PhD; certificates/diploma are also included because of their importance in STEM training) at the time wave 1 was implemented. In the following section I describe the characteristics of the STEM and non-STEM workers included in the final sample."}, {"section_title": "The STEM and non-STEM Workforces in 2008 SIPP: Descriptive Statistics", "text": "The final sample contains 15,728 observations, including 3,493 (22.2%) in STEM occupations, and 12,235 (77.8%) in non-STEM occupations. SIPP provides weights to determine the number of people each observation represents in the US population at the time in the survey. The weighted sample represents a total of 10,080,341 STEM workers and 35,721,884 non-STEM workers. The estimate for the STEM population is much higher than those provided by the 2009 American Community Survey (6.4 million), which includes all individuals in STEM occupations regardless of educational attainment. This discrepancy is partly explained by the more comprehensive STEM definition used in this study, as shown in Table 11. well with prior estimates of the total STEM workforce in the US. Table 12 provides the main demographic characteristics of the final STEM and non -STEM sample. The gender distribution is virtually identical for both STEM and non-STEM workers, with females accounting for close to 52% of all observations. The proportion of women in the SIPP sample is much greater than estimates by the National Science Foundation, which indicates that out of a total of 4,874,000 STEM workers in 2008, 26.8%"}, {"section_title": "Demographic Variables", "text": "were women. The definition of STEM used in this study is partly responsible for the discrepancy. Women represent 25.6% of the \"STEM professional\" category; this proportion is close to that estimated by the NSF, which defines STEM occupations as not including technical or health-related occupations. However, under the more inclusive definition of STEM used in the present study, women account for 79.7% of the STEM-health category and 66.2% of the STEM-technical category. In terms of race/ethnicity, Whites constitute a clear majority in both workforce groups, although the proportion is slightly higher (78.7%) for STEM workers than non -STEM workers (77%). In contrast, the distribution of Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics varies considerably between STEM and non-STEM workers. Asians constitute 9.3% of all STEM workers, but only 4% in the non-STEM category. Blacks account for 6.5% of the STEM workforce, and almost 10% in non-STEM occupations. Finally, the proportion of Hispanics in STEM occupations is 3%, and slightly over 6% in non-STEM occupations. SIPP includes a nondescript \"Other\" category which is roughly equal for STEM (2.3%) and non -STEM (2.6%) workers. Over 80% of workers in both STEM and non-STEM jobs were born in the US; this proportion is higher for non-STEM workers (88.6%). The proportion of individuals with US citizenship is higher for both groups (94% for STEM and 96% for non-STEM), which suggests that a sizable number of foreign-born workers in both groups became US citizens at some point during their stay in the country. The median age for STEM and non-STEM workers is very similar, as illustrated in Figure 2. The white vertical line in the dark box is the median: 43 for STEM and 44 for non -STEM workers. The left and right sides of the dark-gray box are the 25 th and 75 th percentiles, respectively (19 for non-STEM, 18 for STEM workers). The horizontal lines extending from the edges of the gray box stop at the smallest and largest cases, while the dots on the right represent outliers. For non-STEM workers, the slightly longer line on either side suggests that many of these workers enter the labor force at an earlier age and leave it at an older age than their STEM counterparts.  Age Distribution of STEM and non-STEM Workers proportion of postsecondary attainment for this group (24.1%), followed by associate's degrees (17.9%) and master's degrees (15.8%). The proportion of workers with professional and doctorate degrees is smaller than for STEM workers (2.3% and 1.6%, respectively). Finally, a substantial majority of STEM and non-STEM workers in the sample were married at the time wave 1 of the survey took place. For STEM workers, slightly over 70% were married; 16.3% had never been married, and 10.4% were divorced. Among non -STEM workers, 63.6% were married, 20.4% had never been married, and 12.2% were divorced."}, {"section_title": "Employment variables", "text": "The descriptive statistics for health insurance suggest some variation between STEM and non-STEM workers. First, SIPP provides a general measure indicating whether an individual is covered by health insurance and, if so, whether the individual is covered in hi s or her own name or under someone else's policy. By this measure, we find that a large majority (96%) of the STEM workforce is covered by health insurance, as is a smaller but still considerable proportion of non-STEM workers (88.9%). However, it is important to point out that these percentages include individuals who may be covered under someone else's policy (such as a spouse's or a parent's). For the purposes of this study, it is necessary to determine the proportion of STEM and non -STEM workers who receive health insurance benefits from their own current employer (or union associated with their current job), rather than those who may be covered by someone else's policy. The proportion of STEM and non-STEM workers covered in their own name is smaller (77.8% and 69.8%, respectively), as Table 13 shows.  Table 13 disaggregates the number of individuals who had insurance in their own name, and shows the proportion who were covered by a current employer or union. Most of the STEM workers who were insured under their own name had access to insurance benefits through their current employer (91.8%), and a very small percentage obtained it through a union (0.26%). Thus the total sample for STEM workers included 2,505 workers (71.7% of all STEM workers) who received health insurance benefits through their current employer or union. This proportion was lower for non-STEM workers, 61% of whom received health insurance benefits through their current employer or union. An additional level of disaggregation is possible for workers who received insurance benefits from their own employers, indicating the proportion of the insurance premium covered by the employer. For most STEM and non-STEM workers, the employer paid for at least part of the insurance cost, although this proportion was higher for STEM (81%) than non-STEM (74%) workers. A larger proportion of non-STEM workers had employers who either paid for the entire cost (22.33%) cost of health insurance (16.6% for STEM workers)."}, {"section_title": "Employment Status", "text": "As Table 14 shows, both STEM and non-STEM workers tend to be primarily concentrated in the private for-profit sector, and in similar proportions (65% for STEM and 63% for non-STEM). The public sector constitutes the second largest sector for STEM workers (17%), followed by the non-profit sector (16.7%). In contrast, a larger proportion of non-STEM workers are employed in governmental jobs (25%) at the local, state, or federal levels and fewer are employed in the non-profit sector (10%). SIPP's category for contingent workers 14 includes a minuscule proportion of STEM workers (0.57%) and non-STEM workers (1%). Finally, the non-STEM group also includes about 1% of individuals who work in family businesses.   Table shows that the majority of STEM workers who worked parttime did so voluntarily, and only 8.5% worked part-time due to adverse employment conditions. In contrast, the percentage of non-STEM involuntary part-time workers was twice that of STEM workers. In terms of multiple concurrent employment, a majority of workers in both groups held only one job at the time wave 1 of the SIPP survey took place. Among STEM workers, the percentage of individuals with one job exclusively was 91.3%. An additional 7.3% held two jobs simultaneously, and only 0.8% held three jobs concurrently. This dis tribution was similar for the non-STEM sample. SIPP provides additional information regarding the occupational field of those employed concurrently in a second job. As Table 14 shows, a total of 284 individuals employed in STEM fields had at least a second job. Of these, 65.4% had a second job in a STEM field, and 34.5% had a second job in a non -STEM field. The distribution of second jobs looks very different for non-STEM workers. Among those with second jobs, 93% had second jobs in non-STEM fields, and only 6.3% had second jobs in STEM fields. The mean years in occupation for STEM workers was 15 (SD=11.07) and 13 (SD=10.74) for non-STEM workers.  Finally, Table 15 presents basic statistics for three additional employment variables. First, the table shows that union membership is low in both groups, but especially so among STEM workers, only 9% of which belonged to a union, compared to 17% of non-STEM workers. Second, pension availability through the main employer was higher for STEM workers (76%) than their non-STEM counterparts (64%). Finally, SIPP also includes a number of variables regarding the availability of training opportunities for current employees. Table 10 shows that such opportunities are relatively scarce among both STEM and non-STEM workers. About 28% of all STEM workers in the sample had received training to improve job skills in their current job. For the majority (close to 80%) who did receive such opportunities, the training activities were sponsored by the employer. In the case of non-STEM workers, a smaller percentage (23.4%) received training within the past year. As with STEM workers, about 80% of those who had access to training activities were sponsored by their employers.  *NOTE: As mentioned in the methods chapter, one of the main challenges of the SIPP database is that the population universe can vary from one question to another because the original survey question did not include these individuals. This may result in a number of cases that are not included in the final sample for a given variable, as is the case in each of the variables in Table 10. The \"Not in universe\" (NIU) label denotes different characteristics from one variable to another. In the union membership variable, NIU refers to individuals who were employed in a family business and did not receive a salary. For the pension variable, NIU is a bit more complicated. The pension availability variable comes from Topical Module 3, while the main STEM and non-STEM samples were derived from data coming from Core wave 1. In this case, \"not in universe\" denotes individuals who we re employed in core 1, but whose employment status had changed by the time TM3 took place. Finally, NIU includes individuals over 65 years of age in the first training variable, and individuals whose training activities took less than an hour for the secon d training variable."}, {"section_title": "Salary", "text": "On average, STEM workers earn higher wages than their non-STEM counterparts. However, to reach a finer understanding of the salary distribution for these two groups it is important to disaggregate them by level of educational attainment, as shown in Table 16. The first section of Table 16 presents the salary distribution for STEM workers. In congruence with human capital theory, we see that, as workers' levels of postsecondary degree attainment increase, so do their median monthly wages. With the exception of workers with a PhD level, this observation is also true for the non-STEM group. Nonetheless, it is important to stress the high degree of variation in wages within each level of educational attainment. For example, the mean monthly salary for STEM workers with a postsecondary diploma or certificate was $3,440 (SD=2,812). The difference between workers at the 25 th and 75 th quartiles was $2,783, indicating a wide gap between the bottom and top earners. This gap is also present at all other levels of educational attainment, and is widest for those with professional degrees in both the STEM and non -STEM groups. The data in Table 16 also show that the kurtosis for monthly wages remains high, though it decreases somewhat at higher levels of degree attainment. This situation arises because of the high number of observations concentrated at the lower end of the distribution, as Figure 4 illustrates in the case of STEM workers: Although most STEM workers are concentrated at the <$10,000 monthly wage mark, there The same is true of the monthly wages of the STEM workers across all degree levels (all significant at the p. < .001 level). In addition, I also tested the homogeneity of variance for the monthly wages variable-that is, that the variance of the wages variable was the same at all levels of educational attainment in the non-STEM and STEM subsamples, respectively. Table 18 shows the results of Levene's test on untransformed 15 monthly wages data. The test results are significant (p. < .001) for both the non-STEM and the non-STEM subsamples, indicating that the variances are significantly different, therefore violating the homogeneity of variance assumption. Finally, there are two important limitations to the findings presented in this section. First, the analysis cannot distinguish between individuals who may have, for example, a STEM bachelor's degree and a non-STEM graduate degree, or vice versa. This is an artifact of how the SIPP questions for educational attainment were structured. Individuals only reported their highest degree of educational attainment and the corresponding field of knowledge. Therefore \"STEM degree\" and \"non-STEM degree\" refer to the field of study of an individual's reported highest degree. Second, SIPP does not provide sufficient information at the certificate/diploma level to determine whether the certification was in a STEM or non-STEM field; therefore this degree attainment category is not disaggregated in the Chi-square analyses in Chapter 6. In the next chapter, I introduce two-step cluster analysis as a non-parametric statistical approach that can aid in capturing the presence of coherent groups with shared employment characteristics in the STEM and non-STEM subsamples in SIPP. CHAPTER 5: TWO-STEP CLUSTER ANALYSIS Labor Market Segmentation theory shares a conceptual heritage and vocabulary with dual market or dual economy theory (Averitt, 1968;Galbraith, 1973). Both approaches were concerned with the persistence of poverty and underemployment in the U.S. in spite of general economic prosperity in the post-World War II period (Gray & Chapman, 2004, p. 118). This interest led to the development of a framework that would help examine \"the historical process whereby political economic forces encourage the division of the labor market into separate submarkets, or segments, distinguished by different labor market characteristics and behavioral rules\" (Reich et al., 1973, p. 359). Proponents of each approach developed different causal arguments about the origin and maintenance of this labor market \"balkanization.\" For dual market theorists, labor market structure was a reflection of industrial structure. The latter was conceptually divided into \"core\" and \"periphery\" sectors. \"Core\" industries were highly monopolistic, productive and profitable, whereas those in the \"periphery\" were characterized by high competitiveness, low-productivity, and low-profitability. These differences in turn were supposed to determine the types of jobs available in each sector. \"Thus, those in the periphery (competitive) sector will receive lower incomes and lower returns to education, and do so in more dangerous, less pleasant, and more precarious jobs than those employed in the core (monopoly) sector\" (Friedman, 1984, p. 185). In other words: \"core\" industries would tend to offer primary market jobs and \"periphery\" industries to offer secondary market ones. However, over the years, the empirical evidence suggested a far more complex picture-for example, \"core\" firms may also offer significant number of secondary market jobs. In response, LMS theorists shifted their attention away from industrial structure to a more systematic focus on the nature of jobs available in each of the market segments. This entailed addressing the fact that many primary market jobs may have characteristics of secondary market jobs and vice versa. Although further refinements of the segmentation model tended to adhere to the basic division between primary and secondary markets, subsequent models proposed subdividing the primary and secondary markets into upper and lower tiers (e.g. Piore, 1973Piore, , 1975Osterman, 1975). Later scholarship also suggested tripartite (Rumberger & Carnoy, 1980) and quadruple (Lee & Wrench, 1987) segmentation models, as well as hierarchical segmentation models (Gittleman & Howell, 1995). In other words, researchers should think of the dual labor market as an ideal type representing the \"degree to which the labor market is polarized into two [main] segmentsjobs that have only primary labor market characteristics and jobs that have only secondary labor market characteristics\" (Hudson, 2007, p. 292). Empirically, however, dualism is not absolute, since different jobs may combine primary and secondary characteristics. Further, as I explain in the theoretical framework, scholars of labor relations in the new economy, have stressed that the marginalizing effects of non-standard employment (e.g. unequal pay, training, career opportunities) may further complicate the distinction between \"good\" and \"bad\" job characteristics. With this in mind, in the present study I expected to observe a spectrum of jobs ranging from jobs with no secondary characteristics (the \"ideal\" or \"absolute\" primary market) to jobs with no primary characteristics (the \"ideal\" or \"absolute\" secondary market). In between would be groups of jobs in various combinations of primary and secondary characteristics. Previous LMS research has used methods such as discriminant analysis, factor analysis, and maximum likelihood switching models to identify specific labor market segments. Regardless of the method used, the results consistently point to a positive covariation among secondary labor market characteristics (and, likewise, among primary characteristics); this co-varying feature has been used to identify discrete segments in the U.S. labor market. However, a contentious aspect of early LMS studies is that the researchers often determined a priori the number and characteristics of the segments they analyzed. Critics of these early works observed that the a priori definition of segments was not only highly subjective an arbitrary, but was also susceptible to truncation bia s or restricted range problems (Hudson, 2007, p. 291). Therefore, an important consideration in designing this stage of the study was to select a data analysis strategy that allowed me to achieve two main goals: 1) to capture the presence of coherent groups with shared employment characteristics in the SIPP sample (as well as the STEM and non-STEM subsamples); and 2) to avoid the a priori designation of said groups. Two-step cluster analysis emerged as a technique that would allow me to achieve both goals. The main objective of conducting a cluster analysis was to produce an array showing groups of workers with similar combinations of primary-and secondarymarket characteristics. This array-a continuum between the absolute secondary and the absolute primary jobs-allowed me to discern segmentation patterns in the STEM and non-STEM workforces. In the next section, I present a brief overview of cluster analysis as a tool for data exploration. I introduce the two basic clustering techniques (partitioning and hierarchical) as a necessary background to describe how two-step cluster analysis works. Next, I present the findings of the clustering procedure, divided in three sections concentrating on different levels of analysis: the overall STEM/non-STEM sample; the non-STEM subsample only; and the STEM subsample only. I pay particular attention to comparing the employment patterns of the STEM and non-STEM samples. Finally, I discuss the findings in light of both the LMS framework and the literature on the impact of new economy on employment relations in the US."}, {"section_title": "Cluster Analysis Techniques: Definition and Advantages", "text": "Cluster analysis is a method for identifying homogeneous groups (\"clusters\") of objects (e.g. cases, observations) that share characteristics with other members of a given group, but are dissimilar to objects from other groups (Mooi & Sarstedt, 2011). The similarity between clusters is determined on the basis of certain features (i.e. variables) which can be quantitative or qualitative (\u0158ezankov\u00e1 & Everitt, 2009). Although the technique is most commonly used in fields that rely heavily on data mining, such as market research, cluster analysis has proved useful in examining issues of interest in fields like sociology and anthropology (Hennig & Liao, 2013). In the field of higher education, for example, Owen (2008) has applied this approach to create a typology of collegiate leadership programs based on their structural and programmatic characteristics. One advantage of this procedure over other methods of classification, such as discriminant analysis, is that the number and characteristics of the groups are to be derived from the data and are not usually known prior to the analysis (Afifi, May, & Clark, 2012). This is an important consideration for this study, which ultimately seeks to determine whether individuals in STEM occupations can be empirically classified in distinct segments based on their employment characteristics (e.g. wages, benefits, part-time status) without making a priori assumptions about whether distinct employment segments do in fact exist for these workers, or what shape the segments have. Cluster analysis, and two-step cluster analysis in particular, allows for complex configurations of segmentation to emerge from the data itself. representing an individual cluster. These clusters are then sequentially merged ac cording to their similarity. First, the two most similar clusters (that is, those with the smallest distance between them) are merged to form a new cluster at the bottom of the hierarchy. In the next step, another pair of clusters is merged and linked to a higher level of the hierarchy, and so on. This allows a tree-like hierarchy of clusters to be established from the bottom up (Mooi & Sarstedt, 2011;\u0158ezankov\u00e1 & Everitt, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "Types of Clustering Procedures", "text": "Although both procedures allow the researcher to glean a sophisticated understanding of the ways in which observations form latent clusters in a dataset, each comes with a set of disadvantages. and thus does not require that the researcher establish an a priori clustering solution. I have selected two-step cluster analysis for this part of the study as an attempt to \"let the data speak\" regarding the presence or absence of distinct employment segments amongst STEM and non-STEM workers. As its name implies, the two-step algorithm is based on a two-stage approach. In the first stage, \"the algorithm undertakes a procedure that is very similar to the k -means algorithm. Based on these results, the two-step procedure conducts a modified hierarchical agglomerative clustering procedure that combines the objects sequentially to form homogenous clusters\" (Mooi & Sarstedt, 2011, p. 8). All clustering methods require defining a mathematical measure of the distance between two observations. A common measure for hierarchical methods is the Euclidian distance, although other definitions -and their corresponding mathematical expressions-are also possible, including city-block distance and the Mahalanobis distance. In two-step clustering, the default distance of measure is log-likelihood. Because of its partitioning ability, cluster analysis is especially useful in developing exploratory or theoretically-based typologic classification of objects (Hair & Black, 2000). When a cluster is formed, the proximity between it and other clusters are estimated from observed proximities, bypassing any missing values (Romesberg, 2004). Software packages like SPSS calculate the measure of (dis)similarity between pairs of objects. Objects with smaller distances between one another are more similar, whereas objects with larger distances are more dissimilar (Mooi & Sarstedt, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Preliminary Steps: Determining Degree of Association between Clustering Variables", "text": "In conducting cluster analysis, it is important to select variables that potentially Clustering procedures require low levels of collinearity between the variables; as such, care was taken to ensure that the seven variables were not highly inter-correlated (Hair & Black, 2000). Pearson product-moment coefficients among the continuous clustering variable (average monthly wages in core 1) and dichotomous clustering variables 16 (parttime employment, involuntary part-time employment, employer-provided health insurance, employer-provided pension plan, union membership, multiple employment, employerprovided training) are presented in Table 17. All of the selected clustering variables showed 16 Krathwohl (1998) indicates that, even though correlations are designed for use with interval data, they can nonetheless be computed on (binary) categorical data or ordinal data to establish relationship s between variables of interest in sample surveys (p.408). a small to medium association with the monthly wages variable, thus making them adequate for inclusion in the cluster analyses.  (Field, 2005). As predicted by LMS theory, there was a degree of association between the employment characteristics, but the levels of association were sufficiently low to ensure the variables' suitability to be included in the cluster analysis       A general segmentation pattern is discernible in this simplified array. Towards the right end of the spectrum, groups 2 and 8 best fits the traditional definition of \"primary job\" in that their members are employed full-time, receive high wages, and have access to pension and health insurance benefits (as well as employer-provided training in the case of cluster 2). Interestingly, a group not predicted by traditional LMS theory emerges at the far right of the clustering solution. Cluster 5 is comprised by a very high proportion (85%) of part-time workers with high mean wages (the highest for the entire sample), as well as access to health and pension benefits. These \"positive part-time\" characteristics place it close to the type of contractual labor described by Kunda et al. (2002). Group 7 is comprised by middle-earners, about half of which have access to pensions but no other benefits. None of the workers in this group worked part-time or had a second job. Next, groups 6 and 4 are harder to characterize. In the mid-low end of the earnings spectrum (compare to average US population), workers in these groups have access to pensions (and, in the case of group 4, about half have access to employer-provided health insurance). At the same time, slightly over 50% of workers in these groups work part-time, and 100% of workers in group 4 hold a second job. Although it is perhaps futile to speculate which of these groups outranks the other in terms of desirable work characteristics, it seems reasonable to say that the combination of lower wages, part-time work, and second job tenure place group 4 closer to an \"upper secondary\" employment category, while group 6 is a \"lower middle\" group. Finally, group 1 (\"lower secondary\") fits the classic description of the secondary labor market: low wages, no access to benefits, training, nor union, all employed in part-time jobs. Testing the Robustness of the Clustering Solution: \"Broad\" v \"Restricted\" Model A potential problem with this clustering solution becomes evident when we examine the difference between the mean and median wages in each cluster. In some cases, as with cluster 3, the difference is small ($179). However, in cluster 5 the difference is $4,436, suggesting the presence of observations with very high values that severely skew the mean to the right of the distribution. Recall from the descriptive statistics that the wages distribution for the sample was significantly skewed due to the presence of individuals with very high monthly salaries ($10,000+). For continuous variables, the two-step clustering algorithm uses the mean to determine the distance between observations as a way to assign them to different clusters. As such, the algorithm it is very sensitive to the extreme values in the wages variable. At the same time, the standard deviation for the wages variable was very large, suggesting a high degree of variation among workers in the sample. If we rely exclusively on mean wages to assign observations to a particular cluster, we risk grouping together observations whose monthly wages actually differ significantly, as appears to be the case in cluster 5. This does not mean that the clustering solution presented above does not capture the presence of distinct employment groups in the sample. Because it encompasses all observations in the STEM/non-STEM sample, the clustering solution provides a bird's eye view of employment patterns in the sample which can be further tested for robustness. Because the variability of the monthly wages variable could have an undue impact on cluster formation, as a first test it was important to determine that there was a statistically significant difference between the means of each cluster. A preliminary test of normality confirmed that the distribution of wages in each cluster (for the non-STEM and STEM workers, respectively) was not normal. Table 21 shows that, for each cluster, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test yielded a significance level of p < .001 (and p < .05 in the case of STEM workers in the unionized cluster). This is not surprising considering that the wages distribution for the overall sample was not normally distributed, as I illustrated in Chapter 4.  Table   22). Since both the assumption of normality and that of homogeneity of variance were unmet, a non-parametric test was necessary to test for differences between clusters. 18 The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric procedure that allows the researcher to test differences between several independent groups, or, in this case, clusters. I ran the test on the monthly wages as the dependent variable using the cluster variable produced by SPSS as the independent (grouping) variable. I also set SPSS to split the dataset according to a dichotomous \"STEM or non-STEM\" variable to allow comparison of the two groups in each cluster (Table 23). Finally, because this was a large sample, the Kruskal-Wallis procedure was ran on the Monte Carlo method (10,000 samples, starting seed 743,671,174). The Monte Carlo computation is based on the random resampling of the N values. 19  As the effect sizes suggest, the largest difference seems to be that between the lower secondary cluster and the upper secondary cluster. These results suggest that, although there is a statistically significant difference between adjacent pairs of clusters, the effect size in general is small. It is important to keep in mind that LMS theory is predicated on the \"bundling\" of various employment characteristics, of which wages constitutes only onealbeit important-dimension. As an alternate test of the clustering solution's robustness, I introduced two measures to reduce the effect of extreme values in the wages variable, while considering the presence of the additional employment variables. First, I transformed the wages variable into quintiles; this measure ensures that the observations are grouped into equidistant, non-overlapping wage categories. Second, the two-step clustering procedure in SPSS provides an \"outlier control\" option that automatically groups extreme values into a separate cluster. I applied the outlier treatment option using SPSS's default setting of 25%. Running the analysis with these two measures in place resulted in a 2-cluster solution that closely matched the \"ideal\" dual job market: First, a sector characterized by full -time employment, high wages (highest quintile), and pension and health benefits. Second, a cluster comprised of part-time workers in the lowest wages quintile, with no health insurance or pension. Despite its intuitive appeal, this model was too sparse to be analytically useful. Examination of the predictor importance measures for the model showed that t hat the second job, training, and union variables were poor predictors for the clustering solution. Removing these variables resulted in a final 7-cluster solution with a fit measure of 1.0. In other words, this was a saturated model in which 100% of observations within each cluster fit the cluster fields exactly. For example, for cluster 2 in Table 25 below, 100% of observations had no health insurance or pension, 100% of observations worked par-time, and 100% of observations had monthly wages that placed them in the first wage quintile. Because this clustering solution excludes all observations that do not fit each cluster exactly, I will refer to it as the \"restricted model.\" In turn, I will refer to the original clustering solution as the \"broad model,\" since it includes all observations in the sample. As in the broad model, at one extreme of the restricted model we see a cluster comprised by part-time workers with no health insurance or pension benefits, and who are concentrated on the lowest wage quintile. The group comprised by part-time workers with very high wages and benefits has disappeared (since its members were classified as outliers by the revised algorithm). In its place we see a group of full-time workers at the top quintile who received pension and health benefits. Also as in the broad model, in between these two extremes we see a general movement from clusters with less desirable work characteristics on the left, to jobs with increasingly primary characteristics on the right (Cluster number 3 in the restricted model appears to summarize clusters 6 and 7 in the broad model: full-time employment, wages along the middle of the distribution, and no benefits). The restricted model shows that the underlying clustering pattern of the broad model holds when we account for the high degree of wage variation inherent in the latter. Although the restricted model allowed me to detect clusters with perfect within-cluster homogeneity and across-cluster dissimilarity, the model has the disadvantage of losing much of the finergrained detail of the broad model. For this reason, in the next stages of analysis I apply the broad model settings as a way of capturing as much detail of the employment characteristics in the STEM and non-STEM subsamples as possible."}, {"section_title": "Comparing the distribution of Non-STEM and STEM workers in the clustering solution", "text": "The next step in the cluster analysis was to compare the distribution of non-STEM clusters: protoprimary (28%), protoprimary 8 (28%), and contractor (30%). By contrast, non-STEM workers constitute a clear majority in the lower-secondary cluster (89.4%) (See Table 26).  , 2009). An important contribution of the clustering approach based on LMS-relevant variables is that it shows that along with higher wages also come other desirable employment characteristics, such as access to health and retirement benefits. The analysis of the cluster composition shows that STEM workers are more likely than non-STEM workers to be employed in an employment cluster with such primary characteristics. At the same time, the analysis of cluster composition also provides evidence that, although not as pervasive as in non-STEM employment, segmentation is also present in the STEM workforce. This is an important preliminary finding that sets the stage for the second part of the cluster analysis. After establishing a baseline of comparison with the non-STEM workforce, the next step was to conduct the clustering procedure on the STEM subsample alone. This step allowed me to create a finer-grained view of the shape that segmentation takes when considering only STEM occupations in relation to themselves."}, {"section_title": "Clustering Solution for the STEM Subsamples", "text": "Examination of the SPSS output for each of the STEM subsample revealed a clustering pattern similar to that of the broad model for the overall sample, albeit with some significant differences. For the STEM sample, running the clustering procedure using the same parameters of the broad model resulted in a poor fit (0.4). This was largely due to a greater number of observations with extremely high wage values that skewed the distribution. To reduce the effect of these extreme values, I applied SPSS's outlier trea tment control. This measure asks the clustering logarithm to group the extreme values into a separate cluster. The resulting model fit the data satisfactorily (0.7) and divided the observations into 10 clusters, as shown in Figure 9 and in Table 27 below. This solution includes a total of 3,144 observations, or 90% of the STEM subsample.  The general pattern of clusters for the STEM workforce is similar to that of the overall sample in that it is possible to discern a general trend from clusters with more secondary characteristics to clusters with more primary characteristics (see Table X). As in the non-STEM model, the top four clusters in the STEM subsample (7, 1, 8, and 10) comprise workers with health and pension benefits, as well as average wages well above the national average. In both subsamples, there is a cluster of workers who, in addi tion to having relatively high wages and access to benefits, are also covered by a union (cluster 9 in the STEM subsample). Similarly, a high wages, high benefits, part-time work (\"contractual\") group is also identifiable in the STEM subsample; this is a group much better defined in terms of wages than for non-STEM workers. However, the STEM clustering solution also shows three unique characteristics. Most notable is that the mean and median wages for the STEM group are consistently higher, even though the pattern of other employment characteristics resembles that of the overall clustering solution. For example, in both cases, the clustering logarithm identified a \"lower secondary\" group with the following characteristics: the lowest wages in each subsample, no benefits, and part-time employment. However, the wages differ significantly between the STEM (mn=$2,141, mdn=$1,634) and overall (mn=$1,173, mdn=$767) lower secondary groups. This pattern holds across all other comparable clusters. An additional characteristic that distinguishes the STEM cluster pattern is that the \"second job\" variable was a poor clustering predictor for this group of workers. As shown on Figure 9, only a small percentage (ranging from 3.1%-8%) of workers in clusters 4, 5, 9, 2, and 3 held a second job. In contrast, the clustering solution for the overall sample showed a coherent, sizable group (cluster 4, n=1,283) of workers, 100% of whom who held second jobs. A third and final defining characteristic of the STEM clustering solution is the presence of an \"elite\" cluster (cluster 10), characterized by full-time employment, access to health and retirement benefits, and monthly wages >30,000. This small (n=50) group exerted a great influence in the first iteration of the STEM cluster analysis, and was partly responsible for the poor model fit that resulted without implementing the outlier treatment option in SPSS.  These plots also provide a useful visualization of the differences in employment characteristics across clusters. Cluster 2 (in dark blue), the \"lower secondary\" group, has the lowest mean monthly wages for the STEM subsample, no employer-provided benefits, and 100% of its members employed in part-time jobs. At the other end of the spectrum, group 2 (in yellow), fits the \"prototypical primary\" description: full-time workers with high monthly wages, health insurance and pension. The \"contractor\" STEM cluster stands right on the overall median, and its members enjoy health and retirement benefits."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The examination of the cluster analyses for the overall sample and the STEM subsample reveals a pattern generally consistent with LMS theory-albeit with some important qualifications. Higher wages are consistently associated with other primary employment characteristics, including health insurance and pension benefits, as well as fulltime employment. In turn, lower wages showed a tendency to cluster with secondary employment characteristics, such as part-time employment, multiple employment (in the overall sample), and restricted access to health insurance and pension benefits. The lower-secondary cluster present in both samples falls well within the parameters of the secondary market as discussed in the early LMS literature. These are workers who are all employed part-time, have no access to employment benefits, and who receive low monthly wages. Two definitions of \"low\" monthly wages are possible here: low in relation to each of the two samples tested, or low in relation to the US population. In the clustering solution for the overall sample, the annual mean wage for workers in the lower -secondary cluster was $14,076. For workers in the corresponding STEM-only lower-secondary cluster, the annual average wage is $25,692. In both cases, these values are well below the $45,559 annual average for the entire population (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2009), to say nothing of the mean annual wage of $77,880 calculated for all STEM occupations by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Cover, Jones & Watson, 2011). The mean annual wages for workers in the upper-secondary clusters are likewise beneath these thresholds ($33,468 for all workers, and $35,856 for STEM workers only, respectively). At the same time, although there is a general pattern of segmentation in both clustering solutions, there is evidence that secondary employment is more widespread among non-STEM workers. STEM workers in the lower-secondary and upper secondary clusters account for 13.5% of the total STEM subsample. In the overall clustering solution, non-STEM workers in the same categories account for 17.8% of the total non-STEM sample. However, STEM workers in the lower-middle category have mean and median wages on a par with US national average. In contrast, the mean wages of non-STEM workers in the two middle clusters still fall beneath the US annual average. If, purely on a basis of annual wages, we considered these two middle clusters as predominantly secondary labor, the secondary segment would encompass a staggering 43% of the total non -STEM workforce represented in the sample. Determining a \"secondary\" threshold for the middle non-STEM segments is difficult, in part due to the wide variation in mean monthly wages (as shown in the section comparing the \"broad\" and \"restricted\" models for the entire sample). Nonetheless, there is sufficient evidence that a greater degree of segmentation is present in the non -STEM workforce than among STEM workers. At the same time, some clustering features in both cluster analyses point to the need to revise some of the assumptions of classic LMS theory. First and foremost is the observation that not all part-time employment is created equal. The cluster analyses consistently revealed the presence of a sizable group of well-remunerated workers who also had access to health and pension benefits. This group flouts the assumption in early LMS theory that part-time work is exclusively associated with secondary characteristics such as lower levels of compensation, high turnover rates, and lack of benefits. The existence of highly-remunerated part-time workers has been predicted and documented by scholars of labor relations in the new economy. Also known as \"the new global economy,\" the new economy refers to the shift from an industrial/manufacturingbased wealth producing economy into an export-oriented, technology-driven mode of production that relies primarily on a highly-qualified and flexible workforce (Torres & Schugurensky, 2002). Concurrent with the rise of a knowledge-driven mode of production was the introduction of a series of policies based on a theory of political economy which predicted that social and individual well-being could be improved \"by maximizing the reach and frequency of market transactions\" (Harvey, 2005, p. 3). Proponents of this ideology, commonly known as \"neoliberalism,\" view the market as the core institution of modern capitalist societies, and believe that freedom of the market and trade guarantee individual freedoms and prosperity. Neoliberalism proposes that national and international policies should be subservient to the needs of the markets, and consequently emphasizes deregulation and reduction of the state as a way of promoting competition and efficiency (George, 1999). The broad changes brought about by neoliberal policies in the new economy had profound implications for labor relations. These policies fomented the introduction of practices such as the deliberate stimulation of turnover to reduce seniority payments and worker organization, commission sales, and household production by means of computers and telecommunications (Tilly & Tilly, 1994, p. 307). Likewise, the policies also facilitated corporate restructuring and the broader use of contingent and nonstandard work arrangements (Barker and Christensen, 1998). Even though precise estimates of the spread of contingent work are difficult due to the absence of longitudinal data, three observations seem warranted: 1) a significant proportion of the U.S. population is employed contingently; 2) this proportion has increased over the past two decades; and 3) technicians, professionals and managers constitute a greater proportion of the contingent labor force than in the past (Kunda et al., 2002;Barker and Christensen, 1998). 23 This last observation is particularly cogent in light of the \"contractor\" cluster described in the findings. The changes in labor relations over the past three decades pose an important challenge to classical LMS theory, which traditionally assumed that characteristics such as job instability and contingent work were restricted to low-skill employment. Because in the new economy the employment landscape is so variegated, scholars have warned against making sweeping generalizations about the work conditions and the characteristics of parttime workers. The evidence from studies of highly-skilled contingent workers suggests that part-time work has its own primary and secondary sectors. In an industrial economy, the key function of secondary part-time jobs is to help employers \"gain advantages of lower compensation and greater scheduling flexibility\" (Tilly, 1992, p. 331). By contrast, the new economy introduced new forms of \"primary part-time\" employment. Tilly calls this type of part-time employment the \"retention\" model, since part-time positions were designed by employers to retain or attract valued workers (typically women with young children) who, for various reasons, preferred to work part-time. These \"retention\" part-timers were concentrated in technical and professional occupations entailing high levels of skill, training, and responsibility. The rise of highly-skilled contractual labor is a related phenomenon. Research by Kunda et al. (2002) reveals further layers to the experience of highly-skilled contingent workers and how it may differ from that of their low-skill counterparts. The authors examined the experiences of 52 highly skilled contractors in engineering and informati ontechnology occupations. The authors found that the experience of technical contractors diverged significantly from the characteristics typically associated with the secondary labor market. Their interviewees were not poorly trained or rewarded; neither did they \"lead a hand-to-mouth existence.\" Among the advantages of contractual work, the interviewees mentioned higher earnings than in full-time employment, a greater sense of autonomy, the opportunity to develop new skills as they moved from one project to the next, and having greater control over their own time. These are important insights to keep in mind when considering the contractor clusters in the overall sample and the STEM subsample. The findings of the cluster analysis lend support to the related notions that contingent employment in the new economy is more heterogeneous than traditional LMS theory would predict, and that at least some forms of part-time employment may be closer to the definition of a primary labor market. This raises a broader point about the need to explore the intersection between LMS theory and contemporary work on labor relations. Many of the conceptual underpinnings of LMS are so widely accepted in sociological work that they have become commonplace shorthand in discussions of stratification and social mobility. For example, the division of primary and secondary labor-markets has now passed into conventional sociological thought, with the primary labor-market generally denoting secure jobs and good conditions. However, scholars like Tilly and Tilly (1994) have stressed the fact that much of the theoretical work on labor relations-including LMS theory-have failed to keep up with the great changes taking place in employment relations worldwide: \"With fitting irony, standard labor markets seem to be decaying just as we begin to formulate coherent theories about them\" (p. 307). Gray and Chapman (2004) add that the concern for disadvantaged workers that characterized much of the early LMS literature \"might have focused too narrowly on distinctions between primary and secondary sectors and overlooked important distinctions within the primary sector\" (p. 121). In other words, while the distinction between primary and secondary labor market is essential to LMS theory, acknowledging potential differences within primary jobs is just as significant. The findings of the cluster analysis support this thesis, and are generally in keeping with previous attempts at creating more nuanced typologies of primary and secondary labor (e.g. Ramstad, 1993). An additional observation concerns the role that unions might play in facilitating access to jobs with more primary characteristics. From the descriptive statistics we can see that only a small proportion of STEM workers (close to 9% of all STEM workers) belonged to a union. For non-STEM workers, the percentage was higher, but still moderate (28% of all non-STEM workers). Yet for both groups, the union variable contributed to placing the workers in clusters with primary characteristics. The resulting \"unionized\" clusters contained 75% of all unionized STEM workers, and 91% of all unionized non-STEM workers. In other words, although the descriptive statistics bespeak the declining number of unions in the US (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2011;Hudson, 2007), the clustering results suggest the potentially key role of unions in upholding primary-type employment features for their members. Is union-membership a significant factor in negotiating wages or access to benefits for highly skilled workers such as those in the STEM and non-STEM samples? This is a question that the present study cannot answer, but which may be a fruitful area for future research. Having established the presence of segmentation in the STEM workforce, the next step in the study's design is to determine distribution of women, URMs, and the foreignborn along the identified segments or clusters. This step is in keeping with the LMS observation that historically these groups have been disproportionately allocated to jobs in the secondary market. The present study sought to determine whether a similar phenomenon could be observed when considering the STEM workforce in isolation. In the first section of this chapter, I provide a brief overview of the representation of women, ethnic minorities, and immigrants in the STEM labor market. Against this background, I introduce the third and final stage of data analysis, which is concerned with determining the relationship between the workers' individual characteristics and their membership in the employment segments identified in stage two. This examination in turn can provide clues as to the allocation of these groups of workers across the different segments of the STEM labor market. After presenting the findings, I discuss them in reference to the theoretical framework guiding the study.\nA fundamental difference between LMS theory and neoclassical economics is the emphasis the former places on going beyond labor supply models and instead examining the structure of occupational opportunities on the demand side. As mentioned in the theoret ical framework, LMS researchers questioned the neoclassical assumption that labor markets tend to equilibrate (\"clear\") supply and demand of existing jobs through wage fluctuations. In contrast to this \"wage-competition model,\" LMS theorists posited a \"job-competition\" model aligned with the following logic: Firms or industries with higher wages are likely to attract more able job-seekers. In a situation where there are more qualified applicants than positions available, the employer can pick and choose among applicants to hire the best possible. In this scenario, there may still be many qualified workers who do not get hired, a situation which would result in \"queuing\" for jobs in the form of unemployment, subemployment, or job queues among employed workers (Thurow, 1972; Although the present study was not designed to test the queuing hypothesis in detail-which would require a complex modeling of STEM employment over time-the theory behind it does offer a useful lens through which to interpret the findings outlined above. For example, the concept of 'queuing' alerts us to look for concentrations of highly qualified individuals among the lower rungs of the segmentation spectrum. In the case of this study, that means the combined secondary cluster-which, as the reader may recall, is characterized by wages well below the US national average, part-time work, and no employer-provided benefits. As the results of the Chi-square test show, three out of five workers in this cluster have a bachelor's degree or above. More importantly, analysis of the work experience measure indicates that 50% of the workers in this cluster had considerable experience in their reported occupation: 17.5% had 5-10 years of experience, 12.9% had 15-20 years, and 26.6% reported 20 years of experience or more. The analysis is not comprehensive enough to tell us important details about why workers with so much experience were employed in the secondary cluster. It could be possible, for example, that at least some of those with more than 20 years of experience were retirees whose current employment acted as a second career, or even a hobby. Yet given that only 8% of all workers in the secondary cluster were above retirement age, this possibility would still not fully account for the apparent underemployment of nearly half of the workers in this cluster. Yet LMS theory offers a plausible explanation in the form of the 'queuing model' mentioned above, in which an individual's wage is determined not just by demand and supply but by \"by the distribution of job opportunities in the economy and an individual's relative position in the [job] queue\" (Gray & Chapman, 2004, p. 120). Employment opportunities in STEM primary jobs may be both restricted and highly competitive, to the extent that not all qualified employees can access them. Once employed in a secondary job, it may be difficult to access career ladders (either vertical or lateral), which might further restrict mobility across clusters. Restricted mobility across segments is a central tenet of LMS theory. While the findings of the present study do not allow us to go beyond speculating that such a mechanism might be involved in allocating STEM workers to the secondary cluster, such a phenomenon is not unheard of in STEM employment. Indeed, restricted mobility between secondary and primary employment has been documented in a context crucial to science and technology: academe. The \"casualization\" of the academic labor market (Bousquet, 2008) refers to the restructuring of tenure-track faculty jobs into in non-tenure-track adjunct positions, both part-and full-time. Part-time faculty constitute a growing proportion of the academic workforce, particularly of the workforce in teaching. In 1970, less than one -fourth (22.l%) of faculty in American higher education institutions were working in part-time positions. By 2011, this proportion had increased to 50% (NCES, 2012). 34 The rise of contingent faculty is linked to the broader restructuring of the labor force in the new economy. From an institutional viewpoint, one of the main attractions of using part-time faculty is the flexibility that institutions can exercise in reallocating resources. However, from the viewpoint of the individuals in these positions, the labor conditions may be less than ideal. Some issues of concern regarding the increasing use of part -time faculty include employment status, workloads and compensation (relative to full-time, tenured faculty), union membership, academic freedom, and the quality and consistency of workplace conditions for faculty (NEA, 2007;Rhoades, 1998;Barker, 1998). 34 Although smaller than in non-STEM fields, such as English, the proportion of STEM part-time faculty represents a considerable share of faculty work. Across STEM fields, the faculty members least likely to be part-time employees were in engineering and agriculture (30% part-time each). Faculty most likely to be working part-time were in departments of social sciences (37.4%) natural sciences (37.2%), and health sciences (38.1%) (NEA, 2007). For example, the pervasive lack of academic rank has been identified as a factor speaking to the lower status of most part-time faculty members relative to full-time staff, as well as of full-time lecturers relative to tenure stream faculty. A majority of part-time faculty are employed in positions outside the traditional ranks of the professoriate (i.e., assistant, associate, or full professor), and all are in positions outside the tenure system (again, as is true for full-time, non-tenure-track faculty). Sustained contingent, non-ranked status often results in a \"second-class\" stigma with very real consequences for those in parttime (and full-time non-tenure-track) positions, including professional isolation, exclusion from curricular discussions, and a general sense of \"invisibility\" in departmental and university life (Kezar, 2012;Kezar & Sam, 2010;Saltzman, 2000;Barker, 1998). Moreover, many part-time faculty may be \"involuntarily employed on an as-needed, \"piecerate\" basis and are multiple job holders\u2026 traveling from campus to campus to make a living wage\" (Barker, 1998, p. 198). In short, they work in the academic equivalent of the secondary job market. Not surprisingly, a non-trivial proportion of all part-time faculty aspire to full-time teaching positions (NSOPF, 2004). Yet in looking for more permanent positions, these contingent scholars face two considerable barriers: an oversupply of equally qualified applicants 35 coupled with a dearth of full-time positions. These conditions create a \"queuing\" process for part-time faculty who do aspire to full-time positions. The mobility of part-timers' to more primary employment if further restricted by the \"cumulative 35 Many of whom, according to Monks (2009), are in fact \"current and retired workers [willing] to hold parttime teaching positions at relatively modest salaries and without ambition for a full -time teaching appointment [and who] provide an ample supply of ready replacements for administrators willing to fill classrooms with part-time appointees\" (no page). disadvantage\" that accrues to contingent academics, whereby many years of adjunct work experience can in fact count against those applying for full-time positions (Barker, 2008). The reference to the queuing among part-time faculty documented in the literature is germane considering that postsecondary teachers accounted for 4.7% of all workers in the STEM sample, yet their share of the secondary cluster was almost twice as large. Moreover, it is important to stress that 25.6% of all postsecondary teachers in the sample are concentrated in the secondary cluster. A similar, yet slightly smaller, percentage (23.2%) of all postsecondary teachers belongs in the combined primary cluster. In other words, while nearly 1 in 4 of all postsecondary teachers in the sample have access to highly desirable employment features (i.e. high wages, benefits, full-time employment), an equivalent 1 in 4 earn less than the US average for all working adults, in part-time arrangements, and with no access to health insurance or retirement benefits. \"Queuing\" and Women in STEM Occupations Have the non-academic members of the STEM secondary cluster been impacted by queuing? The findings of the Chi-square test for gender and cluster membership suggest that this is the case. LMS scholars saw gender and racial prejudice as important factors shaping an individual's position in the labor queue. Much of the drive behind early LMS work came from empirical observation of the persistent labor marginalization of women, minority, and low-income individuals. As such, phenomena like 'queuing' were explored as mechanisms through which members of these groups were historically allocated to secondary labor markets. Contemporary LMS scholars like Hudson (2007) argue that, as discrimination along gender, racial and ethnic lines became socially and legally discouraged, new ways of meeting the demands of both public and private employers for low-wage, low cost workers evolved over the past few decades-namely nonstandard and immigrant labor. In this regard, the gender composition of the secondary and contractor clusters is particularly suggestive. The women in this sample were clearly overrepresented in clusters defined by part-time employment, but especially so in the secondary cluster, with its concomitant lowwages, no benefits features. That the majority of workers in the secondary cluster are women lends credence to prior research documenting the devaluation of female labor and the concomitant \"feminization\" of occupations and fields of knowledge. Bellas (1994) posits that \"because women are socially devalued, so too is the work that women do. Consequently, employers may set wages for work that is typically done by a woman lower than wages for comparable worthwhile work typically done by men'' (p. 808). A neoclassical economics perspective might assume that the females in the secondary cluster were employed in those jobs as the result of impartial market forces (i.e., the most qualified workers were employed in more primary clusters). Yet such a view does not account for the fact that, as I mention above, most of the workers in the secondary cluster have a high level of postsecondary attainment as well as considerable work experience. The findings of this study suggest that, in addition to being out-earned by their male peers, women in STEM also have a higher likelihood of being employed in secondary jobs. Moreover, judging by the mismatch between their cluster allocation and their credentials plus work experience, the women in the sample also seemed to encounter employment queues or other barriers to advancement. This is consistent with previous research indicating that women and minorities in organizations often cannot find clear, tangible paths for advancement, which can result in frustration and ultimately departure from the organization (Cox & Nkomo, 1991;Fouad and Singh, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "The Representation of Women, URMs, and Foreign-Born Workers in the US STEM Workforce", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Women in STEM Occupations", "text": "Even though women constitute about two-fifths (40%) of those with STEM degrees Board's report stresses that women who are similar to men along all of these factors receive salaries that are 13% (among bachelor's degree holders) to 8% (among master's degree and doctoral degree holders) lower than their male counterparts."}, {"section_title": "Underrepresented Minorities in STEM Occupations", "text": "According to the National Science Board (2012), race and ethnicity constitute salient factors in the rates of participation in the STEM workforce. Table 28 shows the 2008 rates of participation in STEM occupations for different ethnic/racial groups in the U.S. Non-Hispanic whites constitute the majority of workers in STEM occupations (70%), followed by Asians (17%). Asians work in STEM occupations at higher rates than their representation in the overall U.S. working-age population (5%). Although the proportion of Blacks and Hispanics in STEM occupations has grown over time, 24  Although underrepresented minorities generally earn less than their whi te counterparts (NSF, 2011, p. 9), racial/ethnic salary differences are somewhat smaller than salary differences between men and women. Not controlling for occupation and experience, American Indians/Alaska Natives with a highest degree in an STEM field and working full time earned 19% less than whites; Blacks earned 16% less than whites; and Hispanics earned 14% less than whites in 2008. However, the salary difference between minorities and whites is significantly attenuated after controlling for occupation and experience (NSB, 2012 (Lee, 1993). This provision has significantly altered the composition of the U.S. scientific labor force. In 2010, the countries of birth with the largest number of STEM degree holders were India (18% of the foreign-born population with STEM degrees) and China (12% of the foreign-born population with STEM degrees) (Gambino & Gryn, 2011). 26 The \"open doors\" policy of the 1965 immigration Act was brought about in part by the robustness of the U.S. economy during the 1960s, when predicted labor shortages in U.S. scientific and engineering fields renewed interest in immigrant scientific labor. In turn, the economic recession in the mid-1970s considerably slowed down the inflow of foreign scientists and engineers (Lee, 1993, p. 73). The current conditions for the immigration of scientists and engineers are complex. On the one hand, there is a policy climate favorable to the immigration of highly skilled workers. Recently, the Obama administration has put forth policies that would allow more STEM graduates to stay, such as expanding the list of science and mathematics fields that are eligible to stay longer (Carnevale, Smith & Melton, 2011). Likewise, there is a policy preference in the award of F-1 student visas that favors STEM students, as well as a recent regulation that allows F-1 students who receive degrees included on the STEM Designated Degree Program List to apply for a 17-month extension of their post-completion Optional Practical Training (Carnevale, Smith & Melton, 2011). The effect of this favorable immigration climate over the past two decades is reflected in the high propensity of STEM international students to remain in the country after completing their studies. Approximately 6 out of 10 international students who received doctorates in science and engineering fields in 1995 were still in the United States ten years after completing their studies. Of those who obtained doctorates in 2000, about 7 out of 10 remained in the country five years after graduating (Finn, 2007 between segment allocation and the workers' educational attainment and STEM occupational field. In the following section I provide a brief definition of the Chi -square procedure, followed by the hypotheses tested and their corresponding results. Chi-square is a nonparametric statistical procedure that compares the tallies or counts of categorical responses between two (or more) independent groups. The Chi -square procedure statistically analyzes the differences among the data in contingency tables to determine whether the patterns of difference can be considered statistically significant. One of the limitations of the SIPP data selected for the study is that, with two exceptions, all the variables of interest are categorical. Likewise, as I showed in the previous two chapters, the monthly wages variable had a non-normal distribution, and it was not possible to normalize it via transformations. A unique strength of nonparametric procedures such as Chi-square is that they can be used to treat nominal data which cannot, on any logical basis, be ordered numerically. The Chi-square test is thus well-suited for post facto analysis of secondary data with a large number of categorical variables and/or continuous data that does not meet the criteria of normality and homogeneity of variance, such as that used in the present study. .05, then the statistic is considered to be significant (meaning that the researcher can be 95% confident that the relationship is not due to chance). If the calculated value is equal to or greater than the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected. If the calculated value is less than the critical value, the null hypothesis (Ho) is accepted. The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows: The two categorical variables are independent. That is, the categories of one variable are not linked in a pattern to the categories of the other variable. H a : The two categorical variables are related. Rejecting the null hypothesis means that there is a dependent relationship between the study variables. In the findings section, I first present the results of the Chi-square tests for cluster membership by level of degree attainment, and by broad occupational field. I then present the results of the tests for cluster membership by gender, racial/ethnic background, and nativity. To facilitate the interpretation of the crosstabulation tables, I condensed the ten clusters obtained in the previous chapter into seven main clusters according to their shared employment characteristics, as shown in Table 30.  have a slight tendency to be overrepresented in secondary employment. In the top three primary clusters we also observe a pattern once more consistent with human capita l theory. The proportion of workers with subbaccalaureate attainment decreases consistently as we move up the top three clusters: 32.7% in the contractor cluster, 24.9% in the primary cluster, and only 6% in the elite cluster. Analysis of the age and the work experience variables contradicts the expectation that the workers in the secondary cluster would tend to be younger and/or be predominantly new entrants to the labor market. Figure 11 shows the distribution of workers in the secondary cluster by 5-years work experience brackets. We can define entry-level workers as those who reported <1 up to 5 years of experience in their current occupation. By this definition, almost a third (31.3%) of the workers in the secondary cluster qualified as newcomers to the labor market. However, the rest of the workers had considerable experience in their reported occupation: 17.8% had 5-10 years of experience, 13% had 15-20 years of experience, and 27% reported 20 years of experience or more."}, {"section_title": "Figure 10: Workers in the secondary cluster by years of experience", "text": "In terms of age, there is no clear evidence that this cluster is formed predominantly by young workers (Figure 12). Slightly less than 8% were under 25 years old, and 22.2% were between 25-35 years of age. These percentages place the share of workers under 35 years old in the secondary cluster at 30%. An additional 47% were workers between 35 -55 years of age, and the remaining 23% were over 55 years old. In short, workers in the secondary cluster were quite spread out in terms of age, and the majority fell in a middleage range."}, {"section_title": "Figure 11: Workers in the secondary cluster by age group", "text": "These two measures suggest that a sizable share of the secondary segment consists of workers in their prime productive years, and who in addition had considerable work experience in their respective occupations.

Yet given that only 8% of all workers in the secondary cluster were above retirement age, this possibility would still not fully account for the apparent underemployment of nearly half of the workers in this cluster. Data limitations and time constraints preclude a statistical analysis that simultaneously controls for factors such as work experience, field of study, age, and the worker's ability. The interaction of these variables could create different pictures of the processes involved in shaping STEM secondary jobs. However, the analysis of the available data lends support to the LMS position that allocation of workers to the secondary cluster is not purely a function of the workers' human capital."}, {"section_title": "The Association between Broad Occupational Field and Cluster Membership", "text": "As mentioned in the previous analysis, in this study I use a definition of the STEM workforce that is broader than those being employed by some other agencies, including the National Science Foundation. The National Science Board advocates for a definition of STEM that includes \"all individuals educated in S&E fields and using their skills in their jobs, not just those officially classified as a 'scientist' or 'engineer'\" (Crosby & Pomeroy, 2004, p. 25). Using this broader definition may impact the composition of the clusters, and in particular the composition of the secondary cluster. For example, a possibility congruent with human capital theory would be for workers in STEM technical occupations -who ostensibly require fewer years of formal training than \"traditional\" STEM professionals-to 29 As I discuss in Chapter 3, SIPP provides broad occupational categories that allow the researcher to distinguish between the \"traditional\" STEM professions (as defined by the NSF, for example), STEM healthrelated occupations, and STEM technical occupations. SIPP data allows identification of five broad categories consistent with the traditional STEM professions: Computer and mathematical science; engineering; life and physical sciences; social sciences; and postsecondary teachers (see Chapter 3 for an expl anation on why the latter is a distinct subcategory). SIPP also provides sufficient data to disaggregate the STEM Health and STEM Technical occupations into smaller subgroups; however, my attempt to use such disaggregated categories in a Chi-square test rendered the interpretation of the contingency table extremely difficult. For this reason, in the final test they are shown in aggregate form. be overrepresented in this cluster, but underrepresented in the top primary clusters. This idea can be summarized in the following hypothesis: Ho: STEM workers in health or technical occupations are more likely to be allocated in secondary jobs than those in \"traditional\" STEM professions. The Chi-square statistic (42) =335.936, p < .001 indicates an association between broad occupational field and cluster membership, while Cramer's V (.127) suggests a small effect size (Table 33). a. 4 cells (7.1%) have expected count less than 5. The minimum expected count is 1.13. Examination of the contingency table (Table 34) shows some support for the notion that STEM technicians are overrepresented in the secondary cluster and underrepresented in the primary clusters. 30 On the one hand, \"traditional\" STEM professionals are present in either lower than expected numbers in the secondary cluster (12.3% for computer/math professionals, 5.3% for engineers, and 1.9% for life/physical sciences professionals), or at about equal proportions to their representation in the whole STEM sample (2.1% for social scientists). The only exception to this pattern is the \"postsecondary teachers\" category, whose presence in the secondary cluster (8.9%) is almost twice that than for the entire sample (4.7%). Together, STEM professionals account for 30.4% of the secondary cluster. On the other hand, both the STEM technicians (31.3%) and the STEM health workers (38.3%) are present in this cluster at higher rates than in the overall STEM sample. This situation suggests that, indeed, the workers in these non-traditional STEM groups might be partly responsible for the peculiar composition of the secondary cluster. At the other end of the segmentation spectrum, 57% of the primary cluster is made up by two broad occupational groups: computer and mathematics, and health occupations. Even though the percentage of the latter is smaller than the average for all STEM clusters, it still accounts for almost 27% of all workers in the combined primary cluster. Health workers also account for a sizable share of workers in the unionized cluster (38.4%), as do technicians (26.2%). Interestingly, at 8%, the representation of postsecondary teachers in this cluster almost doubles the representation of these workers in the STEM sample. Finally, a remarkable feature of the elite cluster is the overwhelming share of health workers in it (64%). The distribution of STEM health workers along the different clusters is interesting, and suggests a wide variation across these workers in terms of employment characteristics."}, {"section_title": "The Position of Female Workers across STEM Employment Clusters", "text": "As mentioned in the literature review, women in STEM occupations consistently report lower wages than their male counterparts. However, most reports on the status of the STEM workforce use wages as the main or only variable to determine this difference. Ghillarducci & Lee (2005) have found that such a strategy tends to underestimate the actual extent of compensation differences between males and females. They stress the need to use more comprehensive measures of compensation (including wages, access to health insurance and pensions) is better capture differences along gender lines. Because the cluster analysis uses such a comprehensive measure of compensation, it is possible to compare the likelihood that a female STEM worker is allocated to a secondary versus to a primary segment relative to their male peers: H o : Female STEM workers are more likely to be allocated in secondary jobs than their male counterparts. The results show a significant association between the worker's gender and cluster membership (10) = 194.555, p < .001. For a sample of this size, Cramer's V (.236) indicates a medium-size effect (Table 35). Examination of the crosstabulation (Table 36) reveals a clear pattern in the distribution of female workers across STEM employment clusters: women tend to be overrepresented in the clusters with more secondary characteristics, and underrepresented in the clusters with more primary characteristics. Women and men are generally equally represented in the middle clusters.  For example, even though women represent 52% of the total STEM sample in SIPP, they account for 73.8% of the combined secondary cluster. As shown in the previous chapter, these are jobs characterized by part-time employment, few to no benefits, and wages below the US national average. Women also account for a slight majority (58 %) in the lower-middle cluster. The representation of women drops significantly as we move towards the primary end of the spectrum. Women comprise 42.9% of the combined primary cluster. The proportion of female workers is lowest in the \"elite\" cluster, which is overwhelmingly male (88%). It is only in the upper middle and in the unionized clusters that we see a pattern approaching gender parity. Women represent 49.2% of the combined upper middle cluster. The unionized cluster shows the most even representation of males (49.8%) and females (50.2%)."}, {"section_title": "The Position of Workers from URMs across STEM Employment Clusters", "text": "As mentioned in the first part of this chapter, minorities in science and engineering tend to earn less than their white counterparts (NSB, 2012;NSF, 2011). Do the small but significant differences between URMs and Whites hold when we use a more comprehensive measure of compensation than wages alone? The results of the Chi-square for the STEM workers' race/ethnicity and their cluster allocation appear to answer in the affirmative. The Chi-square test rejects the hypothesis of independence (28) 77.360 p < .001 between the race/ethnicity variable and the condensed clusters variable; however, Cramer's V (.074) indicates the effect is quite small (Table 37). For this test, the Chi-square statistic and effect size should be approached cautiously, since there are 5 cells (4 in the elite cluster and 1 in the lower-middle cluster) that had expected counts of less than 5. In larger contingency tables, it is acceptable to have up to 20% of expected frequencies below 5, as long as none of the expected frequencies are below 1. Under these criteria, the results of the test are still valid, but since there is a loss of statistical power the test may fail to detect a genuine effect (Field, 2005). In such cases, it is critical to contextualize the Chi-square statistic with a closer analysis of the row and column percentages. A relevant observation is that four of the five instances of low expected frequencies arise in the \"elite\" cluster. This is a very small cluster with only 50 observations. Out of this total, 80% (40 cases) of the elite workers are Whites and 16% (8 cases) are Asians. The two remaining observations are one Hispanic worker and one worker who reported \"Other\" as his or her race. There are no Black workers in this cluster. In other words, the numbers are so small in this cluster so as to make interpretation difficult. Likewise, the small count of Hispanics, Blacks, and Other race individuals may be contributing to the small effect size identified by the test. 31 workers, as the column total for \"White\" shows. The cell at the intersection of the \"secondary\" row and the \"White\" column has a value of 83.7%. Because this value is above the +/-1% threshold, the cell is marked in green, indicating a higher than average proportion of White workers in the secondary cluster.  Table 39 suggests a subtle pattern of differentiation by race/ethnicity and the allocation of workers across clusters. As Table 33 shows, each ethnic/racial group has a different distribution of workers across employment clusters. The majority of workers in any cluster are White-unsurprisingly since 78.7% of the entire STEM workers sample is White. However, the proportion of Whites is higher than average in the secondary (83.7%), contractor (85.8%), and elite (80%) clusters, and lower than average in both middle cl usters and the union cluster. Asians 32 are underrepresented in the secondary and contractor clusters (5.5% of all workers in each). Their proportion in the union (10.1%) and contractor (10%) clusters is slightly higher but still very close to their overall representation in the STEM sample (9.3%). Asian workers make up 13.6% of the lower middle and 12.2% of the upper -middle clusters. Finally, 16% of the workers in the elite group are Asians--almost twice their representation in the overall STEM sample. Blacks represent 6.6% of the entire STEM sample. At 12%, the highest proportion of Black STEM workers is in the unionized cluster--a percentage almost twice that of their overall presence in the STEM sample. Black workers make up 10.7% of the lower-middle and 8.1% of the upper-middle clusters-in both cases, a proportion somewhat higher than that of Black workers in the entire STEM sample. In contrast, Black workers are 32 For the purposes of this analysis I followed the National Science Foundation convention to treat workers of Asian heritage as a majority group. According to the National Science Foundation (2011), women, persons with disabilities, and three racial/ethnic groups-blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians-are considered underrepresented in science and engineering because they constitute smaller percentages of science and engineering degree recipients and of employed scientists and engineers than they do of the general population. By this definition, Asians are not considered underrepresented, even though Asian subgroups may vary in terms of under-or overrepresentation in science and engineering. This is a different approach than that espoused by the National Science Board, which refrains from using the \"underrepresented minority\" category, and rather includes figures for Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indian/Alaska Native under a general \"Race/ethnicity\" label. underrepresented in the contractor (4.9%) and primary (5.5%) clusters, as well as in the secondary cluster (4.7%). As mentioned above, out of all the five racial/ethnic groups included in SIPP, Blacks do not have any representation in the elite cluster. In short, this pattern suggests that Black STEM workers are most likely to be employed in the middle and unionized clusters, and that they tend to be underrepresented in both the secondary and the clusters on the primary end of the segmentation spectrum. Across clusters, the representation of workers who reported \"Other\" as their racial/ethnic background is generally close to the proportion of this group in the STEM sample (2.4%). Finally, the representation of Hispanics across all clusters is highest in the lower-middle cluster (5.1%), followed by the unionized cluster (4.6%). Hispanics are underrepresented in the upper-middle cluster (1.8%). In all other clusters, Hispanics appear to be represented in proportions more or less commensurate with their representation in the STEM sample (3%). It is important to stress that this visualization, as well as the results of the Chi-square test, use the percentage of race/ethnic groups in the STEM sample as a point of reference. Yet if we instead compare the proportion of race/ethnic groups in each STEM employment cluster against each group's share of the total SIPP adult population, a clearer pattern of stratification for Black and Hispanics emerges. The bottom row of Table 33 shows the share of the total SIPP adult population comprised by each ethnic/racial group. When compared against the total 10.4% share of Hispanics in the 2008 SIPP adult population, we see that Hispanics are underrepresented across all STEM employment clusters. The same is true for Blacks-with the exception of the unionized and lower-middle employment clusters, where the proportion of Blacks is fairly close to their proportion in the entire SIPP adult population. Nonetheless, this differential has more to do with the total representation of minorities in STEM occupations, rather than with their allocation into specific clusters."}, {"section_title": "The Position of Foreign-born Workers across STEM Employment Clusters", "text": "The large proportion of international students in STEM graduate programs, and the high propensity of these students to remain in the U.S. upon degree attainment, is a controversial topic among policymakers. There is concern, for example, that international students will \"crowd-out\" domestic students from admission into graduate programs (e.g., Borjas, 2006). More broadly, the large proportion of immigrants among U.S. scientists and engineers has led to heated debates concerning both the impact of immigrant scientists on the STEM labor market and the work experiences of immigrant scientists. Xie , Goyette, and Shauman (2003) identify two perspectives that have emerged from these discussions: a \"displacement perspective\" and a \"discrimination perspective.\" On the one hand, proponents of the displacement perspective emphasize that the policies that expand the number of visas granted to foreign scientists promote imbalances in scientific labor supply, which can result in depressed wages. One important implication of the displacement perspective is that immigrant scientists might \"occupy positions (from fellowships to faculty appointments) that might otherwise be taken by women and nativeborn minorities, thus slowing the entry of women and minority members into science\" (Xie, Goyette & Shauman, 2003, p. 192). On the other hand, scholars like Bhalla (2006) argue that the size of the foreign-born STEM workforce is insufficient to put substantial downward pressure on domestic wages. Proponents of the discrimination perspective document historical and current evidence of both the structural barriers and covert bias faced by highly-skilled immigrant workers. For example, a frequent observation in the labor economics and wage discrimination literatures is that foreign-born workers are more likely to work in temporary jobs with low salaries and few benefits. Feldman (2006) speculates that a similar situation might be found among highly-educated foreign-born workers, who may face significant barriers to entry in the fulltime, permanent labor market while their visa status becomes resolved. Moreover, \"even recent graduates of masters and doctoral education programs without permanent visa status [may be] forced into taking short-term jobs that do not require as much education as they possess or pay as much as their peers earn\" (Feldman, 2006, p. 39). The displacement and discrimination perspectives suggest contrasting hypotheses regarding the representation of foreign-born workers across clusters: The foreign-born are more likely than then U.S.-born peers to be employed in part-time, secondary types of jobs (discrimination perspective). H o : The foreign-born are overrepresented in clusters where women and URMs are underrepresented, and vice versa (displacement perspective). The results of the chi-square (Table 40) reveal a statistically significant relationship between the nativity and cluster membership variables (7) =34.368, p < .001. However, Cramer's V (.099) indicates that the effect size of this relationship is small.   (Table   41). In terms of the discrimination hypothesis, there is no support for Feldman's speculation that the foreign-born will show a higher propensity to be employed in secondary and/or part-time employment. In fact, the representation of foreign-born workers is lowest in the secondary (9.7%) and contractor clusters (10.1%). In both cases, the proportion of foreignborn workers is lower than their representation in the entire STEM sample (15.7%). Foreign-born workers are disproportionately represented in both the middle clusters (20.3% in the lower-middle and 19.1% in the upper-middle cluster, respectively), as well as in primary (17.3%) and elite (24%) clusters. In regards to the displacement hypothesis, there is some tentative evidence that foreign-born workers are overrepresented in clusters where women and URMs are underrepresented, and vice versa. From the Chi-square tests for gender and race/ethnicity we know that women in the STEM sample tend to be overrepresented in the secondary, lower-middle, and contractor clusters; in contrast, women are underrepresented in the primary and elite clusters. Next, as a groups, URMs (Black, Hispanic, and \"Other\" workers) are overrepresented in the lower-middle and unionized clusters, but underrepresented in the secondary, contractor, primary, and elite clusters. This distribution is summarized in Table   42: In contrast to the overrepresentation of foreign-born workers in the primary and elite clusters, both women and URMs in the sample were underrepresented in these top clusters. A similar pattern of reverse representation between women (overrepresented) and foreignborn workers (underrepresented) is visible in the composition of the secondary and contractor clusters. Similarly, foreign-born workers are slightly underrepresented in the unionized cluster, where women make up half of all workers and minorities are represented in proportions equal to their share of the STEM sample. It is important to stress that this is a crude way of comparing the representation of women, URMs and foreign-workers in each cluster, and is not intended to make any causal inferences regarding a \"crowding -out\" effect of women and URMs by foreign-born workers. In the next section, I discuss these and the rest of the findings from a segmentation perspective."}, {"section_title": "The Contractor and Unionized Clusters: Impact for Women and Minorities", "text": "The representation of women in the contractor and unionized clusters also merits further attention. The contractor cluster flouts the general trend for women to be underrepresented in the primary end of the employment clusters. At 63%, this cluster is predominantly female. This phenomenon brings to mind Feldman's (2006) and Tilly's (1992) observation that highly remunerated part-time work is likely to be appealing for women, and more specifically mothers with young children. Feldman (2006) observes that highly-educated mothers may want flexible employment arrangements and schedules, and are therefore are more likely to seek part-time employment. Further, because these are highly-skilled workers, the employer has a vested interest in retaining them (Tilly,199 2). The SIPP data allowed me to test whether there was a significant association between gender and the number of workers in the secondary cluster who had children under 18. However, the results for the test supported the null hypothesis of independence ( (1) = .207 p > .05). In other words, the contractual cluster is not comprised of a high proportion of women with children under 18; indeed, less than half (43.6%) of the women in this cluster had children under 18. It is possible that the measure for \"children under 18\" is not sufficiently fine-grained to capture a statistically significant relationship with gender in this cluster. For example, the needs and employment priorities of women with infants and very young children may be very different than those with teenaged children, yet the SIPP measure conflates them both. Further research should focus on that difference, as well as the possibility that the females in contractual work arrangements may be more likely to be older and phasing into retirement (examination of the age distribution for this cluster was inconclusive). Likewise, factors other than motherhood may be at work as to why women are overrepresented in this cluster. Like the contractor cluster, the unique composition of the unionized cluster also calls for further scrutiny. The analysis revealed virtual gender parity in the unionized (50.2% females). Similarly, the highest proportion of Black workers in any cluster (12%) is found in the unionized cluster, as is a higher than average percentage of Hispanic workers (4.6%). Further, the same occupational groups that are overrepresented in the secondary cluster (postsecondary teachers, health workers, and technicians) are also overrepresented in the unionized cluster. Together, these findings suggest that union membership may play an important role in brokering access to jobs with primary characteristics for women and ethnic minorities in these occupations. This phenomenon would be consistent with the historical evidence that unionization is associated with important benefits to the worker-such as higher wages better fringe benefits, and greater job tenure (Mayer, 2004). Women in particular accrue significant gains from union membership in both the academic and the larger labor market (May, Moor house, & Bossard, 2010). In this respect, the higher than average proportion of postsecondary teachers in this cluster is also congruent with prior research. Rhoades (1998) for example points out that the rate of unionization in the academic workplace is significantly higher than the general workforce, although unionization itself remains an under-examined aspect of higher education. Other scholars have concluded that male-female salary differences are narrower at unionized schools (Sosin, Rives & West, 1998;Barbezat, 1989). A recent study by May et al. (2010) found that, after controlling for institutional factors affecting the proportion of women faculty, unionized public research universities have a higher proportion of women faculty overall and at the ranks of associate and full professor than do non-unionized schools. The authors conclude that the issue of faculty unionization \"is better understood using a segmented labor market approach since previous studies conducted on the subject may have obscured differences by rank\" (p. 699). Finally, although the evidence in the literature regarding the benefits of union membership for racial and ethnic minorities is mixed, scholars like Hunt and Rayside (2000, p. 402) suggest that 'a growing union recognition of diversity may be one of the ways the union movement is attempting to reinvent and reposition itself for the twenty-first century' (p. 402). This statement would seem to apply in the case of the Black and Hispanic workers in the unionized cluster."}, {"section_title": "The Underrepresentation of URMs in STEM: A Different Type of Segmentation?", "text": "The overrepresentation of minority workers in the unionized cluster is one of the few clear patterns to emerge from the results of the Chi-square test for race/ethnicity and cluster membership. As mentioned in the findings, the test indicates a statistically significant association between the two variables, albeit with a small effect size. The findings of the Chi-square for race/ethnicity seem to support previous findings by the National Science Board (2012) that there is a small but statistically significant difference in the compensation of White (and Asian) and minority workers. 36 As shown in the findings section, the differentiation pattern across clusters is far from conclusive. One problem with the results is 36 The differences in compensation vary by level of degree attainment. After controlling for occupation and experience, minorities with a highest degree at the bachelor's level earn 6% less than whites. Among those with a doctoral degree, the wage difference between minorities and whites is mostly attenuated (3%) and at the master's degree level, the difference is fully attenuated (NSB, 2012, p. 3-46). the low count for certain racial groups, which resulted in expected frequencies lower than 5. So while the Chi-square test for this group tells us that the distribution of minorities in each cluster is unlikely to have occurred by chance, the small effect size restricts our ability to make further inferences about the minority workers in the STEM sample. Ironically, this problem may be in part an artifact of the SIPP sampling strategy, which is after all not a dedicated STEM database. At the same time, the low count of minority workers in this analysis also speak to the underrepresentation of URMs in STEM occupations in general, a phenomenon reflected in the SIPP database. As mentioned in the introduction, a common concern among scholars and policymakers is that STEM university programs are \"enrolling too few U.S. citizens, and especially too few minorities, to advance the nation's educational, economic, and social well-being\" (Zusman, 2005 Taken as a whole, the findings of this study suggest that a different kind of segmentation dynamic is at work when it comes to workers from racial/ethnic minorities. A clearer segmentation pattern for these workers may emerge if we compared allocation within as well as across STEM or non-STEM jobs. This is a topic for future research. Likewise, it would be important to try to replicate the study with data from a dedicated database that would allow researchers to use both a comprehensive measure of compensation and to control for important variables such as age, occupation, and level of degree attainment, in addition to the workers' race."}, {"section_title": "STEM Foreign-born Workers and the Question of Displacement", "text": "The large proportion of international students in STEM graduate programs, and the high propensity of these students to remain in the U.S. upon degree attainment, has raised concerns that foreign-born workers will \"crowd-out\" domestic talent away from careers in science and engineering (North, 1995;Zumeta & Raveling, 2002, Borjas, 2006). There is a concern in particular that the large influx of immigrant workers might occupy positions that might otherwise be taken by women and native-born minorities (Xie, Goyette, & Shauman, 2003, p. 192). As described in the findings, data analysis revealed that foreign-born workers in this sample were indeed overrepresented in clusters where women and URMs are underrepresented, and vice versa. Most strikingly, foreign-born workers were overrepresented in the primary and elite clusters, while both women and URMs in the sample were underrepresented in these top clusters. Yet we must be careful not to assume that the only possible explanation for this phenomenon is a \"crowding-out\" effect. Previous research has shown mixed evidence to support the displacement hypothesis. For example, the reported impact of immigrants labor on wages varies based on variety of factors, including time period (long-or short-term) under consideration, as well as the individual's educational level and occupation (Carnevale, Smith & Melton, 2011). For example, Borjas (2006) provides evidence that increases in the number of foreign-born doctorates have a significant adverse effect on the earnings of competing workers. He attributes a 10% decline in the wages of PhDs in computer science and mechanical engineering occupations arising out of a 36% increase in the supply of PhD-qualified immigrants in these fields. Much of this effect, however, can be attributed to the increased prevalence of low-pay postdoctoral appointments, where a considerable proportion of international doctorates are concentrated (Carnevale, Smith & Melton, 2011). Similarly, Bhalla (2006) argues that the size of the foreign-born STEM workforce is insufficient to put substantial downward pressure on domestic wages. Further, the displacement hypothesis tends to approach the overrepresentation of foreign-born workers in STEM workforce from a supply perspective. Yet, as I have stressed throughout the manuscript, LMS theory alerts us to pay as much if not more attention to the labor demand side to capture the complexity of stratification in labor markets. To take the displacement argument ad absurdum, the solution to the underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in STEM employment would be to halt the oversupply of foreign -born workers. Yet such a position ignores an implicit corollary: capping the number of STEM immigrant workers would stop employer demand for low-cost labor. It seems unlikely, however, that the secondary cluster consistently identified in this study would disappear based on this hypothetical measure alone. Carnevale, Smith and Melton (2011) advocate seeing beyond \"displacement\" and instead focusing on a phenomenon they call \"diversion\" to explain the movement of nativeborn away from STEM jobs. The authors argue that native-born workers with STEM degrees are not being driven out of STEM occupations by immigrants. Rather, because a growing number of jobs in non-STEM occupations require or reward STEM skills, many native-born individuals are being diverted into non-STEM occupations where their STEM skills are in high demand and command higher salaries. The phenomenon of diversion, they argue, takes place along many points in the STEM educational path. The segmentation lens used in this study suggests a third (non-exclusionary) alternative to the displacement and diversion explanations, at least in the case of female STEM workers. Faced with a segmented labor market in which employment queues restrict access to primary-type jobs, female job-seekers may 1) be forced into secondary STEM jobs; or 2) be diverted to non-STEM jobs. In this model, perceptions of barriers to primarytype jobs could exacerbate the impact of existing structural barriers to these jobs. For example, the overrepresentation of males and foreign-born workers in the high-visibility primary and elite clusters could act as a powerful psychological deterrent for women seeking these jobs, who may preemptively self-select out of these positions. Similarly, the underrepresentation of female peers in these jobs could contribute to creating a hostile work environment with few opportunities for advancement (e.g., Hewlett et al., 2008;AAUW, 2010;Fouad & Singh, 2011). These are all questions for further research. CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Leontaridi (1998) observes that, although the interpretation of labor segmentation differs according to the lens through which it is viewed, the existence of the phenomenon in the US labor market is well-established. The interesting question, then, is \"not whether the labor market is segmented, but along what lines\" (p. 78). The present study sought to explore the lines along which the US STEM labor market is segmented. The study used a novel approach to examining the STEM labor market by moving away from an exclusive focus on unemployment rates and on average wages to describe the status of STEM employment. Instead, the study considered wages along with variables such as access to employer-provided benefits, union membership, part-time employment, and access to training, to map out quality of employment patterns among STEM workers in the SIPP 2008 database. The findings of the study show is evidence of segmentation in the highly-skilled STEM and non-STEM samples, which include workers with at least a subbaccalaureate diploma and above. Significantly, the study also found that, although not as prevalent as among non-STEM workers, there is segmentation present in the STEM workforce. The cluster analyses described in Chapter 5 all revealed a pattern generally consistent with LMS theory: Higher wages are consistently associated with other primary employment characteristics, including health insurance and pension benefits, as well as full-time employment. In turn, lower wages showed a tendency to cluster with secondary employment characteristics, such as part-time employment, multiple employment, and restricted access to health insurance and pension benefits. One of the main contributions of the findings is that they reveal a far more variegated employment landscape than is usually presented in national reports of the STEM workforce. Over the past several decades, US STEM workforce studies have primarily focused on the supply side, often premising the work on claimed and predicted workforce shortages. The focus on the supply side dates back to the 1970s and 1980s, when governmental competitiveness agendas encouraged the use of governmental funds to assist in the commercialization of science and technology (Slaughter & Rhoades, 1996). The policy climate at the time was dominated by neoliberal principles and supply-side economics, which favored production incentives such as reduced governmental regulation and conservative tax policies, and tended to disregard demand-side labor dynamics. The nascent models for analyzing the increasingly important STEM workforce, as well as the discourses surrounding the role of public policy in STEM training and employment, were thus fashioned with a strong preference on supply-side factors (Lucena, 2005;Metcalf, 2011). The supply-side framework has influenced the direction of much of the higher education research on STEM training and employment. For example, a significant body of research has tried to understand the factors that influence students' decisions to enter a STEM field of study. Some of the factors found to bear a significant relationship with the choice of college majors include academic ability/performance, socio-psychological variables, labor market returns, and family background (Goyette & Mullen, 2006;Jacobs 1986Jacobs , 1995Melguizo & Wolniak, 2012). An important contribution of this body of work has been to highlight the severe underrepresentation of women and racial min orities in STEM college and graduate school enrollment (Hurtado et al., 2008;Jackson, 1990;Perna, 2000Perna, , 2004Kienzl et al., 2009;Maple and Stage, 1991;Montmarquette et al., 2002). For example, although national statistics show that women account for over 55 % of bachelor's degree recipients, they are still the minority in STEM fields (Joy, 2000;Staniec, 2004). Further, there is consistent evidence that the attrition of women from STEM majors is significantly higher than that of men (Melguizo & Wolniak, 2012;Griffith, 2010;Whalen & Shelley, 2010). Similarly, there is substantial evidence that students of color lag behind in persistence and bachelor's degree completion in the STEM disciplines (Anderson & Kim, 2006;Dowd, Malcom, & Bensimon, 2009). In response, scholars have advocated for recruitment and retention strategies at different key points in education: PK-12, undergraduate, masters, doctorate, and postdoctoral levels (Abriola & Davies, 2006;Castillo-Chavez & Castillo-Garsow, 2006; to ameliorate the systemic barriers faced by women and racial minorities along the STEM \"pipeline.\" These studies all share a common concern with equity of opportunity of outcomes for women and racial minorities both in STEM education and STEM careers. However, scholars like Metcalf (2007Metcalf ( , 2010Metcalf ( , 2011, Teitelbaum (2003), and  have critiqued the pervasive trend to justify the call for greater diversity in STEM on predicted shortages of scientists and engineers. 38 Metcalf (2011) summarizes the \"lack of supply\" discourse as follows: STEM will have a shortage of (white, male, U.S. citizen) workers, putting the nation at competitive risk. Women, people of color, and more recently, international students are populations of \"untapped\" resources. Therefore, STEM needs more women, people of color, and international students to fill these shortages. The supply-side focus then becomes about recruiting and retaining these students as resources, particularly at each of the \"leaky\" points in the pipeline, often in problematic ways (p. 40). Metcalf 2011problematizes \"the view of women and people of color as passive resources to be harnessed\" as a way to avoid labor shortages. In this paradigm, short -term measures to retain women and minorities in STEM pathways are inadequate in that retention \"is defined in terms of supply at a given point in the pipeline without much concern f or the demand at the next point\" (p. 41). An exclusive focus on the supply-side tends to neglect aspects such as organizational resistance to change and the persistence of barriers to entry and advancement of women and racial minorities into the scientific and engineering professions (Etzkowitz, Kemelgor, & Uzzi, 2004, p.13). In this respect, some research has explored occupational outcomes for STEM college graduates. In a review of studies on the occupational outcome of college graduates, Xu (2013) cautions that a problem with this body of literature (which encompasses educational, organizational, economical, and sociological perspectives) is that there is no consistent terminology or classifications to define occupational choices and/or career outcomes. Definitions of occupational outcomes vary widely from one study to another, and can be as wide-ranging as \"white-collar occupation, blue-collar occupation, joining the military, staying at home, and returning to school\" (Keane & Wolpin, 1997) to \"enroll in graduate school, enroll in a first-professional degree program, pursue foreign study, or work fulltime\" (Ehrenberg, 1991). Researchers in the field of higher education have tended to focus attention on graduate school enrollment as an outcome (Ethington & Smart, 1986;Perna, 2004;Sax, 2001;Zhang, 2005). One important limitation in many of these studies is that earned wages is the most frequently used indicator of labor market returns and has been the focus of numerous studies of career outcomes in economics and education (Flyer, 1997;Melguizo & Wolniak , 2012;Smart, 1988;Staniec, 2004;Goyette & Mullen 2006). There are several explanations for this phenomenon. Xu (2013)  Reports on STEM employment usually emphasize (correctly) that, on average, STEM workers command higher wages than their non-STEM counterparts (e.g. Langdon et al., 2011;NSB, 2010NSB, , 2011. The problem with this type of assertion is that, by focusing on average wages alone, they can create a monolithic view of the STEM labor market that in which all STEM employment is created equal. As I showed in Chapters 4 and 5, within STEM occupations there are great differences between the top and bottom earners when we consider mean or median wages alone. When we take into account access to other employment characteristics, such as health and retirement benefits, we can see a clear pattern of segmentation in the STEM workforce that is not usually discussed in the literature. This observation is not intended to discount the value of studies using earned wages as the main (or only) indicator of labor market returns. On the contrary, these studies constitute an important window into the demand-side of STEM training and employment, and of how the disadvantage faced by women and minorities in higher education may continue after graduation. For example, there is evidence that gender differences in labor market returns are present at both the entry level and employment trajectories over time (Roksa & Levey, 2010). However, the findings of the present study suggest that, by not using more comprehensive measures of compensation, researchers may be missing important dimensions of STEM employment not captured by wages alone. Most poignantly, it is possible that the extent of the gender gap in STEM may be underestimated in current research and policy. As I showed in Chapter 6, there is compelling evidence that women in STEM have a higher likelihood of being employed in secondary jobs. The women in the sample were clearly overrepresented in clusters defined by part-time employment, but especially so in the secondary cluster, with its concomitant low-wages, no-benefits features. Moreover, the apparent mismatch between the cluster allocation of women and their credentials/work experience, suggests that the women in the sample may have encountered employment queues or other barriers to advancement in their occupations. This phenomenon lends support to prior research documenting the devaluation of female labor in science and academia (e.g. Bellas, 1994). At the same time, the use of LMS theory and the clustering procedure brings to light the compounded impact of secondary employment. That women earn considerably less than men, even after controlling for a wide set of characteristics such as education and age is one of the most robust facts in the STEM employment research (Langdon et al., 2011). The LMS framework alerts us to the possibility that the gap may be in fact wider (and run deeper) than previously thought, though of course there may be differences by field of study and occupational type. The present study speaks to the literature that interrogates the type and quality of employment available to STEM graduates. In this regard, the findings of the study provide a glimpse into how contingent employment is redefining labor relations in the broader STEM labor market. As I mentioned in the introduction, the higher education literature has long identified the \"casualization\" of the academic labor market (Bousquet, 2008) as an example of segmentation. It is not only the relative number of positions but also the types of job available to PhDs that have changed. 39 A growing proportion of faculty positions are being restructured into in non-tenure-track adjunct positions; at the same time, there is a growing proportion of new PhDs taking postdoctoral positions, and the length of postdoctoral appointments has also increased. While the rise in \"postdocs\" reflects a change in how scientists are trained, it also suggests a softer job market, especially in the sciences (Zusman, 2005). Indeed, a number of scholars have raised concerns about the ability of the labor market to absorb the growing numbers of doctorates Teitelbaum, 2003;Zusman, 2005). In 2006, former postdoc position holders who took the NSF's Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) reported \"additional training in doctorate field\" or \"training in an area outside of doctorate field\" as reasons for accepting their appointment. These reasons are consistent with the traditional intent of a postdoc position as a type of apprenticeship. However, by 2008, 10% of SDR respondents in a postdoc position checked \"other employment not available\" as the reason for taking their current postdoc position. This reason was given by \"9% of postdocs in the biological and agricultural sciences, 5% in the health sciences, 12% in computer sciences and mathematics, 12% in the physical sciences, 6% in the social sciences, and 16% in engineering\" (NSB, 2012, p. 167). Beyond the academic employment prospects of postdocs in STEM fields, other scholars have raised concerns about the working conditions in postdoctoral programs. In this respect, Cantwell (2009) posits that postdocs are in some ways the research equivalent to adjunct instructional faculty. Although most postdocs seek permanent employment, their working conditions are not secure; rather they are contingently employed, much like adjunct faculty. In some fields of study, the postdoc is becoming a form of \"permanently temporary\" employment for many individuals. Significant proportions of postdocs in the life sciences (17%) and physical sciences (12%) report holding multiple, usually successive, postdoctoral appointments (Hoffer, Grigorian & Hedberg, 2008). Further, postdocs-like adjunct faculty-often lack the protection of formalized academic freedom and collegial governance enjoyed by tenured-tracked faculty. These conditions seem to mark postdocs and adjuncts as institutional employees rather than autonomous professionals. Cantwell (2009) concludes that the working conditions of many postdocs are exploitative, in that \"postdocs are highly productive in comparison to their level of compensation and prospects for advancement\" (Cantwell, 2009, p. 212). 40 In short, there is reason to believe that adjunct and postdoc positions are not always stepping stones to independent positions, but instead might function as a way to maintain a cheap, yet highly skilled and productive, workforce (Metcalf, 2011). The growth of contingent teaching appointments and postdoctoral positions represent significant shifts in the quality of employment available to the most highly-trained STEM workers in the US. The case of PhDs has garnered significant attention in the literature due to their importance to STEM training and development. However, research on the extent to which similar shifts in employment patterns have impacted the broader STEM workforce is 40 A non-negligible share of doctorate holders are employed in jobs that are not related to their major field of study, or they are employed in occupations that do not require the doctorate. A study conducted by OECD/UNESCO Institute for Statistics estimates that among individuals who obtai ned a PhD in the U.S. between 1990 and 2006, 6.9% were in jobs not related to their doctorate degree (Auriol, 2010). rare. There seems to be a tacit assumption in the higher education literature that contingent labor is a phenomenon endemic to but also largely circumscribed to academic employment. This is a significant gap in the literature, considering that most of the non-professorial STEM work in the country is conducted by individuals with postsecondary qualifications other than the doctorate (National Science Board, 2010). In closing, it is crucial to approach these findings not as an aberration in an otherwise strong and healthy STEM labor market, but rather as symptomatic of broader trends in labor relations. As I mention in the theoretical framework, m any of the features associated with primary markets have been altered by the ongoing restructuring initiated by large corporations in the past two decades. Corporate restructuring and the use of contingent and nonstandard work arrangements have impacted occupations traditionally associated with primary market employment, namely professional and managerial jobs (Barker and Christensen, 1998). Decreasing wages, the growth of contingent employment, and the gradual disappearance of employer-provided benefits have resulted in a significant erosion of job security across all employment sectors. While STEM employment may be more resilient to these restructuring trends, the findings of the study show that it is far from immune to secondary characteristics. Similarly, while having a postsecondary degree still acts as a buffer against the most deleterious effects of employment erosion, there is evidence that even jobs requiring a postsecondary degree are gradually losing primary characteristics. For example, between 2000 and 2006 the number of Americans without health insurance rose from 38.4 million 47.0 million, primarily due to the precipitous decline in employer-provided health coverage for workers and their families. While uninsured workers are disproportionately young, nonwhite, less educated, and low wage, even the most highly educated and highest wage workers had lower rates of insurance coverage in 2006 than in 2000 (Gould, 2008). As I showed in Chapter 5, the unavailability of employer-provided health insurance is associated with other secondary characteristics for a significant proportion of STEM workers, and an even greater proportion of non-STEM workers, all of whom had a postsecondary diploma/certificate or above. In this respect, it behooves higher education researchers to approach postsecondary outcomes from angles that consider broader employment trends and their impact on STEM and non-STEM graduates-particularly women and underrepresented minorities. The supply-side and numbers-based approach \"needs to be supplemented by a focus on changing the institutional structures where science takes place\" (Etzkowitz et al.,p. 245). Improving these groups' position in STEM employment requires more than simply increasing the pool of STEM degree holders. Without substantive change in employment structures, numeri c representation may do little to improve the experiences of STEM participants (Metcalfe, 2011;Hill, Corbett & St. Rose (2010). Significantly, there must be a recognition that, while higher education can still-and must-do much more to ensure equitable educational opportunities and outcomes for women and underrepresented minorities, our efforts may be Sisyphean if they do not find a counterpart in labor policy. An ongoing dialogue must take place between STEM education (at all levels), employers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to truly understand not only the barriers to equity in employment relations, but the mechanisms that create and maintain segmentation. In the next and final section, I outline some recommendations for policy and future research that may build upon the findings of this study."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Policy and Future Research", "text": "1. Advocate for the availability and use of measures of total compensation One of the main challenges faced by researchers interested in interrogating the demand-side of STEM employment is that, currently, dedicated STEM databases do not contain sufficient information for this kind of analyses. For example, the NSF Survey of Doctorate Recipients includes data on whether a respondent has access to health insurance, but only for respondents who are currently employed as postdocs. As I mentioned in Chapter 4, this situation was one of the main reasons that led me to choose a non -dedicated database for this study. With this in mind, a critical recommendation for policy i s to revise the dedicated NSF databases to allow for more in-depth analyses of STEM quality of employment. Two major revisions are of special importance: 1) To collect data on variables related to employment quality, including but not restricted to, employer-provided health insurance (currently available only for postdocs), access to pension benefits, characteristics of second job (in particular whether it is in STEM or not), and access to career ladders; and 2) To revise the definition of STEM to include individuals with subbaccalaureate degree attainment. 2. Advocate for research and data collection on STEM subbaccalaureate degree attainment and STEM technical labor In recent years, scholars have devoted attention to the role of community colleges in increasing the representation of female and minority students in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (Brazziel and Brazziel, 1994;Starobin, 2004;Starobin & Laanan, 2005;Tsapogas, 2004). Despite this salutary interest in the STEM education at the community college level, significant gaps remain in our understanding of STEM degree attainment at the associate's level. Much of the research on this topic focuses on the transition from community college into four-year programs in STEM and non-STEM fields. Community colleges provide the first 2 years of many students' education before they transfer to an STEM program at a 4-year institutions (AACC, 2009;Karp, 2008;NSB, 2010). 41 The need for research on transfer from community college to 4-year degrees is critical, since the community college offers an important pathway into science and engineering degrees for women, underrepresented minorities, and low-income students (Tsapogas, 2004). However, less attention has been given to terminal STEM degree attainment at the community college level. Yet according to estimates by the National Science Board (2012), associate's degrees accounted for 7.5% of all STEM degrees awarded in the US, making it the third largest level of degree attainment in science and engineering. Moreover, associate's degrees in science and engineering (including engineering technology) represented about 11% of all associate's degrees in 2009. STEM degree attainment at the community college level is an area of study ripe for investigation in higher education. One particular area of interest concerns the labor outcomes of individuals with STEM degrees at the subbaccalaureate level. The economic benefits that accrue to individuals with a postsecondary education are well-documented (Grubb, 1992(Grubb, , 1996Mullin, 2011). The accrued economic, social and personal benefits of obtaining a baccalaureate degree over obtaining an associate's degree at a two -year institution are well documented (Lin & Vogt, 1996;Grubb, 1992). At the same time, researchers have established the benefits of holding a subbaccalaureate degree over a high school diploma. According to Mullin (2011), the 2009 median annual earnings for associate's degree holders were $7,020 more than those of high school graduates. Likewise, the annual gain in median earnings for individuals with some college attainment, such as a certificate, was $3,796 higher than for a high school graduate. For technical and occupational students, the subbaccalaureate certificate or a terminal associate's degree can provide significant opportunities for social mobility when compared to individuals with no postsecondary education (Cejda & Rhodes, 2004). In some cases, earnings for some subbaccalaureate programs outstrip even those from a bachelor's degree. For example, 23% of bachelor's degree holders earn less than those with a license or certificate but not an associate degree, and 25% of those with bachelor's degrees earn less than those with associate degrees (Carnevale, Strohl, & Smith, 2009). 42 Yet because much of the focus is on transfer to 4-year programs, research on the labor outcomes of individuals with terminal associate's degrees in STEM fields is scarce. who have had community college experiences\" (Metcalf, 2011, p. 48). This is a significant omission, considering the need for and use of highly technical skills by the subbaccalaureate STEM workforce, and it leads to a third recommendation for policy and future research: 3. Advocate for research that considers that ways in which STEM knowledge and skills are used in \"non-traditional\" STEM occupations The new economy introduced not only drastic changes to employment relations in the US: it also gave rise to a significant transformation of the nature of scientific and technological work. As knowledge becomes the most important form of global capital, a 42 Technical occupations in which an associate's degree commands higher wages than a bachelor's de gree include actuarial science; drafters; engineering technicians; surveying and mapping technicians; as well as the broad category of \"Miscellaneous Life, Physical, and Social Science Technicians, Including Social Science Research Assistants And Nuclear Technicians\" (Carnevale, Strohl, & Smith, 2009). fundamental rethinking of the traditional relationships between education, learning and work takes place (Olssen & Peters, 2005, p. 334). Capitalist modes of knowledge production encourage partnerships among faculty, managerial professionals, and workers in industry across a variety of different fields. At the same time, the traditional boundaries between the private and public sectors, as well as between disciplines, become more tenuous (Harding, 2006;Mukerji, 1990;Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004). The fact that these blurred boundaries are not represented in most definitions of science and engineering/non -science and engineering, severely limit the accuracy with which researchers can understand what constitutes scientific work (Metcalf, 2011). The exclusion of technical labor and health-related occupations from the traditional definition of STEM is a case in point. In recent years, a number of researchers have argued that research on careers in STEM and medicine is artificially segregated. The chan ging nature of work in these fields, as well as the reality of interdisciplinary paths to degree attainment in them, makes the separation of STEM and medicine into separate tracks untenable. As such, researchers have called for the need to combine these two strands into a single strand of study-STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine) (Miller & Solberg, 2012;Kimmel, Miller & Eccles, 2012). As I have done in this study, this emerging literature also argues for the need to recognize the importance of technical labor: As almost all STEMM professionals know, other individuals with specialized training and skills perform much of the day-to-day work in the laboratories or on the research teams of STEMM professionals. Many of these positions are well known. Skilled technicians and technologists perform a substantial portion of day-to-day bench science, and no laboratory would operate for long without these valued staff members. Laboratories and engineering firms depend on large numbers of skilled workers who build apparatus, repair equipment, and program computers and other devices. A physician may be the quarterback of a health care team, but there are many nurses, therapists, and technicians who provide much of the hands-on care in clinics and hospitals. The growth of information and communication technologies has produced an increasing number of information technology specialists, ranging from IT workers that install and maintain networks to webmasters that build and update websites (Miller & Soldberg, 2012, p. 8). In recognition of the importance of acknowledging the inextricable link between the traditional STEM professions, health occupations, and technical occupations, the National Science Board has advocated for a more inclusive definition of STEM. This is an important step towards a more complete understanding of STEM employment. However, unless it is coupled with concrete measures of data collection on the part of the major federal agencies, our understanding of the dynamics of STEM employment will continue to be lacking. In this study, I limited the analysis of the SIPP database to individuals with a postsecondary degree who were employed in STEM and non-STEM occupations. However, a further exploration of the intersection between degree attainment and occupational type would further refine our understanding of employment dynamics for these populations. As I mention in Chapter 3, the topical module in Wave 2 of the 2008 SIPP covers education and training information. Individuals are asked if they have completed various levels of schooling, including a PhD, professional degree, baccalaureate degree, associate degree, vocational certificate, high school diploma, or less than four years of high school. The respondents are also asked to provide the broad field of study of their highest degree. Identification of the intersection between level of degree attainment, STEM or non-STEM degree, and STEM or non-STEM occupation yields the sub-groups shown in Table 43: The intersections of STEM degree with STEM professional, health-related, and technical occupations constitute the broad definition of STEM; in turn, the lower far -right box constitutes the absolute non-STEM labor market. The two remaining subgroups are of special importance to further research. The upper far-right box denotes a group of individuals that have from a number of reasons moved away from their STEM training into non-STEM occupations. It is important to know more about these \"departures\" of the ST EM postsecondary education system. While the survey data does not allow researchers to determine the reasons behind the shift to non-STEM occupations, further exploration of the SIPP database can tell us something about the characteristics of the jobs held by this group and how they compare to those who remained in STEM and STEM-related occupations.  Table 44 shows, during the 2008 economic downturn, the gap between U6 and the standard unemployment rate (U3) among workers in STEM occupations was substantially smaller than the comparable gap in the general labor force. At the same time, this table contrasts the NSF's narrow classification of S&E occupations (does not include technicians or managers) with the broader grouping which includes science and engineering technicians, computer programmers, and managers. The table shows that both the U3 and U6 indicators are consistently higher for the STEM classification than for the S&E classification in the selected periods. This suggests that analyses that do not include managers and technicians working in STEM and STEM-related fields may significantly underestimate unemployment rates (in both the standard sense, and in terms of those who work part-time but want to work full-time) among STEM workers. 6. Implement novel approaches to investigate the transition from STEM postsecondary education to the labor market Finally, it is important to recognize that quantitative data-at least in the form of currently available datasets-can only tell us so much about how segmentation operates and is sustained in the STEM labor market. In this regard, statistical data must be contextualized with qualitative research that sheds light on the causes and processes of segmentation, as well as on its impact on STEM workers. Qualitative research could help us understanding the ways in which phenomena like queuing take place in the STEM workforce. What are the educational and occupational pathways of workers in secondary employment? Is there a mismatch between their occupational aspirations and their current field and place of employment? Did they try to apply for primary-type employment but were diverted from it? What values and power relations were at play? Other topics for qualitative research are suggested by the findings of this study. For example, a potential topic for qualitative research is investigating the role that union membership may play an important role in brokering access to jobs with primary characteristics ethnic minorities in these occupations, as well as for women. It is possible that important differences may exist by occupational field, age of the employee, or even geographical location (e.g. as in whether the state in which a STEM worker is located is union-friendly or not). Another topic for further research concerns the nature of non-academic contingent employment in STEM. The findings of the cluster analysis point to some aspects of LMS theory that require updating to reflect the significant changes that the labor market has experienced in the past 20-30 years. The consistent appearance of a \"contractor\" cluster in both the STEM and non-STEM samples flouts the LMS assumption that part-time work is exclusively associated with secondary characteristics such as lower levels of compensation, high turnover rates, and lack of benefits. Instead, the findings lend support to the notion that contingent employment in the new economy is more heterogeneous than traditional LMS theory would predict, and that at least some forms of part-time employment may be closer to the definition of a primary labor market. Conducting interviews with workers employed in this type of work arrangement could provide important information regarding the workers' perception of contractor work, their level of satisfaction, and whether they had the option of working full-time but preferred contractual work. A related topic for research could explore the experiences of STEM workers employed in temporary staffing agencies-a population estimated to include more than 100,000 STEM professionals (CPST, 2006). Finally, theoretical and methodological approaches from Social Network Analysis (SNA) may be valuable to the study of the transition from STEM postsecondary training to the labor market. The literature on access to social capital focuses on the social resources that are within the reach of an individual through his or her social networks. For example, the accessed social capital model (Lin, 1999) predicts that a number of personal characteristics play an important part in determining the extent of resources that an individual can access through such network resources. These characteristics include human capital (education, experiences), initial positions (parental or prior job statuses), and social ties (e.g., extensity of ties). The extent of social resources thus accessible to the individual are expected to impact the statuses he or she may attain, such as occupational status, authority positions, sectors, or earnings (Lin, 1999). This model can provide a useful framework to explore the social resources to which recent STEM graduate have access, and how these resources may promote or hinder employment in primary or secondary segments. More importantly, the model is amenable to analyses of differential access to resources for specific groups of students or workers, such as based on gender, race, or national origin. This approach may be particularly useful to tease out the dynamics of \"displacement\" or \"diversion\" impingent upon the movement of native-born away from STEM jobs. As I described in Chapter 6, a third (non-exclusionary) alternative to the displacement and diversion frameworks is possible, especially in the case of women. Faced with a segmented labor market in which employment queues restrict access to primary-type jobs, female job-seekers may 1) be forced into secondary STEM jobs; or 2) be diverted to non-STEM jobs. A possible element of diversion not currently addressed in the literature may involve the access of workers to social resources (i.e. networks) that may facilitate or hinder entry to primary employment. Techniques based on SNA have the potential to reveal patterns of social resources in STEM employment not discernible in traditional quantitative or qualitative research. In terms of sampling, SIPP differs significantly from most data sets used to examine earnings. Each year, a new SIPP sample (or \"panel\") is developed. 43 Each panel includes households whose members are interviewed every four months. Households in each panel are also divided into four \"rotation groups\" with only one rotation group given interviews each month; as a result, information from each rotation group differs slightly in its timing within a given year. Core questions collect critical data on labor force, income, and program participation data. Collected data on employment and earnings includes topics such as respondent's labor force status for each week of the reference period, characteristics of employers, self-employment and business ownership, earnings from either jobs or selfemployment, unemployment compensation during the reference period, time spent looking for work, moonlighting, employment situation for up to two jobs and two businesses (U.S. Census, 2012: SIPP Users' Guide) In addition to the core questions, which remain constant from one wave to the next, the SIPP periodically asks individuals to complete more specific questionnaires called \"topical modules.\" As opposed to core items, topical questions are not repeated in each wave, and their frequency and timing vary. Topical questions sometimes appear in separate topical modules that follow the core questions; at other times they are placed with core questions that relate to the same topic. Although SIPP was designed primarily as a longitudinal instrument, the breadth of subjects and detail of data in the topical module files is amenable to cross-sectional analyses on multiple subjects, including labor market characteristics. For example, wave 2 of the 2008 panel includes a module dedicated to education and training, a topic of particular interest for the purposes of the proposed study. Among other data, this topical module provides information on the respondents' levels of schooling, field of study of highest degree, and whether the respondent held a Federal Aid grant while pursuing a postsecondary degree. According to the SIPP users' guide, (U.S. Census, 2012), the Census Bureau follows a two-stage sample design to select the SIPP sample:"}, {"section_title": "1.", "text": "Selection of primary sampling units (PSUs): The frame consists of U.S. counties and independent cities, along with population counts and other data for those units from the most recent census of population."}, {"section_title": "2.", "text": "Selection of address units within sample PSUs: Five separate, nonoverlapping frames are used: a unit area frame, a group quarters frame, a housing unit coverage frame, a coverage improvement frame, and a new construction frame. 44 A housing unit is defined as living quarters with its own entrance and cooking facilities. SIPP's complex arrangement of panels, rotations, and waves presents challenges to analysts, especially in longitudinal studies. Because the present study is interested in a cross-sectional view of the STEM labor market, sorting through the maze of core and topical questions across waves is relatively less labor intensive. However, several challenges remain. For example, software packages that assume simple random sampling for variance estimation will underestimate the true standard errors of SIPP estimates. Likewise, analyzing topical module data requires close scrutiny of both core and topical data. In SIPP, \"topical module\" really refers to all topical items of the same theme, instead of those that are grouped into a distinct module. Moreover, reference periods for items in topical modules vary widely, ranging from the respondent's status at the time of the interview to the respondent's experience over his or her entire life. Examining topical data requires paying close attention to the universe of respondents for a particular question, since topical modules are not uniformly asked of all respondents.
