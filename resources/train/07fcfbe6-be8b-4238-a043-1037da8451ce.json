An emerging consensus recognises the importance of metastability in healthy neural dynamics where the transition between network states over time is dependent upon the structural connectivity between brain regions. In Alzheimer's disease (AD) -the most common form of dementia -these couplings are progressively weakened, metastability of neural dynamics are reduced and cognitive ability is impaired. Accordingly, we use a joint empirical and computational approach to reveal how behaviourally relevant changes in neural metastability are contingent on the structural integrity of the anatomical connectome. We estimate the metastability of fMRI BOLD signal in subjects from across the AD spectrum and in healthy controls and demonstrate the dissociable effects of structural disconnection on synchrony versus metastability. In addition, we reveal the critical role of metastability in general cognition by demonstrating the link between an individuals cognitive performance and their metastable neural dynamic. Finally, using whole-brain computer modelling, we demonstrate how a healthy neural dynamic is conditioned upon the topological integrity of the structural connectome.

Rather than viewing apparently contrary phenomena as irreconcilable features of the world, the \"philosophy of complementary pairs\" recognises their mutually related nature while simultaneously honouring their differences (Kelso & Engstrom, 2006; Engstr\u00f8m and Kelso, 2008) . One such \"complementary pair\" may be found in the dialogue between synchrony and asynchrony in the brain -a reflection of the growing consensus that the complementary nature of integrating and segregating tendencies is an essential feature of how brains operate Kelso, 2001, 2016) . Accordingly, several developmental, traumatic, and neurodegenerative conditions could be described as an imbalance in the optimal working point of synchrony and asynchrony (Uhlhaas and Singer, 2006; Uhlhaas, 2015) . Epilepsy, for example, could be described in terms of excess neural order -synchrony has become a tyrant. Conversely, several neuropsychiatric conditions, in which the structure of the brain is abnormal e.g. schizophrenia, autism, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are defined by an excess of neural disorder or asynchrony.\nRecently, these observations have been placed on firm empirical and theoretical ground by appealing to a dynamical regime known as metastability (Kelso, 1995 (Kelso, , 2012 Kelso, 2009, 2014a; 2014b) , in which the tendency for local regions to express their independence is balanced with the requirement to integrate and coordinate information globally . The advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has permitted these observations to be tested in-silico . Here, networks of oscillators interact on a backbone of inferred inter-regional white matter known as the structural connectome (Ghosh et al., 2008; Deco et al., 2009 Deco et al., , 2013a 2013b; Honey et al., 2010; Deco and Jirsa, 2012; Cabral et al., 2014; Breakspear, 2017) . In this way, connectomic-based computer modelling permits an analysis of the structural connectivity's role in shaping the brain's functional architecture. The relationship between the connectome's structural integrity and metastable neural dynamics has previously been investigated in a model of traumatic brain injury . In this work, Hellyer et al. (2015) observed that decreases in neural metastability were behaviourally relevant and linked to damage within the connectome. In other work, V a sa et al. (2015) appraised the impact of removing individual nodes on metastability in a systematic manner.\nThe relationship between structure and function is also altered in Alzheimer's disease -the most common form of dementia. AD presents as a steadily worsening constellation of symptoms that mirror the gradual accumulation of misfolded amyloid protein and neurofibrillary tangles. Accordingly, patients are situated on a continuum of phenotypes related to cognitive status ranging from slight memory loss in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) through to advanced cognitive and behavioural deficits in overt AD. The transition between diagnostic categories is marked by a reliable asymptotic decline in overall neural metastability that conforms to the pathophysiological staging of the disease (C ordova-Palomera et al., 2017; Demirta\u015f et al., 2017) .\nIn light of the foregoing, the present paper utilises a dual empirical and computational approach to investigate the relationship between topological properties of the structural connectome, metastable neural dynamics, and cognitive performance in healthy control (HC) subjects and in patients from across the AD spectrum. For this reason, resting state functional and structural neuroimaging data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; Mueller et al., 2005) in three subject groups including healthy control (HC), mild cognitive impairment, and AD. The inclusion of resting state or task-free fMRI into the functional imaging suite has been especially advantageous to dementia researchers where subject compliance can be an issue -here subjects are simply required to lie down and stay awake. In the absence of an assigned task, the ultra-low frequency (<0.1HZ) blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal demonstrates several distinct patterns of covariance across the cortex known as resting state networks (Damoiseaux et al., 2006) . Several neurodegenerative disorders including AD show dissociable patterns of abnormal structure and function in these networks consistent with a disconnection syndrome (Seeley et al., 2009) . Converging lines of evidence from experimental neuropathology (Braak and Braak, 1991) , neuroimaging (Greicius et al., 2004; Buckner et al., 2005) , and transgenic animal studies (Palop and Mucke, 2010) support the contention that AD, in part, represents a disconnection syndrome. Indeed, recent empirical findings emphasise the importance of early inter-areal white matter connectivity in AD pathogenesis (O'Dwyer et al., 2011a (O'Dwyer et al., , 2011b and challenge the conventional view that AD solely represents a disease of the grey matter (Sachdev et al., 2013) . Contemporary observations suggests that 1), white matter abnormalities occur while grey matter is still relatively preserved (Brun and Englund, 1986; de la Monte, 1989; Heise et al., 2010; Zhuang et al., 2012) ; 2), that demyelination and axonal abnormalities occur before the formation of amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangles (Desai et al., 2009 (Desai et al., , 2010 ; and 3), that impaired axonal transport not only precedes the downstream production of grey matter amyloid but actively participates in its formation (Wirths et al., 2006 (Wirths et al., , 2007 Smith et al., 2007) .\nThe paper is structured as follows. We first estimate the global neural metastability of fMRI BOLD signal in resting state networks across the three subject populations (HC/MCI/AD) and we evaluate the impact of macroscopic structural disconnection on large-scale neural metastability.\nFor this we employ whole-brain computer models informed by subjectlevel anatomical connectivity. We then explore the relationship between local network topology in the healthy connectome and damage at the regional level between nodes of the computer model. Next, we investigate how damage to the large-scale structural topology of the connectome effects the metastability of simulated neural dynamics. Differences in synchrony and metastability of fMRI BOLD signal in patients and controls are investigated using the network based statistic (NBS). Finally, we ascertain if the empirical estimates of brain-wide neural metastability are linked to cognitive ability.\nBy virtue of these steps, we found that: 1) macroscopic damage to the structural connectome elicited comparable reductions in simulated metastability to that observed in the empirical data; 2) damage to the computer model's connectivity was centred around highly connected nodes; 3) reductions in simulated neural metastability were the product of abnormal network topology; 4) widespread decreases in metastability between empirical resting state networks in AD subjects contrasted sharply with more focal decreases in synchrony; and 5) reductions in large-scale metastability of fMRI BOLD signal correlated with cognitive test scores across the AD spectrum. Overall, the results of our joint computational modelling and empirical analysis suggest a key linkage between metastable neural dynamics, cognition and the structural integrity of the human brain."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data overview", "text": "Data were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc. edu).

Masks were transformed from individual anatomical to individual diffusion space. The grey-white matter interface surface triangulation was dilated into a 3D volume, labelled to match the adjacent cortical parcellation and split into 148 separate masks for use as seed and target regions. Tracks exiting the union of grey-white matter interface and cortical white matter were regarded as spurious and terminated. Registrations were performed using the FSL (FMRIB's Software Library, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) software package tool FLIRT (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001; Jenkinson et al., 2002; Greve and Fischl, 2009 ) and FNIRTs (Andersson et al., 2007) .\nProbabilistic white matter tractography was performed on the diffusion weighted images using the MRtrix3 software package (http://www. mrtrix.org). Crossing fibres were resolved using the constrained spherical deconvolution algorithm (Tournier et al., 2004 (Tournier et al., , 2012 . MRtrix3 pre-processing included computing the diffusion tensor images (or diffusion ellipsoids) for each voxel from which fractional anisotropy images were subsequently generated.

The seed mask voxel and corresponding target mask voxel were identified and recorded for each track. To address the uncertainty surrounding the relationship between the number of tracks generated for a given pathway and the synaptic strength of that pathway, only distinct connections between seed and target voxels contributed toward overall track count. Track counts were subsequently converted into track density by dividing total track count between region i and region j by total seed and target mask volume and normalising between zero and one.

Under complete independence, all phases are uniformly distributed and R RSN approaches zero. Conversely, if all phases are equally distributed, R RSN approaches one and full synchrony. Global metastability was calculated using all 148 cortical regions. The maintenance of a particular communication channel through coherence implies a persistent phase relationship. The number or repertoire of such channels therefore corresponds to the variability of these phase relationships (i.e. the metastability) measured as the standard deviation of R RSN Deco and Kringelbach, 2016) ."}, {"section_title": "Assessing connectivity changes between empirical resting state networks", "text": "Given that 1), the current formulation of metastability only permits calculation between a set of regions, and 2), that inter-connected subnetworks convey more behaviourally relevant information than single pairs of functional connectivity observed in isolation (Smith et al., 2009) , we argue that an approach exploiting the clustering structure of connectivity alterations between functionally related networks may offer the optimal outcome in assessing connectivity changes between empirical resting state networks. Accordingly, we apply the NBS to measures of synchrony and metastability estimated from empirical fMRI data at the network rather than regional level.\nThe NBS is a non-parametric statistical test designed to deal with the multiple comparisons problem on a graph by identifying the largest connected sub-component (either increases or decreases) in topological space while controlling the family wise error rate (FWER). To date, several studies have used the method to identify pairwise regional connections that are associated with either an experimental effect or between-group difference in functional connectivity (Zalesky et al., 2010) .\nThe present paper adopts a related, but slightly different approach. Rather than applying the NBS to a matrix of pairwise regional correlations, we apply the NBS to measures of synchrony and metastability evaluated at the resting state network level. Accordingly, pairwise interactions between all nine resting state networks were evaluated using the approach described above (see section 2.9). In the case of synchrony, we applied the NBS to 36 9 \u00c2 9 symmetric matrices derived from healthy controls and 34 9 \u00c2 9 symmetric matrices derived from subjects with AD. Of the matrices, each row/column represented an interaction between a resting state network and eight others. We performed the same procedure in the case of metastability. We report the mean synchrony and metastability of each group's interaction matrix in the supplementary information (Figs. S2 and S3) .\nFirst mass univariate testing is used to test the hypothesis of interest at every connection in the graph. Each connection is provided with a single test statistic capturing the evidence in favour of the null hypothesis, that is, there is no significant difference in the means of the two diagnostic groups (HC vs. MCI, HC vs. AD). Second, the test statistic is thresholded at an arbitrary value. The set of connections exceeding this threshold are admitted into a set of supra-threshold connections representing potential candidates for which the null hypothesis can be rejected. The third step is to identify topological clusters among the supra-threshold connections for which a connected path can be found between any two nodes. It is important to note that clustering is not in physical space, rather the NBS clusters in topological space where a cluster corresponds to a connected graph component. The null hypothesis is therefore rejected or confirmed at the level of the whole structure rather than at the level of individual connections. The final step is to compute a FWER-corrected p-value for each component using permutation testing. For each permutation, the above three steps are repeated to construct an empirical null distribution of the largest connected component size. The FWER-corrected p-value for a component of a given size is estimated as the proportion of permutations for which the largest component was of the same size or greater. The size of a component can be measured in two ways 1) as the total number of connections or extent of that component or 2) as the sum of the test statistic values across all connections, namely, the intensity of that component. Extent is appropriate for detecting relatively weak effects Fig. 2 .

The resting state fMRI data of 36 control subjects was decomposed into fifteen independent components nine of which resembled canonical resting state networks (Smith et al., 2009 ). These nine were subsequently projected into the same space as the Destrieux atlas. Regions exhibiting a mean z-score > 2.3 (p < 0.01) were entered into that network. that extend to encompass many connections while intensity is more suitable for detecting strong, focal effects confined to a limited number of connections.

Tracts demonstrating significantly lower FA than controls (p < 0.05; uncorrected) were lesioned from the healthy template i.e. the average structural connectivity of controls. This corresponded to a 5% probability that a control subject would exhibit an FA value this low. Since total denervation was unlikely, the strength of coupling was weakened by 50% with values ranging from 25 to 75% producing comparable results.\nIn detail, FA values FA(i, j) of tracks running between pairwise regions i and j were concatenated for all 30 controls to form a 3D matrix HC (i, j, k) of size HC148 \u00c2 148 \u00c2 30.

Summing each row provided a regional measure corresponding to the total number of lesions in the connectivity of that region. Fig. 4 shows this metric normalised between zero and one plotted on the inflated cortical surface of the Destrieux atlas where dark blue corresponds to zero lesions and yellow to the highest number recorded.\nThe purpose of the consensus distribution was three-fold: 1), to demonstrate how lesions were distributed on the cortical surface; 2), to determine which features of nodal topology were most associated with damage; and 3), to evaluate the distribution of lesions within the richclub i.e. a network of high degree nodes that are more connected to each other than expected by chance (van den Heuvel and Sporns, 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Generating group-level structural connectivity", "text": "Since networks grow or shrink in size depending on the choice of NBS threshold (note however the FWER is always controlled regardless of the choice of threshold) we employ a model-based fitting approach to determine the most likely structural skeleton (and hence threshold) responsible for generating the observed dynamic.\nIn this scenario, the NBS is used to guide the lesioning process. The resulting structure is used to inform coupling in the cortical network model.

Here, global synchronisation dynamics emerge through the reciprocal interaction of pairwise nodes coupled through the underlying anatomical structure. Despite its apparent simplicity, the Kuramoto model generates macroscopic dynamics comparable to significantly more complex spiking models at a significantly reduced computational cost (Mess e et al., 2014) .\nThe phase \u03b8\u00f0t\u00de of each oscillator i is governed by the equation:\nwhere \u03c9 represents the oscillator's natural frequency i.e. the phase change of an uncoupled node per time step, N the total number of connections made by the oscillator, K i, j the strength of coupling between oscillators i and j, and \u03c1 a fixed phase lag. In this context, phase lag is used as a tuning parameter to match the simulated metastability to that of the empirical BOLD data (see: Computational model validation and tuning).\nCollective synchronisation between a set of oscillators can be achieved by increasing the coupling strength between the oscillating units, or by introducing a homogeneous distribution of frequencies between the oscillators. However, these strategies fail in the case where coupling between oscillators induces phase lags (Kundu et al., 2017) . Such a scenario is common among many real-world systems (including the brain) where components take time to respond to their neighbouring oscillators. Under phase-frustration, the system indefinitely avoids synchronisation, even when frequencies are homogeneous and coupling is relatively strong. The phase lag parameter between oscillators can therefore be conceptualised as form of fixed time delay (Shanahan, 2010; Wildie and Shanahan, 2012) . Metastable fluctuations in synchrony are only present for a critical range of the phase lag parameter. In this regime, integrative and segregative tendencies between oscillators are continually engaged but never fully reconciled. The present paper simulates the BOLD signal directly using low frequency oscillators (Ponce-Alvarez et al., 2015) . Such an approach should be distinguished from previous work where simulated electro-physiological signals (Hellyer et al., 2014 V a sa et al., 2015) were transformed into BOLD signals using Balloon-Windkessel hemodynamics (Cabral et al., 2011 (Cabral et al., , 2012 . Since the match between simulated and empirical functional connectivity is largely insensitive to the inclusion of hemodynamic effects (Mess e et al., 2014), Balloon-Windkessel hemodynamics are not included here.\nThe oscillator's intrinsic frequency f i and natural frequency \u03c9 i are related through the equation f i \u00bc \u03c9 i =2\u03c0. The intrinsic frequencies are characterised as limit cycles distributed in the low frequency 0.04-0.07 Hz range of empirical BOLD signal oscillation. The model was numerically simulated in MATLAB 2016a (https://uk.mathworks.com) using the Runge-Kutta integration scheme with a time step of 10 ms.

Instead, model validation and tuning was performed by correlating the average functional connectivity of the empirical BOLD data of healthy subjects with the average functional connectivity of the simulated cortical model over several runs at a given value of the phase lag parameter (Fig. 5A) . The value of phase lag producing the highest correlation (~1.1 rad) between simulated and empirical functional connectivity corresponded to the regime where empirical and simulated data agreed with each other (Fig. 5B and C) ; (Cabral et al., 2011 (Cabral et al., , 2012 Hellyer et al., 2014 Hellyer et al., , 2015 V a sa et al., 2015) .

Interference to one component destabilises the triad, leading to measurable changes in the activity of the remaining two. This paper asked two broadly interrelated questions. How do higher level cognitive processes emerge from the interactions of dynamical networks of anatomically based brain connectivity, and how do disruptions to the topology of this structure impact network dynamics and ultimately cognition? To answer these questions, we interrogated the neural dynamics of MCI and AD subjects for changes in metastability. In AD, macroscopic damage to the structural connectome produced reductions in simulated metastability comparable to that observed in empirical fMRI data (Fig. 6) .

Nodes are positioned at the centre of mass of their respective cortical parcellation. At each threshold, identified nodes had their connectivity lesioned from the average control connectivity. The resulting structure informed coupling strength between nodes in a group-level simulation. connectivity was focused around nodes scoring high in topological centrality, integration, and efficiency (Fig. 7) . Reductions in simulated metastability were associated with damage to the connectome's global topology (Fig. 8) . Brain-wide decreases in metastability contrasted sharply with more focal decreases in synchrony between resting state networks important for cognitive control (Fig. 9) . Finally, the empirical decreases showed behavioural relevance, correlating with a subject's global cognitive ability (Fig. 10) . Overall, the results of our dual computer modelling and empirical study suggest a causal relationship between metastability of neural dynamics, cognitive performance and the structural integrity of the human connectome.\nWe found reduced metastability in the global neural dynamic of fMRI BOLD signal in AD patients compared to healthy controls (Fig. 6) . In a computer model informed by subject-level connectivity data, macroscopic structural disconnection was associated with reduced metastability of resting state neural dynamic in AD (Fig. 6 ) that matched similar declines in empirical data. Damage was selectively distributed according to the topological properties of each node in the healthy connectome (Fig. 7A-D) . Rich-club hubs (Fig. 7E-F) and long distance, inter-modular tracts were especially vulnerable (Fig. S6) . Reductions in simulated metastability correlated with damage to the structural connectome's large-scale topology (Fig. 8) . Decreases in metastability were evident between most of the brain's resting state networks (Fig. 9) . This is especially important in AD, as resting state networks are known to display a high degree of behavioural relevance (Smith et al., 2009) . The level of neural metastability exhibited by a subject was related to the degree of behavioural impairment measured through cognitive testing (Fig. 10) . These results lend further support to previous empirical observations of reduced cognitive flexibility and resting state neural metastability in conditions where network topology has been altered V a sa et al., 2015) .\nEigenvector centrality correlated positively with damaged connectivity in the computer model (Fig. 7A) . Our findings are consistent with the selective vulnerability demonstrated by topologically important hub nodes in neurodegenerative disorders (Crossley et al., 2014) . In AD, the elevated metabolism of default mode network hubs appears to convey a greater risk of pathology (Buckner et al., 2009 ) -a view consistent with transgenic animal studies linking cellular activity to amyloid deposition (Cirrito et al., 2005; Bero et al., 2011) and simulations of activity dependent degeneration in hub regions (de Haan et al., 2012) . Other hypotheses concerning the nature of brain network organisation and distribution of neuropathology have been proposed (Zhou et al., 2012) . Foremost among these is the contention that pathology spreads transsynaptically in a prion-like manner between structurally and functionally related networks (Jaunmuktane et al., 2015) . In support of this view, patterns of circumscribed atrophy are not randomly distributed with Fig. 12 . Determining the most likely group-level structural skeleton (or NBS threshold) responsible for generating the empirically observed resting state network synchronisation dynamic in the AD cohort. A, Mean correlation between simulated synchrony (generated from a computer model with coupling defined by group-level connectivity) and empirical synchrony (measured in fMRI BOLD signal) drawn in blue with 95% CI. For comparison, the mean correlation between the simulated synchrony of a random control (generated from a computer model with randomly defined coupling) and empirical synchrony (measured in fMRI BOLD signal) is in red with 95% CI. Cohen's d effect size is indicated by black dashed line. The group-level connectivity or NBS threshold (4.8) at which correlation between simulated and empirical synchrony approximately peaked (r \u00bc 0.9) and the Cohen effect size maximised (d \u00bc 2.9) was considered optimal. B, Same as in A but for metastability. At the group-level connectivity or NBS threshold of 4.8, correlations between simulated and empirical metastability are at their peak (r \u00bc 0.83) and the Cohen effect size is moderate (d \u00bc 0.75). C, Disconnected FA sub-networks identified by the NBS in a group of 30 patients with AD at different thresholds (p < 0.05; corrected). Nodes are positioned at the centre of mass of their respective cortical parcellation. At each threshold, identified nodes had their connectivity lesioned from the average control connectivity. The resulting structure informed coupling strength between nodes in a group-level simulation.\nrespect to the modular architecture of the brain. Rather, they appear to be constrained within specific resting state networks depending on the identity of the neurodegenerative disorder (Seeley et al., 2009 ). In keeping with this hypothesis, a relatively simple anatomically constrained diffusion process accurately predicted spatial patterns of neurodegeneration in AD (Raj et al., 2012) . Our results indicate that pathological material is disseminated through the cortex by a network of nodes scoring high in eigenvector centrality.\nTopologically integrated nodes with high clustering coefficient (Fig. 7B ) and local efficiency (Fig. 7C) constituted a second locus of disruption in the computer model. Local network features providing tight integration between neighbouring nodes may facilitate the spread of pathological disease vectors within local communities (Raj et al., 2012) . To date, disrupted clustering coefficient has been reported across imaging modalities in AD (Tijms et al., 2013) .\nDamage to the computer model's connectivity also correlated with a node's participation coefficient (Fig. 7D) . Nodes scoring high in participation coefficient bridge segregated communities by distributing their long range connections evenly between modules. Our results provide a physical basis for reports of reduced participation coefficient reported in functional connectivity networks in AD (Brier et al., 2014) . Power et al. (2013) identified regions with high participation coefficient as convergence zones for different functional subsystems. Damage to these nodes produced much greater disruption in resting state organisation than lesions of equivalent magnitude in more circumscribed networks (Gratton et al., 2012) . In another study, Warren et al. (2014) demonstrated that nodes with high participation played a distinct role from nodes of high degree. Crucially, lesions to nodes with high participation coefficient produced impairment across a range of cognitive domains, whereas lesions to high degree nodes displayed more circumscribed cognitive deficits. Such results are consistent with the finding of reduced integration between network modules in our study and the global cognitive decline associated with AD. Furthermore, our results suggest a causal link between damage in high participation nodes, reduced metastability of neural dynamics, and decline in global cognitive performance.\nNodes demonstrating both high eigenvector centrality and high participation coefficient are likely part of the putative rich-club -a densely interconnected core of network hubs (van den Heuvel and Pedersen and Omidvarnia, 2016) . The rich-club phenomenon occurs when hub nodes connect more densely among themselves than nodes of lower degree. Pathways linking these regions constitute an expensive high-performance backbone for global integration. Accordingly, the rich-club accounts for the majority of shortest paths between node pairs (van den Heuvel et al., 2012) . Simulations show that targeted attack of rich-club hubs impair global efficiency three times more than randomly directed attacks (van den Heuvel et al., 2012) . Our results show disrupted rich-club organisation across the AD spectrum with nodes of the rich-club regime demonstrating the greatest number of lesions in their connectivity (Fig. 7E-F) . In line with this view, reduced metastability may be a signature of disrupted rich-club organisation consistent with its role in boosting functional diversity (Senden et al., 2014) .\nThe drive for rich-club architecture is associated with the tendency for hubs to connect regions over large physical distances (van den Heuvel et al., 2012) . In a similar vein, cross modality sensory information is often integrated over long distances by hubs located in heteromodal association cortex. Damage to long distance association and commissural tracts (Fig. S6 ) may therefore provide an anatomical basis for reports of attenuated long range functional connectivity in AD (Liu et al., 2014) .\nImportantly, MMSE test scores correlated positively with empirical resting state global metastability in AD patients (Fig. 10) . The MMSE measures the severity and progression of longitudinal cognitive impairment by testing abilities related to memory, attention, and language. All three domains involve the large-scale integration of information across distributed sensory, motor, and cognitive control regions. For this reason, metastability may represent an important dynamical mechanism underlying general cognitive function.\nOur study found decreases in global metastability (Fig. 6 ) that correspond to an extended network of behaviourally relevant cognitive subsystems (Fig. 9) . This is consistent with the understanding that higher order processes involving memory and attention (such as those putatively captured by the MMSE) are unlikely to reside within discrete topological modules. Instead, traditional modular architecture is likely dissolved in favour of a highly integrated global neuronal workspace (Dehaene et al., 1998) . Measures of network integration including clustering coefficient, global efficiency, and participation coefficient, may therefore be more closely linked to higher order task performance than measures of segregation such as modularity (Bassett et al., 2011) . In line with this view, reduced path length, heightened topological efficiency, and disrupted modular topology has been reported in functional networks during more challenging cognitive operations (Kitzbichler et al., 2011) .\nInstead of assessing topological properties of functional connectivity networks directly, we used computer modelling to examine the link between a connectome's large-scale integrative structure and its ability to generate metastable neural dynamics. This was achieved by informing coupling strength between nodes with anatomically derived subject-level connectivity. In the present approach, changes in metastable dynamic could be directly linked to topological changes taking place in the structural connectome. Since the subject-level connectomes were derived by lesioning the healthy template i.e. the average structural connectivity of the controls, the finding of reduced topological efficiency is perhaps unsurprising. Of note however, is the direct causal relationship between degraded topological structure and reduced metastability in the simulated neural dynamics. Crucially, in the present research, simulated and empirical data are in qualitative agreement (Fig. 6) .\nOverall, AD was defined by reduced connectivity between topologically important and well-connected nodes, fragmented local network structure, increased path length between nodes, and reduced diversity of inter-module links. Accordingly, the structural connectomes belonging to MCI and AD subjects demonstrated a positive association between their simulated metastable dynamic and global measures of topological centrality, integration, and efficiency ( Fig. 8A-D) . Such patterns of largescale structural reorganisation may signal a shift in cost-efficiency trade-off in the direction of lowered metabolic costs at the price of reduced integrative capacity (Bullmore and Sporns, 2012) .\nInterestingly, time resolved fluctuations in resting state functional connectivity are characterised by two different states (Zalesky et al., 2014) , one consistent with a long distance, highly efficient, integrated workspace configuration, and another, more segregated, less metabolically demanding configuration favouring local efficiency. The spontaneous switching of these configurations likely underlies the variation in synchrony registered here as metastability. On this basis, reduced metastability in AD may reflect a change in the transition rate or dwell time of each configuration (Jones et al., 2012) . One hypothesis is that AD patients spend more time in segregated, locally efficient configurations and less time in metabolically demanding states of global integration. Thus, the indiscriminate decrease in brain-wide metastability observed in AD (Fig. 9 ) may signal a reduction in the brain's dynamic repertoire when subjects are at rest.\nDiffuse decreases in metastability were accompanied by more circumscribed decreases in focal synchrony between fronto-parietal and sensory-motor network and between fronto-parietal and default mode network (Fig. 9) . These decreases were consistent with structural damage in a comparable set of regions ( Fig. 12C and fig S8) . The present results accord with recent findings of disrupted fronto-parietal network functional connectivity in AD (Zhao et al., 2018 ) and a growing consensus that frontal-parietal regions constitute a domain general control system for orchestrating more specialised networks (Vincent et al., 2008; Cole et al., 2013; Crossley et al., 2013) . Recently, Dixon et al. (2018) revealed a novel processing stream between fronto-parietal and default mode network involved in regulating introspective behaviour. Of note are the associations between functions ascribed to the DMN and symptoms of AD. These include recollection of autobiographical events in the past (Andreasen et al., 1995; Buckner and Carroll, 2007; Buckner et al., 2008) ; simulation of prospective events and self-projection in the future (Schacter et al., 2007 ; and theory of mind and social cognition (Schilbach et al., 2008; Spreng et al., 2009 ). Fronto-parietal and default mode network interactions have also been identified in autobiographical (Spreng et al., 2010) and working memory (Piccoli et al., 2015) that overlap with the core dysfunction of AD -the ability to author and recall one's own history (Gil et al., 2001) . In fact, DMN dysfunction is considered a hallmark of incipient AD (Greicius et al., 2004) . Tellingly, hypometabolism in default mode network structures has been found to correlate with anosognosia score in MCI patients (Therriault et al., 2018) . The fronto-parietal control system has been proposed to play a central role in regulating mental health (Cole et al., 2014) . Dubbed the \"immune system of the mind\" its flexible hubs may implement adaptive feedback control to regulate symptoms as they arise. Our results indicate a possible role for the fronto-parietal network in default mode network dysfunction in AD.\nMetastability is consistent with other descriptions of the brain as a dynamical system such as self-organised criticality (Hesse and Gross, 2014) . For example, Fig. 5 implies a phase transition from a highly disordered (sub-critical) to a highly ordered (super-critical) state. In finite systems such as the connectome, phase transitions do not occur at a precise point but are smoothed out over a parameter range (Tagliazucchi et al., 2012; Moretti and Mu\u00f1oz, 2013) . Thus, we find a small region between 0.5 and 1.5 rad that is not technically critical, but likely retains properties of criticality. These hallmarks of criticality lend dynamical systems their optimal information processing and storage capabilities (Shew and Plenz, 2013) . Resting state dynamics of human brains demonstrate properties consistent with critical dynamics (Tagliazucchi et al., 2012) . In this regime, the brain is likely poised at an equilibrium point of balanced excitation and inhibition where synchrony is maximally variable and pathological states of low or high synchrony are avoided (Yang et al., 2012) . The consequences of highly variable synchrony on information processing is not well understood. Since the maintenance of a particular communication channel through coherence relies on a persistent phase relationship, the continuous variation in phase associated with metastability is potentially commensurate with a large number of independent communication channels (Deco and Kringelbach, 2016) . Some limitations should be noted. Since there are many ways of defining a network both functionally and structurally, and at multiple scales, the current results may only be valid for the Destrieux atlas parcellation. Since the major sulci and gyri are unlikely to align well with functional activity, future modelling work may benefit from using atlas regions defined multi-modally, that is, based on more than one neurobiological property (Glasser et al., 2016) . In addition, the use of model-based fitting to select the structural skeleton responsible for generating the observed dynamic does not consider likely degeneracies in the structural data, i.e., the method only considers a subset of the possible structural lesions responsible for changes in empirical metastability. Any lesions outside the largest detected component are explicitly ignored.\nIn summary, we used a neurodegenerative disorder, AD, and its prodromal stage MCI, to clarify the relationship between structural network topology and metastable neural dynamics. Overall, our results indicate a causal relationship between structure, dynamics, and cognition and support the contention that structure and cognition can be bridged through metastability (Friston, 1997; Kelso, 1995 Kelso, , 2012 Kelso, 2009, 2014a; 2014b) . In AD, metastability of fMRI BOLD signal was decreased and this correlated with cognitive performance. Using a model based on empirical connectivity we showed a direct link between reductions in metastability and structural damage. These findings offer a distinct perspective on the network-level role of metastability in cognition, its relation to structure, and its inexorable decline in neurodegenerative disease."}]
