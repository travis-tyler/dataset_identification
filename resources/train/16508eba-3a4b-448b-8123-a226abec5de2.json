Am J Phys Med Rehabil 2014;93:876Y883.\nObjective: Age-related declines in physical activity are commonly observed in human and animal populations, but their physiologic bases are not fully understood. The authors hypothesize that a lack of available energy contributes to low levels of activity in older persons.\nDesign: Cross-sectional analyses of relationships between physical activity level and energy availability were performed in 602 community-dwelling volunteers aged 45Y91 yrs from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Energy expenditure was measured at rest and during a maximal 400-m walk for calculation of Bavailable energy.[ Overall and vigorous physical activity levels were assessed using standardized questionnaires. General linear regression models were used to assess the relationships between available energy and general and vigorous physical activity, and stratified analyses were used to analyze the possible differential association between available energy and physical activity across high and low (peak sustained walking oxygen consumption per unit time, G18.3 ml of oxygen per kilogram per minute) levels of aerobic fitness.\nResults: Low available energy was associated with low levels of total physical activity (A = 64.678, P = 0.015) and vigorous activity (A = 9.123, P G 0.0001). The direct relationship between available energy and physical activity was particularly strong in persons categorized as having low aerobic fitness between available energy and physical activity with both total (A = 119.783, P = 0.022) and vigorous activity (A = 10.246, P = 0.015) and was independent of body composition and age.\nThe findings from this study support the hypothesis that available energy promotes the maintenance of physical activity in older persons. The findings also run counter to the perception that age-related declines in physical activity are primarily societally or behaviorally driven."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "Despi te the known benefits of physical activity, in most countries, rates of habitual physical activity are very low and trending dramatically downward. 1Y3 In older persons, low rates of physical activity are particularly deleterious because regular activity in this group helps prevent bone loss 4 and sarcopenia 5 and reduces the risk for falls. 6 Environmental, occupational, social, psychologic, and genetic factors, together with poor self-efficacy, fear of falling, and aging-adverse city planning, have been identified as potential causes of age-related declines in physical activity. 2,7Y9 Although these and other factors certainly contribute to the volition to be physically active, there is evidence that physiologic mechanisms are also at play, as evidenced by studies showing similar trends toward physical inactivity with aging in Blower[ organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans, 10, 11 Drosophila melanogaster, 12 and other animals. 13, 14 Physiologic explanations of age-related declines in physical activity have been assessed in previous research, including age-related declines in maximal aerobic capacity 15 and increased fatigue, 9 although the specific mechanism through which these dimensions may affect daily physical activity is not fully understood. One hypothesis connecting the physiology of energy metabolism to behavioral motor activity is rooted in a paradigm recently introduced in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The overarching hypothesis of this paradigm states that, Bif energy becomes deficient, adaptive behaviors develop aimed at conserving energy.[ Moreover, recent findings from this work support this hypothesis and suggest that older persons decrease gait speed to minimize total energy expenditure and offset declining walking efficiency. 16 A similar hypothesis with respect to a possible physiologic/metabolic explanation of diminishing physical activity would contend that limited energy available for physical activity is the reason that older persons tend to have lower levels of activity. The energy available for physical activity, or Bavailable energy,[ has been operationally defined as the difference between oxygen consumption during peak overground walking and resting oxygen consumption. 17 Assessing the association between available energy and reported activity may shed light on the relationship between energy metabolism and overall activity level and offer new opportunities for physical activity intervention programs aimed at attenuating the age-related decline in physical activity. Accordingly, the primary aim of this study was to examine the relationship between available energy and overall and vigorous physical activity levels, as assessed using an interviewer-administered self-report questionnaire in 602 community-dwelling men and women aged 45Y96 yrs enrolled in the BLSA."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Established in 1958 and conducted by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program, the BLSA is a study of normative human aging.

At the time of enrollment, participants must pass a comprehensive health and functional screening evaluation and be free of major chronic conditions and cognitive and functional impairment. Once enrolled, participants are followed for life and undergo extensive testing every 1Y4 yrs depending on age.\nThe sample for the current study consists of men and women who underwent physical function and gait speed assessments and tests of walking energy expenditure between July 2007 and March 2012 as described previously. 17 Exclusion criteria for the current analysis included required use of a walking aid and the inability to complete 400 m of peak sustained walking.

Standardized encouragement was given with each lap along with the number of laps remaining. Split times for each lap and total time to walk 400 m were recorded. The Cosmed remained on the participant for 2 mins after the completion of the test to ensure adequate breath collection.\nTo calculate peak sustained walking energy expenditure per kilogram of body weight (peak sustained walking oxygen consumption per unit time [milliliters per kilogram per minute]), readings from the first 1.5 mins of the 400-m walk were discarded to allow the participant to adjust to the workload, and the remaining readings were averaged to arrive at a single measure of the mean energy expended (milliliters per kilogram per minute) during 400 m of peak sustained overground walking. This measure of overground energy expenditure is more consistent with the energy required for higher-intensity tasks related to daily living than treadmill-based measures of cardiorespiratory fitness. 27 Weight (SR Scales 725L) and height were measured according to standard protocols, and body mass index was calculated as weight (kilograms) over height squared (square meters).

Adjusted models included as covariates sex and two established, independent contributors to physical activity level: fat mass and fat-free mass. 28Y30 No significant interactions were found between age and sex, age and available energy, and sex and available energy, and therefore, these interactions were not included in the final models presented.\nTo address the potential differential association across fitness levels between energy availability and physical activity, fitness levelYstratified analyses were performed. The cut point delineating Bhigher fit[ from Blow fit[ strata was a peak sustained walking energy value of 18.3 ml/kg per minute, as previously designated in this cohort 31 and other research indicating that this is the minimal level adequate for independent function. 32Y34 All analyses were performed using Stata MP, version 12 (Statacorp, College Station, TX), and P values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. Table 1 . The mean (SD) age was 68.0 (10.8) yrs, approximately half (51.8%) of the participants were men, and the mean body mass index fell within the overweight category (27.3 [4.3] kg/m 2 ). Only 5.1% of the participants were current smokers or had quit within the past 10 yrs. As a descriptive measure of functional capacity, usual gait speedV which was assessed in a separate 6-m test that is part of the BLSA physical performance battery 16 Vranged from 0.5 to 1.9 m/sec and the mean (SD) was 1.2 (0.2) m/sec. These values match the distribution of usual walking speed in the older population already reported in other studies. 8, 9, 28 Total physical activity was progressively lower with age (A = j23.5, P = 0.02), especially after age 65 yrs (A = j41.0, P = 0.02) (Fig. 1A) . In contrast, there was no significant age-related difference in reported vigorous physical activity (A = j2.37, P = 0.13) (Fig. 1B) . The mean (SD) available energy was 15.2 (4.2) ml/kg per minute and was lower with increasing age (A = j0.12, P G 0.001) (Fig. 2) . Higher available energy was associated with higher total (A = 125.7, P G 0.01) ( Fig. 3A ) and vigorous physical activity (A = 14.9, P G 0.001) ( Fig. 3B ). Given these results, a mediation analysis was performed to assess whether reductions in available energy substantially explain the decline in both total and vigorous physical activity. When available energy was entered into a model with age as the predictor and physical activity as the outcome, the significant relationship between age and total physical activity was reduced to nonsignificance (A = j11.4, P = 0.28), whereas available energy was still strongly and significantly related to total physical activity (A = j89.5, P G 0.001). Similarly, a nearly significant relationship between age and vigorous physical activity was attenuated (A = 0.22, P = 0.79) by available energy, with a significant relationship between available energy and vigorous physical activity (A = 12.7, P G 0.001) prevailing.

No significant association between age and either measure of physical activity was found in the adjusted models; however, low available energy was negatively associated with levels of total physical activity (A = 64.678, P = 0.015) and vigorous activity (A = 9.123, P G 0.0001) in older persons, independent of body composition and age (Table 2) .\nFinally, stratified analyses were used to analyze the possible differential association between available energy and physical activity across levels of aerobic fitness. In this sample, 341 (56.6%) individuals were lower than the threshold of 18.3 ml/kg per minute. This low fit group had a greater percentage of women and tended to have a higher body mass index and lower usual gait speed, RMR, available energy, and total and vigorous activity levels (Table 1 ). In the more fit group, lean mass was associated with total physical activity (A = 0.086, P = 0.01); however, available energy was not associated with either measure of physical activity in this higher fit group ( Table 3) . Analyses of the low fit (or debilitated) group (peak sustained walking energy expenditure of G18.3 ml/kg per minute) generally indicated similar trends in terms of the association of lean mass with both total physical activity (A = 0.074, P = 0.026) and vigorous activity (A = 0.004, P = 0.061) and the association of fat mass with both total physical activity (A = j0.009, P = 0.509) and vigorous activity (A = j0.002, P = 0.033).

Although the relationship between physical activity and physical fitness is well established, with activity considered the driving factor, the analysis stratified by fitness level revealed that the relationship between available energy and physical activity was driven by the strong association in debilitated persons, that is, those with fitness levels lower than the threshold of peak sustained walking energy expenditure consistent with independent living.\nThe results of this article are consistent with previous findings from the BLSA indicating that older individuals may use an adaptive strategy of reducing usual gait speed to conserve limited available energy 16 and indicate a similar strategy of energy conservation relating to the volume of activity (in terms of either kilocalories of total energy expenditure or minutes of vigorous activity). Both high-volume and high-intensity activities require substantial energy expenditure, and, especially in individuals with compromised peak aerobic fitness that falls lower than critical levels, energy availability may be a critical determinant of why many individuals avoid physical exertion. 2 Furthermore, physical inactivity is a core component of frailty, the stage of heightened vulnerability and diminished functional capacity observed at the end of life. 35 The authors contend Energy Promotes Activity in Older Adults that this nonvolitional reduction in activity may begin as an insidious physiologic process based on low available energy. Preservation of available energy seems to be a critical factor in maintaining sufficient physical activity levels with age and reaping the documented benefits of an active lifestyle. 3, 36, 37 Because persons with low peak energy availability are most vulnerable/at risk, efforts should be focused first on developing lowlevel activities within the energetic capacity of debilitated/detrained individuals to prevent them from falling lower than the critical threshold. Physical activity may also assist these individuals in rising higher than the threshold, as suggested by previous work indicating the importance of physical activity, including resistance training, in preserving muscle mass and quality and limiting comorbidities. 38, 39 With available energy preserved or increased gradually through small doses of physical activity spread across the day, previously detrained individuals may then be more likely to participate in greater volume and intensity of physical activity. Specific interventions may progress toward more novel types of training such as higher-intensity interval training, with its effects on peak aerobic capacity in addition to broader health benefits. 40 Limitations of the current study include the cross-sectional nature of the data, which does not allow excluding a mechanism of reverse causality (i.e., diminished physical activity may initiate losses in available energy). Additional longitudinal analyses will be possible as more follow-up data become available to address this issue; nevertheless, the crosssectional analysis distinguishes the low fit individuals from others in the sample. In addition, the sample used in the current study is likely more fit than the general population, as supported by a lack of significant decline in vigorous activity across the age span (Fig. 1B) . This feature of the current study may limit the generalizability of these findings to a more fit, active subgroup of the general population. However, even within this healthy cohort, a substantial number of individuals were classified as Blow fit[ by established criteria. Despite their status as Blow fit,[ all individuals in this sample met the inclusion criterion of being able to complete 400 m of peak sustained walking, suggesting that there is sufficient physiologic reserve to enable habilitation even in persons with low levels of fitness.\nThe mechanisms contributing to the worldwide downward trends of physical activity are multifactorial and interrelated. The findings from this study underscore the potential importance of energetics in general and available energy in particular in enabling vigorous, physically active lifestyles. The findings also partially contradict the perception that age-related declines in physical activity are primarily behaviorally and societally driven. In debilitated individuals, there seems to be a critical level of energy required to maintain physical activity higher than levels normally associated with healthy aging and chronic disease prevention. Future research should target individuals who are either in or approaching the classification of having low fitness and are therefore susceptible to loss of functional independence and evaluate physiologically based approaches to increasing physical activity through enhancing energy availability."}]
