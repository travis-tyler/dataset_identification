[{"section_title": "", "text": "results are not a true replacement of human estrogen hormones, which plant (soy)-based products applied as topical creams (which do not go to the liver) mimic better.\nPhyllis Wise: Premarin is not the only preparation used in these studies. Some used ethinyl estradiol and others used yet other preparations.\nGabrielle Strobel: Also surprising in that New York Times story (The New York Times, Science Times Section, 31 January 2006) was that prescription rates have not plummeted as far as one would think following the WHI data. The piece also did not deal with AD but mostly cardiovascular disease. It did quote an opponent of HRT (a cardiology professor) as saying that people who still study it are simply unwilling to let go of a cherished hypothesis, regardless of the data.\nJohn Breitner: I am fairly amazed, because I sense a reversal in the common view that because a trial negates observational data, the latter are faulty. The issue of timing seems to be in everyone's mind. How did that happen?\nPhyllis Wise: As basic scientists, we have followed the WHI work with great interest. We have been focusing our recent studies on deciphering the reasons for discrepancies between it and other studies.\nGabrielle Strobel: Phyllis, can you make some explanations for those discrepancies, based on your work? Phyllis Wise: I think that timing, dose, and formulation are critical differentiators of the response. For example, the average age of the women in the WHI was 61, and they had not received prior hormone therapy (HT). CEE clearly has different effects than 17\u03b2estradiol. Medroxyprogesterone acetate binds to both the progesterone receptor and the androgen receptor.\nMark Smith: Phyllis, how representative of HRT users were the women in the WHI study? My feeling is they were not very representative.\nJohn Breitner: Mark, I do not think we should be distracted by the ability to generalize the study population when it comes to trials. Internal validity is virtually all any trial can promise.\nDominique Toran-Allerand: I think it is far more than that the trials were started too late. All of the WHI studies were flawed because of failure to take into account the biology of estrogens and of the estrogen receptors.\nGabrielle Strobel: Dominique, very interesting; could you expand a bit for us? Dominique Toran-Allerand: Gabrielle, comments have already been made on the differences between ovarian 17\u03b2-estradiol and CEE, but equally important is the fact that in the WHI studies the hormones, CEE and Provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate), were given for years without interruption. Unlike with many compounds which increase the levels of their receptors, prolonged exposure to estrogens decreases the levels of the estrogen receptor so that with time, the cells become much less responsive to estrogens. Moreover, by giving estrogens and progestins concurrently instead of the physiological manner which is sequential, estrogen is unable to up-regulate the progestin receptor to enable it to respond to progesterone, as it does after ovulation (one of its important functions), and progestins are unable to down-regulate the estrogen receptor -one of progestin's important functions -so neither hormone can act physiologically.\nGabrielle Strobel: Dominique, very interesting. So future trials should use estrogen breaks? Dominique Toran-Allerand: Gabrielle, absolutely. That is the way the body is normally exposed to these hormones during the reproductive period.\nSam Gandy: I agree with Dominique's point about the cyclical nature of hormones and the absence thereof in clinical trials.\nCraig Atwood: Dominique, Sam, however, there is no cycling of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy, or during lactational amenorrhea? So is cycling that important?\nDominique Toran-Allerand: Craig, while there may be no cycling of estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy, human gestation is finite (9 months) and does not extend for years as in the WHI trials.\nCraig Atwood: Dominique, but if you take a women who has five children (almost 4 years of pregnancy) and lactation amenorrhea for \u223c3 years each (15 years), that is almost 20 years of no cycling. And this is the normal hunter-gatherer situation, from which we have evolved recently.\nPhyllis Wise: Dominique, we have had several opportunities to talk about this, but just for the record: Downregulation of estrogen receptor (ER) occurs when pharmacological levels of hormone treatment are used. We have shown that with our very low hormone treatments, the receptors remain. To me, this is a very significant point, because if we can use low levels of estrogen and still get protection, it may be important.\nGabrielle Strobel: Phyllis, are birth control pills with the lowest doses used to date in the range you just mentioned?\nPhyllis Wise: Gabrielle, contraceptive pills still use relatively high doses because you have to prevent ovulation or implantation. The whole question is whether in postmenopausal women, where it is not necessary to control fertility, you can use much lower doses and still get the protective actions. We believe you can.\nDominique Toran-Allerand: Phyllis, we have found that continuous proestrus levels of estrogen given to mice (which are really not pharmacological) do elicit down-regulation of the estrogen receptor if given for many months without interruption.\nPhyllis Wise: Dominique, I agree. Proestrus levels should be considered high and could down-regulate receptors. Our paradigm has used replacement levels that are characteristic of the other days of the cycle."}, {"section_title": "Sam Gandy:", "text": "The main point of the Times piece was that all fields are revisiting HRT with the notion that the clinical trials that have turned us off were all begun too late. The issue now is, do we have to redo everything and start perimenopausally? How will that impact bone, heart, vessels? Brain?\nAnd now there is Ellis Levin's endoplasmic reticulum estrogen receptor (ERER) as well [4, 5] .\nGabrielle Strobel: Sam, where does that fit in? What hypothesis does it suggest? I cannot picture it. . .\nThe ERER plays a role in calcium homeostasis, which certainly could dovetail with conventional models of neurodegeneration.\nChris Gregory: Phyllis, are the brain estrogen levels (versus serum levels) more important for protective effects?\nPhyllis Wise: Chris, Dominique's data would suggest that brain estrogen levels are important, and there may be different estradiol isomers in the brain than in plasma.\nRena Li: The brain does make estrogen itself and has brain-specific aromatase [6] .\nDominique Toran-Allerand: Regarding brain versus serum estrogen levels, we have found by mass spectrometry that the level of endogenous 17\u03b2-estradiol levels in the neocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum are very, very low, but the levels of 17\u03b1-estradiol, which does not circulate and which appears to be made in the brain, are astronomical and likely to be very important.\nGabrielle Strobel: Rena, does this brain-specific estrogen production change after menopause? Are the ovaries and the brain production coupled?\nRena Li: Gabrielle, that is not clear.\nThere is a bit of a circular problem in that the basic science funding is suffering because of the state of the clinical trial data.\nRena Li: To all, start ERT studies at younger ages.\nPhyllis Wise: Sam, absolutely. I think that a great deal more basic science research should be steered to looking at the importance of timing, preparation, and dose. Once we figure out the mechanisms of action that are involved in protective pathways, we should be able to design better selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Although it would be ideal to measure risk of AD, that may be prohibitively expensive. If we can use other endpoints that appear earlier and are good indicators, we may be able to design better clinical studies.\nRena Li: I think dosage is relevant because each individual will have a different level of estrogen due to absorption rate variability. Therefore, monitoring estrogen level in the ERT user might be very important.\nRobbie Brinton: All, our mechanistic analyses indicate that convergence of E2 action onto the mitochondria is a critical factor in regulating calcium homeostasis. Our current studies are determining the impact of E2 and progestins on mitochondrial calcium buffering capability prior to, versus following, exposure to disruptions in calcium homeostasis. The data thus far are quite interesting. A question to the community, determining the key biomarkers for prevention remains unanswered in my mind. Ideas?\nRobbie, my answer is PIB.\nEpidemiology is not the gold standard, Mark. Epidemiology can be misleading, too. HRT is based on epidemiology. Sufficiently powered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are required. Nancy Emerson Lombardo: Agreed, but by the time all the clinical trials and prevention trials are funded and completed, the baby boom generation will all be dead or demented. So what do we do in the meantime? We keep plugging along and doing the best we can to prove with gold standard random controlled trials, but in the meantime we have a public health crisis that needs addressing, which the Alzheimer's Association and now the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are making a start with. I think we scientists need to have this on our minds as well.\nChris Gregory: Sam, we agree about the controlled clinical trials and that is what we are working on right now.\nYes, I know about Voyager's trials, but strictly speaking, \"working on\" is simply not \"there.\" I am not disagreeing or criticizing. I am just withholding judgment until the data are in.\nMark Smith: Fair enough. What data does HRT have that leuprolide has to have to make it more promising?\nSam Gandy: Nothing. The clinical trials are a bust, at least perhaps because they were done too late. If a perimenopausal HRT trial is ever done and is negative, I give up.\nMark Smith: Then, as a treatment, HRT is a bust?\nSam Gandy: Absolutely. It is prevention or nothing for HRT at this point.\nChris Gregory: Sam, we are not mechanistically far apart from the discussions raised in today's forum. The well-powered trials will provide the answer, but like everyone else doing AD studies, these trials are long (at least 12 months now and in some cases 18 months). Not an excuse, just the reality that we all have to deal with. Nancy Emerson Lombardo: Sam, but be sure the perimenopausal trials are done with the right humanlike ERT and properly administered, per this discussion. If Premarin were used only, then I still would not necessarily believe the results.\nSam Gandy: Nancy, I agree that the issues of cycling, preparation, progestins, etc., are all issues that must be accounted for and optimized. It makes more sense to me to \"prevent\" the acute hormone withdrawal than to allow the body to re-equilibrate for 20 years and then try to go in and get anywhere.\nMark Smith: But as John said, prevention is very expensive and fraught with its own problems.\nSam Gandy: Mark, that is why these phone instruments are being developed, to cut the cost of prevention trials. Just because it is hard does not mean we should not try. . . Nancy Emerson Lombardo: Sam, I totally agree. By the way, probably the correct administration of a phytoestrogen or phytoHRT would be transdermally; that would also prevent the heart problems according to the HRT specialists I follow. They predicted the WHI MS trial would fail and that Premarin creates heart/stroke problems.\nSam Gandy: Phytoestrogens are another variable in the queue as far as I am aware. We have reached the end of our hour. Thank you all very much for this interesting discussion."}, {"section_title": "Rena Li: How about the dosage of ERT?", "text": "Chris Gregory: There are several issues around ERT that remain interesting to us. In particular, we wonder whether in the ancillary WHI Memory Study (WHIMS), findings relate to the inability of estrogen to down-regulate luteinizing hormone (LH) levels when there has been time (years) between the onset of menopause and the administration of estrogen. In other words, does the prolonged absence of estrogen prior to ERT dysregulate the hypothalamus-pituitarygonadotrophin (HPG) axis, leading to the inability of estrogen to turn off local/systemic LH production?\nMark Smith: Chris, estrogen does not regulate LH after several years postmenopause (or ovariectomy in animal models)."}, {"section_title": "Phyllis Wise:", "text": "Mark, my understanding is that estrogens will continue to feed back negatively even after an animal has been ovariectomized for a prolonged period of time.\nCraig Atwood: Phyllis, that is correct.\nMark Smith: Phyllis, I have read in several papers otherwise. . . we should discuss.\nSam Gandy: I was surprised to learn this week that there is an NIH early estrogen study that has recently begun. I do not recall the acronym. I thought that the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS) was the only thing going. Phyllis Wise: Sam, my understanding is that the trial will use CEE compared to estradiol in patch form supplemented with progesterone, and that endpoints will be measured at annual intervals. But do not quote me on this.\nGabrielle Strobel: Phyllis, in KEEPS, what are the endpoints? Just clinical (dementia diagnosis, cognitive performance, etc.), or is there also blood and CSF work on biomarkers, A\u03b2/tau levels, brain imaging?\nPhyllis Wise: Gabrielle, the major endpoints are cardiovascular, but some cognitive endpoints will be mea-sured. Again, I feel a bit uncomfortable going into too much more detail until I consult with Mitch Harman about the final design that they decided to use. There was a lot of discussion about how much could be done with the funds and the relatively small group of women.\nGabrielle Strobel: Thanks, Phyllis. There is much excitement about biomarkers in AD research these days. It would be wonderful if they could be included, but I see that money is an issue, as always.\nCraig Atwood: Sam, how old are the ELITE participants?\nSam Gandy: Craig, no age is stated. Just \"completed menopause\" as the entry criterion.\nCraig Atwood: Sam, it would be better if they had started a little earlier.\nRena Li: Our preliminary data from animal studies support early treatment rather than late.\nRena, great confirmation of the principle that time of treatment is critical.\nChris Gregory: Rena, reduced estrogen in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains compared to normal brains with similar serum estrogen levels [1] correlated nicely with our gonadotrophin-based mechanistic hypothesis of AD.\nPhyllis Wise: Rena, we too have completed a preliminary study that shows that when mice are ovariectomized and then not treated for a long period, subsequent estradiol does not protect against stroke injury. With some luck, we will submit this in a couple of months. Daniel et al. [2] show that immediate replacement in middle-aged rats improves memory but not after a long period of deprivation [2] .\nRena Li: Phyllis, our data show that late treatment does not improve AD pathology in animal models.\nRena, I think that we should keep in mind that aromatase knockout mice will have higherthan-normal levels of androgens (since they cannot be converted to estradiol) and that androgens themselves may have influence. In stroke models, most investigators have found that androgens exacerbate. Christian Pike has shown that, in vitro, androgens may protect against amyloid-\u03b2 injury [7, 8] .\nRena Li: Phyllis, that is true in our animals. Male animals do not develop the same degree of pathology as female aromatase knockouts.\nChris Gregory: Rena, Dominique, are we not talking about \"autocrine\" estrogen signaling in the brain?\nRena Li: Chris, we really do not know. We are working on it.\nChris Gregory: Rena, have you considered that brain estrogen levels may influence brain gonadotrophin levels (e.g., LH)?\nRena Li: Chris, good point and should be further pursued, but we have not done it yet."}, {"section_title": "Mark Smith: Rena, mechanistically, why do you think that is?", "text": "Rena Li: Because late estrogen treatment does not activate clearance of A\u03b2.\nSam Gandy: Rena, how did your animals parse out with respect to gender? Did males and females show the same thing?\nJohn Breitner: But who can follow immediately postmenopausal women for 30 years to observe incidence of dementia and AD? It seems to me this is one area where there is an urgent need for surrogate indicatorsall caveats notwithstanding.\nPeter Zandi: John, right. I wonder how a 5-year trial, assuming this is the distance, can show anything relevant, early versus late.\nCraig Atwood: John, Mark Sagar has a study here in Wisconsin -the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) -that is doing just that. The study has recruited over 600 individuals, who must have a parent with confirmed AD. I am not sure how many are on hormone replacement. Nancy Emerson Lombardo: John and Mark, brain healthy nutrition and exercise will help you stay alive with no AD a lot longer than NSAIDs.\nCraig Atwood: John, better still, take leuprolide. Steve Austad showed that leuprolide increased longevity in rats by 18 percent with 6 months of treatment.\nSam Gandy: John, is 30 years the real minimum number of years to have enough power to see an effect, based on the average age at onset of menopause and AD?\nJohn Breitner: Sam, as usual, it all comes down to money and resources. The younger the cohort,the more subjects you need to achieve the number of incident cases, which is what drives power.\nGabrielle Strobel: John and Peter, this brings up an interesting question: What sorts of shorter, cheaper trials can address this time factor (mid-life treatment versus late-life diagnosis)? That would be worth brainstorming about, it seems. Everyone, can animal models be employed to address this question?\nJohn Breitner: Gabrielle, animal models are clearly a contender, but the problem is, we do not know how true to life the animal models are. Most of our models focus squarely on the A\u03b2 hypothesis. Robbie Brinton's work suggests there may be a timing interplay between A\u03b2 and estrogen treatment, but I think I am more intrigued with the biomarkers idea. If only we could get biomarkers for AD, such as the CD4 counts and viral load we have for HIV disease! But that would probably require that we know a lot more about root causes. Sam Gandy: Gabrielle, there are some interesting strategies to try to cut the cost of long trials by using phone screening.\nGabrielle Strobel: Please expand, Sam. Is testing people for inclusion/exclusion criteria a major cost factor? Sam Gandy: Basically, versions of the various cognitive instruments are being adapted for use by phone, so that clinic visit expense is eliminated.\nGabrielle Strobel: John, very interesting. I am just putting finishing touches on a meeting report on an academic/biotech/pharma workshop on biomarkers for AD. Tony Wyss-Coray's talk on his proteomic fingerprinting test of a composite of 12 inflammation-related markers was a highlight. Small subject numbers, but it predicted with 97 percent accuracy.\nSam Gandy: John, can some assumptions be made in order to guesstimate a plausible prediction regarding duration and reasonable cohort sizes, etc.?\nJohn Breitner: Yes, Sam, but the results are likely to be disheartening. Especially in the present funding environment, I think animal models or especially surrogate indicators are the way to go. Sam Gandy: John, but the FDA will want humans before giving its blessing, no?\nJohn Breitner: Sam, almost certainly yes.\nChris Gregory: John, as imaging and biomarker analysis and genomics (proteomics and metabolomics) continue to be increasingly applied to AD research, there will hopefully be an enhanced ability to identify patients likely to progress and thus shorten the length of those trials and decrease the number of patients necessary for the trial."}, {"section_title": "Rena Li:", "text": "Monitoring hormone levels is important.
