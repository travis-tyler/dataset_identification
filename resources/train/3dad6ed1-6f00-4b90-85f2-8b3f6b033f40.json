[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "To evaluate a stutter-step model of academic performance in high school, this article adopts a unique measure of students' beliefs that is constructed from two matched sources of information on 12,591 high school sophomores from the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS), [2002][2003][2004][2005][2006]. Verbatim responses to questions on occupational plans, drawn from restrictedaccess student data records, are coded into 1,111 categories in order to capture detailed information (specific job titles), extended information (the listing of multiple jobs), and contradictory information (the listing of multiple jobs with divergent characteristics). The educational requirements of detailed jobs, as specified in the Department of Labor's O*NET database, are then matched to all jobs that students list within their plans.\nWith this new measure, the article then shows that students with uncertain beliefs have (1) lower levels of performance in both the sophomore and senior years of high school, net of adjustments for family background and expectations for future education and (2) lower commitment to schooling, as measured by 32 indicators of achievement-relevant behavior reported by students, parents, and teachers. These results give support to the conjecture that uncertainty about the future has consequences for the short-run behavior that determines important educational outcomes, beyond the effects that are commonly attributed to existing models of performance.\n1\nPerformance in high school is a strong predictor of college attendance and other lifecourse outcomes that structure inequality in the United States.

The extant attainment literature amply demonstrates that performance is strongly predicted by family background, with effects commencing in early childhood and continuing throughout educational careers. A more recent literature shows that performance in high school, in particular, is also structured by adolescents' decisions about whether to commit to the student role and to engage with the content of their coursework, decisions that are partly but not wholly conditioned by family background.\nNo consensus exists in the literature on how these contingent and consequential everyday decisions should be modeled. In this article, we build the case for a \"stutter-step model\" of student performance in high school that has four basic premises: (1) high school performance is determined, to a substantial degree, by everyday decisions to commit to schooling; (2) commitment decisions are oriented to the future; (3) the beliefs that structure these forwardlooking decisions may be inaccurate and uncertain; (4) as a result, the factors that structure beliefs may have autonomous effects on performance by way of everyday commitment decisions, net of family background and other fixed characteristics of individuals.\nOne focus of the stutter-step model is thus on the consequences of uncertainty and inaccuracy of beliefs about the future on high school performance. Important precursors to this model exist, and these include a broad literature on engagement that emerged in the late 1980s (for a review, see Fredericks, Blumenfeld, and Paris 2004) , the \"aligned ambitions\" lifecourse model of schooling proposed by Schneider and Stevenson (1999) , and, more recently, Morgan's (2005) model of prefigurative and preparatory commitment. This emphasis on uncertainty and inaccuracy has become increasingly prominent in some of the most recent literature in the sociology of education (see Bozick, Alexander, Entwisle, Dauber, and Kerr 2010; Grodsky and Riegle-Crumb 2010; Staff, Harris, Sabates, and Briddel 2010; Yates, Harris, Sabates, and Staff 2011) . The stutter-step model falls solidly within this broader research agenda, but moves it forward by focusing on the mechanism through which uncertainty affects performance.\nAs explained in the next section, we will evaluate the tenability of the four-part stutterstep model of student performance. To do so, we employ a unique measure of the uncertainty of high school sophomores' beliefs about of the future. This measure is constructed from a unique coding of the verbatim responses of 12,591 high school sophomores from the restricted-access data records of the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS), [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] . We show that this new measure predicts both everyday commitment decisions and performance by the end of high school. Figure 1 presents the underlying causal model that will motivate our empirical analysis, a model in the new causal graph tradition (Pearl 2009 ; see Morgan and Winship 2007 for an introduction written for social scientists). Observed variables are represented by solid nodes, \u2022, and unobserved variables by hollow nodes, \u25cb. Arrows represent assumed causal effects, and no assumptions of linearity or separability are built into the model. Accordingly, causes can have nonlinear effects on outcomes, and causes can interact with each other in producing effects."}, {"section_title": "A Causal Graph for Performance in High School", "text": "1 In 1 In these models, typically labeled nonparametric structural equation models, the arrows signify inclusion in kernel functions f(.) that generate effects and where no functional form is placed on the kernels. Thus, if A and B have arrows that point to Y, then the structural relation is specified as Y=f Y (A,B,e Y ), where the right-hand side can be parameterized variously by any function in A, B, and e Y , including cross-product terms such as A*B.\nthis article, the black arrows represent causal effects that we assume exist. The gray arrows represent causal effects that many other researchers assume exist and which we accordingly allow even if, as we discuss below, we are not convinced that they exist.\n[ The model asserts that performance in high school is caused by a direct effect of family background and by a general mechanism represented by a chain of three unmeasured variables:\ninformation (I), beliefs (B), and commitment (C) . 3 This mechanism is intended to capture a welldocumented phenomenon in adolescence: many students move in fits and starts through high school, eschewing all-or-nothing grand decisions about their futures and responding only in a 2 We also assess math learning, measured as the difference between 2004 and 2002 math test scores, and timely high school completion. These results are available in the Supplemental Appendix to this article. Reading test scores are not available in the 2004 ELS wave, and as a result we cannot assess reading learning. 3 The direct effect of family background on performance is properly interpreted as a collection of unspecified mechanisms. We take no position on which of the many proposed mechanisms in the literature constitutes a portion of the arrow that defines this direct effect in Figure 1 . Possibilities include (1) differences in resources that affect learning and performance but that are unrecognized by students, (2) biased assessments of teachers that generate an association between ascriptive characteristics such as race and subjective performance evaluations such as grades on written assignments, and (3) structures in schools, such as tracking and course sequences, that harm the achievement growth of students from disadvantaged social origins, without such students recognizing these effects. Notice, however, that we do allow the Wisconsin model to have an explicit place in the causal graph, which includes its master variable of educational expectations (see Sewell, Haller, and Portes 1969; Sewell, Hauser, Springer, and Hauser 2004) . Accordingly, the Wisconsin model mechanism, where significant others define status expectations that students then adopt as their own aspirations, is not embedded within the direct effect arrow that emanates from family background.\nlimited way to the educational plans defined for them by others. Students make consequential everyday choices of whether to commit to schooling, and they do so under information deficits and with goals that are susceptible to social influence (see Bozick et al. 2010; Fredericks et al. 2004; Grodsky and Riegle-Crumb 2010; Morgan 2005; Schneider and Stevenson 1999) .\nThe causal graph in Figure 1 posits that the unmeasured information, I, that informs educational choices is generated by exogenous factors in Z and V. 4 This information, which presumably includes information about the fairness of the education system and about the costs and benefits of higher education, is also determined directly by family background. We assume that this effect of family background on I emerges because those who occupy advantaged social positions are more comfortable searching for information beyond that which is available to them because of joint structural determinants, V, of both family background and the distribution of information.\nBeliefs, B, are then formed on the basis of this differentially available information, although in interaction with family background. Here we assume that students from different family backgrounds may process their acquired information differently. They may also feel that the costs and benefits of education depend on their social origins. This perception may or may not be accurate, and indeed the academic literature offers contradictory findings regarding the direction and magnitude of class-differentiated costs and benefits (see Breen and Goldthorpe 1997 and Brand and Xie 2010) . For our purposes, the critical point is not so much whether beliefs about education are accurate, only that these beliefs vary by both family background and information, I.\n4 Typically in this tradition of causal graphs, nodes such as Z would be suppressed, since it is assumed that all nodes have exogenous sources that give them distributions and that are independent of the other variables in the model. Here, we give Z an explicit place in the model in order to reinforce the point that differences in information are not reducible to differences in family background or correlates of it.\nThe key mechanistic behavioral variable in the causal model is commitment, C, which transmits the effects of beliefs to performance in high school. The model in Figure 1 does not require a particular model of commitment, and there are many on offer. Morgan (2005) provides one possible model in his concepts of prefigurative and preparatory commitment, where the latter follows from the former. Another possible model of commitment emerges from the \"aligned ambitions\" perspective (Schneider and Stevenson (1999) . This model maintains that motivation and effort in high school are determined partly by the alignment of students' educational and occupational ambitions, which Schneider and Stevenson argue are shaped by a diverse set of factors that structure students' beliefs about their futures. A third alternative is the Bourdieuinspired model of habitus utilized by Grodsky and Riegle-Crumb (2010:18) , where \"a collegegoing habitus may increase the likelihood that students engage in behaviors that increase their probability of attaining their goals.\" For Grodsky and Riegle-Crumb, a college-going habitus can be measured by indicators of how beliefs for future educational attainment were constructed, either as taken-for-granted scripts for the future or as conscious choices arrived at during primary or secondary schooling. The critical point here is not which model of commitment the analyst adopts, but that he or she adopts some belief-based model of everyday behavioral orientations to schooling that can account for some subsequent differences in levels of educational performance.\nFinally, the causal graph in Figure 1 includes two additional observed variables that reflect the underlying beliefs in B. As discussed in the next section, Educational Requirements of Expected Jobs will be the key predictor variable in our empirical models, and College\nExpectations will be used to test for the robustness of our conclusion that the underlying model of commitment has empirical support."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Strategy", "text": "How can this stutter-step mechanism be evaluated? Our empirical strategy has a simple goal: to determine whether there is evidence to support the existence of the causal pathways I \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 Performance. The empirical challenge is that I, B, and C are either partly or completely unobserved.\nWe resolve this challenge, we argue, with a unique measure of students' beliefs, which is represented in Figure 1 by Educational Requirements of Expected Jobs. Nominally, this measure is based on a fine-grained coding of students' verbatim occupational plans at age 30, matched to an external source of information on whether the expected job(s) typically require a college degree. This measure, as we detail later, allows us to separate students with specific and certain beliefs about their futures from those with uncertain beliefs and/or internally inconsistent beliefs.\nThe rationale for the tests is based on the causal relations depicted in Figure 1 . To the extent that students (a) formulate beliefs about the costs, benefits, and other characteristics of higher education based on information that is differentially available to them, and (b) make everyday commitment decisions that are consistent with these beliefs, our measured variable select \"I don't plan to work when I'm 30,\" select \"I don't know,\" or skip the question.\nThe data processors contracted by the U.S. Department of Education coded responses to this prompt into an occupational plans variable with seventeen categories. Each of the seventeen categories is broadly consistent with census major occupation groups (e.g., craft, professional), with the additional differentiation of \"professional A\" from \"professional B\" and of separate categories for \"school teacher,\" \"protective service,\" and \"other.\" The data distributors also provided the verbatim responses to question 64 as metadata available to approved users of the restricted-access ELS data.\nAfter examining these verbatim responses, we concluded that (1) many of the students offered more than one occupation in their stated plans, and (2) Table 1 presents our categorization of these responses after they were matched to the educational requirements of students' expected jobs. As shown in the first row, 42.0 percent of respondents listed only jobs that required at least a bachelor's degree or more of education. Many of these respondents listed multiple jobs, but all of these jobs required a college degree or more. In contrast, 11.5 percent of respondents listed jobs that all required only a high school degree or less. 6 In order to merge in the O*NET educational requirement information, we collapsed our 1,103 job codes (i.e., all but the single \"uncodable\" category for a verbatim response and 7 distinct codes for types of missingness) into 339 broader categories across which educational requirement information is made available in the O*NET as job zones. 7 To classify each job listed as a \"College or more\" job or a \"High school or less\" job, we dichotomized the O*NET job zone classification between 3 and 4 on the scale from 1 to 5. As a result, the \"College or more\" jobs are those that have Specific Vocational Preparation (SVP) of 7.0 or higher and are characterized by \"considerable preparation needed\" such that \"most of these occupations require a four-year bachelor's degree\" (see URL:\nTwo categories of respondents expressed variably uncertain plans. First, 3.9 percent of respondents offered two or more jobs, of which at least one required a college degree and at least one required no more than a high school degree. Second, 30.9 percent of respondents selected the response option of \"I don't know.\" 8 These two groups of respondents are the most important for our analysis, and together represent more than one third of the sample.\nLess than one percent of respondents indicated that they did not plan to work at age 30.\nTen percent of respondents did not respond in any way to the question, and less than one percent provided a response that we judged uncodable, either because it was a nonsensical string of characters, which we assume resulted from poor handwriting, or was an obvious wisecrack."}, {"section_title": "Beliefs and High School Performance", "text": "The first three research questions can be answered with the results of the models presented in Tables 2 and 3 . Table 2 presents six models that predict performance in the sophomore year of high school, where performance is measured by scores on standardized tests of reading and mathematics in 2002. Table 3 presents a similar set of results for math performance measured two years later and for cumulative GPA.\n[INSERT TABLES 2 AND 3 ABOUT HERE]\nhttp://www.onetonline.org/help/online/zones). Likewise, the \"High school or less\" jobs had corresponding SVP of less than 7.0, and yet include some jobs that may require post-secondary training less substantial than a bachelor's degree. Like all exercises in dichotomization, noise is inevitable, with some misclassification of jobs near the cutpoint on the job zone scale. Still, focusing narrowly on the job zone breakpoint of requiring skills typically held by those with bachelor's degrees, underpinned by SVP ratings, made the most sense to us based on our theoretical conceptualization.\nQuestion 1. Do the educational requirements of expected jobs, and any inherent uncertainty within them, predict high school performance? Models 1 and 4 presented in Table 2 and Models 7 and 10 presented in Table 3 suggest that the answer to this question is Yes. Model 1 regresses the 2002 math test score for high school sophomores on dummy variables for the categories of our variable Educational Requirements of Expected Jobs, where the \"College or more\" category is the reference group. The coefficient -7.45 for the \"High school or less category\" suggests that those who do not expect to be in a job that requires anything beyond a high school degree have lower levels of math performance in the tenth grade (approximately one half of a standard deviation or 7.44/14.11). Although it is not our primary interest, this contrast in performance conforms to most theoretical predictions.\nOur primary interest lies in the coefficients for the two uncertain categories of \"High school and college\" and \"Don't know,\" since these groups of students hold beliefs that are The answer to Question 1 is therefore Yes in two specific senses. First, the higher the level of education required for an expected job, the higher the student's performance in high school. Second, students who (a) listed two or more expected jobs with inconsistent required levels of education, or (b) were willing to indicate explicitly their uncertainty (by selecting \"I don't know\" in response to the prompt for occupational plans) performed worse than those who listed only expected jobs that required college degrees.\nQuestions 2 and 3. The remaining models in Tables 2 and 3 assess whether the associations in Models 1, 4, 7, and 10 can be accounted for by family background and college expectations. The goal of these additional models is to determine whether the evidence for our affirmative response to Question 1 is at least partly separable from evidence that could be used to support standard alternative interpretations of the overall associations. 12 Models 3, 6, 9, and 12 imply that the uncertainty reflected in occupational plans may decrease everyday performance even for students whose uncertainty has not reached a level that prompts them to select a \"Don't know\" response when asked whether or not they expect to enter college.\nIt should be noted, as in recent pieces such as Goyette (2008) and Reynolds, Steward, MacDonald, and Sischo (2006) , that educational expectations have increased considerably since the 1960s, and perhaps in fantastical ways that reduce their explanatory utility (see also Morgan 1998). Accordingly, it is possible that a new indicator of \"educational aspirations\" is needed in order reveal the true explanatory power of the Wisconsin model for today's youth. Such a measure would need to elicit educational expectations that are not contaminated by the possible existence of a \"college for all\" ethos (see Rosenbaum 2001) . We know of no such measure."}, {"section_title": "Questions 4 and 5. Now that we have demonstrated that the association between", "text": "Educational Requirements of Expected Jobs and Performance is robust, we turn to Questions 4 and 5, which ask whether commitment, C, can be considered the carrier of the effects of beliefs, 11 The 1957 questionnaire for the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) had a nonstandard format for elicitation, and it is unclear how the questions on college plans were combined into the college plans variables that were utilized for the published research. It is therefore unclear how students who chose \"I have no definite plans\" were coded. Nonetheless, it seems that for the two classic Wisconsin model articles, college plans were restricted to levels of education expected (first, for the 1969 article, as a binary variable for any type of college or degree granting institution relative to no further education and second, for the 1970 article, after creating a third middle category for those who planned to attend postsecondary vocational schools). 12 The source variable in the ELS is the composite variable BYSTEXP, for which item-specific missing values on the original question 56 were imputed by the data distributors. Values of \"Don't know\" were not imputed and were all selected by respondents.\nB, to Performance. We address these questions by making use of 32 separate indicators of behavioral commitment to schooling. These indicators are based on items from distinct questionnaires distributed to students, their parents, and their teachers. The standard approach would be to create an index of these variables and then to show how it can explain away some of the association between Educational Requirements of Expected Jobs and Performance (e.g., as in the \"work habit\" scale of Farkas, Grobe, Sheehan and Yuan 1990, the \"effort\" scale of Carbonaro 2005, or the \"behavioral engagement\" scales reviewed by Fredericks et al. 2004 ). We prefer to offer separate models for each indicator, for two reasons. First, although our measures of commitment are extensive, we still do not believe that they capture all dimensions of everyday commitment. We would not want to imply anything to the contrary, which is a risk when indexing. Second, as we will show, we find consistent patterns of results across the available measures of commitment, and we think it is more compelling to show this consistency than to bury it within a single index.\nIn Tables 4 through 6 , we report the coefficients for the crucial groups with uncertain beliefs -\"High School and College\" and \"Don't know\" -for 64 models. These models are structured analogously to Models 1 and 2 in "}, {"section_title": "Supplementary Results", "text": "[The associated tables for this section are available for the reviewers and Editor at the end of this submission. We propose that these tables be placed in an online Supplementary Appendix on the authors' websites and, if possible, on the journal website.] Tables S1-S3 present results analogous to those reported in Tables 4-6 , for commitment, after further adjustments for students' educational expectations, using the same indicator variables included earlier in Models 3, 6, 9, and 12 in Tables 2 and 3 These additional models show that adjustments for expectations reduce the sizes of the coefficients in Tables 4-6 by about 25 percent for \"High school and college\" and by about 60 percent for \"Don't know.\" Despite the decreases in the magnitudes of the coefficients, 27 of the 32 coefficients (for both groups) remain in the direction predicted by the stutter-step model. With the declines in coefficient size, levels of statistical significance (tested against null hypotheses of zero) decline as well, especially for the smaller \"High school and college\" group. Yet, the overall pattern is the same as for Tables 2   and 3 : educational expectations can account for only a portion of these conditional associations. The results presented in Tables S5 and S6 then develop the clear linkage between our models of performance (Tables 2 and 3 ) and our models of commitment (Tables 4-6 and S1-S4).\nThese supplementary tables report regression models (of our four measures of performance) that include supplemental predictors for commitment. In particular, we add the 32 separate commitment variables analyzed in Tables 4-6 as independent variables to Models 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 12 from Tables 2 and 3. The results in Tables S5 and S6 Tables 2-3 and S5-S6, such that respondents in the \"Don't know\" and \"High school and college\" groups have lower average gains in achievement over the two years. The models in Table S8 show that the same is true for timely high school graduation, with the odds of finishing high school on time in 2004 being substantially lower for respondents in the \"Don't know\" and \"High school and college\" groups."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION", "text": "In this article, we have developed two primary empirical findings for high school students own beliefs about their futures, and that these features of beliefs are structured by the quality and quantity of information available to students.\nNot only have we found baseline support for this model by demonstrating that uncertainty of beliefs about the future predicts lower everyday commitment to schooling, we have also shown that these associations cannot be attributed to students' own forecasts of their future education. Accordingly, the associations that we report cannot be explained away by the socialization theory developed for status attainment research or any of the literature that follows from it."}, {"section_title": "Complementary Perspectives", "text": "In response to calls for greater school effectiveness in the 1980s, scholars contributing to the \"student engagement\" literature attempted to identify the determinants of active and inquisitive learning (see Fredericks et al. 2004 for a review). This literature supports some of our results, insofar as it demonstrates how engaged commitment to schooling can have positive effects on student performance. Like our model, it recognized that commitment and engagement are determined in part by \"socio-cultural determinants\" outside of the school (Newmann, Wehlage, Lamborn 1992:17) . This literature did not, however, offer much insight into the genesis of these underlying \"socio-cultural determinants\" of student engagement. Indeed, because of its policy impetus, the engagement literature focused on how schools can foster modes of learning that transcend adherence to traditional school routines dominated by a pedagogy of recitation and response. It tended to overlook how schools can accentuate baseline engagement differences that originate outside of schools.\nTwo articles, in particular, demonstrate the importance of such processes. Farkas et al. (1990) showed that teachers reward work habits when assigning grades, beyond how the same work habits shape performance and coursework mastery. As a result, determinants of work habits that arise from sources outside of schooling -such as uncertainty about the future that is generated by incomplete or inaccurate information about higher education -are then amplified by performance assessments constructed by teachers. Gamoran and Nystrand (1992) showed that the effectiveness of teaching differs substantially across curriculum tracks in schools, such that teachers in honors classes frequently engage in \"authentic questioning\" that deepens student engagement with the content of coursework. In contrast, teachers in remedial classes reserve their interactional authenticity for broader discussions of student life, and they utilize a less effective mode of recitation when teaching coursework content. Because track placement in school is determined by past demonstrated levels of engagement and performance, any baseline engagement differences attributable to forces outside of the school will be amplified by withinschool differences in pedagogy.\nThese results suggest that a policy-based research focus on how teachers and schools can cultivate engagement must rest on a solid foundation of research into how baseline engagement is shaped by social origins and students' locations in the broader structure of social inequality.\nThe more recent literature has taken up this challenge head on. In addition to the stutter-step model, we noted earlier that there are additional complementary perspectives that have been influential. Schneider and Stevenson (1999) focus their attention on the extent to which adolescents maintain \"aligned ambitions,\" which they define as the concurrence of concrete educational plans and the educational requirements of desired jobs. They write, based on extensive in-depth interviews with adolescents, that A characteristic of those who have aligned ambitions is that they are more likely to sustain high levels of motivation throughout their high school careers. One reason is because adolescents with aligned ambitions are more capable of identifying their own strengths and weaknesses and of creating their own internal standards of performance. (Schneider and Stevenson 1999:107) For Schneider and Stevenson, parents play crucial roles in helping students to align their ambitions, in part by shaping their beliefs about the future in ways that then compel appropriate everyday courses of behavior. In contrast to our analysis and the stutter-step model that motivates it, Schneider and Stevenson do not focus on the uncertainty that is reflected in the occupational plans of students. However, it is reasonable to assume that many of the students whom Schneider and Stevenson identified as having misaligned ambitions would fall within the one-third of our sample that either expressed considerable uncertainty about their occupational plans or that identified planned occupations with internally heterogeneous educational requirements.\nIn another complementary perspective, Bozick et al. (2010) Sometimes these youth do well in school; sometimes they stumble. Over time the signals they receive neither consistently support nor temper an expectation to attend college, and when they report late in high school that they expect to attend college, the extent of their commitment and their ability to follow through are less certain. (Bozick et al. 2010 (Bozick et al. :2047 Bozick and colleagues did not consider the uncertainty that is reflected in occupational plans, nor did they assess the extent to which middle-and lower-SES students throughout the country might exhibit similar patterns. Our results suggest that this \"mixed signals\" group of students may be more prevalent throughout high schools in the United States than could be determined with the Baltimore sample of the BSS.\nThe analyses in this article extend and elaborate on this convergent stream of literature and, in the process, deepen both the status attainment perspective that was proposed in the 1960s and the student engagement perspective that entered into the literature in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Overall, our empirical results provide support for the stutter-step model of performance, as well as for alternative models that have similar behavioral predictions. They are, however, inconsistent with models that do not give a prominent role to uncertainty of beliefs in the causal processes that are presumed to generate performance in secondary schooling and in subsequent educational attainment (insert identifying citation to the companion paper here). .37 (.14)\n."}, {"section_title": "(.06)", "text": "."}, {"section_title": "(.15)", "text": ".37 (.07)\nHas this student fallen behind in school work?
