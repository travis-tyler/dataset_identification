Recent reports indicate that a warming environment often drives advances in breeding phenology of diverse organisms (Parmesan and Yohe 2003; Root et al. 2003) , and in some cases, the consequences of differential phenological shifts between consumers and their prey can produce mismatches between peaks in resource availability and demand, and so importantly reduce reproductive success (Both et al. 2006; Saino et al. 2011) . These mismatches may be most important in ecosystems where productivity is temporally predictable; in other cases these phenological shifts may be reflective of adaptive plasticity (Martin 2007; Charmantier et al. 2008; Dunn et al. 2011) . Climate change may also impact reproductive output by directly affecting ecosystem productivity and food availability, and the intensity of predation pressure (McShea 2000; Martin 2007 ), or may even produce decreases in reproductive effort (Bolger et al. 2005 ) and success (Rodriguez and Bustamante 2003) . This diversity of ecosystem responses to warming and our limited understanding of the subsequent biological effects on organisms suggest that this will remain an important area of study.\nA vast majority of research exploring changes in reproductive phenology and its potential causes has been conducted in wet, temperate ecosystems in the northern latitudes (Gordo 2007; Parmesan 2007) , and our understanding of how warming affects breeding phenology and reproductive success of birds in hot arid systems is poorly known (but see Brown et al. 1999; Li and Brown 1999; Bolger et al. 2005 ). Yet, global warming and its demographic consequences may be particularly severe in desert regions. For example, the southwestern US is a region that has recently been subject to rising air temperatures and increasingly severe droughts. As a result of increased greenhouse gases, temperatures in the southwestern US are predicted to increase by 2-4 \u00b0C by 2100 (Romero-Lankao et al. 2014) . Precipitation regimes are expected to be more variable, and winters are expected to be warmer with less precipitation. Overall, warmer and drier conditions will produce reductions in soil moisture and thus primary productivity, and prolonged droughts are expected in New Mexico (State of New Mexico 2005; Romero-Lankao et al. 2014) .\nDeserts define much of this landscape and resources such as water and energy are often in short supply. Because the productivity of deserts are defined by water (Noy-Meir 1973) , the combined effects of increasing air temperatures and decreasing precipitation may well have disastrous effects on secondary productivity. For breeding birds, food abundance affects both reproduction and survival (Martin 1987) with reduced primary productivity and harsher physical conditions affecting adult condition and survival (McKechnie and Wolf 2010) as well as reproductive effort and success (Bolger et al. 2005) . Given the challenges that are already inherent to desert ecosystems, understanding the effects of increasing physical and ecological stressors on animal reproductive activity is likely to provide important insights into the limits of performance and the resilience of desert birds under projected climate warming.\nThe loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus) is an aggressive, medium-sized predatory bird that occupies open habitats ranging from southern Canada to central Mexico. Despite its extensive distribution, shrike populations have declined dramatically over the last 40 years; North American Breeding Bird Survey estimates indicate that, continentally, populations have decreased by as much as 79 % (Sauer et al. 2014) . The potential contribution of climate change to this serious population decline has not been examined, and populations in the arid southwest are particularly understudied.\nWe studied loggerhead shrike breeding density and reproductive success in the desert southwest. Our study was conducted during a period of rapid warming at a site where land use and habitat availability were relatively static, but temperature and precipitation were highly variable and included severe drought and the hottest year in the instrumental record (Table 1) . We asked the following questions:\n1. Has the timing of reproduction shifted with recent warming? 2. Has the number of breeding pairs changed with increased air temperature and drought? 3. Has shrike reproductive productivity (clutch size, number of young fledged) been affected by increased air temperature and drought? 4. Has nest survival been affected by environmental and nest site variables, such as precipitation, air temperature, and nest height and concealment, and what temporal trends are evident (i.e., are nest survival rates similar both within and across years)?\nBecause primary productivity and arthropod abundance and biomass in arid ecosystems are closely tied to precipitation (Tanaka and Tanaka 1982; Bolger et al. 2005; Muldavin et al. 2008) , we hypothesized that precipitation should be important in driving available prey resources that, in turn, should influence the total number of nest attempts, overall productivity, and nest survival. Temperature cues are important in determining the timing of breeding activities for many species (Dunn 2004; Visser et al. 2009 ), thus we hypothesized that increasing air temperatures would lead to advancement of breeding activities. We expected the relationship between temperature and the breeding biology of shrikes to be more complicated. Temperature interacts with precipitation in driving overall available soil moisture and therefore plays an important role in driving primary and secondary productivity. High temperatures can also cause direct physiological stress to breeding adults and growing nestlings (Cunningham et al. 2013 ). However, warmer temperatures during the cool period at the onset of the shrike breeding cycle can positively impact the availability of ectothermic prey, can lead to accelerated nestling growth (Dawson et al. 2005) , and can reduce female incubation costs (Vleck 1981) . All considered, we expected that higher air temperatures would have a net negative impact on the number of breeding attempts, productivity and nest survival. Other non-climatic variables can also impact nest survival. We examined variation in nest predation rates and site characteristics, as they also may importantly influence nest survival (Porter et al. 1975; Martin and Roper 1988; Yosef 1996) . Nest predation rates may be higher during times of reduced precipitation (McShea 2000; Martin 2007) and during high temperatures (Cox et al. 2013 ). Increased nest concealment should decrease detection by nest predators that hunt by sight; however, concealment is not expected to impact predators hunting via olfaction. Nest height may deter mammalian predators but should have a limited effect on aerial predators or those that are efficient climbers. To test the effects of temperature and precipitation on various shrike productivity metrics, we evaluated the correlates between avian productivity and weather and climate variables over biologically relevant time periods. The timing of precipitation in this region is bimodal with pulses of precipitation occurring during the winter and during late summer thunderstorms (July-September). Thus we assessed over the following time periods: (1) annual precipitation, (2) winter precipitation in the months immediately prior to breeding (December-March), and (3) active breeding season daily precipitation. Active breeding season daily precipitation was the sum of daily precipitation recorded during the period that a single nest was active, beginning with the first egg and continuing through either fledging or nest failure. We also evaluated correlations between avian productivity and temperature variables including: (1) mean annual air temperatures, (2) mean air temperatures during the period encompassing the breeding season (MarchJuly), and (3) daily mean maximum air temperatures during the period just prior to nest initiation (March-April)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Nest observations", "text": "From 2007 to 2012, we located breeding adult loggerhead shrikes during road-based surveys and in historic nest territories. After identifying breeding territories, we determined nest locations by observing parental behaviors or by systematically searching areas where breeding activities were observed. Each year surveys began at the beginning of March and continued until breeding ceased (generally early to mid-July). Surveyor effort and areas surveyed were consistent throughout the study period. Two to three observers conducted surveys 5 days per week. The same two individuals conducted surveys over the 6-year period, and one additional observer was present from 2009 to 2011. After the discovery of an active nest, contents were checked every 3-4 days. From nest observations, we were able to determine nest initiation dates, clutch size, proportion of eggs that hatched, number of young fledged per successful nest, total number of pairs, total nesting attempts and nest success. Nests were considered successful if \u22651 young fledged. A number of individuals from this population were also fitted with a unique set of color bands, allowing for the identification of individual birds. We identified first or second broods from observations of these marked individuals, but also determined the brood attempt number through observation of territory boundaries and the timing of nest attempts."}, {"section_title": "Nest site characteristics", "text": "We recorded nest substrate species, nest height and concealment following cessation of breeding activity. Nest concealment was established by estimating the percentage of a 10-cm-diameter circle in the position of the nest that would be concealed by the nesting substrate (Martin et al. 1997) . Four measurements were taken, one from each cardinal direction, from 1 m high and 1 m from the nest and were averaged for total estimated nest concealment. The same two observers recorded all measurements throughout the study."}, {"section_title": "Nest initiation", "text": "Nest initiation dates were determined from nest content observations, such as date of first egg, whenever possible. More frequently, however, initiation dates were estimated from known nestling ages and fledge dates. Initiation dates were considered as the date the first egg was laid.\nWe tested for differences in nest initiation dates between years with a one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey honest significant difference test for multiple comparisons (Zar 2010) . We also used a one-way ANOVA to test whether nest initiation dates of first broods varied according to spring mean maximum daily temperatures (daily mean maximum temperatures as recorded from 1 March to 30 April). The majority of first broods are initiated throughout March and April, and we used mean maximum temperatures as an indicator of the most extreme conditions that these birds were exposed to during the nest initiation period. Mean maximum temperatures for March and April ranged from 18.06 \u00b0C in 2007 to 21.11 \u00b0C in 2012; the long-term average was 19.12 \u00b0C (Table 1) . We separated temperatures evenly into four categories between 18 and 22 \u00b0C. We tested for differences in initiation dates of first broods according to the following temperature groups: low (18.01-19.0 \u00b0C), medium-low (19.01-20.0 \u00b0C), medium-high (20.01-21.0 \u00b0C), and high (21.01-22.0 \u00b0C). Temperatures during the study period never fell into the medium-high category; therefore only three categories were tested. For both of these tests, nest initiation dates were log transformed prior to analysis in order to meet assumptions inherent to ANOVA (Zar 2010) .\nChanges in spring phenology are one of the most commonly observed responses to increasing global temperatures (Walther et al. 2002; Parmesan and Yohe 2003; Root et al. 2003) . Advancement of breeding phenology is often correlated with temperatures in the months that immediately precede breeding Walther et al. 2002; Pearce-Higgins et al. 2005 ), but not all species respond in the same way or to the same degree; the ability of individual species to adapt to rapidly changing conditions varies and is often defined by life history traits such as migration strategy (Both and Visser 2001 ). During our 6-year study period, nest initiation dates advanced, on average, by 20 days, and the earliest nests advanced by 28 days (Fig. 1) ; this advancement was significantly related to increases in mean maximum air temperatures during March and April. Whether the advancement observed in our study represents a true advancement compared to historical nest initiation dates is unknown for this population. However, our findings are similar to the observations from many other studies Walther et al. 2002; Dunn 2004 ), but they differ markedly from a recent study of birds in the deserts of Arizona and California where decreased precipitation apparently produced a delay in reproductive activity in 13 species (McCreedy and van Riper 2015) . These authors suggested that precipitation inputs may be a primary driver of nest initiation at arid sites, and that precipitation may offset or mask the effects of increasing temperature (McCreedy and van Riper 2015) . However, here we note the more typical relationship of advancing nest initiation dates with increasing temperature. Although we did not specifically examine the relationship between nest initiation dates and precipitation, the earliest nests on our site tended to occur in the driest years (Table 1 ; Fig. 1 ). These differing observations may suggest a more complex relationship between environmental conditions and changes in breeding phenology than are suggested by either this study or McCreedy and van Riper (2015) . Alternatively, even apparently slight differences between site locations and life histories (e.g., differences in latitude and elevation, prey base makeup, potential predators, and migration strategies) can have very different effects on breeding phenology. Shrikes were exposed to variable but generally increasing temperatures over the course of this study (Table 1) . Spring mean maximum temperatures increased 1.8 \u00b0C and ranged over 3 \u00b0C, and mean breeding season temperatures increased 1.6 \u00b0C and ranged over 2 \u00b0C during the study period. The hottest 2 years were 2011 and 2012 (Table 1) , which had the second and third hottest MarchApril periods since 1983, respectively; 2012 was the hottest year on record. Both the range of temperatures experienced by shrikes during this study period and the degree of advancement in nest initiation dates were notably large. Parmesan (2007) in her meta-analysis showed an average advancement of 3.7 days per decade (0.37 days year \u22121 ) for 41 bird species in the northern hemisphere. The most dramatic advancement was 24 days per decade [2.4 days year \u22121 (Root et al. 2003) ]. During our study, we observed an advancement of 20 days over 6 years (3.3 days year \u22121 ), which is greater than that of any reported species. However, it is important to note that the advancement we recorded occurred only over a 6-year period, and in the other studies mentioned covered much greater time periods; therefore our results may not be directly comparable. How breeding phenology will continue to respond to local climatic conditions remains to be seen, but our results suggest that a continued increase in temperature may result in further breeding advancement. Our results do, however, illustrate the immediate and dramatic effects that air temperature can have on phenology, even in isolated years.\nThe ability of shrikes to advance their spring activities so dramatically can be attributed to a number of factors. While there is evidence of a strong genetic component that underlies variability in some species (Schaper et al. 2012) , both physiological constraints and phenotypic plasticity define the overall capacity for variation. In our study, the rapid advances in nest initiation dates with increased air temperatures suggest that phenotypic plasticity probably accounts for the observed shifts. This flexibility may, in part, arise from the shrike's broad breeding distribution (~30\u00b0 in latitude), where breeding activities are initiated between January and May (Yosef 1996; Collister and Wilson 2007) . Non-migratory shrike populations in California and Florida have shown a large degree of annual variability in nest initiation dates (Yosef 2001; Hudgens et al. 2009 ), as resident individuals maintain pair bonds during nonbreeding months, keeping reproductive cycles synchronized and enabling them to breed when conditions become suitable (Yosef 1996) . In this study, some individuals are sedentary residents, while others either migrate or disperse away from the site. Earliest nests are most likely nests of these sedentary individuals. Our results show the natural variability in nest initiation dates within this population, though this study occurred during a period of some weather extremes. The changes in breeding phenology observed during this study were not just driven by extreme shifts by a few individuals, but result from wholesale changes in the phenology of a breeding population in response to dramatic changes in the climatic conditions."}, {"section_title": "Breeding parameters", "text": "We determined clutch size and number fledged per successful nest, and tested if annual mean clutch size and number of young fledged per successful nest differed between years using a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA. We used Mann-Whitney two-sample procedures for pairwise comparisons (Zar 2010) . Wilcoxon two-sample procedures were used to test for differences in clutch size and number of young fledged between broods, as well as differences in the number of days and distance between first and second broods based on the fate of the initial brood.\nStepwise multiple linear regression with forward selection criteria was used to evaluate the relationship between environmental and productivity metrics. Environmental predictor variables were added to a null model, with significant variables retained in order of greatest significance. Final models for each productivity metric were selected based on R 2 and minimum Akaike information criterion (AIC) values (R Core Team 2013). Because there is autocorrelation each year between the number of pairs, number of nesting attempts, and estimated eggs laid, we analyzed the number of breeding pairs since this is the primary driver of number of attempts and eggs laid. Additional productivity metrics that we considered were total young produced, clutch size, and number of young fledged per successful nest. Each breeding parameter was evaluated against the following environmental metrics: breeding season temperature, previous winter precipitation, and annual precipitation.\nClutch size ranged from three to seven eggs; mean clutch size for all years was 5.35 \u00b1 0.15 eggs (Table 2) The total number of pairs was positively related to mean breeding season temperature and total winter precipitation (R 2 = 0.91, F 2,3 = 26.67, P = 0.01) by the following equation: \u221279.84 + 5.59 (BSTEMP) + 0.08 (Winter Precip). Annual precipitation, winter precipitation and breeding season temperature were not significant predictors of total young produced, clutch size or number of young fledged per successful nest (Appendix 1)."}, {"section_title": "Nest survival", "text": "We estimated nest survival using the program MARK (White and Burnham 1999) , but also included the widely used Mayfield estimates (Mayfield 1961 (Mayfield , 1975 for direct comparison to other studies evaluating loggerhead shrike nest success. We used program MARK to evaluate covariates that we considered potentially important drivers of nest survival (Rotella et al. 2000; Jehle et al. 2004 ). We considered a number of a priori models that we hypothesized would be important in determining nest survival. Models were constructed in the following manner:\n1. We began by fitting four models to evaluate variation in nest survival both within and between years. We fit a constant survival model and two time trend models (linear and quadratic) to evaluate within-year effects.\nWe used a year-effects model to examine for time trends in nest survival through years. 2. To further evaluate between-year variability, we added individual environmental covariates to the top-ranking model from above. These variables were constant for the whole group, and included the previous winter's precipitation (Winter Precip.; December-March) and mean breeding season temperature (BSTEMP; MarchJuly). 3. Finally, to the top-ranking model from step 2, we added individual covariates that were unique to individual nests. Covariates included active period precipitation, calculated for the period during which a nest was active, and two physical nest site characteristics: nest concealment and nest height.\nModel selection was based on AIC corrected for small sample size (AIC c ) (Akaike 1973; Anderson et al. 1998) and AIC c weights (w i ) to evaluate model strength (Anderson et al. 1998) .\nWith the exception of nest survival, all statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.0.2 (R Core Team 2013). All individual covariates were checked for collinearity, and significantly correlated variables were not used within the same test. All tests were evaluated at an \u03b1-level of 0.05, and values are reported as mean \u00b1 95 % confidence interval (CI).\nAnnual nest survival estimates from Program MARK ranged from 12 % (95 % CI 4-25 %) in 2009 to 44 % (95 % CI 23-63 %) in 2007 (Table 3) . Mean survival was 30 % for all years combined. Over all years, 39 % of nests fledged at least one young, and nests were lost most frequently to predation (43 %), abandonment (10 %), weather (primarily wind storms, 2 %), and failure of eggs to hatch (1 %). We were unable to determine the cause of nest failure in 4 % of cases due to insufficient evidence or inaccessibility of the nest site.\nWe considered a total of nine models in program MARK, and the model with the greatest support showed that nest survival for loggerhead shrikes was negatively associated with time during the nesting season (Fig. 2) , and positively related to winter (Fig. 3a) and active period precipitation (Fig. 3b) .

Mean success for loggerhead shrikes in studies prior to 1996 is 56 % (Yosef 1996) , and success greater than 70 % has been reported in many studies (Anderson and Duzan 1978; Brooks and Temple 1990; Chabot et al. 2001; Boal et al. 2003) . Low success has been reported in a few studies, and is attributed to linear habitats in these cases (Yosef 1994; Walk et al. 2006) . Mean nest success in this study was 30 %, and ranged from 12 to 44 %; these values are markedly lower than any nest success rate previously reported in the literature. This low success can have strong population consequences, as population growth is limited in part by breeding success (Ezard et al. 2006) . The direct causes of low nest success in this population are the focus of the following. In this study, extreme weather events only accounted for a few cases of direct nest loss, ranging between 0 and 4 % annually, and were never a primary factor in driving nest success. Food limitation can also have a variety of demographic effects on breeding birds (Martin 1987 ) because a number of reproductive traits are typically sensitive to food supply (e.g., clutch size, numbers of broods, number of offspring fledged); in our study, however, shrikes did not appear to suffer from food limitation. Starvation and brood reduction were uncommon and while the warmer air temperatures and greater drought might certainly have impacted arthropod and vertebrate prey abundance, they did not appear to impact reproductive output such as clutch size and the number of nestlings fledged as these measures did not vary greatly between years.\nIn our study, predation caused the majority of nest failure and accounted for between 23 and 73 % of annual nest loss (Table 3 ). In 2009, predation was responsible for 73 % of nest failures when nest success was only 12 %; in 2007, the year with the highest nest success (44 %), predation accounted for 23 % of nest failures. Although it is often difficult to identify the exact species responsible for each predation event, gopher snakes (Pituophis catenifer), coachwhips (Masticophis flagellum) and coyotes (Canis latrans) were commonly observed in the study area and were the most likely nest predators. Predator activity and predation rates can be affected by weather. Morrison and Bolger (2002) suggested that low temperatures and periodic heavy rain limited predator activity and drove differences in annual nest predation rates observed in their study. In this study, however, periods of heavy rainfall were brief and erratic, and it is unlikely that rainfall events drove predation rates. Environmental temperatures, however, do importantly affect ectotherm (lizard, snake and insect) activity, and snake predation rates are known to increase with activity (Weatherhead et al. 2010 ) and temperature (Cox et al. 2013) . Nest survival was higher earlier in the breeding season, as has been found in other studies (Nur et al. 2004; Collister and Wilson 2007; Skagen and Yackel Adams 2012; McCreedy and van Riper 2015) , (Fig. 2) , and this could be, in part, due to reduced snake activity during the cooler temperatures common at the onset of breeding (Peterson et al. 1993; Cox et al. 2013) . Additionally, predators can increase their efficiency as they develop a search image over the course of a breeding season (citations in (Martin 1988) . However, these within-year changes do not explain annual variability in nest survival.\nPredator behavior may also be impacted by climatic conditions that can be highly variable annually. Snakes such as coachwhips and gopher snakes are common nest predators (DeGregorio et al. 2014 ), but do not specialize on bird eggs or nestlings (Diller and Johnson 1988; Whiting et al. 1992; Rodriguez-Robles 2002; Beane 2013) . But in dry years, predators may focus more on bird nests when their preferred prey sources are less abundant (McShea 2000) . The food habits of predators such as coyotes also change in years where their preferred prey (black-tailed jack rabbit, Lepus californicus) is less abundant (MacCracken and Hansen 1987) , and other studies have found higher nest predation rates in dry years (McShea 2000; Martin 2007) . Also, incidental predation that occurs in conjunction with increased search time can be an important factor in driving overall nest predation rates (Vickery et al. 1992) . Finally, during periods of greater food availability, birds may experience decreased nest predation due to changes in adult and juvenile behavior at nests (Rastogi et al. 2006) . Because nests are lost to a variety of predators, individual nest site characteristics such as nest height or concealment do not have widespread influence on nest survival. The predators of shrike nests are taxonomically and behaviorally diverse, and the relationship between environmental conditions and predators is complex. Abundance of alternative prey sources should also impact nest predation rates, and this measure may be more directly related to precipitation and temperature.\nOur results show that both winter and active period precipitation were important in driving nest success (Table 4 ; Fig. 3a, b ) and other studies have also shown a positive effect of precipitation on nest success (George et al. 1992; Li and Brown 1999; Collister and Wilson 2007; Monadjem and Bamford 2009; Skagen and Yackel Adams 2012) . Primary productivity in arid environments is closely correlated with precipitation (Noy-Meir 1973) , and spring primary productivity shows a strong positive relationship with winter precipitation in New Mexico (Muldavin et al. 2008) . However, the lack of variation in our annual measurements of food-sensitive traits such as clutch size and number of young fledged suggests food resources may not directly impact shrike nest success under the conditions observed. Hudgens et al. (2009) similarly found that food supplementation of shrikes in California did not affect nest success, although it affected other measures of productivity.\nOther studies have shown a positive effect of temperature on nest success (Collister and Wilson 2007; Skagen and Yackel Adams 2012) , but our results did not reveal a significant relationship with breeding season temperature. However, we found that loggerhead shrikes in this study experienced a higher probability of nest failure toward the end of their breeding season, similar to other studies (Nur et al. 2004; Collister and Wilson 2007; Skagen and Yackel Adams 2012; McCreedy and van Riper 2015) . As discussed above, the decrease in daily nest survival later in the breeding season could be indirectly related to temperature through predator behavior, but could also be directly associated with physiological limits related to high temperatures at the end of the season. When temperatures exceed a certain threshold, fitness costs may be incurred (Cunningham et al. 2013) . These costs are observed in growing young through reduced mass, size, or delayed fledging (Cunningham et al. 2013) , or in increased water loss associated with thermoregulation in the heat (Wolf and Walsberg 1996) . A threshold temperature has not been identified for loggerhead shrikes, but for a related species (common fiscal, Lanius collaris), temperatures above 33 \u00b0C resulted in fitness costs (Cunningham et al. 2013) . Temperatures exceeded 33 \u00b0C each year during the end of the breeding season (mid-May up to and including July), and the greater likelihood of failure for late nests could be related to high temperature during this time. Lower nest survival at the end of the breeding season may have been related to the effects of high temperatures on shrike fitness or survival, or seasonal changes in predator activity or abundance. The high temperatures experienced at the end of each breeding season in this study could have masked any positive influence of temperature during the cool onset of the breeding period. It is possible that an analysis of temperature trends subdivided within the breeding season period may have revealed different relationships."}, {"section_title": "Number of breeding pairs", "text": "In many cases, years with high levels of nest predation are typically followed by decreased population size in subsequent years (Martin 1992) . However, we did not observe this pattern in our population (Table 3) , and cannot attribute changes in population size to the previous year's nest survival. Some species reduce their reproductive efforts during drought conditions through decreased overall nesting attempts (Bolger et al. 2005; Keynan and Yosef 2010) , but not all species respond in this manner (McCreedy and van Riper 2015) . In a recent study documenting responses of desert birds to drought, authors offer no insight into the effects of drought on population size (McCreedy and Van Riper 2015), but we would expect it to have a negative impact if fewer available resources result in fewer breeding attempts. In this study, however, an increase in the number of breeding pairs and therefore total nesting attempts was positively correlated to mean breeding season temperature and winter precipitation (Fig. 4) . Because both the number of breeding pairs and the total nest attempts increased, this cannot be explained simply through an extended season or multiple broods. At the same time, very few single birds were observed with the exception of a few floater males at the beginning of each breeding season. A positive relationship between population size and temperature has not been described elsewhere, and while we feel it is important to note, the (Arcese et al. 1992; Perdeck et al. 2000; Saether et al. 2000) so warm winter conditions both at this site as well as in nearby areas could have positively impacted survival and therefore population size. However, many factors independent of temperature can influence survival on winter grounds [e.g., habitat availability and quality (Sherry and Holmes 1996) , precipitation (Gullett et al. 2014) , food (Perdeck et al. 2000) ], so this relationship is not clearly tied to temperature. Habitat loss is cited as a factor in the decline of loggerhead shrike populations (Cade and Woods 1997; Pruitt 2000) , and the loss of nearby habitat could result in a flux of individuals onto this site that has remained unchanged. However, we did not note any large-scale loss of adjacent habitat, but land use changes or degradation of habitat within the region could possibly be a factor. The notable increase in breeding loggerhead shrikes on this site during a period of increased temperature and drought raises questions regarding the potential drivers, and warrants further investigation."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Temperature had important effects on loggerhead shrike reproduction. Increases in spring temperatures led to advancement of nest initiation dates, and the number of breeding pairs increased with increasing air temperatures. While the responses to increasing temperatures were generally positive, it is possible that, as other research suggests, a threshold temperature that negatively impacts reproduction and/or survival may be on the near horizon. Indirectly, further increases in temperature could lead to reduced soil moisture, translating to reduced primary and secondary productivity. The advantage of advanced breeding phenology is unclear in this arid environment where resource peaks occur according to both temporally and spatially unpredictable precipitation patterns, but there is evidence of positive impacts of advancement on nest survival and productivity (McCreedy and van Riper 2015) , and our study as well as others have shown a positive influence of early breeding on nest survival.\nShrike breeding success hinges primarily on various aspects of precipitation. Winter precipitation was the primary driver of nest survival (Fig. 3a) , and active period precipitation was also important (Fig. 3b) . Loggerhead shrikes have experienced range-wide population declines across a variety of habitat types (Cade and Woods 1997; Pruitt 2000) , and temperature has been shown to be an important positive factor in driving success in northern bird populations (Chabot et al. 2001; Collister and Wilson 2007; Skagen and Yackel Adams 2012) . However in this southern population, we found no effect of temperature on nest survival, but found a strong positive relationship between nest survival and precipitation. As the climate in the arid southwestern US continues to become drier with less reliable winter precipitation, shrike populations in these regions may experience continued low nest survival and potential population declines. Additionally, if a positive relationship between temperature and population size does exist, but drought conditions lead to high degrees of nest failure, a population sink could occur, possibly leading to local extinctions.\nWe showed that precipitation was an important driver of nest success. While rainfall is positively correlated with primary productivity, resulting in increased food resources, shrike productivity measures that are immediately impacted by this did not change. Therefore, indirect effects of precipitation such as adult behavior at nests, predator behavior and abundance, and the abundance of alternative prey sources must play an important role in limiting this system. The relationship between drought conditions and predator behavior warrants further study. The behavior of snakes as nest predators in the desert southwest is relatively understudied despite the high diversity of snakes at lower latitudes (DeGregorio et al. 2014) . Understanding the behavior and food habits of snakes in this ecosystem and how they respond to climatic conditions could provide valuable understanding of variation in predation rates on nests of loggerhead shrikes and many other avian species. Arid lands in North America are anticipated to become much more extreme environments over the coming century (Seager et al. 2007; Romero-Lankao et al. 2014 ). Understanding not only the direct effects of these changes but also complex community interactions will be paramount in managing these areas in the future."}]
