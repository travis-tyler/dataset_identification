The analysis is based on the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93), which tracks students who received a bachelor's degree in academic year 1992-93. Participants were sampled and surveyed in their year of graduation as part of the 1993 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93). The base-year study consisted of two components: an institutional survey that provided extensive information on students' enrollment and financial aid and a student survey. The First Follow-up (B&B:93/94) was conducted 1 year later, and provided additional information that is comparable to that collected in the Recent College Graduates (RCG) series of cross-sectional surveys. As part of the First Follow-up, participants' undergraduate transcripts were also collected from the B&B sample institutions. In 1997 (approximately 4 years after graduation), B&B participants were contacted again for the Second Follow-up (B&B:93/97). In both follow-up surveys, participants reported on many aspects of their employment. While B&B:93/94 provided continuity with earlier cross-sectional surveys, B&B:93/97 highlights the benefits of B&B's longitudinal design. Some issues, such as access to and participation in graduate education and labor market outcomes require a longer time lag than 1 year after graduation to observe outcomes of interest. Furthermore, the longitudinal design permits a comparison of outcomes at different points in time for bachelor's degree recipients. xiii 13    Ila Average full-time salary reported in April 1997 for 1992-93 bachelor's degree   recipients who had not enrolled in graduate school by 1997, unadjusted and adjusted  after controlling for variables listed in the table   43   1 1 b Average full-time salary reported in April 1997 for 1992-93 male bachelor's degree recipients who had not enrolled in graduate school by 1997, unadjusted and adjusted after controlling for variables listed in the table   46 Ilc Average full-time salary reported in April 1997 for 1992-93 female bachelor's degree recipients who had not enrolled in graduate school by 1997, unadjusted and adjusted after controlling for variables listed in the table   48   12a Average percent increase in full-time salary between 1994 and 1997 for 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who worked full time in 1994 and 1997 and had not enrolled in graduate school, unadjusted and adjusted after controlling for variables listed in the table   12b Average percent increase in full-time salary between 1994 and 1997 for 1992-93 male bachelor's degree recipients who worked full time in 1994 and 1997 and had not enrolled in graduate school, unadjusted and adjusted after controlling for variables listed in the table   12c Average percent increase in full-time salary between 1994 and 1997 for 1992-93 female bachelor's degree recipients who worked full time in 1994 and 1997 and had not enrolled in graduate school, unadjusted and adjusted after controlling for variables listed in the table   13 Percentage of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients reporting that their April 1997 job both required a bachelor's degree and had definite career potential among those who had not enrolled in graduate school, unadjusted and adjusted for variables listed in the "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "No one disputes the economic benefits of earning a bachelor's degree) College graduates as a whole earn considerably more than high school graduates, and the wage gap between these two groups has been growing.2 In addition, more and more students are enrolling in college to increase their employment opportunities and marketability. For example, in 1999, three-quarters of college freshmen reported that \"being able to make more money\" strongly influenced their decision to attend college (Sax et al. 1999, p. 50). In contrast, just over half (54 percent) reported the same in 1976 (Astin 1993, p. 245). Among college graduates, however, students' employment outcomes vary considerably according to what they choose to study. A number of researchers have demonstrated the effect of undergraduate major on career earnings (e.g., Grogger and Eide 1995;Rumberger and Thomas 1993). There is general consensus from these and other studies that applied undergraduate fields such as engineering, business, and to a lesser extent, health, command higher salaries than do fields in humanities and arts and social sciences. According to Pascarella and Terenzini (1991), one explanation for these differences may be that the applied fields such as business or engineering are \"characterized by a relatively well defined body of knowledge and skills, an emphasis on scientific or quantitative methods of inquiry, and quite often, an applied orientation\" (p. 516). For jobs not directly related to college majors, employers also may use undergraduate major as a way of sorting out applicants, believing that those majoring in more applied and quantitative fields have had more rigorous training or are generally brighter than other students (Pascarella and Terenzini 1991). However, some evidence indicates that social science and humanities and arts majors have greater potential for succeeding in corporate management positions than do their counterparts majoring in engineering and mathematics. In a study conducted by AT&T in 1984, the author concluded that undergraduate major \"was the strongest predictor of managerial performance and progress\" for employees participating in a longitudinal study of managers (AT&T 1984, p. ii). While humanities and arts and social science majors were relatively weak in quantitative abilities, they were particularly strong in interpersonal and verbal skills. According to the same study, business majors were a \"strong second\" in managerial abilities. In contrast, though they exhibited strong quantitative skills, engineers and mathematics/science majors were relatively weak with respect to other managerial characteristics. Despite college students' increased motivation to seek a college education in order to position themselves better in the labor market, and despite the growth in the technology industry, between 1986-87 and 1996-97 students actually moved away from majoring in certain applied fields such as engineering and computer science. For example, the number of degrees awarded in engineering fields declined 19 percent, and those awarded in computer and information sciences dropped 37 percent (U.S. Department of Education 1999, table 255). At the same time, due in large part to increased enrollment by women, the number of degrees conferred in social science, psychology, and biological sciences increased substantially over the same 10-year period. How have recent college graduates fared in the job market with respect to their undergraduate field of study? That is the main question addressed in this study. This study adds to earlier research on how students' undergraduate major affects their employment in several ways. First, it is based on relatively recent datastudents who earned their bachelor's degree in 1992-93and is limited to students who had never enrolled in graduate education. Second, it analyzes changes in graduates' employment status and annual salary between the time they first entered the labor market (one year after graduation) and four years later. Third, the analysis also examines the association between undergraduate major and other employment outcomes such as the job stability, the availability of benefits, and the general job satisfaction reported by college graduates. Because the survey used for this study extends four years after most of the participants completed their bachelor's degree, a major consideration that this study could not address is long-term outcomes. But consistent with the AT&T study discussed above, there is some evidence that college graduates who major in humanities and arts and social science fields do better with respect to earnings and job advancement in the long term (i.e., 10 years or more later) than their peers who major in applied fields.3 The analysis is based on data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B) representing college graduates who received their bachelor's degree in the academic year 1992-93. Survey participants were initially sampled from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93) and were first surveyed in their senior year of college. They were later followed up in 1994 and 1997, approximately one year and four years after graduation. For this study, the sample is based on respondents who participated in all three surveys, approximately 83 percent (about 9,000) of respondents among the original eligible participants. The sample was further limited to graduates who had not enrolled in graduate school as of 1997, about 70 percent of all graduates. The main analytic variable used in the study is undergraduate field of study. It is based on the major listed on students' undergraduate transcripts. If more than one major was reported, the variable is based on the first one listed. Major was aggregated and coded to distinguish among different applied fields of study. For example, nursing was distinguished from other health fields, and computer science from engineering. In addition to salary and employment status, respondents reported on various benefits offered at their April job, including health, vacation, sick leave, and retirement benefits. These benefits and graduates' reported satisfaction with various other aspects of their 1997 job, including pay, promotion opportunities, education benefits, job challenge, job security, working conditions, and co-workers, are presented here with respect to major field of study."}, {"section_title": "Education", "text": "Of course, in addition to field of study, other factors may influence employment outcomes and earnings.4 In particular, many studies have reported gender differences in earnings within occupations as a contributing factor (Clery, Lee, and Knapp 1998;Fitzgerald 2000;Hecker 1998;Rumberger and Thomas 1993). Thus, for several outcomes, the findings for men and women are presented separately."}, {"section_title": "Study Sample", "text": "The study is based on 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who had not enrolled in graduate education by 1997. College graduates who do not seek graduate education differ somewhat from those who do, especially with respect to undergraduate field of study. Since those who major in applied fields are often trained for specific occupations, they are more likely to enter the labor market immediately after graduation than are their peers who major in more academic subjects. For instance, roughly 8 in 10 of those majoring in business, nursing, computer science, and communications/journalism had not enrolled in graduate school as of 1997 (figure 1). In contrast, roughly half of 1992-93 college graduates majoring in either biological-related sciences or mathematics and physical sciences, and about three-fifths of social science majors, had not enrolled in graduate school. Bachelor's degree recipients who did not enroll in graduate education also differed with respect to their demographic characteristics (table 1). Because older students may have family and financial obligations that make it more difficult to attend graduate school, those who were older than the traditional age at the time of their bachelor's degree (i.e., 23 years or older) were more likely not to enroll in graduate school and thus, more likely to be included in the study sample. Consistent with their older ages, married graduates were more likely not to enroll in graduate school. 4Even within field of study, course taking may also vary and possibly affect employment outcomes. See for example, the difference between men's and women's biological science course taking in Adelman (1991, p. 12).  Whether or not college graduates' parents had attained a graduate degree also was related to students' enrollment in graduate school. College graduates whose parents had attained no more than a bachelor's degree were more likely not to enroll in graduate school than their peers whose parents had earned an advanced degree. Finally, as measured by cumulative grade point average (GPA), differences in academic performance also emerged. As undergraduate GPA declined, so the likelihood of not enrolling in  graduate school increased (e.g., 19 percent with GPAs under 3.0 had enrolled, compared with 38 percent with GPAs of 3.5 or higher)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Two types of descriptive analyses are presented in the report. The first two sections (\"Major Field of Study\" and \"Labor Market Outcomes\") examine the relationship between major field of study and employment outcomes by comparing graduates in one field of study to all graduates. In this way, the experiences of graduates in specific fields are compared to the \"average experience.\" Since the two groups being compared are not independent (i.e., graduates in each major are also part of the whole), proper statistical techniques were used to take this into account (see appendix B). In all the tables supporting discussions of specific majors compared with all graduates, estimates significantly greater than the average (i.e. the total line of the table) are shaded in gray. Estimates significantly less than the average are in a box without shading.

Following business, the next most popular majors were social sciences and humanities and arts: 15 percent and 13 percent, respectively, of college graduates with no graduate education had obtained bachelor's degrees in these fields. Several demographic differences were apparent for graduates who had majored in applied fields, but with the exception of gender, there were few differences among those who had majored in fields considered to be more academic (women were more likely than men to major in the humanities and arts).5 Among the applied fields, men were more likely to major in more quantitative and technical fields, while women tended to major in fields associated with helping professions. Specifically, men were more likely to major in business (32 versus 24 percent), engineering (13 versus 2 percent), and computer science (4 versus 2 percent), while women were more likely to major in education (13 versus 4 percent), nursing (6 versus 1 percent), and other health fields (4 versus 2 percent). Business fields tended to attract older college graduates. More than one-third of college graduates who were 30 or older when receiving the bachelor's degree had majored in business (35 percent), compared with just over one-quarter (27 percent) of those 22 or younger. College graduates in their mid-20s (ages 23-29) majored in engineering at higher rates than did their younger or older counterparts.6 Some racial/ethnic group differences were also found, especially with respect to engineering majors. Asian/Pacific Islander graduates were more likely than their black, non-Hispanic counterparts to major in engineering (13 versus 5 percent). However, despite what appear to be substantial differences between Asian graduates (13 percent) and graduates from other racial/ethnic groups (5 to 7 percent), there was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that they 5This was especially true for the field of psychology, in which nearly three-quarters of majors are women (B&B:94/97 Data Analysis System). 6This may be partly due to the fact that some engineering programs require five years of study; thus, students entering at age 18 would be about 23 at graduation. 9"}, {"section_title": "28", "text": ".

In addition, black graduates were less likely to earn degrees in education or health (U.S. Department of Education 1995).7 Finally, undergraduate major was related to the type of college or university attended. For those who did not enroll in graduate school, bachelor's degree recipients who attended public institutions that do not grant doctorate degrees were more likely than those in all other institutions to major in education (12 versus 2 to 8 percent) (table 2).

In 1997, three years after college graduates' first entry into the labor market in 1994, the economy was strong and labor market tight. By 1997, just 2 percent of college graduates who had not enrolled in graduate school were unemployed and 86 percent worked full time. However, there were some differences in employment status when taking field of study into account. In both 1994 and 1997, graduates who had majored in business, engineering, or computer science were more likely than all college graduates to be employed full time, while those with humanities and arts majors were less likely to be so (table 3a). In 1994, but not 1997, those who majored in education were less likely than all graduates to work full time and more likely to work part time, and those who majored in biological sciences also were less likely to work full time. Demographic differences, especially gender differences, were related to employment status. Consistent with traditional gender roles, where women more often work in the home and men outside the home, women were less likely to be employed full time in both 1994 and 1997, and they more often worked part time, or were out of the labor force. When considering race/ethnicity, few measurable differences were found to be related to how much graduates worked.8 In 1994, but not 1997, white, non-Hispanic graduates were more likely than Hispanic graduates to work full time.

Among those with any unemployment, the average number of unemployment spells was 1.3 (table 3b). Only those who had majored in nursing or business reported fewer average unemployment spells than did all graduates (1.1 and 1.2, respectively).

Likewise, three-quarters (74 percent) of education majors were employed as teachers or educators, 56 percent of business majors worked in Unlike other applied fields, graduates with degrees in communications/journalism were more likely than graduates in any other field of study to be employed in service occupations: fully one-third of these graduates were employed in such jobs.9 About one in five communications/journalism majors were employed in business occupations, and the same percentage reported working as editors, writers, or performers. For academic majors who did not enroll in graduate school, the link between undergraduate field of study and employment in 1997 was not as obvious. However, there were some clear connections. For example, nearly one-quarter of graduates majoring in biological science or mathematics and physical science fields were employed in occupations related to science, research, or technical work. And roughly the same percentage of these graduates were employed as educators. This is understandable since science and mathematics teachers often specialize in the subject matter that they teach. Some graduates who had majored in academic fields were employed in jobs that were not obviously related to their major.

"}, {"section_title": "67", "text": "The analysis thus far has been limited to bivariate comparisons and in particular, comparisons of graduates in specific fields of study to all graduates as a whole. While this type of analysis is useful to gain insight into the general patterns of employment outcomes with respect to major, many other factors also may play a role in how college graduates fare in the labor market. Gender and age, for example, are highly correlated with employment outcomes. In order to take multiple factors into account, it is necessary to use statistical techniques that hold related variables constant while looking at the independent effects of individual variables. To do so usually requires the use of a comparison group or in the case of this study, a particular field of study against which to compare other fields. The natural point of comparison is business, the field of study that dominates undergraduate education. As was shown in figure A, over one-quarter of all 1992-93 undergraduates had majored in a business-related field. Thus, the multivariate analysis compares specific majors to business after holding other variables constant. In other words, taking into account factors such as age, gender, marital status, employment experience, and other variables that may affect employment outcomes, the analysis compares college graduates in each major with those in business. Three linear regression models were developed with the following outcome or dependent variables: (1) 1997 full-time salary, (2) the percent increase in full-time salaries for those who worked full time in both 1994 and 1997, and (3) the percentage of graduates reporting that their 1997 occupation both required a bachelor's degree and had definite career potential. Models 1 and 2 (1997 salary and percent increase in salary) were run separately for men and women. The sample for model 1 was limited to those who worked full time in 1997; model 2 included those who worked full time in both 1994 and 1997; and model 3 included all graduates (i.e. those with no graduate enrollment). Along with undergraduate major, the independent variables included in the models reflect student demographic characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, age at bachelor's degree, parents' highest education); family responsibilities (marital status, parenthood); performance in college (cumulative GPA); undergraduate institution attended; and work experience. Work experience variables included employment while enrolled in college, ever worked in overlapping jobs simultaneously, worked in two or more jobs since graduation, worked in one job versus two or more, and the average number of months worked in the 1997 job. Finally, like the bivariate analysis, only bachelor's degree recipients with no graduate enrollment were included in the analysis. The results of the first regression analysis-1997 full-time salariesare shown in table 11 a. The first column displays the unadjusted average full-time salaries of college graduates with no graduate education before controlling for the other variables. The second column displays the average salaries after controlling for all the independent variables listed in the table. In other words, they are the expected salaries after holding all other variables constant. The italicized category for each variable is the reference group against which all comparisons and tests of statistical significance are made. Asterisks indicate when a particular category of a variable is significantly different from the reference group. When asterisks appear in both columns, one can draw the same conclusion as when interpreting the unadjusted results. When asterisks appear in only one column, it means that the adjustment procedure may lead to a different interpretation than when one uses only unadjusted estimates. For example, before adjustment, the average salaries for graduates in several fields differed from those in business. After adjustment, however, only education and humanities and arts remained different from business. Graduates in either education or humanities and arts earned less than their peers in business, while graduates in no other field earned significantly more than those in business. The change between the unadjusted and adjusted salaries is likely due the interrelationship of several variables, but in particular, to age and employment experience. Older graduates were more likely to major in business (see table 2), and these graduates presumably have more employment experience, which in turn is associated with higher salaries. Thus, when age and employment experience are controlled for, the average adjusted salary for business appears lower than the unadjusted amount and the adjusted salaries for several other fields appear higher. In addition to field of study, three other variables included in the model remained significant predictors of 1997 salaries after controlling for related variables: gender, GPA, and institution first attended. Men earned substantially more than women, graduates with GPAs under 3.0 earned less than those with GPAs of 3.5 or higher, and those attending private, not-for-profit doctorate institutions earned more than their counterparts attending comparable public institutions.  4Standard error of least squares coefficient, adjusted for design effect (see appendix B).

"}, {"section_title": "71", "text": "When models predicting 1997 full-time salaries were run separately for men and women, GPA was no longer significant. Otherwise, the results for men mirrored those for all graduates: men who had majored in education or humanities and arts earned less than business majors and those attending private, not-for-profit institutions earned more than their counterparts attending comparable public institutions (table 11b). For women, on the other hand, there were several factors related to their 1997 salaries that were not related to men's (table 11c). Those who had majored in either engineering or other health fields reported substantially higher salaries than their peers who had majored in business. And unlike graduates as a whole and their male peers, women who had majored in humanities and arts did not earn significantly less than women who had majored business. In addition, women's age at bachelor's degree, race/ethnicity, and employment experience all independently influenced their 1997 salaries. Specifically, women age 30 or older (compared with those under 23), Asian/Pacific Islanders (compared with white graduates), and women who never worked in overlapping jobs (compared with those who did) earned higher salaries. It is not clear why so many more variables were associated with women's 1997 salary compared with men's. Whether women are subjected to greater scrutiny in advancing through their professions or whether there is more variation among women college graduates with respect to their employment tenure cannot be determined from the data. When looking at college graduates who worked full time in both 1994 and 1997, after controlling for related variables, only two factors were associated with the percent increase in salaries between 1994 and 1997: age and major field of study (table 12a). College graduates age 30 or older experienced a smaller percent increase in salary than their counterparts age 22 or younger, and those who had majored in either education or nursing experienced a lower percent increase in salary than did business majors. The finding for age is consistent with the fact that college graduates age 30 or older earned substantially higher salaries in 1994 than did their counterparts age 22 or younger (see table 4a); older graduates also reported working in fewer jobs (table 3c), giving them fewer opportunities for pay increases. Similarly, nursing majors also started out at a relatively high rate of pay (i.e., their 1994 salary was higher than average). Education majors, on the other hand, started with low salaries and they remained low between 1994 and 1997. When models for men and women were run separately, age was the only factor included in the model that predicted the average percent increase in salary for men (table 12b). Otherwise, male college graduates working full time in both 1994 and 1997 appeared to be advancing in salary at roughly the same rate regardless of major field of study, employment experiences, and variables other than age that were included in the model. For women, field of study was the only predictor of salary increases (table 12c). That is, women who were nursing majors or education majors experienced lower percent increases in salary than did women who were business majors.

Because a relatively large percentage of graduates reported either that a degree was required or that their job held definite career potential, in this analysis, the two attributes were combined into one composite variable so that only those reporting both job attributes were considered (38 percent of graduates). As shown in table 13, after controlling for related variables, field of study was the only variable. that was significantly associated with the outcome. Specifically, engineering majors were more likely than business majors to report both job attributes. Engineering is often a highly specialized major leading to a very specific career track, which may explain why majors are so much more likely to be in a career track position requiring a bachelor's degree. However, compared with business, in no other field of study were college graduates more or less likely to report that their job was on a definite career track and that a degree was required. In summary, the data from the models predicting 1997 full-time salaries confirm the earnings disadvantage of education majors. This remained true for both men and women when separate models were run. In addition, for men but not for women, humanities and arts majors also earned significantly less than those who majored in business. Among women, but not men, those who majored in engineering or health other than nursing enjoyed an earnings premium compared with business majors. The data from the other two models (i.e., salary increase and career track employment) suggest that once college graduates are established in full-time employment, undergraduate major has at most a modest influence on either salary advancement or the degree of career potential that their occupations hold. However, it should be remembered that this analysis was limited to those employed full time. It is possible that major field of study may exert more influence on part-time or temporary employment earnings.

While a small proportion of them experienced unemployment, most reported working full time. However, for those who had not enrolled in graduate education by 1997 their employment outcomes did vary with undergraduate major. The findings in this study concerning salary are consistent with earlier research analyzing the effect of college major. Graduates in certain applied fields such as engineering, business, computer science, nursing, and other health fields earned higher than average salaries either when they first entered the labor market in 1994 or three years later in 1997, while those in education, social work/protective services and humanities and arts earned lower than average salaries. However, when examining other job attributes such as job stability, job benefits, and job satisfaction, differences across fields of study were relatively modest. Consider, for example, that most college graduates (83 to 86 percent) reported that their jobs provided health insurance, paid sick leave, or paid vacations. The only field in which graduates consistently reported having these benefits less often was humanities and arts, yet three-quarters or more of these majors (77 to 79 percent) reported receiving these benefits. Similarly, there was little variation in the extent to which college graduates reported high satisfaction with job attributes other than pay. Half or more reported being very satisfied with job security (63 percent), job challenge (56 percent), fringe benefits (53 percent), co-workers (80 percent), and working conditions (56 percent).

However, one field stood out from the others with respect to almost all job attributes: engineering majors consistently experienced very positive outcomes for both salary and job benefits. Not only did they report higher than average salaries but they also were more likely than all graduates to report job benefits such as health insurance, paid vacations, retirement benefits, family leave, and outside job training. College graduates who had majored in computer science fields also reported very positive outcomes relative to all graduates.

Nursing was the only field in which graduates experienced better than average job stability for all three indicators examined: they had worked in fewer jobs, experienced fewer spells of unemployment, and had worked in their April 1997 job longer than all graduates as a whole. In contrast, education majors and humanities and arts majors fared relatively poorly compared to all graduates, especially with respect to salary. Education was the only field in which majors reported lower than average full-time salaries in both 1994 and 1997, and they experienced a lower than average salary increase between the two time periods. Humanities and arts majors reported lower than average salaries in both 1994 and 1997, and they consistently reported receiving all job benefits (health, sick leave, paid vacations, retirement benefits, family leave, and job training) less often than all graduates. In the multivariate analysis, where specific fields of study were compared to business after holding related variables constant, education majors earned lower salaries among both men and women. The same was true for humanities and arts majors but only for men. Women who had majored in humanities and arts did not earn significantly less than business majors once related variables were controlled. In addition, among women, but not men, engineering majors and health (other than nursing) majors earned more than business majors. With respect to salary increases between 1994 and 1997, among those employed full time in both years, education was one of only two fields (nursing being the other) in which graduates earned lower salary increases than did business majors. Finally, engineering was the only field in which graduates were more likely than business majors to report that their 1997 job both required a bachelor's degree and held definite career potential. The multivariate analysis also demonstrated that even after controlling for major, background characteristics, college GPA, and work experience, men earned considerably higher salaries than women in 1997. Several factors that influenced women's salaries in 1997 did not have a comparable effect on men's salaries. These included age at bachelor's degree (women 30 or older earned higher salaries than those under 23); race/ethnicity (female Asian/Pacific Islander graduates earned higher salaries than their white counterparts); and work experience (women who had ever worked in overlapping jobs earned less than their peers who did not). The discrepancy between factors that predict the salaries of men and women in 1997 suggests that women may be subjected to greater scrutiny than men in attaining higher paying positions in the marketplace. There were three fields of study in which graduates appeared to reach gender equity in earnings. In the fields of engineering, health fields other than nursing, and humanities and arts men and women earned comparable salaries four years after receiving their bachelor's degree. Again, however, these results reflect very early labor market experiences for those who never enrolled in graduate education, at most five years after college graduation.

Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors occur because observations are made only on samples of students, not on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments; instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents the population difference. Nonsampling errors occur not only in sample surveys but also in complete censuses of entire populations. Nonsampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all students in all institutions in the sample (some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and imputing missing data.

In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors12 and weighted sample sizes for these estimates.

The procedure is typically referred to as the Taylor series method.  Tabular results are limited by sample size when attempting to control for additional factors that may account for the variation observed between two variables. For example, when examining the percentages of those who completed a degree or were still enrolled in postsecondary education 3 years after their initial enrollment, it is impossible to know to what extent the observed variation is due to socioeconomic status (SES) differences and to what extent it is due to differences in other factors related to SES, such as type of institution attended, intensity of enrollment, and so on. However, if a nested table were produced showing SES within type of institution attended within enrollment intensity, the cell sizes would be too small to identify the patterns.

Substituting ones or zeros for the subgroup characteristic(s) of interest and the mean proportions for the other variables results in an estimate of the adjusted proportion for the specified subgroup, holding all other variables constant. For example, consider a hypothetical case in which two variables, age and gender, are used to describe an outcome, Y (such as percentage of graduates working in a job requiring a bachelor's degree and with definite career potential). The variables age and gender are recoded into a dummy variable representing age, A, and a dummy variable representing gender, G: The following regression equation is then estimated from the correlation matrix output from the DAS: \"For more information about weighted least squares regression, see Michael S. Lewis-Beck, "}]
