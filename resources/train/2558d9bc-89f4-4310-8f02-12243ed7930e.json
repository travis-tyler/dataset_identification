[{"section_title": "", "text": "G round-based remote sensing for variable-rate N management relies on real-time, sensor-based spectral measurements of crop canopy refl ectance to derive in-season, plant N recommendations (Raun et al., 2002; Link et al., 2005) . By timing N fertilizer applications with crop N demand, this new technique promises to help growers manage plant N uptake more effi ciently. Spectral measurements are obtained at certain wavelengths within the visible (VIS: 400-700 nm) and near infrared (NIR: 700-850 nm) regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, where the spectral characteristics of vegetation are indicative of plant N status (Hinzman et al., 1986; Zillmann et al., 2006) . Typically, assessment of crop N status is accomplished by comparing the refl ectance from the crop yet to be fertilized with the refl ectance from the crop in a suffi cient N reference plot, or strip (Shanahan et al., 2008) . Th e greater the diff erence between the two, the greater the expected crop N response and the more N fertilizer needed.\nBefore canopy closure, crop refl ectance is strongly infl uenced by leaf surface area of the crop per unit of ground, or LAI. Th erefore, for early season N applications, spectral refl ectance within a sensor's fi eld of view may be a mixture of refl ectance from the crop canopy and soil background (Daughtry et al., 2000; Asner, 2004; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2004a) . Low LAI and consequent high soil refl ectance will diminish the ability of remote sensing to detect subtle diff erences in Chl content and hence, crop N status (Baret and Guyot, 1991; Rondeaux et al., 1996; Leone and Sommer, 2000; Bausch and Diker, 2001; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2004b; Bannari et al., 2006) . In semiarid environments, variation in LAI is largely attributable to water availability (Hatfi eld et al., 2004) , which has confounded use of remote sensing for determining both early and late-season N requirements of dryland wheat (Eitel et al., 2007 (Eitel et al., , 2008 .\nTh e Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and variants, Transformed Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI), Generalized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (GESAVI), and Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI), were developed to normalize soil eff ects in the crop canopy response (Huete, 1988; Rondeaux et "}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity of Ground-Based Remote Sensing Estimates of Wheat Chlorophyll Content to Variation in Soil Refl ectance", "text": "Spectral indices (SI) derived from crop refl ectance data are sensitive to chlorophyll a and b content (Chl). However, the SI-Chl relationship might be confounded by variation in leaf area index (LAI) and soil background refl ectance, especially in semiarid environments where water determines crop growth. Th is study evaluated the sensitivity of SI to variation in soil refl ectance and how this may aff ect overall SI performance for ground-based sensing of Chl in dryland wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Selected SI were computed from spectra simulated by the PROSPECT-SAIL radiative-transfer model for 5 LAI values, 7 Chl values, and 121 dry soil surface refl ectance spectra. Th ese spectra represented soils across major wheat growing areas in the United States. Soil properties and refl ectance varied widely among the soils indicated by the high SI variation for LAI values < 1.5. Overall, soil background variation contributed less to the observed SI variability (<6%) than LAI (<97%). Combined indices [i.e., Normalized Diff erence Red Edge Index (NDRE)/Normalized Diff erence Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Modifi ed Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio Index (MCARI)/Second Modifi ed Triangular Vegetation Index (MTVI)] were least aff ected by soil background variation than single indices (i.e., NDVI). Results showed that ground sensing of Chl may be improved by means of combined indices that are resistant to soil background and LAI. Empirical measurements verifi ed that the modeling results were a reliable representation of the infl uence of Chl, LAI, and soil on canopy refl ectance. Further research is needed to evaluate the eff ect of soil moisture, surface roughness, residue, growth stage, and shadow on SI.\nAbbreviations: Chl, chlorophyll a and b content; GESAVI, Generalized soil adjusted vegetation index; LAI, leaf area index; MCARI, modifi ed chlorophyll absorption in refl ective index; NDRE, normalized diff erence red edge index; NDVI, normalized diff erence vegetation index; OSAVI, optimized soil adjusted vegetation index; SAVI, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index; SI spectral index; MTV2, Second Modifi ed Triangular Vegetation Index; TCARI, transformed chlorophyll absorption in refl ectance index; TSAVI, Transformed Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index. Daughtry et al., 2000; Gilabert et al., 2002; Haboudane et al., 2002) . Th ough resistant to soil background variation, these indices have been shown to have limited sensitivity to Chl and N status (Daughtry et al., 2000; Haboudane et al., 2002; Eitel et al., 2007 Eitel et al., , 2008 . In comparison, the Modifi ed Chlorophyll Absorption in Refl ectance Index (MCARI) and the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Refl ectance Index (TCARI) are reported to be more sensitive to Chl and resistant to soil background refl ectance (Daughtry et al., 2000; Bannari et al., 2006) .\nCombining a SI sensitive to chlorophyll with one sensitive to LAI produces a \"combined index\" that is independent of vegetation cover and therefore more closely related to Chl and crop N status (Daughtry et al., 2000) . For example, the combined index TCARI/OSAVI, was found to enhance sensitivity to Chl (r 2 = 0.81) and reduce background refl ectance contributions from soil (Haboudane et al., 2002) . Combining the MCARI and OSAVI to form MCARI/OSAVI yielded good results (r 2 > 0.69) when predicting Chl of corn (Daughtry et al., 2000) and tree crowns (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2004a) . Th e MCARI combined with the second Modifi ed Transformed Vegetation Index (Haboudane et al., 2002) in ratio (MCARI/ MTVI2) explained more variance in Chl of dryland wheat than MCARI or MTVI2 alone (Eitel et al., 2007 (Eitel et al., , 2008 . Th e Canopy Chlorophyll Content Index of Barnes et al. (2000) employing the Normalized Diff erence Red Edge Index and the Normalized Diff erence Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ratio (NDRE/NDVI) explained up to 69% of the variance in N content of dryland wheat (Rodriguez et al., 2006) .\nA further complication of low LAI that has been reported is variation in soil color and brightness (Hatfi eld et al., 2004) , due to diff erent soil types, that produce diff erent crop spectral refl ectance values within a reference strip even though N availability is abundant ( J. Schepers, personal communication, 24 Sep. 2007 ). Indeed, many farm fi elds have required multiple reference strips in smaller areas to account for diff erences in soil type. Soil color and brightness diff erences are reported to be responsible for the variability (Huete et al., 1985) that have confounded use of remote sensing for determining N requirements in corn (Scharf and Lory, 2002; Sripada et al., 2005) . Soil diff erences between farm fi elds may complicate the geographic transferability of regression models relating SIs to plant physiological parameters such as Chl and N content (Eitel et al., 2007) .\nSoil refl ectance is largely infl uenced by chemical-physical properties including water content, organic matter content, iron oxides, calcium carbonates, mineralogy, and surface roughness, and particle-size distribution (Baumgardner et al., 1985; Hill, 1994; Asner, 2004; Brown et al., 2006; ) . Variation in amounts of refl ected and absorbed light at given wavelengths, due to different combinations of these properties, produces diff erences in color and brightness among soils (Torrent and Barron, 1993; Hill, 1994) . Soil refl ectance decreases with increasing soil moisture, organic matter, and surface roughness (Baumgardner et al., 1985; Irons et al., 1989; Hill, 1994; Ben-Dor et al., 1999; Clark, 1999) , whereas it increases with increasing calcium carbonate content (Leone and Sommer, 2000) . Th ough in general larger grain sizes result in lower diff use refl ectance for a particular mineral, sandy soils contain highly refl ective quartz and feldspars which makes them more refl ective than clayey soils that contain darker secondary phyllosilicates (Hill, 1994; Leone and Sommer, 2000) . Iron oxides infl uence the entire VIS-NIR refl ectance spectrum of soils, particularly between 400 and 550 nm and 700 to 870 nm where they cause characteristic, broad electronic absorption features (Irons et al., 1989; Hill, 1994; Ben-Dor et al., 1999; Clark, 1999) .\nTh ough the use of combined SI has been shown to improve the prediction of Chl and N status in wheat, relatively little is known on how strongly soil background variation negatively affects overall SI performance of ground-based remote sensing of Chl in wheat. Th e objectives of this study were to evaluate the sensitivity of combined SI and their single index components to variation in soil refl ectance, and to test how strongly it aff ects the overall index performance for ground-based sensing of Chl in wheat."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Soil Refl ectance Data", "text": "Th e 2002 Census of Agriculture (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2002) was used to identify counties within the contiguous USA with 5000 or more harvested acres (2025 ha) of all wheat for grain ( Fig. 1) . Soil surface refl ectance spectra and associated laboratory soil characterization data were available for a total of 121 pedons within this defi ned area from the US National Soil Survey Center-Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSC-SSL) in Lincoln, NE. Previously, Brown et al. (2006) had obtained standardized measurements of diff use soil refl ectance for soils stored at the NSSC-SSL using an ASD Fieldspec Pro FR VNIR spectroradiometer (Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder, CO) with 2-to 10-nm eff ective resolution over a wavelength range of 350 to 2500 nm. Soil was scanned from below using an ASD highintensity source probe and white light source with Duroplan borosilicate optical-glass Petri dishes (Schott AG, Mainz, Germany) to hold samples and a Spectralon panel(Labsphere, Inc., North Sutton, NH) for white referencing.

Th e PROSPECT leaf optical model ( Jacquemoud and Baret, 1990 ) was used to simulate leaf refl ectance and transmittance spectra between 500 and 900 nm at a spectral resolution of 1 nm. Model input parameters were leaf structural parameter N, leaf water content Cw (g cm -2 ), leaf dry matter content Cdm (g cm -2 ), and Chl (\u03bcg cm -2 ) ( Table 1 ).

Viewing and illumination input parameters included: latitude, solar declination angle, spherical leaf angle distribution (Campbell and Norman, 1998) , sensor viewing angle, sensor zenith angle, time of day, and fraction of direct solar radiation (Table 1) . For each of the 121 soil spectra, SAIL model simulations were made for each combination of fi ve LAI values (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0) and the seven leaf refl ectance and transmittance spectra from PROSPECT (i.e., 121 soil spectra \u00d7 5 LAI values \u00d7 7 Chl steps).\nTh e hyperspectral refl ectance data simulated by PROSPECT-SAIL were converted to the band equivalent refl ectance (BER) of a CropScan MSR87 multispectral radiometer (CropScan, Inc., Rochester, MN). Th is sensor was selected because of proven adaptability for real-time, ground-based remote sensing and N fertilizer application (Reyniers and Vrindts, 2006) . Band equivalent refl ectance was computed with the following equation (Trigg and Flasse, 2000) :\nwhere R x is BER for band x, \u03bb min is the starting wavelength of band x's fi lter function, \u03bb max is the ending wavelength of band x's fi lter function, r i is the relative response for band x at wavelength i, and \u03c1 i is refl ectance measured by the spectroradiometer at wavelength i.

In each case, the ANOVA estimated the contribution of Chl, soil refl ectance, LAI, and their interactions in explaining the variance in each SI, or dependent variable. Th e ANOVA was conducted using ver. 2.7.2 (2008) of the statistical soft ware package R (Free Soft ware Foundation, Inc., Boston, MA) and the model:\nwhere \u03b1 is the eff ect for Chl, \u03b2 is the eff ect for soil background refl ectance, \u03b3 is the eff ect for LAI, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 is an interaction term, and \u03b5 is random error. Th e percentage of the total variance explained by Chl, soil background, LAI, and their interactions was computed by dividing their individual variances by the total variance and multiplying by 100. For ANOVA with simulated data, the variable soil refl ectance had 121 classes representing the 121 soil samples. For ANOVA with empirical data, the variable soil refl ectance had fi ve classes representing fi ve soil samples (about 25 kg) that were obtained in 2008, oven dried for 48 h at 50\u00b0C, and ground to pass a 2-mm sieve. Th e soils were selected to represent wide diff erences as possible in spectral refl ectance and represent extremes in soil variability within farm fi elds (Table 3) . Soil types were determined based on U.S. Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff , 2006). Color of soil was expressed as a rating value relative to the Munsell notation.\nCrop refl ectance measurements for the empirical-based ANOVA were acquired from 18 plots of size 0.5-m \u00d7 0.5-m within a dryland spring wheat fi eld near Echo, OR (45\u00b0 43' 48\" N, 119\u00b0 3' 18\" W). Crop refl ectance was measured aft er spreading the soils out 2 cm deep within 25 by 50 cm metal trays, and placing two trays of a soil between one row of wheat. Trays were painted black to minimize their refl ected energy. A spectroradiometer (Model FieldSpec Pro, Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc., Boulder, CO) was used to measure refl ectance in 1.4 nm increments from 350 to 1050 nm. One canopy refl ectance spectra was taken within each plot from the same viewing position for each of fi ve soil backgrounds. Spectra were acquired under cloud-free conditions. Negative eff ects of illumination geometry were minimized by taking spectra between 1100 and 1500 h PDT. Th e fi ber optic probe of the spectroradiometer (25\u00b0 fi eld of view) was held 0.7 m above the ground surface and pointed toward nadir. A Spectralon reference panel was used to convert radiance values to refl ectance.\nRelative Chl values were obtained with a chlorophyll meter (model SPAD-502, Minolta Corporation Ltd., Osaka, Japan) as the average of 10 randomly selected fl ag leaves. Th e relative Chl for a single leaf was the average of three measurements taken approximately 25, 50, and 75% of the distance from the leaf base to the leaf tip. Leaf area index within each sampling plot was the average of fi ve measurements that were taken with a plant canopy analyzer (Model LAI-2000, LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE). "}, {"section_title": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity to Soil Refl ectance Variability", "text": "As expected, contents of total organic C, carbonates, Fe, sand, and clay varied widely across the 121 soil pedons from within the U.S. wheat growing regions (Fig. 2) . As demonstrated by the spectra obtained by Brown et al. (2006) , soils containing more sand or carbonates were brighter and more refl ective than soils containing more clay, Fe, or organic C that were darker and less refl ective (Fig. 3) . In addition, a wide range of soil refl ectance was observed within each of the green, red, red edge, and NIR wavebands (Fig. 4) and apparently may be attributed to extreme variation in soil physical properties.\nTh e sensitivity of each SI to soil spectral refl ectance was evaluated by means of the standard deviation (\u03c3 s ) of the SI-Chl relationship averaged across the 121 soils at specifi c LAI values (Table 4) . As expected, soil spectral variation has little eff ect on single and combined indices when crop density is high (LAI = 3.0). However, its infl uence increases with decreasing crop density as indicated by values of the \u03c3 s , which increase with decreasing crop density for every SI except MCARI and NDRE/NDVI. Th e low sensitivity of MCARI to soil refl ectance is consistent with fi ndings by Daughtry et al. (2000) who showed that only 0.1% of variation was caused by soil background eff ects. Th e NDVI is strongly affected by soil background refl ectance at low canopy cover (Baret and Guyot, 1991; Rondeaux et al., 1996) , which explains why its standard deviation is larger than that of the other indices for LAI \u2264 2.0. Except for TCARI/OSAVI, combined indices were less sensitive to variation in soil refl ectance than NDVI as indicated by the relative smallness of the ratio of \u03c3 s to that of NDVI at LAI = 0.5 (Table 4) . Sensitivity of MCARI and TCARI to soil background variation was comparable with the sensitivity shown for NDRE/ NDVI, MCARI/OSAVI, and MCARI/MTVI2.\nAs indicated by their standard deviations, NDRE/NDVI was the best combined index followed by MCARI/OSAVI, MCARI/ MTVI2, and TCARI/OSAVI. Th is is in broad agreement with fi ndings by Zarco-Tejada et al. (2004b) who found that TCARI/ OSAVI was more negatively aff ected by soil background variation than MCARI/OSAVI. Th e lower sensitivity to soil background of MCARI/OSAVI versus TCARI/OSAVI might be explained by the fact that the single index component TCARI appears to be more strongly aff ected by soil variation than MCARI. Figure 5 shows the relationship between each SI and Chl simulated by canopy refl ectance modeling with variation in soil refl ectance for LAI = 0.5, 1.5, or 3.0. Th e curves corresponding to the diff erent SI show diff erences in slopes and standard deviations of the plotted points. At low LAI (0.5), single indices were less sensitive to chlorophyll than combined indices: that is, values change slightly or remain constant with increasing Chl. Except for MCARI and TCARI, single indices were negatively aff ected by variation in soil refl ectance: that is, relatively large standard deviations associated with each chlorophyll step. Most indices increased in resistance to variation in soil refl ectance with LAI \u2265 1.5, but NDRE, MCARI, and TCARI increased both in sensitivity to chlorophyll and resistance to soil refl ectance.\nExcept for TCARI/OSAVI, combined indices were less negatively aff ected by variation in soil refl ectance than most of the single indices. At high LAI values (3.0), all combined indices were not only sensitive to Chl, but also resistant to variation in soil refl ectance. For LAI = 0.5, sensitivity of combined indices TCARI/ OSAVI, MCARI/OSAVI, and MCARI/MTVI2 to soil refl ectance tended to increase with decreasing Chl. For MCARI/OSAVI and MCARI/MTVI2 this behavior disappeared for LAI \u2265 0.5 and for TCARI/OSAVI for LAI \u2265 2.0 (data not shown for LAI = 2.0). Th e reason for this behavior is unknown. Index NDRE/NDVI was invariant to soil eff ects throughout changes in Chl."}, {"section_title": "Overall Index Performance for Ground-Based Sensing of Chlorophyll a and b", "text": "To simultaneously evaluate the sensitivity of each index to chlorophyll and resistance to soil refl ectance and LAI, fi ve values of the REN were computed for each of fi ve Chl (x) steps where x = 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 \u03bcg cm -2 (Fig. 6) . Th e lower the REN Chl for a given index, the higher the sensitivity of an index to Chl and/ or its resistance to soil background eff ects and/or LAI. Noise in the determination of Chl, due to variation in soil refl ectance and LAI, increased with Chl for NDRE/NDVI. In contrast, this noise decreased with Chl for TCARI/OSAVI, MCARI/MTVI2, and MCARI/OSAVI. When Chl was <40 \u03bcg cm -2 the noise for MCARI/MTVI2 was greater than that for NDRE/NDVI or TCARI/OSAVI. Th erefore, NDRE/NDVI or TCARI/OSAVI may be better for low levels of chlorophyll versus MCARI/ MTVI2, which may be better for intermediate and high levels.\nTh e ANOVA was performed to estimate the amount of variance in a SI that is explained by each independent factor, their interactions, and error term (Table 5 ). Main eff ects of Chl, soil refl ectance, and LAI together accounted for >90% of the variance in any single or combined SI. Eff ects of interaction terms and error were small (<10%) and accounted for the remaining variance.\nTh e main goal of ground-based remote sensing of crop N content is increasing sensitivity to Chl as well as increasing resistance to extraneous variation from LAI and soil refl ectance. Based on this criterion, the best index is MCARI/MTVI2 followed by NDRE/ NDVI, TCARI/OSAVI, and MCARI/OSAVI. In contrast, single indices MTVI2, OSAVI, and NDVI have the greatest sensitivity to LAI, but also the least sensitivity to Chl. Th e superior performance of combined indices is due to use of single, structural indices (e.g., OSAVI, MTVI2, or NDVI) that are highly sensitive to LAI and therefore, can be used to correct for its confounding eff ects. Th e large percentage of variance in MCARI/MTVI2 explained by Chl coupled with small eff ects from soil and LAI is also corroborated by the previous result, that this index had the least noise for estimation of chlorophyll contents larger than 40 \u03bcg cm -2 (Fig. 6 ). Variation in soil color and brightness, due to diff erent soil types, produce diff erent canopy refl ectance values and calculated SI for a given amount of biomass (Huete, 1988) . Th is phenomenon was reported to confound use of remote sensing for determining N requirements in corn (Scharf and Lory, 2002; Sripada et al., 2005) . In this study, however, soil refl ectance had a small eff ect (<6%) on single and combined indices versus LAI (<97%). Th erefore, variation in LAI apparently will be more important than soil refl ectance in producing diff erences in crop spectral refl ectance values within N reference strips and the intended target area to receive in-season N application. Utilizing a combined index such as MCARI/ MTVI2 or NRDR/NDVI should be expected to accommodate the confounding eff ect of LAI on estimates of Chl."}, {"section_title": "Model Verifi cation Results", "text": "All soil types diff ered in specifi c color, lightness or darkness, and color intensity (Table 3) .

Combined indices NDRE/NDVI and MCARI/MTVI2 were less sensitive to this soil variability than single indices. For instance, Chl explained 62% of the total variance in NDRE/NDVI, whereas LAI explained <14% and soil background <5% (Table 5) . Factor Chl explained 59% of the variance in MCARI/MTVI2, whereas LAI and soil background explained 2 and 4%.

Th ese ANOVA results based on empirical measurements help confi rm that combined indices are both sensitive to Chl and resistant to variations in soil background and LAI.

Th ese new indices are needed for implementation of ground-based remote sensing technology in dryland crop production systems. Our results are derived from PROSPECT-SAIL model simulations performed on an extensive data set of spectral refl ectance from soils used for wheat production in the USA.\nTh ose familiar with the use of multiple reference strips to account for soil diff erences have anticipated problems in transferring predictive relationships between sites within fi elds, but the issue has not been studied extensively. Th is research has demonstrated that NDVI, OSAVI, and other single indices were strongly aff ected by variation in dry soil background for LAI less than 1.5. In contrast, soil background had a minor infl uence on combined indices NDRE/NDVI, MCARI/OSAVI, and MCARI/MTVI2 for LAI < 1.5. Th erefore, these indices may be better suited for ground-based remote sensing of Chl in semiarid environments where crop cover is oft en low (LAI < 1.5) and crop variability is largely driven by water supply. To date, ground-based sensing has been successfully employed in subhumid environments where variation in LAI is largely related to N fertility. Under dryland conditions, this research has confi rmed that LAI negatively aff ects the SI-Chl relationship more than soil refl ectance, such that the ground sensing of Chl should focus on use of combined indices that accommodate the variance attributable to LAI. Combined index MCARI/ MTVI2 explained 90% of the variability in Chl and was the best overall predictor of the SI investigated. With optical sensors now providing the red edge band, the long-standing reliance on NDVI is reduced, and the use of combined indices remains to be further investigated. Further research is also needed to determine how variability in soil types, soil moisture, surface roughness, soil texture, leaf inclination angle, or crop shadows may amplify soil background eff ects and infl uence the computation of SI."}]
