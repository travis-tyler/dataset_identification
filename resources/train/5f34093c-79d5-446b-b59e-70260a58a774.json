[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Estimates from the early stage of the epidemic in Peru (March 2020) showed sustained transmission in Lima with an estimated of reproduction number R~2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5) [14] . Moreover, the 20-days ahead forecast for Lima indicated that the prompt social distancing measures have significantly slowed down the initial spread of the virus in the region [14] . The crude case fatality rate (CFR), defined as the number of cumulative deaths and cases at a single time point, in Peru is estimated at 5.9%, approximating the global crude CFR average of ~6.3% [15] . Statistical analyses and mathematical models using data from Peru suggest that under current epidemic growth, the number of CoVID-19 infected individuals could surpass the healthcare system capacity [16] .\nThe clinical spectrum of CoVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic cases to clinical conditions characterized by respiratory failure, to multiorgan and systemic manifestations which can cause death [17] [18] [19] . CFR is a statistical entity used to estimate severity of the epidemic [20] as it provides a criterion for the public health officials to gauge the intensity and duration of public health interventions required to contain the epidemic [21] . However, it becomes challenging to estimate CFR during an epidemic as CFR estimates are sensitive to right censoring of the data that occurs .

Moreover, under-reporting of cases because mild or asymptomatic cases can go undetected by disease surveillance systems also underestimates CFR [22, 25] .\nIn this study we provide real-time estimates of adjusted age-specific CFR during the CoVID-19 epidemic in Peru, through May 25, 2020 to assess the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the region. The country has been performing PCR tests with the average positivity rate estimated at ~8.6% as of March 30, 2020 [14] . In Peru ~85% of ICU beds with ventilators are currently occupied by patients [26] , therefore our current estimates are not affected by excess deaths due to health care demand exceeding health care capacity. However, fears of hospital overcrowding persist [26] .\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted June 16, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.20123315 doi: medRxiv preprint Lain America, including Peru, is aging at a rapid rate, still a relatively small percentage of the population in the region are older than 65 years of age [33] . So in fact the age structure in the region could favor a lower overall CFR than would be expected otherwise with a relatively older population, as in other regions.\nOur estimate of adjusted CFR among men (10.8% (95%CrI: 10.5-11.1%)) is 1.7-fold higher than the estimated adjusted CFR for women (6.5% (95%CrI: 6.2-6.8%)), consistent with the estimates given in ref [34] . Men aged 80 years or older have an estimated adjusted CFR as high as 64.3% (95%CrI: 60.9-67.8%), 58-fold higher than our estimates for men aged 0-9, and 1.3-fold higher than our estimates for men aged 70-79. Similarly, the adjusted CFR estimates for women of aged 80 years or older are as high as 35.1% (95%CrI: 32.1-38.1%), 29-fold higher than the estimates obtained for female aged 0-9 and 1.1-fold higher than the estimates obtained for female aged 70-79, consistent with recent findings in Chile [30] . In comparison, a study conducted in China, reported much lower estimates of CFR for individuals >80 years of age (13.4%) [29] .\nAn upward trend in the crude CFR for overall population suggests the transmission may be spreading to more vulnerable populations.

However, since 72.4% of the economically active population works in informal jobs, which are concentrated in the poorest areas of the country, compliance with government mitigation strategies can be challenging despite the government's efforts to support the population [35] . Another factor possibly contributing to the upward trend in crude CFR may be an increase in unreported cases due to saturated testing capacity [27] . However, since Peru's testing capacity has substantially increased since the beginning of the outbreak, going from >0.01 test per 1000 population to 0.09 per 1000 in May 22 [15] , and the positivity rate is estimated at ~8.6% as of March 30, 2020, this seems an unlikely cause. Furthermore, the results show an increasing trend in crude CFR around day 45 (May 14 th , 2020), probably reflecting the exponential increase of cumulative cases around day 40 (May 9 th , 2020).\nThe downward trend in the adjusted CFR at the early stage may indicate the existence of a reporting delay and the shift of the outbreak to a less vulnerable segment of the population. In particular, the observed differences in estimates between the crude CFR and adjusted CFR can be attributed to the time-delay that is assumed fixed during the course of the epidemic.\n.

As higher mortality among male has been reported in China and the U.S. [34] , additional data on deaths stratified by gender provides the opportunity to examine the CFR by gender and age.\nOur study has at least two limitations. First, our estimates are probably overestimated, due to the effect of under reporting rates and ascertainment rates, as has been underscored in other studies [22, 24, 36] . But a recently enhanced testing capacity in Peru is expected to mitigate these effects, and an ongoing mass serological study will provide data to generate more accurate estimates of the death risk. Second, adjusted CFR, especially among seniors, has displayed fluctuations, highlighting the importance of focusing on sub-group analyses. Additional information such as line lists that include related risks including information on underlying diseases may help to identify subgroups with elevated risks.\n.

(Table 1 , Figure 1A , 1B). Data show a similar pattern for women. The majority of reported cases occur in females aged 20-69 years, and the majority of reported deaths occur among women aged 50 years or more.

In contrast, most deaths are reported among those aged 60-69 (30.2%), followed by women aged 70-79 (25.9%), and lastly, women aged 80 years and above (18.4%). Regarding CoVID-19 mortality per 100,000 population, seniors (individuals >70 years of age) were the most affected age group; mortality burden per 100,000 is 279.2 among men aged 80 years and above, and 207.6 among men aged 70-79 years.

Similarly, the proportion of male deaths is also higher than 50% except for those aged 10-19 years (\u03c7 2 test, p-value<0.001). Cumulative morbidity ratio by gender and age group is presented in Figure 1E , indicating that cumulative morbidity ratio among men is higher than women across all age groups (proportion test, p-value < 0.001) except for individuals aged 0-9 years (proportion test, p-value =0.85). Figure 1F illustrates the mortality per 100,000 population directly caused by CoVID-19 by gender and age group. Mortality is higher than among females aged 20 years and above (proportion test, p-value <0.05), and it is not significantly different among those aged 0-19 years. Figure 2 shows the cumulative cases and deaths of CoVID-19 by age group for males and females (A through J) over time. The figure suggests cumulative deaths increases after an increase in cumulative cases. The growth curve for overall cumulative cases (all age groups) for men and women appears to increase exponentially until around day 60 (April 29 th , 2020), while exponential growth in cumulative deaths overall (all age groups) for men and women appears to occur until around day 70 (May 9 th , 2020).\n.

Overall, our model based crude CFR fitted the observed data well, except for individuals aged 80 years and above, probably influenced by low reporting rate/ascertainment bias of cases at an early stage. Crude CFR for most of age groups increased at the early stage of the epidemic, peaked amidst the outbreak ~day 34 (April 3 rd , 2020) and followed a decreasing trend turning into an almost flat curve. Overall, our model-based posterior estimates for the time-delay adjusted CFR are substantially higher than the crude observed CFR. These estimates fluctuated at the early stage of the epidemic and then followed a decreasing trend.\nThe most recent estimates, as of May 25, 2020, of the time-delay adjusted CFR for men and women are 10.8% (95%CrI: 10.5-11.1%) and 6.5% (95%CrI: 6.2-6.8%), respectively, while overall national estimate is 9.1% (95%CrI: 8.9-9.3%) ( Figure 4 and .
