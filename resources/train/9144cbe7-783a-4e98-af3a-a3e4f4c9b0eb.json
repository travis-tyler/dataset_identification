[{"section_title": "January 2015", "text": "Online at https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/61198/ MPRA Paper No. 61198, posted 10 Jan 2015 08:08 UTC Success in extracting oil and natural gas from shale formations through horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has led to a wave of drilling in shale-rich states like Texas and Pennsylvania.\nDrilling in shale formations has varied consequences, creating jobs while also affecting residential property values and human health (Weber 2012; Hill 2013; Olmstead et al. 2013; Weber 2013; Brown 2014; Gopalakrishnan and Klaiber 2014) .\nSeveral recent studies look at the effect of shale gas development on residential housing values to estimate the cost of environmental and human health risks, real or perceived Gopalakrishnan and Klaiber 2014) . The value of residential properties primarily reflects the value of buildings. The value of properties like farms, in contrast, mostly reflects the value of undeveloped land. The link between shale development (or the potential for it) and land values remains unexplored aside from two studies that address it tangentially. Weber, Brown, and Pender (2013) found a positive correlation between farm real estate values and lease and royalty payments from oil, gas, or wind activities, while Borchers, Ifft, and Keuthe (2014) found a weak negative correlation between county-level oil production and farm-level pasture values.\nWe use self-reported farm real estate values from five Censuses of Agriculture (1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012) to estimate how natural gas development affected farm real estate values, which primarily consist of the value of undeveloped land. We focus on two regions that have had extensive shale development as of 2012: the Barnett Shale in Texas and the northeastern part of the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania. We use these data to inform several questions related to shale gas development.\nFirst, we use estimates of the effect of development on farm real estate values as an indication of the ubiquity of split estates -properties where the rights to oil and gas are owned by someone other than the land owner. As extracting natural gas from shale formations becomes profitable, the oil and gas rights appreciate. We expect shale development to cause greater land appreciation in areas with few split estates than in areas with many split estates. Split estates matter because they imply that the person bearing most of the disamenities from drilling -the person living on the surface near the well -is different than the person negotiating the leasing terms for drilling. It is also likely that the greater the frequency of split estates, the less royalty income captured by local residents.\nSecond, with our long panel data we can see how farm real estate values changed during the leasing and development periods. We expect farm real estate values to change over time. As natural gas is withdrawn, the subsurface rights grant access to fewer and fewer resources, causing properties with subsurface rights to gradually decline in value. A decline in value to below pre-development levels would indicate a long-term cost of having wells and related infrastructure on or near a property, assuming that farmers did not invest royalty income in land improvements. We note here that the effect of shale development on farm real estate values that we estimate is a medium to long-term net effect. Our data do not permit separating competing positive and negative effects of drilling, and with farms observed at five-year intervals, our estimates primarily reflect effects that persist for several years. As such the estimates are not comparable to studies that estimate the change in real estate values from shortly before to shortly after the drilling of a well.\nLastly, we leverage the data to see how drilling affects the suitability of land for a variety of uses. Residential values, which prior research has considered (e.g. Gopalakrishnan and Klaiber 2014; Muehlenbachs et al. 2013) , reveal how drilling affects a property's attractiveness for use as a residence. Properties with more land reveal how drilling affects their suitability for the nonresidential purposes that give it value. Properties with a house and barn and 100 acres, for example, are used as a residence but also for growing crops, raising livestock, and recreation.\nBecause of potential effects on local water quality, drilling may lower the value of land dedicated to livestock but not the value of cropland. Similarly, land used primarily for recreation may be more sensitive to the environmental, health, and landscape consequences of drilling.\nData limitations prevent us from clean and concrete conclusions. Our findings, nonetheless, provide greater understanding of all three topics and should help further research in this area. First, we find a small positive effect of shale development in both the Barnett (Texas) and the Marcellus (Pennsylvania) but the effect is much larger in the Marcellus, suggesting that split estates are far less common there. This conclusion is consistent with Fitzgerald (2014) who finds that local ownership of mineral rights is more than two times higher in Pennsylvania than in Texas. Regarding different effects for different properties, we find evidence that shale development caused real estate in residence farms -those with limited agricultural sales and whose owners have a primary occupation other than farming (not to be confused with \"small\" farms) -to appreciate more than real estate in nonresidence farms. This finding holds for both regions. Weaker evidence suggests that livestock farm real estate appreciated less or even lost value. Both findings potentially reflect a correlation between farm type and the presence of oil and gas rights -a possibility that underscores the value of information on oil and gas right ownership when studying the effect of shale energy development on property values."}, {"section_title": "Shale Gas Development and Land Values: The Perils Facing the Researcher", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Limited Data", "text": "Property sales data with detailed land characteristics, including whether the subsurface rights were conveyed in the sale, would provide a firm foundation to quantify how shale gas development affects the value of oil and gas rights and surface rights. Standard sales data, however, typically lacks information about the conveyance of oil and gas rights. They also only include properties sold, and if the researcher wants to control for time-invariant unobservable characteristics, she must further limit her study to properties sold twice during the study period. This is less of a challenge when considering residential properties with little land because they are so numerous. The same is not true of properties consisting primarily of land, which are fewer and only a small fraction of them are sold in a given year. Many are only sold once in a lifetime, let alone twice in a researcher's study period. The problem may be exacerbated by oil and gas development if development slows land market turnover.\nA researcher using survey data asking property owners for market values may avoid the small sample pitfall of sales data but may stumble into others. Surveys -such as the Census of Agriculture, which we use -may provide panel data on more proprieties in a given area.\nHowever, unless the data was collected with subsurface issues in mind, the questionnaire probably did not ask landowners if they own the oil and gas rights to their land, and the Census of Agriculture is no exception. Even if landowners own the rights, they may not report them in the market value of their land if the questionnaire lacks explicit instructions."}, {"section_title": "Heterogeneous Effects", "text": "Oil and gas rights aside, shale development may have different effects on different types of land.\nThis increases the researcher's data needs to include the characteristics associated with the distinct effects. Pope and Goodwin (1984) argued that rural land has value because of its agricultural productivity but also because it can be enjoyed for its own sake -what the authors label as a consumptive component of value. We might expect the value of land whose demand comes primarily from people who want to escape city life and enjoy the outdoors to be more sensitive to the disamenities of drilling. If instead the land is used for growing crops, drilling should matter less as long as it does not affect yields. We may also expect heterogeneous effects for different types of agricultural land. Beef cattle and dairy cows require quality water. If drilling through the water table muddies a spring used to water cows, it may reduce the value of the property for use as a livestock farm. For crop farms, muddy spring water may not affect productivity, especially if irrigation is not used."}, {"section_title": "A Moving Target", "text": "The effect of a property being located over a shale formation will change with time, making it hard to interpret estimates. Suppose that during the initial leasing period the land inside of a formation appreciates more than land just outside the formation, but the price differential declines as development matures. The natural resource economist might say the finding reflects the decline in the resource stock; the environmental economist points to it as evidence of environmental disamenities. Both could be true.\nWe expect the difference in land values across shale and nonshale areas to vary over time for at least three reasons. First, to the extent that subsurface rights are incorporated in land values, changes in the quantity or price of the oil or gas in the ground will cause changes in land values. Second -and perhaps most important in the short term -drilling reveals information about the energy richness of an area. Wells drilled in some parts of all the major U.S. shale formations have yielded disappointing results. After acquiring 84,000 acres in the Utica Shale in 2012, BP America saw disappointing results from test wells and decided to abandon development and sell the acreage in 2014 (Seeley 2014) . As wells generate knowledge, investment (and therefore production, royalties, and the value of subsurface rights) dries up in one area and flows to another. Third, disamenities change over time. Initially wells are drilled, creating noise and truck traffic, both of which subside as drilling slows. In time, however, other disamenities may emerge as the well cement cracks and allows gas or liquids to migrate underground. Since we are able to track land values only at 5-year intervals over time, our estimates of the net effect of shale development on land values will reflect primarily longer-term disamenities, as we are unable to capture any short-term disamenities."}, {"section_title": "What We Hope to Learn from Self-Reported Market Values", "text": "Despite the perils presented, self-reported land value data can be creatively leveraged to inform four questions."}, {"section_title": "Do self-reported land values incorporate subsurface rights at all?", "text": "For an answer, we look at two regions and see if shale development's effect on land values is larger in the one with fewer split estates (Pennsylvania) than the one with more split estates (Texas). Fitzgerald (2014) shows a local mineral ownership rate of 66 percent for Pennsylvania, which he measured by the percent of leases where the mineral lessor was a resident of the county of the lease. In Texas, on the other hand, only 28 percent of minerals were locally owned. While nonlocal ownership is not equivalent to split estates, the two should be highly correlated, since split estates occur when someone who owns and potentially lives on a parcel sells oil and gas rights to someone who does not live there. Alternatively, a split can happen when a property owner moves and sells a property but retains the oil and gas rights.\nOil and gas rights in shale areas acquired substantial value as it became clear that shale gas could be profitably extracted. If the increase in the value of rights does not cause greater land appreciation in Pennsylvania than in Texas, then it suggests that land owners typically do not include the value of their oil and gas rights in their self-reported land values.\nWe find evidence that to some extent, farmers include their oil and gas rights in the self-reported value of their farm real estate. For the Barnett Shale, where split estates are more common, natural gas development had a small positive effect on farm real estate values over time (Table   2 ). This is evidenced by the coefficients on the Shale x Y t interaction terms. In the northeastern part of the Marcellus Shale, where split estates are less common, we find much greater appreciation in the Pennsylvania counties, which experienced intense leasing and drilling, In addition to statistics presented in Fitzgerald (2014) we provide further evidence that split estates are common in Texas. In Texas, oil and gas rights are treated as real property like land and houses. Once an oil or gas well begins producing, the rights associated with it are assessed a value annually, upon which the owner pays local property taxes. 1 Weber, Burnett, and Xiarchos (2014) show how the oil and gas property tax base increased by more than $80,000 per student in Barnett Shale school districts relative to districts just outside of the shale. The Census of Agriculture collects information on all property taxes paid by farmers. If they commonly own their oil and gas rights, we should see an increase in property taxes paid per acre owned in shale areas relative to nonshale areas. It is possible that school districts and local governments in the shale area lowered property tax rates as the tax base expanded, causing the total tax collections to return to pre-drilling levels. It is unlikely, however, that this would have occurred before an initial tax revenue windfall, which we should observe in our data in the form of greater tax payments at some point.\nThe fixed effects model with the log of property taxes paid per acre owned as the dependent variable provides little evidence that farmers in the Barnett Shale area began paying more taxes compared to those outside the shale as development matured (Table 2) . If oil and gas right ownership were common among farmers there, we would expect tax payments to increase precipitously during peak drilling, since taxes are only assessed once production begins. Yet the coefficient on the Shale x Y t interaction actually decreases from 2002 to 2007 when drilling and production increased substantially.\nA similar analysis for the Marcellus is not indicative of the ubiquity of split estates because oil and gas rights are not taxed in Pennsylvania. 2 Indeed, we find that property taxes paid by farms on the Pennsylvania side changed little over time relative to properties on the New York side. This finding also gives us confidence that the differential appreciation in Pennsylvania and New York did not stem from systematic changes in property tax rates or assessments."}, {"section_title": "How does the net effect of development change during the leasing and drilling periods?", "text": "For both regions, our data covers the period when most leasing occurred and the period when drilling boomed. In Texas the data also include the period of declining drilling. As long as the number of split estates did not change substantially, changes in land values will reflect the net effect of drilling over time.\nThe second question our empirics inform is how the effect of shale gas development changes over the leasing and drilling stages of development. For farms in both the Barnett and Marcellus (Wilber 2012, p. 48) . In spite of property owners in the three New York counties likely owning oil and gas rights in the Marcellus Shale similar to their counterparts across the state line, less leasing on the New York side as of 2007 caused landowners there to place a low value on their oil and gas rights. This suggests that land owners were conservative in reporting of land values and did not assign much value to their oil and gas rights without lease offers in hand."}, {"section_title": "How common are split estates?", "text": "Quantile regressions permit estimating different effects of shale development based on whether a property appreciated more or less than what we would predict given its observed characteristics.\nBecause we do not control for oil and gas right ownership, properties with the rights should have larger residuals because they should have appreciated more than other properties with similar observed characteristics but without the rights. In areas where most estates are split, we expect appreciation to be confined to the upper quartiles. We also note, however, that only observing appreciation in the upper quartiles could reflect unobserved differences in resource richness within shale areas. Not all properties within a shale area will be profitable to drill. Such properties will not appreciate much, even if the surface owner has the oil and gas rights.\nThe property tax data suggest that split estates are common in the Barnett. Using quantile regressions we provide further evidence that split estates are more common in the Barnett Shale than the northeastern part of the Marcellus Shale, though there may be other reasons why the effect of shale development is different for the two regions. Equation (4) does not control for whether a property has the oil and gas rights attached to it. Initially, these rights would have been almost worthless but would then gain tremendous value as technology and prices evolved to make drilling in shale profitable. The changing value of these rights are embedded in the residual because they vary across properties in the shale area. Using the specification in (5) "}, {"section_title": "How has shale gas development affected the value of rural residence and livestock properties relative to other properties?", "text": "Land derives value from what it produces, with more productive land being more valuable. Shale gas development may affect land values by affecting land productivity. Suppose that the technology f is applied to land to produce y. If land is paid a rent that equals its marginal value product, then the difference in rental rates for land in shale and nonshale areas will be given by\nIf the price of land is the discounted value (at rate r) of an infinite stream of rent payments, then\n(1) can be written as\nEquation (2) shows how the effect of shale gas development on the price of land reflects changes in land productivity:\nDifferent types of land presumably have been put to their most productive uses -to grow crops, pasture livestock, or provide recreation. The output used to measure productivity may therefore be a consumptive good such as a place to enjoy the outdoors or a traditional output such as corn. We hypothesize that compared to agriculturally-intensive farms, farms used mainly as a residence property will appreciate less from development because their value depends more on producing environmental or aesthetic goods, which drilling potentially degrades. After all, many people buy a country property to enjoy fresh air and a bucolic landscape. Under this hypothesis, the productivity of land in a residence farms (subscript res) decreases more than that of land in production agriculture (subscript ag):\nSimilarly, we expect farms engaged primarily in raising livestock to value clean water more than other farms because they would suffer greater losses if drilling contaminated the farm's water source. Bamberger and Oswald (2012) , for example, document cases where waste water leakage from drilling and other drilling-related factors affected livestock health in drilling areas.\nIf the frequency of split estates is not correlated with agricultural decisions, estimating separate effects for different types of properties should provide credible information about the heterogeneous effects of shale development on the productivity of land in different uses.\nAs mentioned previously, the value of real estate in livestock farms and residence farms may be more sensitive to the disamenities from shale development. We define a livestock farm as one reporting more than 75 percent of sales from livestock, with a minimum of $10,000 in livestock sales. The USDA has traditionally used a farm typology that groups farms into Residence, Intermediate, and Commercial farms. Following this typology, we define a residence farm as any farm with less than $250,000 in agricultural sales and whose principal operator does not identify farming as their primary occupation and lived on the farm at least once in the census year. 4 The classification of a residence farm does not depend on acreage, so it should not be confused as a term for small farms. Large farms with little agricultural production can be termed residence farm, while productive small farms would not. We then estimate a modified version of Equation (5) augmented with a dummy variable indicating a livestock or residence farm and its interaction with the shale dummy variable:\nAs in Equation (5), this is a cross-sectional analysis focusing on the difference in the log value per acre before and after the leasing period. For the Barnett, t equals 2002 and t-1 equals 1997; for the Marcellus t equals 2007 and t-1 equals 2002. We estimate equations (6.1) and (6.2) separately instead of as a single equation including indicator variables for shale, livestock, residence, and their interactions, since we are limited in sample size to farms in both censuses in question for each study area. Including all interactions at once would result in just a few farms identifying the shale effect for residence livestock farms, for example.\nThe point estimate of the effect of being in the shale was less for livestock farms than for other farms in both the Barnett and Marcellus Shale samples (Table 4 ). In the Barnett, the shale effect was negative for livestock properties; for the Marcellus, the effect was positive but smaller for livestock farms than nonlivestock farms. In both cases, however, the point estimates are statistically insignificant. Less appreciation (or depreciation) over the leasing period for properties used to raise livestock instead of grow crops may indicate that livestock farmers are less likely to own their oil and gas rights. Alternatively, farmers may perceive that drilling poses a risk to the farm's water, lowering its value as a livestock farm.\nFor both the Barnett and Marcellus Shale samples we also find that the effect of being in the shale was larger for residence farms than for other farms. The point estimate of the coefficient on the Shale x Residence interaction is similar in both cases (0.43 and 0.45), though less precise in the Barnett sample (standard error of 0.28 compared to 0.20). The finding is the opposite of our prediction that the value of residence farms would be more sensitive to the disamenities for drilling (or expected drilling). As with nonlivestock farms, residence farms may be more likely to own their oil and gas rights. Perhaps prior interest in oil or gas development and therefore splitting of estates, focused on larger tracts of accessible land which is where larger farms tend to be located. Alternatively, farmers are potentially less able than residence landowners to move away in the event land or water are accidentally contaminated, which may make the former less willing to sign leases. estimates based on reported data will be too. To the extent that the frequency with which farmers own their oil and gas rights varies by region -and our findings suggest that it does -differences in land values across space may also be biased."}, {"section_title": "Study Regions, Periods, and Data", "text": "We assess the effects of shale gas development on farm real estate values in the Barnett Shale in While no wells were drilled in NY, the comparison of northeastern PA to the NY border counties is of a different nature than inside and outside the Barnett shale in TX, since southwestern NY is still within the Marcellus shale and drilling may occur in the future. To the extent that landowners in NY have incorporated an expectation of future shale development into their self-assessed land values, we would be underestimating the impact of shale development on land values. We can interpret our estimates as serving a lower bound of the potential shale development impact.\nSince our variables of interest are land value and property tax payments, we are not particularly concerned about spillover effects, which would be more of an issue in an analysis of shale development impacts on the labor market or residential housing market. Demand for temporary housing from shale workers would boost the sale or rental price of apartments and single family homes outside the Barnett shale area or on the NY side of the border, but this should have little effect on the demand for multiple-acre farms."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "We use farm-level data from the Censuses of Agriculture conducted in 1992, 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012 . In the Census the National Agricultural Statistics Service attempts to collect basic information on all farms in the U.S. Because of the broad USDA definition of a farm -a place that has sold or has the potential to have $1,000 in agricultural sales in a year -many places enumerated as a farm have little or no agricultural production and in most cases are best described as rural residence properties. Consequently, the properties covered in the Census of Our variable of interest is the self-reported market value of the land and buildings owned by the farm divided by the total acres owned. We employ other variables collected through the Census, including the farm's sales by commodity type and whether the farm operator lives on the farm. Because of undercoverage and nonresponse in the Census of Agriculture, all farms have a statistical weight indicating how many farm it represents in the population. We use this weight in our empirics. "}, {"section_title": "How has shale gas development affected land values in southwestern Pennsylvania", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusion -What We Have and Have Not Learned from Land Values", "text": "Appreciation occurs during the land leasing period, not when most drilling happens. The little to no additional appreciation in the drilling period may reflect several competing forces. On one hand, investment of royalty income in improvements to land or buildings, greater local public revenues and overall greater demand for land should cause appreciation during the peak drilling phase. On the other hand, other factors could cause depreciation: well productivity can decline exponentially shortly after being drilled and drilling can produce environmental disamenities and affect the land's suitability for the uses that give it value.\nThe nature of our data means that we can estimate only the long-term net effect of shale development on land values. We do not know if specific channels are at work and, if so, how much they contribute to appreciation or depreciation. Isolating the importance of various channels would provide a richer description of the effects of development. Land values will continue to be interesting to track in coming years as they will reveal how the combined effect of the above mentioned causal channels evolve as shale development matures. Our last year of analysis, 2012, was near the Barnett's peak; production continued to grow after 2012 in the Marcellus.\nThe effect of development on property values appears to vary by property type, though our samples are too small to provide rigorous and fine-grained breakouts. For both the Barnett and the Marcellus we find that residence farm properties appreciated more as land was leased. In contrast, for both regions point estimates suggest that livestock farms appreciated less than other farms in the shale, though the difference was not statistically significant in either case. This is an area fertile for research and one where regional differences will matter. Water scarcity in the west may reduce the value of farms dependent on ground or surface water for growing crops or raising livestock. In the east, water quality may matter more and mostly for livestock farms since most crops are rain-fed.\nIn all of the questions raised, a continued empirical challenge is the lack of data on oil and gas right ownership. It remains a glaring omitted variable in any study of property values and oil and gas development. This is true for self-reported data or sales data. For self-reported data it is necessary to know if oil and gas rights are present and if they are included in the reported land value; for sales data, it is important to know if they were initially present and, if so, if they were conveyed to the buyer. Our empirics provide indirect evidence that the frequency of split estates is more common in the Barnett Shale than in the northeastern part of the Marcellus Shale. Ownership may also be correlated with characteristics of the property that make it more or less valuable, such as accessibility and distance to urban centers. Ownership data would therefore aid in identifying environmental disamenities from drilling apart from changes in oil and gas right ownership or valuation. Note: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.
