[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "A novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) causes acute respiratory disease (Coronavirus disease 2019; , which was initially found in China but now it is spread all over the world (Guo et al., 2020) . The total number of COVID-19 cases diagnosed so far exceeds 2.7 million worldwide as on 24 th April, 2020 with the number almost reaching 24,700 in India While the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% identical to a BatCoV RaTG13, it shares with 79.5% similarity to SARS-CoV. Based on this virus genome sequence analysis and evolutionary analysis, bat has been suspected to be the natural host of the virus origin.\nSince bats are not available at seafood markets of Wuhan, it is suspected that virus spread might have occurred through alternative intermediate hosts like turtles, and snakes (Guo et al., 2020) .\nSince then, a total of 10,478 viral isolates have been sequenced and deposited online (https://www.gisaid.org/). Genome sequence analysis of viral genome between countries would help to understand the origin and also the severity of the disease process itself. There are only two reports of sequencing of very few numbers of Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (Yadav et al., 2020; Sardar et al., 2020) . The diagnosis of COVID-19 is largely overseen by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Government of India with diagnosis being carried out using commercial diagnostic kits in ICMR approved government and private facilities (https://www.icmr.nic.in/)."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "To identify the origin of Indian isolates of SAR-CoV-2 virus, we examined the phylogenetic data from Database Features of Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID; https://www.gisaid.org/). Although the sequence information is available from 11,919 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from all continents, the phylogenetic data from 3123 samples, which included 4 Indian isolates, is only available at GISAID website because of limitation with respect to single view performance and legibility reasons (Figure 1; Supplementary   figure 1 ). It is of our interest to note that there are two major clusters-Asian cluster represented by purple and related colours and European cluster represented by greenish yellow. The Indian samples, represented by arrows (black and white) cluster with both Asian cluster and European clusters. It is interesting to note that while the Indian samples with black arrows were isolated during January 2020, the other two samples with white arrows were isolated during March 2020 (see more details later).\nFurther to precisely map the origin of Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates, we carried out an independent phylogenetic analysis using a selected set of samples representing most regions and countries where COVID-19 infection rate is high. Our selection criteria also considered the fact that more genomes are sequenced in USA, Europe, East Asia and Oceania compared to other parts of the world. Hence, we chose a set of 449 samples derived from USA (75), Europe (80), China (75), East Asia (64), South Asia (41), Oceania (75), Middle East (11) and\nIndia (28). The analysis shows interesting features about the possible source of Indian SARS-CoV-2 samples (Figure 2; Supplementary figure 2 ). In particular, the Indian samples are .

(Yadav et al., 2020) .\nThe date of sample collection probably coincides with the time of disease occurrence.\nThe collection dates of different Indian samples provide some hint at the origin and spread of virus. The first two Indian viral isolates that were detected during January 2020 from patients who travelled from Wuhan, China showed more similarity with China/East Asia viral isolates.\nThis conclusion is well supported by the fact that the initial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 virus in Wuhan happened during December 2019 (Zhou et al., 2020) . The remaining twenty-six Indian viral isolates, which were collected during March 2020, show more similarity with samples from Europe, Middle East, South Asia and Oceania regions. The one month delay in the occurrence of majority of Indian COVID-19 cases probably indicate the time taken for the virus .

Similarly, other two samples (EPI-ISL_413522 and EPI_ISL_413523) (collected from patients who had travel history from Wuhan, China) that grouped with samples from China were also identified to be associated with the major Asian cluster in Figure 1 . Thus, the results of our independent phylogenetic analysis (as per Figure 2 ) are matching to that of analysis done by GISAID thus increasing the confidence in our findings.\nAccording to specific variations in different viral proteins, GISAID identified three clades of SARS-CoV-2 namely G, V and S (Elbe and Bucklan-Merrett, 2017) . G clade is characterized by D614G in S protein and largely encompasses sequences from Europe. V clade is characterized by G251V in ORF3 and mostly includes Asian and European sequences. S clade is characterized by the presence of L84S in ORF8 and mostly comprises sequences from North America. Recently, a new clade of SARS-CoV-2 carrying V378I in ORF1ab has been linked to travellers returning from Iran to Australia (Eden et al., 2020) . We then investigated the genomes of Indian SARS-CoV-2 viruses to find out the association between Indian samples and different clades. This analysis revealed several interesting facts (Figure 3) . We found Indian samples does not belong to either clade V or S except the sample EPI-ISL_413522, which is one of samples derived from patient with recent travel history from Wuhan. The other Indian sample (EPI_ISL_413523) who also had travel history from Wuhan does not seem to belong to any of these clades suggesting that this virus may be more similar to original Wuhan-China virus. However, the origin of these two viral isolates needs to more investigation. Most Indian samples are found to classify between G and I clades. One set of thirteen Indian samples . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 29, 2020. . https://doi.org/10. 1101 (n=13) that belong to the cluster B, which is enriched with European samples as per figure 2, segregate into G clade as they carry D614G mutation in S gene. Another set of thirteen Indian samples (n=13) that belong to the cluster A, which are enriched with Oceania samples as per figure 2, segregate into I clade as they carry V378I mutation in ORF1ab gene. We have also extended our viral clade analysis to recently submitted Indian samples (n=9) from the state of Karnataka. Due to the fact that these samples are low coverage samples, they could not be included in phylogenetic analysis. However, clade analysis revealed three samples from this Karnataka set belongs to G clade, while the status of other samples could not be clearly established (Supplementary figure 3) . We conclude from this analysis that Indian samples are divided between I and G clades. Thus, these results provide additional confirmation to our earlier findings (as per figure 2) that while one set of Indian samples in cluster A is more similar to Oceania samples, the other set of Indian samples in cluster B is more similar to European samples.\nOur finding that Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates belong to different clades may have important consequences with respect to virus transmission rate and virulence, extend of the disease severity and various other aspects of disease pathogenesis. It has been reported that viruses belonging to different clades may differ in their virulence (Brusky, 2020) . For example, the G clade viruses carry glycine (G) corresponding to the codon 614 of S protein instead of aspartic acid (D) in other clades. Phylogenetic analysis identified that D614G mutation is originated from ancestral D residue seen in the reference Wuhan virus (Wu et al., 2020) . This residue is located very close to glycosylation region of the viral spike protein encoded by S gene (Anderson et al., 2020) . It has been proposed that mutations in and around glycosylation region may alter viral spike protein structure and hence the membrane fusion process resulting in varied pathogenicity and transmissibility. Further, the difference in the death rate of COVID-19 patients of East Coast Vs. West Coast of USA is implicated to their difference in their G .

There are also many reports that mutations in spike protein of other Coronaviruses alter the virulence (Krueger et al., 2001; Geoghegan and Holmes, 2018; Ontiveros et al., 2003) .\nThe presence of multiple clades of SARS-CoV-2 strains in a population may also have serious implications in the accuracy of diagnostic tests that are being employed worldwide.\nThe diagnostic tests based on detection of antibody or quantifying the viral RNA genome does not appear to distinguish these variations. Consequently, it is important to develop diagnostic kits based on the type(s) of clades prevalent in an area. Indeed, it is reported that the serology based rapid tests are ineffective in detecting COIVD-19 positive cases in India and elsewhere in the world. The variation created by the presence of different viral clades in a population also needs to be considered seriously in developing vaccines. It has been also proposed that relaxation models of social distancing should consider the presence of one or more types of viral clades (Brusky, 2020).\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 29, 2020 . . https://doi.org/10.1101 highlights the power of rapid viral genome sequencing and public data sharing to improve the detection and management of pandemic diseases such as COVID-19. It is important to point out that most countries in America, Europe, Oceania and East Asia were quick in supporting the advanced scientific studies on the virus and disease process itself to develop treatment modalities and preventive vaccines. Needless to say that major countries from emerging economies such as Brazil and India should support experimental research on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\nCertainly, our analysis has clear limitations, the most important one being that we were able to analyse only a small number of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes while the number of COVID-19 cases increased beyond 20,000. Further, lack of travel history of the patients is another lacuna which makes the conclusions not conclusive. Hence, it is required that more number of Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 needs to be sequenced to confirm these results.\nNevertheless, our study highlights the need for large-scale community surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 introductions and the spread. More importantly, this work underscores the power of pathogen genomics to identify epidemiological understanding of the virus and the disease.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted April 29, 2020. . https://doi.org/10. 1101 genomes with low coverage was used only for clade analysis.

The probable source of Indian SARS-CoV-2 viruses is countries from Europe and Oceania regions besides Middle East and South Asian regions. The possible spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to India through Middle East countries from Europe and Oceania regions cannot be ruled out. Both A and B clusters contain samples from Middle East countries. In addition, these samples appear to split between I and G clades (Supplementary figure 3) . In the absence of the information related to travel/contact history of Indian patients, more inference and definite conclusions on the possible origin and source could not be made at present.
