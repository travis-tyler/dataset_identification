In this paper, we present a statistical and analytical portrait of living conditions among children in immigrant families in Germany.\nAs in many countries, there is a shortage of data suitable for the study of immigration issues. Unfortunately, the data problems are acute in Germany. By highlighting these problems, this paper represents an advocacy tool for the collection of better data so that important research questions about immigration may be addressed and the difficulties facing immigrant groups might be more readily resolved.\nWe first supply a brief historical perspective on immigration in Germany. We describe the major demographic characteristics of immigrant groups, especially children and families, based on the most recent data available nationwide. We sketch out the legal and conceptual framework governing the process of naturalization for immigrants and children in immigrant families. In the literature review, we combine analysis of data and the recent literature on immigration in Germany to examine the social and economic well-being of children in immigrant families and the social environment in which these children develop and grow, including the education system, health care and the labour market."}, {"section_title": "RECENT PATTERNS IN IMMIGRATION", "text": "Already more than 2,000 years ago, Celts, Romans and Slavs were settling among the Germans. Germany's status as a country of settlement is also apparent today. Since the end of World War II, immigration has been a decisive component in the development of the population of the country.\nIn 1950, there were only about 500,000 foreigners living in the Federal Republic of Germany. This represented about 1 per cent of the total population of the country. Later immigrants came in several waves. From 1955 From to 1973 , the number of resident foreigners rose to about 4 million following the recruitment of foreign workers, who were known as guest workers (Gastarbeiter). The largest immigrant group, persons of Turkish origin have been arriving steadily since this period. Smaller, but still important immigrant groups recruited initially as guest workers include persons of Italian origin, who represent the oldest immigration flow into the country, as well as persons of Greek, Moroccan, Portuguese, Spanish and Tunisian origin and people from the former Republic of Yugoslavia.\nAfter 1973 and up to about 1985, most immigration occurred through family reunification (Familiennachzug) as spouses and foreign-born children joined foreigners already living in Germany. In 1985, 4.4 million foreigners were living in the Federal Republic.\nWhen the Cold War ended in the late 1980s, two new waves of immigration began: asylum seekers and ethnic German repatriates. There were 57,000 asylum applications in 1987. The next year, the number jumped, and, by 1992, it had reached 438,000. In 1998, after the asylum law was amended, the number subsided to well below 100,000 applications.\nMeanwhile, between 1945 and 1990, 15 million refugees -German expellees from other countries and ethnic Germans whose forebears had migrated elsewhere, sometimes centuries earlier -arrived in Germany seeking resettlement (Heckmann 1995 ). An average 36,000 repatriates of German ancestry were resettled in the Federal Republic from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union each year from 1950 to 1984 . In 1987 -1988 , this new wave of immigration began to swell. In 1988, the number of ethnic Germans moving to Germany rose to 203,000, and, in 1990 , it was nearly 400,000. From 1987 to 1999, Germany took in a total of 2.7 million ethnic German repatriates from the territory of the former Soviet Union. In 2000, the annual figures began sinking below 100,000; they have now returned to the levels of the early 1980s.\nThe immigration of ethnic Germans from the former Soviet Union demonstrates that statistics on foreigners living in Germany do not provide a full picture of the phenomenon of immigration in the country. This is why the term \u2017persons of migrant origin' is gaining currency. It may refer to foreign nationals, but it may also refer to German citizens who are immigrants (repatriates or naturalized foreigners) and to their children born in Germany.\nThe number of persons of migrant origin is still increasing because of family unification and marriage. It is safe to assume that, including German repatriates, nearly one person in five living in Germany today is a person of migrant origin."}, {"section_title": "SIZE AND ORIGIN OF THE POPULATION OF CHILDREN IN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES", "text": "In Germany, immigration clearly accounts for a significant share of the population. In 2005, there were around 15.3 million people of migrant origin (Table 1) . This represented 18.6 per cent of the total population (82.4 million). Most people of migrant origin are living in the western part of the country, which corresponds to the 10 old L\u00e4nder (states) of the Federal Republic of Germany before reunification, on 3 October 1990 (Table 1) . Only a small share is living in the eastern L\u00e4nder. In Saxony in eastern Germany, for example, the share of foreign residents is only about 2 per cent, and, in Thuringia, foreign residents represent only 1 per cent of the population.\nMeanwhile, in western Germany, the shares are 12 per cent in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, 13 per cent in North Rhine-Westphalia, 14 per cent in Hesse, 15 per cent in Bremen, 16 per cent in Berlin and 17 per cent in Hamburg.\nThe shares of men and women and of foreign and German citizens in the population are indicated in Table 2 . Among the foreigners in 2005, 48.3 per cent were women and 51.7 per cent were men. This is almost the reverse of the shares of women and men in the population of German citizens and the entire population. Around 10.4 million individuals now living in the country arrived in Germany through a personal immigration experience (Table 3) . Among these are 5.6 million foreigners, 3.1 million naturalized Germans, and 1.7 million individuals who, through immigration, acquired German citizenship without following the discretionary naturalization procedure (shown as ethnic German repatriates in the table). This last group includes, for example, many ethnic German repatriates who arrived from Poland or the countries of the former Soviet Union and who acquired naturalization on demand by entitlement. Another 4.7 million individuals have been born in the country, but have nonetheless been affected directly by immigration because of their citizenship or because of the migrant origin of at least one of their parents. These include 2.6 million German nationals with at least one parent who is an ethnic German repatriate, a naturalized German, or a foreign resident, 0.4 million naturalized Germans and 1.7 million foreign residents (shown as foreign residents under the German birth column in the table).\nAt the end of 2006, there were 6.7 million foreigners living in Germany who were registered in the central register of foreigners (Ausl\u00e4nderzentralregister) ( Table 4) . Although this source gives data that are slightly different from the population estimates of the Federal Statistical Office shown in Tables 1-3 , the data indicate that about a third of the foreigners are citizens of member countries in the European Union (EU), and around two thirds are citizens of other countries. Because recent immigration to Germany began in earnest in the 1960s, many families in immigrant groups, especially the groups involved in earlier immigration flows, have become well settled in Germany. For this reason, within these groups, the number of children 0 to 17 years of age born in Germany is much larger than the number of such children born outside Germany. In terms of the sociological taxonomy of immigrant generations, the second generation (85 per cent of the age group within the population of migrant origin), that is, the generation of children born in Germany to at least one parent born abroad, is larger than the first and third generations, that is, respectively, the generation of children born abroad to immigrant families and the generation of children born in Germany to parents of migrant origin born in Germany. Today, relatively few children 0 to 17 are first-generation immigrants. The largest group among first-generation children of migrant origin is the group from the Russian Federation. Among certain immigrant groups, such as persons of Italian or Turkish origin, a significant third generation of children 0 to 17 has been socialized and reached adulthood entirely in Germany.\nLike most other societies in Europe, German society is ageing because of advances in health care and nutrition and the pronounced reduction in the birth rate associated with economic well-being. Marriage rates have declined along with the birth rate, and growing shares of women are remaining childless. For several years, the fertility rate has stood at around 1.4 children per woman.\nAmong the foreign population, there are around 1 million children 0-17 years of age, 3.1 million people between 18 and 40, 1.8 million between 41 and 60 and 0.8 million older than 60. There are nearly 6 million people of migrant origin under the age of 25. Relative to the rest of the population, the age structure among people of migrant origin is shifted considerably towards younger age groups. Of all persons of migrant origin, 29.3 per cent are in the 0-20 age group. The corresponding share among the rest of the population, 17 per cent, is plainly lower. The microcensus data indicate that nearly 60 per cent of all children 0 to 17 of migrant origin are in the 0-9 age group; 26 per cent are 10 to 14 years of age, and 14 per cent are 15 to 17 years old. Meanwhile, the corresponding shares among persons without a migrant origin are more balanced, at 49.8 per cent for the 0-9 age group and 50.2 per cent for the 10-17 age group.\nAccording to the data, 58 per cent of all children 0-17 years of age in immigrant families have German citizenship. Only 8 per cent are naturalized German citizens. The share of children in Germany who are living with parents who are recent immigrants is quite large. Among the parents of children of migrant origin, 26 per cent are mixed, that is, one parent is a German citizen, and one is not."}, {"section_title": "CURRENT NATURALIZATION AND CITIZENSHIP POLICY", "text": "From 1995 to 2004, 1,278,524 foreigners obtained German citizenship by naturalization (Table 5 ). This means that about 1.5 per cent of the German population was naturalized during this period. The amended Nationality Act (Staatsangeh\u00f6rigkeitsgesetz) of 1 January 2000 and the Immigration Act (Zuwanderungsgesetz) of 1 January 2005 revised German law on naturalization and citizenship. Originally based on ius sanguinis, the right (ius) to citizenship conferred by a blood relationship (sanguinis) to a citizen, the law now also includes provision for the application of ius soli, the right of citizenship based on birth within the national territory (soli). Thus, an individual may acquire German citizenship if one of the parents is a German citizen, irrespective of the individual's place of birth, but also, under certain circumstances, if the individual has been born in Germany to parents who are both foreign citizens. Though it would have been undertaken in any case, the reform well reflects the reality that more than 7 million foreigners are now living in Germany, half for at least 20 years, and one third for more than 30 years. The revised law makes it somewhat easier for foreigners resident in Germany on a long-term basis to acquire German citizenship, but especially their children born in Germany. Mandatory waiting periods before an individual may apply for naturalization have also been reduced.\nAn individual born to a mixed couple is usually a German citizen on that basis (ius sanguinis) even if the individual is born outside Germany and the parent who is a German citizen has been naturalized. However, in future, individuals born outside Germany to a German parent who was born outside Germany will need to be registered as a German citizen within 12 months of birth.\nBirth in Germany generally does not automatically confer German citizenship if neither parent is German. However, children born to non-German parents on or after 1 January 2000 acquire German citizenship at birth if at least one parent has been entitled to residence or possessed a permanent residence permit for at least three years and has been lawfully residing in Germany for at least eight years. Because Germany allows dual citizenship only in certain cases (though there is flexibility on this issue), such children who may have also acquired the foreign citizenship of parents are obliged formally to apply successfully for German citizenship after they reach the age of 18 and before they reach the age of 23. They will normally also be required to prove at the time of application that they have already submitted an application for denaturalization with respect to any other citizenship they may possess.\nGerman citizenship may be acquired through naturalization by an individual with a permanent residence permit who has lived in the country for eight years. The individual must have mastered German and demonstrated the means to a livelihood without resorting to the welfare system. Applicants are normally expected to show they have renounced or become ineligible for any other citizenship they may have possessed. Some discretion is allowed on this issue. For instance, an applicant who is a refugee may not be able to give up the other nationality, and thus the rule might be waived in this case. There is also an exception for citizens of EU member states that do not require Germans to renounce their citizenship upon naturalization. The residence requirements may also be otherwise reduced or waived. Thus, the spouse of a German citizen may be naturalized after three years of residence if the couple has been married for at least two years.\nThe right of people in selected groups to German citizenship has been recognized in the German constitution, the Basic Law (Grundgesetz). Thus, German repatriates who have returned to Germany since 1993 from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union may claim automatic German citizenship if these ethnic Germans are expellees from other countries or had forebears who emigrated from Germany. Likewise, persons who lost their German citizenship between 30 January 1933 and 8 May 1945 by individual decree or through the application of directives under the Reich Citizenship Law (Reichsb\u00fcrgergesetz) that deprived Germans of Jewish faith living outside Germany of their nationality are entitled to renaturalization. Descendants of these persons are also entitled to renaturalization if they would have acquired German nationality by birth had their parents or grandparents (or more remote ancestors) not been deprived of German citizenship. In these cases, the residence requirements and obligation to renounce a foreign citizenship are waived.\nThe rules governing naturalization and citizenship are complicated, and there are many other exceptions and conditions. Nonetheless, because of the reforms, a substantial share of the foreign population in Germany now has the opportunity to participate in and help shape social and political issues by exercising their inherent rights and obligations as German citizens."}, {"section_title": "5.", "text": "DATA Studies on issues involving children in immigrant families in Germany, including estimates on the numbers of children of migrant origin according to various variables and indicators of well-being and quality of life, usually rely on the following data resources:\nofficial government statistics such as the central register of foreigners and other population registers; data produced through the educational system and through international school achievement studies such as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study coordinated by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement; representative surveys of the population such as the microcensus of the Federal Statistical Office (see below), the German Socio-Economic Panel Study that is carried out by the German Institute for Economic Research, an independent, non-profit academic institution, and the German general social survey, a national data generation programme of the GESIS-Leibniz-Institut f\u00fcr Sozialwissenschaften that collects statistical data on attitudes, behaviour and social structure; 1 data published in surveys on specific research topics.\nA large share of the studies available on people of immigrant origin is based on official statistics. This data source has a major disadvantage: the statistics typically cover migrant origin insufficiently because they differentiate only by foreign or German citizenship. Thus, ethnic Germans and naturalized immigrants, for example, usually appear in statistics as Germans although they have a migrant origin and may have been socialized entirely outside Germany. For this reason, the number of people of migrant origin may be calculated only approximately and, indeed, is probably regularly underestimated.\nCurrently, only a few studies provide data (on a limited basis) that may help us more accurately identify children in immigrant families according to the country of origin of the parents (see Stanat 2006) . Such is the case, for example, of the IGLU (InternationaleGrundschul-Lese-Untersuchung), part of the International Reading Literacy Study, an international assessment of reading comprehension in primary schools that is aimed at improving reading education. In 2006, 35 countries participated in the study.\nAnother example is the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), an international assessment of scholastic performance among 15-year-olds that has been jointly developed by countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to standardize and improve teaching methods. Beginning with the first PISA assessment, in 2000, personal citizenship information has been collected, as in other surveys and assessments in Germany, but information on the year of migration, the year of naturalization and the migration history of the parents of the children has also been collected. However, birthplace is indicated only as \u2017Germany' or \u2017not Germany'."}, {"section_title": "The sample", "text": "In 2005, the regular microcensus survey conducted by the Federal Statistical Office and the statistical offices of the L\u00e4nder to collect structural data on the population and the labour market began to include specific countries of origin and is therefore helping us to clarify individual immigration experiences. In the case of the children of ethnic German repatriates, in particular, this represents a new chance to attempt to distinguish them as Germans of migrant origin, which has not been possible with previous data sets. The regular microcensus covers a representative sample of 1 per cent of all households in Germany. It is an ongoing household sample. Households are chosen on a principle of contingency, and each household remains in the sample for four years. Because participation is obligatory, the non-response rate is low (about 3 per cent).\nAlthough there have been improvements in the data set, there are still significant gaps. Important variables are missing. One example is kindergarten and primary school enrolments, which were surveyed in Microcensus 2004, but not again in 2005. Such gaps force us to seek to match diverse sources of information or leave concepts out. Nonetheless, the numbers are the most recent available within this representative survey, and they may be the best current source for our information.\nBecause of the particularities of the German data explained here and elsewhere above, we have been obliged to include Germany in our tables as a country of origin. We note that the Germany category is part of the German data. It may indicate children in the majority population of German-born citizens of German origin, but it may also include children who are naturalized Germans, children whose parents or grandparents are naturalized Germans, children of ethnic German repatriates and other children in immigrant families. Information on the previous countries of residence or citizenship among the families of these children may not be available in the data. (Note, for example, the missing second generation in Table  6 below.)\nThe problems represented for us by the Germany category are aggravated by the other singularities of the data. Thus, as the reader may see in our tables, we have been able to separate out fairly well the children of the first generation in immigrant families. This is because the focus of the German data on the distinction between foreign and German is typically much more relevant in this generation. However, because of the idiosyncrasies of the data, the third generation of children in immigrant families -the children born in Germany of parents of migrant origin born in Germany -has also tended to disappear without much of a trace in the data because many of them are already German citizens. Thus, we are unable to identify clearly many third-generation children in immigrant families in the sense in which the terms are used in this UNICEF series.\nMoreover, because of the differences in the terms in the German practice and the taxonomy of immigrant generations, we have been constrained to use a rather misleading category for the children who, in the data, are not included among foreign-born families. These are the children in \u2017native-born' families. The latter actually includes the majority population of children, plus many third-generation children in immigrant families and even some secondgeneration children (of naturalized Germans, for example) and first-generation children, particularly children in the 1.5 generation who have arrived in Germany as members of ethnic German repatriate families and are therefore actually foreign born. The microcensus has allowed us to separate out some of these children in the tables, but, in general, we cannot be entirely confident that we have captured them all, and we have kept the numbers among the native born.\nThis means that our analysis of the situation among children in immigrant families in Germany is actually an analysis of the situation among (most) first-and second-generation children in comparison with the situation among the majority population, plus the (relatively small) third generation of children in immigrant families and a small share of second-and first-generation children, none of whom, in the data, appear clearly among the group of children that is the focus of our interest.\nIn what follows, children are defined as individuals 0 to 17 years of age as of their last birthday who are living with at least one parent in one common household. All the national groups used in the calculations have been taken from the original data set. Totals for countries of origin accounting for low numbers of children in immigrant families have been aggregated.\nBased on our calculations, the number of children in foreign-born families in Germany is 3,673,300. The number of children in native-born families is 10,740,700. Because the data set is based on a sample, the respective totals reflected in our tables are 18,256 and 62,944. Tables 6-8 indicate a basic profile of the sample in the data set.

Indicators on these features of society therefore help us understand living and housing conditions among children in immigrant families in Germany."}, {"section_title": "Size and structure of the family", "text": "Two-parent households are quite common in Germany. Nonetheless, children in secondgeneration immigrant families are more likely than any other children to live in two-parent households. The share of children in native-born families living in mother-only or father-only households, 22 per cent, is significantly higher than the corresponding share among children in foreign-born families, 13 per cent (Table 9 ). In both cases, around 90 per cent of the single-parent households are mother-only households. Altogether, only 12 per cent of the children in foreign-born families are living only with their mothers. The share of father-only households is similar among native-born and foreign-born families. A grandparent in the home may imply additional childcare opportunities and additional attention to children and their needs. Children in foreign-born families are more likely than children in native-born families to live with grandparents in the home (3.6 versus 2.5 per cent, respectively), though grandparents in the homes of grandchildren are not especially common in any case.\nThat foreign-born families tend to be larger than native-born families becomes clearer if one examines the number of siblings in a household. Children in native-born families are more likely to have fewer siblings. In the sample, 80.3 per cent of the children in native-born families have fewer than two siblings each; only 4.5 per cent have three siblings or more.

One approach adopted in this research, the value-of-children approach, involves examining intercultural differences in generative behaviour and in the structure and nature of parent-child relationships and the related intrafamily arrangements (see Nauck 2000 Nauck , 2005 . As a means of linking family dynamics and intergenerational behaviour, the approach systematically explores the value and worth of children to their parents across cultures, including across various immigrant groups within individual countries. Several indicators are used to measure this value and worth, which may be described as follows:\nthe economic and utilitarian value of children: the need for help around the home and with work, income support, insurance against the uncertainties of old age; the psychological and emotional value of children: emotional satisfactions of parenting, stimulation through interaction with children and younger people; the cost of children: the financial, material, physical, social and psychological burdens and the time burden involved in parenthood.\nThrough a comparison of the value of children to parents of German, ethnic German, Greek, Italian, Turkish and Vietnamese origin, Nauck et al. (1998) find that the psychological and emotional value of children is generally more highly esteemed than the economic and utilitarian value (Table 14) . Across all groups, the share of fathers or mothers who esteem these values is usually well over 50 per cent. Families of Turkish origin appreciate these values the most. Sources: Nauck et al. (1998) . a. Refers to the population of non-migrant origin.\nThe greatest intercultural differences occur in the appreciation of the economic and utilitarian value of children by fathers and mothers. Thus, among Germans of non-migrant origin, relatively few fathers and mothers expect children to be a help in old age. This contrasts with the opinions of Turkish and Vietnamese fathers and mothers. Nauck (2000 Nauck ( , 2005 considers these particular differences to correlate to the expectations created because of differences in the provision of old age support in Germany, where the state provides old age benefits, and Turkey and Viet Nam, where parents generally rely on transfers between generations. We note, moreover, that ethnic Germans are not equivalent or even nearly equivalent to Germans of non-migrant origin according to any of these measures.\nFriendships also play an important role among children and youth of migrant origin. Haug (2003) has studied interethnic networks and friendships among young people aged 18 to 30 using the integration survey conducted by the Federal Institute for Population Research in 2000. Her analysis reveals that youth of Italian origin have significantly more contact with German youth than with youth of Turkish origin. She shows that more Italians are thereby receiving society-specific social capital that leads to effective social inclusion. She also shows that, among men and women of migrant origin, men have more contact with Germans."}, {"section_title": "Educational attainment among children", "text": "Education policymakers are convinced of the urgency of supporting education in the German language among children of migrant origin. Researchers find that fluency in the language of the country of settlement is decisive in the social inclusion of children of migrant origin (for example, see Esser 2001 , Beisenherz 2006 . However, the progress in this area has not been particularly promising (Diefenbach 2007 ).\nIn preschool, in the school system and during leisure activities among peers, the importance of a common language for communication, social interaction and cooperation has begun to be emphasized. The PISA 2000 assessment found that students of migrant origin are, on average, less fluent in the shared language in school and that this has long-term negative effects on their school careers. Kristen (2002 Kristen ( , 2003 likewise points to the key role of language competence during the transition that occurs in the education system after the four years of primary school and revolves around entry in lower secondary school (see elsewhere below). Boos-N\u00fcnning and Karakasoglu (2005) have studied the importance of language within an immigration context among 950 girls and young women of ethnic German, Greek, Italian, Turkish and (former) Yugoslav migrant origin.\nUsing data from school entrance examinations in the city of Osnabr\u00fcck in , Becker (2006 shows that fluency in German is closely linked to the length of time children stay in kindergarten. The longer children of migrant origin attend kindergarten, the more likely they are to overcome their difficulties with German. However, especially among children of Turkish origin, the presence in schools of a large number of children from families from the same country of origin is leading to linguistic separation in these institutions and among these children.\nSystematic studies of school performance among children of migrant origin have been undertaken only recently. Thus, Diefenbach (2007) describes the nature and extent of the disadvantages faced by children of migrant origin in schools. She focuses on culture, immigration and education in light of human capital theory, discrimination and language use.\nIn their investigation based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study conducted by the German Institute for Economic Research, Becker and Schubert (2006) have demonstrated empirically the significance of parental resources, parental educational decisions, differences in learning environments and the institutional regulations in the school system, but also the social differentiation and selectivity involved in the transitions in the system, such as the transition from primary to secondary school, in determining the development of reading competence among pupils under the age of 15.\nBesides general research on children of migrant origin in the educational system, several studies have concentrated on the school performance of these children in particular stages of education and thereafter."}, {"section_title": "Preschool and kindergarten attendance (ages 3 to 5 and 6)", "text": "The amount of research on preschool and children of migrant origin is limited. Kunze and Gisbert (2005) show that attendance at a childcare facility outside the home has positive impacts on the development of the cognitive, social, emotional, physical and linguistic abilities of children. The first six years of life are the most decisive educational years because of the significant educability and knowledge retention among children in this age group (see also Beauftragte der Bundesregierung f\u00fcr Migration, Fl\u00fcchtlinge und Integration 2005).\nThrough an analysis of data on preschool enrolments collected through the German SocioEconomic Panel Study, Becker and Tremel (2006) find that preschool attendance enables children of migrant origin to improve their school performance and contributes to the educational opportunities available to them. Nonetheless, children of migrant origin who attend preschool thereby reach the average level of school performance of the children of blue-collar workers, who are considered somewhat disadvantaged in the educational opportunities open to them. Becker and Biedinger (2006) have confirmed the existence of differences in educational outcomes after preschool among various groups, including children of migrant origin, using the Osnabr\u00fcck data from 2000-2005 (see above). Controlling for family origin, they find that educational disadvantages persist among children in foreign-born families. They also find that, if preschool attendance is prolonged, the effect of family origin on school readiness is reduced. This effect begins to disappear completely only through additional gains in cognitive and language ability.\nAccording to Diefenbach (2004a Diefenbach ( , 2004b and Becker and Tremel (2006) , preschool enrolment rates are lower among children in foreign-born families. Government statistics indicate that attendance rates at preschool facilities outside the home are lower among children who are not German citizens than among children who are German citizens (78 and 84 per cent, respectively) (Konsortium Bildungsberichterstattung 2006). Preschool attendance rates among foreign children born in Germany (80.7 per cent) are nearly the same as the rates among German citizens, while the rates among foreign-born children are lower, at 71.7 per cent (Konsortium Bildungsberichterstattung 2006) . Analyses based on Microcensus 2005 show that 90 per cent of all children aged 5 and above attend a preschool or kindergarten (the age of primary school enrolment is approaching for these children) and that the differences in attendance rates between foreign and German children have become smaller ( Few comparable data exist on primary school enrolment and attendance rates among foreign children because this information is gathered differently or not at all in the individual L\u00e4nder. Despite these constraints, Gomolla and Radtke (2000) find that children in foreign-born families begin school significantly later than German children. The example of school entry in North Rhine-Westphalia during the 1995/96 and 2003/04 school years shows that the share of children in foreign-born families who begin school later is twice as high as the corresponding share among German children, while the share of children in foreign-born families who begin school earlier is lower by one third than the corresponding share among German children. We must point out, however, that the role of earlier or later school entry in school performance is still controversial."}, {"section_title": "Children of migrant origin in secondary school (ages 10 to 18)", "text": "In the 2005/06 school year, 12.3 million students were attending general education and vocational schools. Of the approximately 1.1 million students who were not German citizens (9.1 per cent), 83 per cent were attending a general education school, while 17 per cent were attending vocational school. More than 70 per cent of these foreign students were living in one of only four L\u00e4nder, namely, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse and North RhineWestphalia. In 2003, citizens of countries that had once been the main sources of migrant labour in Germany represented the largest share of foreign students: 43.4 per cent were citizens of Turkey, 11.8 per cent were citizens of one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia and 15.5 per cent were citizens of Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, or another EU member country.\nThe education system has a hierarchical structure. The transition from primary to lower secondary school is the first significant transition in the system. After primary school (Grundschule), children may attend one of three types of secondary schools, a Hauptschule, a Realschule, or a Gymnasium. 2 The choice determines the subsequent path in a child's education. The decision to attend one type of school or another therefore has considerable consequences in access to the labour market and professional careers.\nAlthough foreign pupils are treated equally given that, since the 1960s, foreign families have been required to meet the obligations imposed by compulsory education, nearly all available studies agree that, in practice, the opportunities in the educational system are not equally available. This is one of the reasons for the relatively poor school performance of foreign children and youth.\nChildren in foreign-born families obtain grades that are generally lower than the grades of children in native-born families beginning in primary school, and the improvement among children in native-born families is greater as well during the subsequent grades. In her study of 3,000 pupils in the fourth grade in six primary schools in Mannheim, Kristen (2002 Kristen ( , 2003 concludes that differences in the participation in education are evident already during the transition from primary to secondary schooling. Children in foreign-born families appear to be more frequently guided towards the least intensive school track, the Hauptschule, and less frequently towards the Realschule or Gymnasium. Kristen finds that performance in two primary school subjects, mathematics and German, is most often the deciding factor in this outcome (Table 15 ). Although her sample is small, highly selective and unrepresentative, her results nonetheless illustrate the differences also found by other researchers on performance at the end of primary school. Children and youth in foreign-born families tend to start school later and repeat classes more often. Analysis of the data gathered during the PISA 2000 assessment show that the risk of repeating grades 1, 2, or 3 is four times greater among children of migrant origin. We assume that this outcome is mainly generated because of problems with German. In any case, the actual repetition rates are probably much higher given that children and youth attending schools for children with special needs (Sonderschule) have not been included in comparative studies. Using the results of the PISA 2000 assessment, Stanat (2006) has examined the effects on academic performance of the composition of classes among adolescents. She finds that class composition has unexpected positive effects on educational aspirations among adolescents. Adolescents in schools with large shares of children of migrant origin tend to have higher expectations and to be more motivated in school. They are striving towards better educational results."}, {"section_title": "Vocational education (ages 16 to 18)", "text": "There was a surge in the number of youth of migrant origin enrolling in vocational education during the 1980s and into the mid-1990s. The peak -34 per cent of youth of migrant origin participating in education in the relevant age group -was reached in 1994. There has been a strong downward trend since then, and the share was 24 per cent in 2005.\nAfter leaving the regular school system, youth of migrant origin are less likely to undertake formal vocational training and are therefore underrepresented among trainees generally. The overall decline in the number of available apprenticeships in Germany, where the apprenticeship system by trades is particularly well organized, has been especially difficult for youth of migrant origin. This was the finding of a 2004 study carried out by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training and the Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit among applicants for apprentice and trainee positions (see Eberhard et al. 2005) . The study found that only 29 per cent of youth of migrant origin had taken up an apprentice or trainee position, whereas 40 per cent of youth in the rest of the population had done so."}, {"section_title": "Youth and the labour market", "text": "Analysis of Microcensus 2005 data reveals that all youth aged 15 to 17, including youth in foreign-born families, attend school (Table 16) . Some of these youth may also be working, but no youth in this age group who are working are not also in education. The microcensus found no cases of youth who were not attending school and who also were not working. Among youth and adults aged 18 to 24 in native-born families, young men and women are similar in school attendance -in most cases, vocational school or training programmes -and in participation in the labour force (Table 17 ). In this age group, men are only slightly more likely to be working and slightly less likely to be attending school relative to women. The shares of men and women who are not in school and who are not participating in the labour market are nearly identical. The study also found that children of migrant origin participate less often in individual early diagnostic tests. Altogether, only 56 per cent of children of migrant origin take part in these medical checkups regularly. This compares with 85 per cent of children of non-migrant origin. The share of children of migrant origin who have never taken part in such an early general diagnostic test is seven times the corresponding share of children of non-migrant origin, 14 versus 2 per cent, respectively (Kamtsiuris et al. 2007 ).\nThe study similarly found that there are differences in oral hygiene practices among children and youth of migrant origin and other children and youth. Schenk and Knopf (2007) find that the differences remain after they control for social class. Another possible explanation for this outcome may be a more curative than prophylactic attitude towards dentistry among families of migrant origin. In 2003, a study was undertaken in Rems-Murr, a district in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, to examine the dental health of preschool children of Turkish origin and the dental health of other preschool children (Beauftragte der Bundesregierung f\u00fcr Migration, Fl\u00fcchtlinge und Integration 2005). The study found that a large majority of parents in families of Turkish migrant origin agree with the statement, \u2017it is sufficient to visit a dentist only if one has a toothache'.\nMonitoring in Berlin schools reveals that the share of school beginners of foreign nationality and, especially, school beginners of Turkish migrant origin who are overweight is larger than the corresponding share among school beginners in the rest of the population (Delekat 2003, Kurth and Schaffrath Rosario 2007) . The German health interview and examination survey for children and adolescents found similar results. Additional research should clarify whether there are any linkages between these differences and socioeconomic factors or factors related to immigration status.\nThe German health interview and examination survey for children and adolescents found that relatively more children and youth of migrant origin experience problems in social and emotional adjustment compared with the rest of the population (9.8 versus 6.7 per cent, respectively) (H\u00f6lling et al. 2007 ). Thus, 11 per cent of all children of migrant origin and 8.8 per cent of all children of non-migrant origin have emotional problems (such as excessive anxiety or depression)."}, {"section_title": "Children and poverty", "text": "The likelihood of poverty among children of migrant origin rose from 5 to 15 per cent in 1989-2001, while the corresponding rise among other children was from 6.4 to 11.2 per cent (Boos-N\u00fcnning 2005). The share of children and youth in foreign-born families receiving social benefits was more than twice as high as the corresponding share among children and youth in native-born families, 13.9 and 5.9 per cent, respectively (Boos-N\u00fcnning 2005).\nStudies on children and youth of migrant origin cover various dimensions of poverty such as:\n(1) financial restrictions, including pocket money and money for clothing, recreation and entertainment and so on, that are directly tied to low household incomes; (2) less opportunity to obtain an appropriate education that matches needs and to acquire positive German language skills and social and cultural advantages; (3) deficient health care (see BoosN\u00fcnning 2005 , Butterwegge et al. 2005 , Hradil 2005 ).\nIn 1999, a study supported by the Arbeiterwohlfahrt Bundesverband and the Institut f\u00fcr Sozialarbeit und Sozialp\u00e4dagogik found that 42.7 per cent of foreign preschool children were poor (Hock et al. 2000) . Butterwegge et al. (2005) found that 46.5 per cent of all children of migrant origin in a sample in Cologne were among low-income population segments.\nKinderbarometer Hessen 2006, a study by the Land of Hesse, found that children of migrant origin, on average, have less pocket money than other children, \u20ac15.56 versus \u20ac23.72 per month (Hessenstiftung 2007) . Children of migrant origin must also generally pay more out of their own pockets for items that the families of other children more often tend to provide. Thus, 12 per cent of children of migrant origin must bear the cost of school materials, and 9 per cent must pay for their own clothes, whereas the respective shares are only 5 and 4 per cent among other children. The study found that children of migrant origin often mention snacks or clothes in answering the question, \u2017What do you buy with your pocket money?'. They mention toys, magazines, or leisure activities much less often than other children.\nAccording to a study supported by the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, children of migrant origin more often live in poor housing (LBS-Initiative Junge Familie 2006). Relatively more children of migrant origin are living in blocks of flats (25 versus 3 per cent among other children), and fewer are living in detached homes (41 versus 73 per cent). The study also found that fewer children of migrant origin have their own room and do not have to share a room with siblings or other family members (62 versus 82 per cent). Children living in blocks of flats or in large families rarely have a room of their own. Given that children of migrant origin are more likely to belong to one or both of these two groups, these are factors in the housing conditions among these children. According to the study, the families of children of migrant origin tend to allow children fewer opportunities to participate in decisions about housing and the home and tend to be more strict on the use of the home by children to meet with and entertain their friends. Nonetheless, the study found that children of migrant origin and other children differed only slightly in their self-reported evaluations of their housing conditions, 6.1 versus 6.5, respectively, on a 7-point scale, with 7.0 the highest score.\nThe need for more research is clear. The few studies available on poverty among families of migrant origin are generally tentative. They rely on small numbers of cases or only refer to particular areas or L\u00e4nder. They cannot be considered representative. There have been no serious attempts to separate out ethnic factors, the effects of immigration status, or socioeconomic factors in determining the causes of these and other outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Youth and deviant behaviour", "text": "The chief source of reliable nationwide information on deviant or criminal behaviour among children and youth is police statistics, the Polizeiliche Kriminalstatistik (BKA 2007 Not all offences are reported to the police. Offenders who are unknown to their victims tend to appear more often in reports to police. If offender and victim know each other, situations tend relatively more often to be resolved without resort to a call to the police. The closer the relationship between offender and victim, the less likely an offence will be reported. Moreover, offenders who are unknown to their victims and who also appear foreign or speak with an accent or in another language, are more likely, in relative terms, to be reported to the police (Pfeiffer et al. 2004 ). Age and gender influence crime rates significantly. Boys and young men aged 14 to 24 show an especially high propensity for criminal behaviour. There are proportionally more foreigners than Germans in this high-risk group (13.1 versus 11.8 per cent, respectively). Crime rates in high-population urban areas and among people in low-income groups are proportionally greater. As a group, foreigners tend to live in large towns and cities and to have relatively fewer financial resources. Some crimes, offences against immigration or asylum laws, for example, can only be committed by people who are not German citizens (Naplava 2005 , Pfeiffer et al. 2004 ).\nTo counter some of these problems, Pfeiffer et al. (1998) surveyed adolescents about crimes they might have committed. The authors focused on four types of crimes: robbery, extortion, assault, and assault and battery. They were able to show that youth of migrant origin are involved in violent crimes at a higher rate. Turkish youth are at especially high risk.\nSeveral other studies have also found variations in the incidence of violence among groups, though they are based on small sample sizes and less differentiated results among certain migrant groups. In three waves (1994, 1999 and 2004) over 10 years, Fuchs et al. (2005) investigated 4,523 students in a representative study in Bavaria. They found that foreign children and youth are significantly more violent than other children and youth. Babka von Gostomski (2003) and Goldberg (2006) find that Turkish and ethnic German youth are involved in fighting much more often relative to Germans of non-migrant origin. Goldberg (2006) has examined the links between leisure activities such as computer games, sports, television and other media to explain differences in delinquent behaviour among youth of migrant origin and other youth. Schmitt-Rodermund and Silbereisen (2004) , in their study among ethnic German youth of migrant origin, find a strong correlation between delinquency and the frequency of contact with other delinquent youth. Babka von Gostomski (2003) finds that the higher crime rates, especially among Turkish youth, are the result of socioeconomic disadvantage and lack of opportunities. investigated parental-partner violence and found that Turkish youth reported three times more frequently that they had witnessed violent behaviour by their parents at home. Baier and Pfeiffer (2007) analyse the results of a 2005 survey among school students (Table  18 ). They find that three main factors explain the greater relative violence and crime rates among youth of migrant origin: (1) disadvantages in education, (2) parental tolerance of violent behaviour and (3) a greater incidence of concepts of masculinity that favour aggressivity and promote excessive violence. This culture of violence is relatively more characteristic among youth in low-income groups. Source: Baier and Pfeiffer (2007) . Note: The data are weighted. a.

Baier and Pfeiffer (2007) note, however, that offences such as shoplifting, crimes involving property and various kinds of substance abuse are not especially common among Turkish youth, who, however, are involved in crimes of violence relatively more often.\nFindings that youth of migrant origin are involved relatively more frequently in violence are politically charged. Studies have pointed out that children of migrant origin are also victims of crime. lament the lack of periodic, standardized, representative victim surveys. For their study, Baier and Pfeiffer (2007) have surveyed German and foreign youth victims of robbery, blackmail, sexual violence, and bodily injuries caused by armed or unarmed offenders. They find that Germans are the least frequent victims of these crimes (17.9 per cent had this experience at least once in the last year), whereas Italian (23.1 per cent), Polish (26.8 per cent) and Turkish (20.3 per cent) youth showed the highest rates of victimization. However, the differences among the Turkish group and the remaining migrant groups are not sharp."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Children of migrant origin face disadvantages in preschool. Many are held back because of a lack of German language proficiency. For numerous reasons, including obvious practical reasons, proficiency in German is decisive for the inclusion of children of migrant origin in the school system and for their subsequent academic success.\nThe German school system is highly selective, and children in foreign-born families are often guided towards less demanding and less promising educational tracks because of their perceived or actual deficiencies. This is apparent especially during the first important educational transition in German schools, from primary to lower secondary schools.\nEmpirical results from health surveys indicate that children of migrant origin benefit from less health care. Important among the reasons for this outcome is the more restrained participation of these children in early diagnosis and preventive care. Research suggests that there may also be a greater incidence of obesity and poor dental care among children in some immigrant groups.\nDeviant and criminal behaviour, including crimes of violence, appear to be more prevalent among children and youth of migrant origin. Among the most important factors responsible for this outcome are the disadvantages in education faced by immigrant groups, greater parental tolerance of violent behaviour, acceptance of concepts of masculinity that tend to legitimize aggressivity and violence, and more frequent association with young people prone to delinquency and crime.\nMany researchers appear to believe that the disadvantages confronting immigrant groups are tied to the status of people in these groups as immigrants. However, the generally poorer socioeconomic conditions among foreign-born families may be at least as important. Lower average incomes mean that families of immigrant origin face many of the same disadvantages as poor native-born families. Thus, similar to poorer people in the rest of the population, the selective placement of children of migrant origin in less demanding and less promising educational tracks may also be conditioned by the shortage in social and cultural resources among the parents of these children. Because of these and similar structural effects, many people of migrant origin experience disadvantage even after they become German citizens.\nThe data resources and the collection of statistics on living conditions among children of migrant origin have improved. Nonetheless, it is still impossible even to determine the number of these children with any precision. The efforts associated with the microcensus, the German health interview and examination survey for children and adolescents and other initiatives offer an inspiring example for child-oriented research on immigrant families. However, this must only be the beginning."}]
