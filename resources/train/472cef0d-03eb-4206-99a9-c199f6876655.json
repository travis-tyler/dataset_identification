[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The human hippocampal formation can be divided into a set of cytoarchitecturally and functionally distinct subregions, involved in different aspects of memory formation. Neuroanatomical disruptions within these subregions are associated with several debilitating brain disorders including Alzheimer's disease, major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Multi-center brain imaging consortia, such as the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium, are interested in studying disease effects on these subregions, and in the genetic factors that affect them. For large-scale studies, automated extraction and subsequent genomic association studies of these hippocampal subregion measures may provide additional insight. Here, we evaluated the test-retest reliability and transplatform reliability (1.5 T versus 3 T) of the subregion segmentation module in the FreeSurfer software package using three independent cohorts of healthy adults, one young (Queensland Twins Imaging Study, N = 39), another elderly (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI-2, N = 163) and another mixed cohort of healthy and depressed participants (Max Planck Institute, MPIP, N = 598). We also investigated agreement between the most recent version of this algorithm (v6.0) and an older version (v5.3), again using the ADNI-2 and MPIP cohorts in addition to a sample from the Netherlands Study for Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) (N = 221). Finally, we estimated the heritability (h 2 ) of the segmented subregion volumes using the full sample of young, healthy QTIM twins (N = 728). Test-retest reliability was high for all twelve subregions in the 3 T ADNI-2 sample (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.70-0.97) and moderate-to-high in the 4 T QTIM sample (ICC = 0.5-0.89). Transplatform reliability was strong for eleven of the twelve subregions (ICC = 0.66-0.96); however, the hippocampal fissure was not consistently reconstructed across 1.5 T and 3 T field strengths (ICC = 0.47-0.57). Between-version agreement was moderate for the hippocampal tail, subiculum and presubiculum (ICC = 0.78-0.84; Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) = 0.55-0.70), and poor for all other subregions (ICC = 0.34-0.81; DSC = 0.28-0.51). All hippocampal subregion volumes were highly heritable (h 2 = 0.67-0.91). Our findings indicate that eleven of the twelve human hippocampal subregions segmented using FreeSurfer version 6.0 may serve as reliable and informative quantitative phenotypes for future multi-site imaging genetics initiatives such as those of the ENIGMA consortium.

This seahorse-shaped structure in the medial temporal lobe is divided into a set of cytoarchitectonically heterogeneous subregions (Insausti and Amaral, 2004; Winterburn et al., 2013; Pipitone et al., 2014) , each associated with distinct aspects of memory formation, among other functions. For example, the dentate gyrus (DG) and sectors 3 and 4 of the cornu ammonis (CA) are involved in declarative memory acquisition (Coras et al., 2014) , whereas the subiculum and CA1 are associated with disambiguation during working memory processes (Newmark et al., 2013) . The CA2 subregion, long assumed to be a simple transition point between CA3 and CA1, has recently been implicated in animal models of social memory (Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014) and episodic time encoding (Navratilova and Battaglia, 2015) . The subiculum, a subregion that exerts control over the hippocampal output, has been associated with spatial memory functions, but its ventral part may play an additional regulatory role in inhibition of the HPA axis (O'Mara, 2006) .\nNeuroanatomical abnormalities within these hippocampal subregions are associated with a broad range of neurological and psychiatric disorders, from ischaemic stroke, encephalitis, temporal lobe epilepsy, transient global amnesia and multiple sclerosis (Bartsch, 2012; Das et al., 2011) to bipolar disorder (BPD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Sala, 2008) . Some of these malformations develop as a result of head trauma, intracranial infection or other environmental influences, but genetic factors also play a fundamental role (Thompson et al., 2008; van Erp et al., 2004) . Recent advances in genome-wide association (GWA) meta-analysis and large-scale collaborative brain imaging (e.g. Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA), the Early Growth Genetics (EGG) consortium, and the Cohorts of Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE)) have helped identify several common genetic variants associated with structural variation in the hippocampus Hibar et al., 2015; Stein et al., 2012) as well as other brain regions including the putamen, caudate nucleus , intracranial volume Stein et al., 2012) and head circumference (Taal et al., 2012) .\nInternational consortia like ENIGMA are now turning their attention to specific investigations of genetic and phenotypic variation in healthy individuals as well as those diagnosed with schizophrenia, BPD, MDD, PTSD, epilepsy and many other brain illnesses (Thompson et al., 2014) . Among subcortical structures assessed, the hippocampus has consistently shown the greatest effect sizes for differences between patients and controls, in both schizophrenia (van Erp et al., 2015) and major depression, particularly recurrent depression (Schmaal et al., 2015) . Impaired hippocampal integrity may in turn impair treatment response, making it pivotal to detect such morphologically defined subgroups (Frodl et al., 2008; S\u00e4mann et al., 2013) .\nFocusing on fine-grained phenotypic variation within small subregions of the hippocampus may improve our power to localize genetic and disease-related effects on the brain as a whole. As part of its next major project, the ENIGMA consortium aims to delineate specific sub-regions of the hippocampus as quantitative phenotypes for genome-wide association and cross-sectional case:control metaanalyses. Before these new ENIGMA initiatives can begin, we first need to evaluate a non-invasive, reliable and relatively accessible technique for reconstructing the human hippocampal subfields in vivo. In turn, for future genetic mapping efforts, we must validate these automatically reconstructed hippocampal sub-regions as quantitative endophenotypes -heritable, robust brain markers that may be closer to the molecular basis of disease than diagnostic assessments in the clinic (Braskie and Ringman, 2011; Glahn et al., 2007; Gottesman and Gould, 2003; Hasler and Northoff, 2011) .\nSeveral manual segmentation techniques have been developed to reconstruct hippocampal and parahippocampal subregions from T1-weighted MRI scans acquired at 3 to 7 T field strengths (Adler et al., 2014; La Joie et al., 2010; Van Leemput et al., 2009; Mueller et al., 2007; Wisse et al., 2012) . Although these methods typically segment the hippocampal subregions at remarkably fine-scaled resolution, a critical bottleneck for collaborative imaging initiatives such as ENIGMA is the need to manually label the subregion boundaries, which is laborious, time-consuming and susceptible to intra-and interobserver variability (Van Leemput et al., 2009 ). Several automated protocols have been developed to address this issue, combining rules on image intensity and geometry to delineate the boundaries between hippocampal and parahippocampal subregions (Van Leemput et al., 2009; Yushkevich et al., 2009 Yushkevich et al., , 2010 . One often-used automated technique is provided as part of FreeSurfer, a freely available suite of neuroimaging structural analysis tools (Fischl, 2012) .\nInitial versions of the FreeSurfer algorithm (versions 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3) produce subregion segmentations that are largely inconsistent with brain anatomy (de Flores et al., 2015; Pluta et al., 2012; Wisse et al., 2014 ). An updated version of the algorithm, to be released as part of FreeSurfer version 6.0, uses a new statistical atlas constructed from ultra-high resolution ex vivo MRI . This revised algorithm produces subregion volume estimates that more closely match volumes derived from histological investigations . However, consensus is still lacking on the most appropriate subregion delineation protocol to use (Yushkevich et al., 2015) . Here, using four independent samples, we set out to validate version 6.0 of the automated FreeSurfer algorithm from three complementary perspectives: First, we evaluated the algorithm's 'test-retest' reliability; i.e. its ability to extract comparable subregion measures across multiple time points in two independent cohorts with different image acquisition parameters and age characteristics (our two samples differ in mean age by approximately 50 years). Second, we examined the algorithm's 'trans-platform' reliability -defined as its ability to reproduce similar subregion measures across different MRI scanner platforms and field strengths (for example, 3 T versus 1.5 T). Third, we investigated overall agreement between this new algorithm, which we will refer to as 'FS6.0', and the older algorithm, version 5.3, which we will refer to as 'FS5.3'. The degree of quantitative deviation between volumes extracted using FS5.3 and volumes extracted using FS6.0 may help users of the former evaluate the necessity of re-processing their data with the latter.\nValidation of a reliable, automated subregion segmentation tool may allow ENIGMA and other imaging consortia to study hippocampal subregions as fine-grained quantitative phenotypes in large-scale genome-wide association meta-analyses. However, to be considered a promising target for genetic mapping, the subregional volume estimates must show evidence of heritability (h 2 ). Quantitative genetic analysis of automatically segmented, T1-weighted brain images from paired twin samples has frequently been employed to estimate the heritability of global volumetric measures. Prior estimates show that total hippocampal volume is highly heritable in both healthy adults (h 2 = 0.66-0.71) (den Braber et al., 2013; van Erp et al., 2004; Wright et al., 2002) and children (h 2 = 0.64-0.72) (Swagerman and Brouwer, 2014) . However, structural variance within the whole hippocampus may be less heritable in elderly adults (h 2 = 0.4-0.65) (DeStefano et al., 2009; Mather et al., 2015; Sullivan et al., 2001) , possibly due to environmental stressors (Hedges and Woon, 2010) , alterations in testosterone levels (Panizzon et al., 2012) or other endogenous biological factors. Similarly, total hippocampal volume is only moderately heritable in schizophrenia (h 2 = 0.36-0.73) (Kaymaz and Os, 2009; Roalf et al., 2015) . Thus, while the heritability of total hippocampal volume is well established across many populations, the heritability of structural variations in individual subregions has yet to be delineated. Therefore, in the second part of this study, we set out to disentangle the relative contributions of additive genetic variance and environmental influences on hippocampal subregion volume in two independent cohorts of healthy adults, and by this to assess the eligibility of such hippocampal subregion volumes as endophenotypes for future large-scale collaborative genetic association studies in ENIGMA."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants and imaging protocols", "text": "Four collections of MRI scans were analyzed in this study."}, {"section_title": "ADNI-2", "text": "Subjects.

This revised module is compatible with FreeSurfer v5.3 (FS5.3) and will be freely distributed with FreeSurfer v6.0 (FS6.0) . Prior versions of the algorithm (FS5.1 to FS5.3) combined a single probabilistic atlas with high-resolution, T1-weighted invivo manual segmentations to predict the locations of eight hippocampal subregions. The new version (FS6.0) predicts the location of twelve hippocampal subregions, using a refined probabilistic atlas built upon a combination of manual delineations of the hippocampal formation from 15 ultra-high resolution, ex-vivo MRI scans and manual annotations of the surrounding subcortical structures (e.g., amygdala, cortex) from an independent dataset of 39 in-vivo, T1-weighted, 1 mm resolution MRI scans . This revised algorithm features the following enhancements: (i) first-hand knowledge of histological staining of the hippocampus by a neuroanatomist; (ii) a cytoarchitectural atlas of the hippocampal formation (Rosene and Hoesen, 1987) ; and (iii) highresolution, ex-vivo brain MRI scans (120 \u03bcm 3 ), which show definitive borders between the subregions and greater consistency with manual segmentation methods (Yushkevich et al., 2015) . Previous versions of the FreeSurfer algorithm reconstructed eight subregions per hemisphere, including the CA1, CA2/3, fimbria, subiculum, presubiculum, CA4/DG, hippocampal tail and hippocampal fissure.

After successful subregion segmentation, we used a custom-designed Matlab code to visually inspect each segmentation (see Fig. 1 ). Subregion volume estimates were exported to SPSS (for reliability analysis) and reformatted into phenotype covariance matrices (for heritability analysis described below).\nVolume measures were imported into SPSS (IBM Corp., Version 21.0) and subjected to a series of two-way reliability analyses, using Cronbach's alpha (\u03b1) (Cronbach, 1951) as a measure of internal consistency. Cronbach's alpha is calculated as follows:\nwhere N is the number of subregion volume estimates, c-bar is the average inter-subject covariance among these estimates and v-bar is the average variance. The resulting \u03b1, interpreted as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), provides an estimate of how consistently the FreeSurfer v6.0 parcellation protocol reconstructs hippocampal subregions from baseline to follow-up scan. ICC ranges from 0 (indicating high variability between baseline and follow-up volume estimates) to 1 (denoting high reproducibility between baseline and follow-up estimates)."}, {"section_title": "Between-version reliability analysis", "text": "We compared subregional hippocampal volumes estimates extracted using FS5.3 and FS6.0 from three independently acquired cohorts: (i) baseline scans of the ADNI-2 cohort (N = 163), (ii) the NESDA cohort (N = 221), and (iii) the MPIP cohort (N = 589). Volume measures for each subregion were bilaterally 'averaged' across the left and right hemispheres.\nVolume measurements from FS6.0 are given in mm 3 , whereas volume measurements in FS5.3 are returned on the basis of 0.5 mm isotropic. Therefore, the latter set of volume estimates was divided by a factor of 8 in order to transform them to mm 3 measurements.\nVolume estimates for the eight sub-regions extracted using FS5.3 were imported into SPSS alongside eight of the twelve possible subregions extracted using FS6.0. Volume estimates for the parasubiculum, molecular layer, GC_ML_DG and HATA (extracted using FS6.0) had no direct corresponding subregions in FS5.3 and were not included in this between-version analysis. We conducted eight sets of two-way mixed reliability analyses, using the same statistical model applied for our prior test-retest comparison (Cronbach's alpha) . This produced a series of ICC values measuring the agreement between the old (FS5.3) and new (FS6.0) versions of the FreeSurfer subregion segmentation algorithm.\nAs a second measure of reproducibility and spatial overlap between FS5.3 and FS6.0, we employed a custom-designed Matlab code to extract a series of Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) for each hippocampal subregion. The DSC, first proposed by Dice (1945) , provides a validation metric for evaluating reproducibility and has previously been used to assess spatial overlap between automated MRI reconstructions (Zou et al., 2006) . DSC values range from 0 (indicating no spatial overlap between two sets of binary segmentations) to 1 (full overlap between binary segmentations).\nDSCs were calculated by dividing the sum of volumes segmented using FS5.3 and volumes segmented using FS6.0 by twice the volume of the intersection between these segmentations; i.e.\nwhere A is the first hippocampal subregion (reconstructed using FS5.3), B is the second hippocampal subregion volume (reconstructed using FS6.0) and \u2229 is the intersected space between the two subregions.\nTrans-platform reliability analysis 20 pairs of T1-weighted images were acquired on a 1.5 T and a 3 T scanner system to investigate the stability of both FS5.3 and FS6.0 across platforms.

Methods to estimate heritability in SOLAR are detailed elsewhere Winkler et al., 2010) . Briefly, SOLAR implements a maximum likelihood variance decomposition method, expanding on prior algorithms developed by Amos (1994) . The algorithm decomposes phenotypic variance (\u03c3 2 P ) into a genetic (\u03c3 g 2 ) and a residual component (\u03c3 e 2 ) -the latter represents variation not accounted for by the genetic component (i.e., random environmental variation and/or experimental error). Mean volumes for the whole hippocampus and twelve of its subregions were extracted from all twin pairs in the QTIM sample (N = 132 MZ pairs and N = 232 dizygotic pairs) and reformatted into a phenotype covariance matrix. Each covariate matrix was adjusted to include sex, age, and age * sex interactions as covariates. The covariance matrix, \u03a9, for each pedigree of individuals was then integrated into the following expression:\nwhere \u03a9 represents covariance between one relative and another, \u03a6 is the pair-wise kinship coefficient representing the relationship between these relatives (0.5 for full siblings), \u03c3 g 2 represents the additive genetic component of phenotypic variance, I is the identity matrix and \u03c3 e 2 is residual non-genetic variation (i.e., individual-specific environmental variance). Heritability (h 2 ) was computed from this model by comparing the observed covariance matrix for phenotypic variance (\u03c3 p 2 ) with the observed covariance matrix for additive genetic effects (\u03c3 g 2 ), i.e.,\nHere, h 2 is a value between 0 and 1 representing total additive genetic heritability, ranging from 0 (no genetic contributions) to 1 (all phenotypic variance reflects a genetic effect). Significance of heritability was estimated by computing a model in which \u03c3 2 g was constrained to zero, computing a second model in which \u03c3 2 g was estimated, and computing twice the difference between the first and second models' log-likelihoods. For our analysis, we employed a polygenic model that calculated the effects of specific variables (additive genetic variation, and covariates including age, sex and sex * age interactions) in explaining each subregion's volumetric variance within the QTIM population. Three main test statistics were then recorded for each subregion volume: its h 2 estimate, the significance (p-value) of this heritability estimate and its standard error.

All regions exhibited high heritability, between 0.56 and 0.88. The highest heritability estimates (h 2 \u2265 0.7) were observed for large regions with mean volumes of 220 mm 3 or greater (i.e., the whole hippocampus, molecular layer, CA1, CA3, CA4, hippocampal tail, granule cell layer, subiculum and presubiculum). Smaller subregions (mean volume: 60-165 mm 3 ) showed moderate-to-high heritability (0.55 b h 2 b 0.7) (see Fig. 2 ). Table 8 shows the heritability estimates alongside their significance values and standard errors. Using a combination of FreeSurfer subregion labels and TrackVis (http:// trackvis.org/), we constructed a three-dimensional visualization of each heritability estimate, this shows how large, posterior subregions (i.e., the hippocampal tail) were most heritable, whereas smaller, anteromedial subregions (parasubiculum, presubiculum and fimbria) were less influenced by genetic factors (see Fig. 3 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Here we evaluated a series of automatically segmented volumetric measures from the hippocampus and twelve of its major subregions as reliable, heritable quantitative phenotypes for future large-scale imaging genetics studies. We had four main findings. First, the most recent version of a widely employed FreeSurfer segmentation protocol (FS6.0) showed good test-retest reliability, both at 3 T and 4 T in healthy young and older adults. Spatial overlap between segmentations produced at baseline and follow-up time points was moderate-to-high for all subregions, with the exception of the hippocampal fissure. Second, segmentations produced using FreeSurfer v6.0 showed strong reproducibility from 1.5 T to 3 T field strengths. Third, subregional volume estimates varied between prior and revised versions of the FreeSurfer algorithm, with some subregions (e.g. the hippocampal tail) remaining stable, and others (e.g. the cornu ammonis) diverging notably from one version to the next. Fourth, genetic factors significantly affected the volume of the human hippocampus and its twelve major subregions in a sample of healthy, adult twins. Multi-site genetic analysis may Table 4 Intra-class correlation coefficients for between-version agreement (ADNI-2 cohort, N = 163, 3 T).\ntherefore be feasible for automatically extracted subregion measures, building on prior studies that detected common variants associated with overall hippocampal volume Hibar et al., 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "FreeSurfer v6.0: Reliable test-retest segmentations of eleven hippocampal subregions", "text": "Automated parcellation algorithms are essential neuroimaging tools, as they facilitate the harmonized, time-efficient and precise reconstruction of brain regions across multiple sites. The automated subcortical segmentation protocol included in the FreeSurfer software package has been employed in several important imaging collaborations, leading to the discovery of genetic polymorphisms associated with subcortical and intracranial volumes Ikram et al., 2012; Stein et al., 2012) and the identification of robust subcortical alterations in large populations of people with schizophrenia (Van Erp et al., 2015) and major depressive disorder (Schmaal et al., 2015) . FreeSurfer has been validated as a reliable method to reconstruct and measure larger brain regions (Jovicich et al., 2006; Wonderlick et al., 2009 ), but early versions of its hippocampal subregion segmentation module were criticized by some as anatomically inaccurate, overly reliant on lowresolution images and not yet validated against manual tracing techniques (de Flores et al., 2015; Pluta et al., 2012; Wisse et al., 2014) . Here, we found that a revised version of the FreeSurfer subregion segmentation tool, due to be released with FreeSurfer v6.0, produces reliable segmentations for eleven of the twelve hippocampal subregions at 3 T and 4 T field strengths. The most reliably reconstructed subregions included the hippocampal tail, CA1, CA4, presubiculum and subiculum. These subregions showed excellent test-retest reliability in two independent tests (ICC and DSC analysis) and in two unrelated cohorts (ADNI and QTIM).\nOther subregions, including the dentate gyrus, CA3, fimbria, HATA and parasubiculum, showed strong test-retest reproducibility at 3 T field strength, but a wider range of test-retest reproducibility at 4 T field strength. This discrepancy may be explained, in part, by the smaller sample size of the 4 T cohort (QTIM; N = 39) compared to the 3 T cohort (ADNI-2; N = 163). ICC estimates extracted from the 4 T cohort were associated with larger confidence intervals (CIs), many of which overlapped with CIs from the 3 T cohort (see Table 2 ). Voxel size differences between ADNI-2 (1.2 \u00d7 1.2 \u00d7 1.2 mm) and QTIM (0.94 \u00d7 0.98 \u00d7 0.98 mm) may have also contributed towards these discrepancies: FreeSurfer resamples MR images to 1 mm isotropic voxel size during its automated reconstruction process and this interpolation procedure may produce variable resolutions in datasets that are 'down-sampled' (i.e. ADNI-2) compared to those that are 'up-sampled' (i.e. QTIM).\nOf the twelve subregions we investigated, only one -the hippocampal fissure -produced unreliable volume estimates between baseline and follow-up acquisitions. The hippocampal fissure is a vestigial sulcus located between the molecular layer of the hippocampus and the dentate gyrus. Several neuroanatomical and methodological variables may contribute to the inconsistent segmentation of this subregion. Its relatively small size and complex cytoarchitectural morphometry may make the subregion more susceptible to partial volume effects caused by changes in the subject's head positioning, variable tissue contrast profiles or even small, undetected changes in the MR signal (Morey et al., 2010) . The relatively arbitrary boundary between the fissure and extrahippocampal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may have also contributed towards its poor reproducibility.\nPrior appraisals of the FS5.3 segmentation algorithm noted its inconsistent delineations of the hippocampal head and tail (Yushkevich et al., 2010) . This new algorithm -FS6.0 -which relies upon a refined atlas built upon high-resolution ex vivo MRI data , appears to reconstruct the hippocampal tail and parts of the hippocampal head (CA1, CA2/3) with a high degree of spatial overlap and test-retest reproducibility. Segmentations of the dentate gyrus have also been criticized in FS5.3, as they appear to mismatch with known anatomical boundaries (Wisse et al., 2014) , In FS6.0, the dentate is reconstructed as three individual subregions, namely; the hilar region (CA4), the granule cells (GC-DG) and, partially, the molecular layer. Our study showed stable test-retest reliability in all three subregions.\nPrior evaluations of the FS5.3 algorithm also noted that the CA1 is the smallest of the three cornu ammonis segmentations (CA1, CA2 & CA3), despite post-mortem studies contradictorily indicating that the CA1 is the largest and the CA2&3 are the smallest subfields (Wisse et al., 2014) . This neuroanatomical inconsistency may yield misleading clinical interpretations: For example, FreeSurfer-based investigations of the human hippocampal subregions have associated neurological conditions such as MCI or Alzheimer's disease with atrophy of the CA2&3 (Hanseeuw et al., 2011; Lim et al., 2012) , whereas anatomical studies have reported the most profound atrophy in the CA1 (Simic et al., 1997; Rossler et al., 2002) . Our findings suggest that this anatomical inconsistency appears to be resolved in FS6.0; the CA1 is now the largest and most reliably reconstructed of the three subfields (see Table 2 ). Future in-vivo investigations of the human hippocampal subregions should therefore prioritize the use of the revised algorithm, FS6.0, as our results show that FS6.0 reliably reproduces eleven major hippocampal subregions across two independent cohorts (QTIM and ADNI-2), despite differences in age, scanning interval and image acquisition method. Clinical findings reported using the algorithm's predecessor, FS5.3, should be interpreted with caution.\nBetween-version agreement and trans-platform reliability: Implications for imaging consortia\nInternational consortia like ENIGMA typically involve large-scale implementation of harmonized segmentation protocols across diverse networks of research laboratories. Many of these laboratories may have already processed their T1-weighted images through older versions (v5.1-5.3) of the FreeSurfer subregion segmentation tool, raising questions about the need to process their data through a new version of the algorithm. Here, we found strong agreement between older (v5.3) and newer (v6.0) versions of the tool for the hippocampal tail, presubiculum and subiculum. However, versions 5.3 and 6.0 produced variable volume estimates for the cornu ammonis, fimbria, and hippocampal fissure. These discrepancies were expected, due to the algorithm's revised definitions of subregional borders . FS6.0 also produced four new subregions with no directly corresponding structures in FS5.3 (the parasubiculum, molecular Table 7 Trans-platform reliability across 1.5 T and 3 T field strengths, using estimates extracted from using FreeSurfer v5. 3 and v6.0 (MPIP cohort, N = 10, 3 T Fig. 2 . Heritability of the whole hippocampus and its respective subfields in the QTIM cohort (N = 728). layer, granule cells of the dentate and HATA). Furthermore, version 6.0 produced slightly more consistent estimates across lower (1.5 T) and higher (3 T) MRI scanner field strengths. Overall, these findings suggest that the latest version of the FreeSurfer subregion segmentation algorithm is a more reliable, versatile and anatomically accurate tool than its predecessors . International consortia such as ENIGMA may benefit by encouraging all participating sites to process their imaging data with the revised segmentation tool (FS6.0). The combination of volume estimates acquired using previous (FS5.3) and revised (FS6.0) algorithms is not recommended."}, {"section_title": "Validating the human hippocampal subfields as quantitative phenotypes for genetic mapping", "text": "In the second part of this manuscript, we used SOLAR to calculate the heritability of all twelve automatically segmented hippocampal subregions. The greatest genetic effects were observed in larger subregions, particularly within the granule cells of the DG, molecular layer and the hippocampal tail (h 2 = 0.74-0.91). Smaller subregions such as the hippocampal fissure and parasubiculum produced strong but lower heritability estimates (h 2 = 0.56-0.57). This pattern of heritability has previously been reported across the wider collection of subcortical structures, with larger regions (such as the thalamus) showing higher heritability than smaller regions (such as the amygdala) (see Hibar et al., 2015) . These heritability fluctuations may be explained by the reduced measurement errors associated with larger segmentations. However, biological factors may also play a role. For example, the cornu ammonis is among the earliest brain regions to develop prenatally (Taupin, 2007) , whereas the subiculum and CA2 are the first hippocampal subregions to mature postnatally (Jab\u00e8s et al., 2011) . The DG and hippocampal tail show accelerated patterns of neurogenesis after the first postnatal year (Insausti et al., 2010) . In adult life, hippocampal neurons continue to proliferate from precursor cells in the DG (Kempermann et al., 2004) . Given the early development of the CA subregions (Taupin, 2007) and hippocampal tail (Insausti et al., 2010) and the key memory-processing role of the DG in adulthood (Coras et al., 2014) , it is likely that genetic factors significantly influence each region. Total hippocampal volume was also significantly heritable (h 2 = 0.86-0.88) -supporting prior estimates from healthy populations; this further shows the impact of genetic factors on the structure as a whole (den Braber et al., 2013; Swagerman and Brouwer, 2014; van Erp et al., 2004; Wright et al., 2002) . Our main aim here was to identify reliable quantitative phenotypes that can be used in future collaborative genetic mapping efforts. A biomarker must satisfy several explicit criteria before it can be considered an endophenotype (Gottesman and Gould, 2003) . First, it should be associated with illness in the population. Structural changes in the hippocampal subregions are implicated in a wide range of brain disorders, from Alzheimer's disease to epilepsy and schizophrenia (Bartsch, 2012; Sala, 2008) . Second, a useful quantitative endophenotype must be heritable. In this study, all major subregions of the hippocampus were highly influenced by additive genetic effects, with heritability estimates ranging from h 2 = 0.56 to h 2 = 0.91. All subregions, with the exception of the hippocampal fissure (which shows inconsistent volume estimates across image acquisition time points and field strengths), could therefore be considered as reliable and robust quantitative phenotypes for future genetic mapping studies."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and future directions", "text": "In this collaborative investigation, we evaluated a revised version of the FreeSurfer subregion segmentation tool using data collected and analyzed at multiple, independent sites (ADNI-2, QTIM, MPIP and NESDA) at two different field strengths (3 T and 4 T) across large samples of healthy (QTIM, ADNI-2) and affected populations (MPIP, NESDA). We found that the revised algorithm produces heritable and reliable segmentations for eleven human hippocampal subregions, but future users should note some limitations. First, the algorithm has yet to be validated against manual segmentations. A recent quantitative comparison of 21 manual segmentation protocols, including the protocol used to generate manually annotated training data for the revised FreeSurfer algorithm, revealed significant variability among the labels used to define subregions, how boundaries were placed between labels, and the overall extent of the hippocampal formation that is labeled across protocols (Yushkevich et al., 2015) . FS6.0 is already a reliable, accessible tool for automated subregion segmentation, but it continues to evolve alongside on-going efforts to harmonize hippocampal subfield protocols (The Hippocampal Subfields Group (HSG), 2014; see hippocampalsubfields. com). As such, it is inevitably subject to revisions as the field develops. Second, although the revised algorithm can segment T1-and T2-weighted images (and their combination; , Fig. 3 .

Heritability is represented as a heat map, with the most heritable subregions depicted in red (see: the hippocampal tail) and moderately heritable subfields colored in green/yellow (see: the hippocampal fissure and parasubiculum). The first image (on the left) is a full reconstruction of the hippocampal formation, showing the most lateral subfields including the CA1, CA3, hippocampal tail ('hippo. tail'), fimbria and hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area ('HATA'). The middle image removes some lateral substructures, including the fimbria and CA3, in order to display mid-lying subfields including the hippocampal fissure ('hippo. fissure'), molecular layer and granule cells of the DG ('ML-DG') and CA4. The third image (on the right) further removes these subfields in order to display three remaining medial sub-regions, including the subiculum, presubiculum and parasubiculum. This rendering represents bilateral h 2 estimates, although only the left hippocampus is shown here.

Test-retest reliability estimates were extracted using a series of 1. Table 2 ). Future versions of the FreeSurfer segmentation algorithm may yield more robust estimates for low resolution data (b1 mm 3 ) by combining smaller subfields such as the subiculum and CA2/3. Third, while we observed good reliability between subregion segmentations acquired at 1.5 T and 3 T field strengths, test-retest reproducibility estimates were not established at 1.5 T.\nDespite these limitations, the present study supports the utility of eleven automatically segmented hippocampal subregion volumes as quantitative endophenotypes for future imaging genetics collaborations. Progressing from macro-level investigations of large brain regions towards more fine-grained maps of specific hippocampal subregions may add more precise localization to GWAS effects. The ENIGMA consortium is now conducting related, finer-grained efforts using diffusion tensor imaging (Jahanshad et al., 2013; Kochunov et al., 2015) and shape analysis (Thompson et al., 2014) . Here, we evaluated the automated reconstruction of hippocampal subregion volumes as another useful intermediate biomarker for genome-wide association. As multicenter consortium efforts continue to discover genes associated with brain measures, future quantitative genetic investigations of specific hippocampal subregions may point to a more mechanistic understanding of these genes, and how they affect cognition, behavior and neurological illness."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The hippocampal formation is one of the most profoundly disrupted brain regions in many neurological and psychiatric illnesses.
