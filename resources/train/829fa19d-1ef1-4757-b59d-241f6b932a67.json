[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The COVID-19 is a disease caused by a novel coronavirus called 'SARS-CoV-2'. This virus is transferable from human to human and its spreading, and infection factors are very high [1, 2] . Almost three million people are infected and over 200 thousands are died within just four months from 5 it's originating, and it is increasing steadily 1 . The World Health Organization(WHO) has declared it a pandemic [3, 4] . But this is not the only pandemic human civilization is facing, there are many outbreaks had come in the past or it may come in the future [5, 6] . The appropriate drugs, vaccines, infrastructure, etc. are not available up to some stages of any out- 10 breaks. Therefore, mitigate these types of diseases with existing capacity becomes most important in those stages [7, 8] . Many researchers from all over the world trying hard to develop such kind of techniques to cope with such challenges [9, 10] .\nModern-era largely depends on Artificial Intelligence(AI) including Data 15 Science, and Deep Learning(DL) is one of the current flag-bearer of these techniques [11] . Therefore, these techniques could also assist to mitigate COVID-19 like pandemics in terms of stop spread, diagnosis of the disease, drug & vaccine discovery, treatment, and many more [12, 13] . But to trained this DL, large datasets as well as powerful computing resources are required. 20 For a new pandemic, data insufficiency and it's variation over different geographic regions is a huge problem, so here Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) would be effective as it learns from one task and could apply in another task after required fine-tuning [14] . On the other hand edge devices such as IoT, Webcam, Drone, Intelligent Medical Equipment, Robot, etc. are 25 very useful in any pandemic situation. These types of equipment make the infrastructures sophisticated and automated which helps to cope with an outbreaks [15] . Though, such devices are equipped with low computing resources which represent the main challenges of Edge Computing(EC) [16] . As a way to overcome this challenge, transfer learning could be a possible way 30 to consolidate the needed computational power and facilitate more efficient EC. Therefore, DTL in edge devices as an EC could be smart techniques to mitigate a new pandemic [17] . This survey article has tried to report all these issues scholarly as potentialities and challenges with relevant technical backgrounds. Here, we also proposed a possible pipeline architecture for 35 future scopes to brings DTL over EC to assists mitigation in any outbreaks.\n1 https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"}, {"section_title": "Contributions of this Article", "text": "Some highlights of the contributions of this article are as follows:\n\u2022 Presented a systematic study of Deep Learning(DL), Deep Transfer Learning(DTL) and Edge Computing(EC) to mitigate COVID-19. 40 \u2022 Surveyed on existing DL, DTL, EC, and Dataset to mitigate pandemics with potentialities and challenges.\n\u2022 Drawn a precedent pipeline model of DTL over EC for a future scope to mitigate any outbreaks.\n\u2022 Given brief analyses and challenges wherever relevant in perspective of 45 COVID-19."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Article", "text": "Starting from the introduction in section 1, the remainder of the article organized follows.

The possible roles and challenges of these techniques in a pandemic, especially for COVID-19, are mentioned in section 4. This section has tried to bring an overview and general progress of DL, DTL, and EC in the following three subsections. 60 Deep learning (DL) (also known as hierarchical learning or deep structured learning) is one of the great inventions for modern-era of Artificial Intelligence (AI) [11] . Until the decade '90s, classical machine learning techniques were used for making inferences on data and prediction. Nevertheless it had several drawbacks such as depend on handcrafted features, bounded by 65 human-level accuracy, etc [18] . But in case DL, handcrafted feature engineering is not required rather features are extracted from data during training. In addition, DL can make more accurate classifications and predictions with the help of innovative algorithms, computing power of modern machines, and the availability of Big Datasets [19] . Nowadays, DL methods have been successfully applied for several AI-based medical applications such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images analysis for cancer and diabetes diagnoses, conjunction with biometric characteristics, etc [20] . DL is a kind of learning algorithm or model under the umbrella of AI which is based on Artificial Neural Networks(ANN) [21] . These models are 75 trained using dataset through backpropagation algorithm [22] and a suitable optimizer method [23] . The inherent capacities of such DL model such massive parallelism, non-linearity, and capabilities of feature extraction have made them powerful and widely used [19] . There are several variety of DL algorithm such as Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) [24, 25] , Recurrent 80 Neural Networks (RNN) [26] , Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) [27] , GAN [28] , etc. After success of a CNN-based model, called AlexNet [29] , many deep learning model has proposed such ZFNet [30] , VGGNet [31] , GooglNet [32] , ResNet [33] , DenseNet [34] , etc specially for computer vision tasks [35] . In figure 1 we try to illustrate a typical methodology of a DL based screening 85 system, where the system uses a DL algorithm (CNN) to predict whether the X-ray images of suspected patient's lung is normal or having viral pneumonia or COVID-19 pneumonia."}, {"section_title": "Deep Learning(DL)", "text": "In the time of the COVID-19 crisis, when the numbers of infected patients are at a time very high and the disease is still spreading, many research groups 90 are using the DL techniques for screening COVID-19 patients by detection fever temperature, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia, etc. In addition, DL is using or could be used for other purposes such as patient care, detection systematic social distancing violation, etc [13] . As for reference, S. Wang et.al used a CNN based DL for screening COVID-19 patients with an accuracy, 95 sensitivity, and specificity of 89.5%, 87%, and 88% respectively by using their computed tomography (CT) images [36] . Similarly, in another study [37] L. Wang et.al used chest X-ray images for a screening of COVID-19 cases with 83.5% accuracy. The description of such works is in section 4.1.1. 100 Transfer Learning is a technique that effectively uses knowledge of an already learned model to solve another new task (possibly related or little related) with require of minimal re-training or fine-tuning [38, 39] . Since DL requires a massive training data compared to traditional machine learning methods. So, the requirement of a large amount of labeled data is a big prob- 105 lem in solving some critical domain-specific tasks, specifically the applications for the medical domain, where the making of large-scale, high-quality annotated medical datasets is very complex, and expensive [40] . In addition, the usual DL model requires large computing power such as GPU enabled sever, although researchers are trying hard to optimizing it [41, 42] . Therefore, 110 Deep Transfer Learning (DTL), a DL based Transfer Learning try to overcome this problem [43] . DTL significantly reduces the demand for training data and training time for a target domain-specific task by choosing a pretrained model (trained on another large dataset of same target domain) for a fixed feature extractor [44] or for further fine-tuning [45] . strating the main steps methodology of a Deep Transfer Learning approach, where an untrained model is trained using benchmark dataset (task-1) for feature extraction. Then that pre-trained model is further used to tackle a new challenge such as the task (task-2) of COVID-19 by just replacing only few last layers in the head of the architecture and required fine-tuning. 120 So far, many DTL models have been proposed [14] . A few recent are mentioned reported and discussed in the article. In a research study [43] , Mingsheng Long et.al proposed a joint adaptation network. It learns a transfer network by aligning the joint distributions of multiple domain-specific layers across domains based on a joint maximum mean discrepancy. In another 125 study [46] , Yuqing Gao and Khalid M. Mosalam proposed a state-of-the-art transfer learning model based on VGG model [31] . They have used ImagNet [47] dataset for features extractor and their hand label construction images for fine-tuning. Abnormality classification in MR images through DTL proposed in a study [48] . The authors of that study also have used pre-trained ResNet34 model with fine-tuning. In a research practice [49] , a DTL for diagnosing faults in target applications without labeling was proposed. Their framework used condition distribution adaptation. Q-TRANSFER [50] , another DTL framework proposed by Trung V. Phan et.al. To mitigate the dataset insufficiency problem in the context of communication networking, a 135 DTL-based reinforcement learning approach is used."}, {"section_title": "Deep Transfer Learning(DTL)", "text": "As the COVID-19 disease spread is terrifying all over the world, screening, quarantine, and providing appropriate treatment to COVID-19 patients has become the first priority in the current scenario. But the global standard diagnostic pathogenic laboratory testing is massive time consuming and more 140 costly with significant false-negative results [51] . At the same time, tests are are hardly to be taken place in the common healthcare centres or hospital due to limited resources and places compared with the high volume of cases at one time. To combat this kind of situation, the researcher from this domain are trying hard to develop some possible DTL models to mitigate this challenges 145 [52, 53] . As for example M. Loey et.al in [52] use DTL along with the GAN model on their very limited, only 307 chest X-ray images to test COVID-19 disease based patient chest X-ray. Here, they have three pre-trained stateof-the-art model namely Alexnet [29] , GoogleNet [32] , and ResNet18 [33] . Among these three pre-trained GoogleNet give the highest accuracy in their 150 experimental studies."}, {"section_title": "Edge Computing(EC)", "text": "In the era of cloud computing, maximum tech companies in the world rely on very few selected cloud providers for hosting and computation power. The user's data from millions of devices around the world is being delivered 155 to some centralized cloud providers for processing or computation. This data transformation always resulted in extra latency and extra bandwidth consumption [54] . The explosive proliferation of IoT devices along with the requirement of real-time computing power have forced to move the scenario of computing paradigm towards Edge computing. Therefore, instead of relying 160 on doing all the work at a cloud, it focuses to start the computational process close to the IoT devices (near to the source of data) in order to reduce the utilized bandwidth and latency [55, 56] . Sometime in Edge computing, an additional nearby server called Fog is associated between the cloud and the Edge or IoT devices. It locally stores the copy of densely used data from the 165 cloud and it provides additional functionality to IoT devices to analyze and process their data locally with real-time working capability. Hence only the relevant data from IoT devices is need to transferred to the cloud through the Fog server [57] . In figure 3 the hierarchy of a possible framework for Edge Computing as-170 sociation with Fog and Cloud computing is illustrated. The data are collected from various IoT devices are being pre-processed before sending by Edge to Fog server for the analysis and computation with the real-time speed (because of the minimal distance between Edge layer and IoT devices and the local database of Fog). While the cloud holds the central control system and 175 it manages the whole database of the system. The database on the cloud is continuously uploaded by the Fog only when it has important data or information.\nAlthough EC is not a new concept but it becomes popular in the last five years in the era of IoT [58, 59] . Few recent different type of state-of-the-art of EC are mentioned in this section as a way to familiarize the reader with the recent development with the era of EC and its potential benefits in mitigating COVID-19 as pandemic. EdgeIoT [60] , a study of mobile EC proposed by X. Sun et.al. It is a SDN-based EC work with Fog Computing(FC) [61] to provide computational load locally. In a study [62] , F. Wang et.al have proposed 185 a joint offloading strategy of mobile EC and wireless power transfer. This scheme tried to address energy consumption, latency, and access point issues in IoT. In another study [63] , Wei Ding et.al propose a field-programmable gate array-based depth-wise separable CNN accelerator to improve the system throughput and performance. They have used double-buffering-based 190 memory channels to handle the data-flow between adjacent layers for mobile EC. On the other hand, G. Premsankar et.al in their case study [64] have discussed how efficient mobile gaming can run through EC. In a study [65] , S. Wang et.al have proposed a mobile edge computing with an edge server placement strategy. In their multi-objective constraint optimization-based 195 EC have tried reduced delay between a mobile user and an edge server. In-Edge AI [65] , an integrate the deep reinforcement learning techniques and Federated Learning framework with mobile edge systems are proposed by X. Wang et.al. This framework intelligently utilizes the collaboration among devices and edge nodes to exchange the learning parameters for betterment."}, {"section_title": "200", "text": "In another recent study [66] , an integrated two key technologies, ETSI and 3GPP are introduced to enhanced slicing capabilities to the edge of the 5G network.

However, researchers are working hard to cope with the challenges, as results in many computing ideas, optimized model, as well as some computing accelerator devices, comes in picture [68, 69] . Deep Transfer Learning as mentioned in section 2.2 is one such area that is useful where the size of datasets is not sufficient [43] . This transfer learning is also useful where computing resources are not sufficient such as Edge or IoT devices [70] . Since edge computing becomes popular in the last few years, so, we restricted this review to the last five years with chronological order.\nLorenzo Valerio et.al have studied the trade-off between accuracy and 220 traffic load of computing in edge-based on transfer learning [71] . They have suggested that sometimes the partial model needs to move across edge devices and data will stay at those edge devices and vice-versa.

Some of are mentioned forecasting, fake news alert, etc, but more critical parts of this pan-300 demic maybe are addressed by this DL approach. Successfully apply DL in COVID-19 or any running pandemic has three main challenges. The first one is a shortage of reliable datasets. As data collection and validation are a timeconsuming process as well as privacy issues also there whereas a pandemic or epidemic comes suddenly. The second one is the variety of data of a pan-305 demic virus. This COVID-19 virus 'SARS-CoV-2' has mutating itself over different geographic regions, environments, and time [102, 103] . Therefore, the pandemic dataset collected from one region may not be work to drawn inference on the pandemic of other regions. The third one high computational resources required for a DL model whereas to cope with an outbreak 310 IoT or Edge Device (ED) are useful for many purposes [15] . Though these types of equipments have low computing resources.\nIn order to overcome such challenges, cleaver implementation of relevant AI strategies is required. For the first two challenges, DTL and GAN [28] could be a possible approach towards possible solutions. DTL has described 315 in section 4.2 whereas details about GAN are out of the scope of this article. The third challenge could be mitigated using Cloud Computing, Fog Computing, and Edge Computing [104] . However, for Cloud or even Fog Computing latency and data security & privacy could be a problem. Therefore, Edge Computing could be effective for the third challenge, which has 320 described in section 4.3.\nDTL does task adaption that is very necessary for analyzing, diagnosing as well as mitigating COVID-19 like pandemics. The number of studies Most of these works could be easier when AI is cooperating and forming such a model along with IoT or ED [13] . Some issues could be solved by EC as described in section 4.3. Though 350 a better system could be delivered when the most suitable algorithm applied on EC. One possibility of archiving this when DTL implemented alongside with EC which as conceptually describes in section 5.\nEC works on site, so, many benefits could draw from EC with IoT or 370 ED. Nevertheless as mentioned IoT or ED has limited computing resources. Therefore, to get the benefit of modern AI algorithm such as DL it is still challenging. To cope with these challenges researchers from all over the world are working hard to propose many ideas [68, 121, 17] . But so far only a few studies on EC in pandemic are proposed in limited areas of application as 375 mentioned in table 3. Assisting many critical COVID-19 related tasks such as remote sensing-based COVID-19 patient monitoring, Hygienic practice monitoring, systematic social distancing monitoring in a crowded area, etc could be done through EC [13] .

Therefore, to exploit the benefit of DL to cope with COVID-19 or other pandemics are a bit challenging. Therefore, DTL could be effective in this case.

Section 2.3 mentioned the potentialities of EC where computing power is low. Therefore, the merging of these 415 three computing models could be more effective in assisting the mitigation of pandemic situations. This combined model, that is, Deep Transfer Learning over Edge Computing(DTLEC) will take the power of DL through DTL as well as would be applicable in critical sectors by EC to cope with a sudden pandemic. There are some studies that exist in DTLEC as in [68] and some 420 related work mentioned in section 3. However, these works are still in general concept or their proposed methods are applicable only to some others application areas. As per literature studies, this idea has not been studied or experimented to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic.

As in figure 4 edge or IoT devices that are set up in those areas may be embedded with EC, 430 and then it could be connected with a cloud server. A state-of-the-art DL model shall train in GPU enabled cloud server by using a benchmark dataset for feature extraction. Then a pre-trained model(with extracted weight or features except for classification layer) shall push down to the edge devices. In edge devices required fine-tuning mechanism to be implemented into that 435 model with some real data. In this way, the model may ready to work in some critical areas where outbreaks are affected such as hospitals, crowded places, and many more.\nIn figure 5 a typical current COVID-19 outbreaks situation and possible working model are shown. This figure illustrating the proposed framework 440 to tackle the COVID-19 situation by using DTL in EC in both COVID-19 patient care and management systematic social distancing. In the first scenario, we may use several healthcare sensors like blood pressure sensors, body temperature sensors, webcam, etc to sense the data about the running health condition of each patient. Then all of the collected data would be 445 sent to the EC layer where a pre-trained DL based model will be used to process the captured data and making an inference out of it. If the generated report is a critical health condition then an automatic system alert message will be sent with all the details to the hospital control room and also to all the doctors of associated team. In the second scenario, several public place 450 monitoring sensors (like a drone, CCTV, traffic cameras, etc) could be used to detect unnecessary illegal crowd with or without wearing masks with help from the DTLEC-based model. If the model finds any such gathering then an automatic system alert message will be sent with all the details to the nearby police station. 455 "}, {"section_title": "Future Challenges", "text": "This model may be successfully deployed in some critical sectors such as hospitals, airports, markets, emergency service areas, and those areas which are the primary hotshots for spreading pandemics. The model has to be work on real data to draw the inference. In order to make it successfully 460 deployed, lots of collaborative work need to be done, which may face many challenges. Some challenges need to be addressed such as (i.) At first, IoT or Edge devices need to be connected with each other and a cloud server, hence a modified sensor type of networking protocol will be required. (ii.) EC through DTL need be implemented, for that appropriate pre-trained deep learning need be carefully selected after some studies. (iii.) For the transfer learning approach, using only EC is not sufficient, while the adoption of EC-Fog-Cloud combined model would be more useful. A deep learning model shall be trained at a cloud server using a benchmark dataset for feature extraction. After that pre-trained model will push down to the edge where 470 limited re-training (or fine-tuning) shall be carried out to orient a few last layers for required inference. So, at least a small pandemic dataset needs to be created. Here, the Fog server could work as a cluster. (iv.) Security and privacy issues of data need to be addressed. This inquires much more attention by researchers in analyzing numerous vulnerabilities that associated 475 with such outbreak due to rumours and fake news. Besides, the privacy of captured data from multiple sources (things in IoT or individuals) will open a new research direction for the near coming future. (v.) A new simulation model may be required for experimental studies.

It has also proposed a conceptual combined model with its scope and future challenges of working at critical sites and real data. As the running 485 pandemic is very new, so, there is a limited number of peer-reviewed studies and experimental results. Therefore, this systematic study article also considered some pre-print studies which are tried to make some contributions in mitigating running pandemic. The running pandemic definitely will be mitigated but there will be a left over impact on global health, economics, 490 education, etc, so mitigation of this pandemic is necessary to restrict further worsen. Every scientific community of the world needs to think wisely to get prepared cope with such kind of crisis in a case similar outbreaks appear in the future. This article will definitely assist to the research community; especially deep transfer learning and edge computing to work further 495 in developing many tools and applications towards the mitigation of running pandemic or any future pandemic if that could arise."}]
