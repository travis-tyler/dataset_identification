Until then, an increased supply of qualified teachers is needed to reduce teacher shortages.\nDisciplines\nComments"}, {"section_title": "", "text": "D uring the past decade or so, teacher turnover has become a major concern in educational research and policy analysis because of the demand it creates for replacement teachers (Johnson, Berg, & Donaldson, 2005; Kozleski, Mainzer, Deshler, & Coleman, 2000; National Commission on Teaching and America's Future, NCTAF, 2003) . This concern is dramatized by NCTAF's assertion that \"Teacher Retention Has Become a National Crisis\" (p. 21 chapter heading), meaning that inadequate retention (i.e., excessive turnover) has become a crisis. Others have endorsed this per-Eweptional Children spective and stated that the apparent shortage of teachers is due to exceptionally high demand created by an excessive rate of turnover, rather than because of insufficient supply. They believe that the teacher shortage is a myth, claiming that the supply of teachers is adequate (Ingersoll, 1997; NCTAF; Podgursky, 2006) . This perspective does not have wide support; teacher shortage is commonly viewed as an imbalance between supply and demand (e.g., Boe & Gilford, 1992; Curran & Abrahams, 2000) . The main purposes of this research were to quantify trends in teacher turnover phenomena nationally in special and general education and to investigate claims of excessive teacher turnover as the predominant source of teacher shortages.\nTeacher turnover refers to major changes in a teacher's assignment from one school year to the next. Turnover includes three components, the most studied of which are leaving teaching employment (commonly referred to as attrition) and moving to a different school (commonly referred to as school transfer or as teacher migration). A third, but neglected, component is teaching area transfer, such as the transfer of a teacher from an assignment in special education to one in general education. This has been of particular concern to the field of special education (Kozleski et a!', 2000) , albeit little studied.\nThe results of research on teacher turnover have been used to support advocacy for far-reaching changes in education. At the policy level, NCTAF (2003) recommended downsizing schools, offering federal financial incentives for attracting teachers into high-shortage areas, and higher teacher compensation-all of which are designed to reduce teacher turnover. Kozleski et al. (2000) recommended the preparation of sufficient numbers of teachers in special education to fill the demand created by turnover. At the practice level, Kozleski et al. and Billingsley (2005) suggested a number of strategies including effective professional development and reasonable work assignments to enhance teacher retention. In view of this widespread use of research to advocate changes in policy and practice, it is important to have valid, comprehensive, and up-to-date evidence about the turnover of both special education teachers (SETs) and general education teachers (GETs). Yet much is not known, and there are several fundamental issues with the reporting, interpretation, and application of teacher turnover statistics."}, {"section_title": "TURNOVER RATES", "text": "Even though the teaching profession has been characterized as a revolving door (e.g., Hanushek, Kain, & Rivkin, 2004; Ingersoll, 2003) , there is some uncertainty and confusion about the amount of turnover annually. It is surprising that two major recent reviews of research literature on teacher turnover and retention (Billingsley, 2004;  8 Guarino, Santibafiez, & Daley, 2006) did not address the amount of turnover. Instead, these reviews focused on factors related to turnover and retention. A third recent review (Johnson et al., 2005) cited some of the extensive data on teacher attrition and migration collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) as part of its periodic national-level Teacher Follow-Up Surveys (TFS). TFS is a high-quality survey that defines attrition and migration behaviorally by tracking changes in an individual teacher's employment status from one year to the next, as distinguished from simply asking teachers about their intentions to remain or leave in the future. Furthermore, the sample sizes are reasonably large, and the response rates are quite high (Luekens, Lyter, & Fox, 2004) .\nBased on TFS data from school years 1999-2000 to 2000-2001, 7 .4% of all public school teachers left teaching employment, whereas another 7.7% moved to a different school-a total of 15.1 % at the school level for attrition and migration combined (Luekens et al., 2004) . Contrasted with these statistics, an influential report on America's teachers reported questionable or confusing data of uncertain origin about teacher transitions (NCTAF, 2003) . According to NCTAF, 30% of the national teaching force was in transition at the school level during the 1999-2000 school year (15% being hired; 15% leaving). In fact, however, only about 15% of the teaching force was in transition, not the 30% claimed. This is because the 15% hired at the school level one year replaced the 15% that left after the prior school year. The remaining 85% of the teaching force remained in the same school from one year to the next (Luekens et al.) . The source of NCTAF's data is not known because the original research cited (Ingersoll, 2001) did not include such information."}, {"section_title": "TURNOVER OF TEACHERS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "IN SPECIAL VERSUS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "GENERAL EDUCATION", "text": "Based on TFS data for the 1993-1994 school year, Boe, Bobbitt, Cook, and Barkanic (1998) reported separate annual attrition percentages for SETs (6.3%) and GETs (6.6%). Contrasted with these statistics, a major report by the Council for Exceptional Children (Kozleski et al., 2000) stated that SETs leave the profession each year \"at almost twice the rate of their general education colleagues\" (p. 7), without citing the source of this information. This statement is certainly at odds with national TFS attrition statistics for leaving teaching employment. However, Kozleski et al. may have meant that twice as many leave teaching in special education (i.e., the sum of attrition and transfers to general education) as leave teaching in general education (i.e., the sum of attrition and transfers to special education). In that case, TFS data for 1994-1995 demonstrated that about twice as many teachers left special education teaching (15.3%) as left general education teaching (7.0%; Boe et aI., 1998) . Regardless, depending on what was meant, the Kozleski et al. statement is either ambiguous or incorrect."}, {"section_title": "ATTRITION OF BEGINNING", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "TEACHERS", "text": "In addition to the concern about the annual attrition rate for all teachers, the even higher rate of attrition of beginning teachers has been particularly troubling to the field of education. According to TFS data for [2000] [2001] 8 .5% of public school teachers with 1 to 3 years of full-time teaching experience left teaching employment annually, whereas 6.5% of teachers with 4 to 9 years of experience left annually (Luekens et al., 2004) . Based on these data, the estimated rate of leaving during the first 3 years was 25.5%, during the first 4 years was 32.0%, and during the first 5 years was 38.5%. In addition to TFS, NCES conducted the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) Longitudinal Study during the mid-1990s and found annual attrition of only 6.9% for public and private teachers (combined) with 1 to 3 years of teaching experience (Henke, Chen, Geis, & Knepper, 2000) . This survey was based on a national sample of bachelor's degree graduates who entered teaching within a year of graduating.\nContrasted with these attrition statistics, Kozleski et al. (2000) reported that, \"Four out of every ten entering special educators have left before their fifth year\" (p. 5)-a 4-year rate of 40%. Although SETs might have left teaching at a Exceptional Children higher rate during their first 4 years than the 32% reported by Luekens et al. (2004) for all public teachers, it is not possible to verify the 40% rate reported by Kozleski et al. for SETs because no data source was cited. NCTAF (2003) has also reported questionable attrition data for early-career teachers. According to NCTAF, approximately 46% of all teachers leave during the first 5 years. This percentage was based on preliminary data from the 2000-2001 TFS (see Figure 4 note, p. 157). Although NCTAF cited Ingersoll (2002) as the original source of the 46% attrition rate, Ingersoll instead reported 39% attrition during the first 5 years of teaching experience based on TFS data but did not report the TFS year on which the 39% rate was based.\nIn spite of these ambiguities, NCTAF's (2003) conclusion that \"almost half (of America's teachers) may leave during rhe first five years\" (p. 24) has been widely repeated, sometimes without citing a source (e.g., Center on Education Policy, 2006; Smith & Ingersoll, 2004; The Teaching Commission, 2006) . This conclusion may not be a good estimate because it was based on preliminary TFS data for 2000-2001. Furthermore, it certainly does not represent the core of America's teaching force-full-time public school teachers. The 46% rate apparently includes private school teachers and part-time teachers, who are known to leave teaching employment at a substantially higher rate than public school teachers and fulltime teachers (Luekens et al., 2004) ."}, {"section_title": "TEACHER TURNOVER COMPARED", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "WIT HOT H' E ROC CUP A T ION S", "text": "In addition to rese'arch on teacher turnover rates, efforts have been made to compare turnover rates in teaching and other occupations. The Bureau of National Affairs (BNA) publishes quarterly data on employee turnover nationally (e.g., 2002) . BNA defines turnover as leaving the employing organization (this includes migrating to another organization in the same occupation and leaving the occupation), excluding reductions in force. For convenience, we call this corporate attrition, because it is based on leaving an employing organization and excludes transfers between sites within the organization. According to BNA (2002) , the corporate attrition rate in 2000 for all employees was 15.6%.\nBy comparison, the combined rate of public school teacher attrition (7.4%) and school migration (7.7%) was 15.1%, based on TFS data for 2000-2001. However, almost half of this school migration percentage (3.6% of the 7.7%) was transfers between schools within the same district (Luekens et al., 2004 ). In addition, reductions in force account for a small component of the teacher attrition percentage (Whitener et aI., 1997) . Thus, the properly adjusted corporate attrition rate for public teachers in 2000-2001 was approximately 11.5%; that is, the sum of teacher attrition and migration, less school transfers within a district. With these adjustments, the corporate attrition rate of 11.5% for public teachers was well below the BNA rate of 15.6% in 2000 for employees in all occupations-thus, attrition from public school teaching was about 4% lower than attrition from other occupations.\nIn contrast, NCTAF (2003, Figure 3 ) reported a corporate attrition rate of 11.9% for employees in all \"nonteaching\" occupations during the years 1998-2001, and a 15.7% turnover rate (movers plus leavers) for all public and private school teachers for 2000-2001, indicating that turnover in the teaching force was about 4% higher than in other occupations. The 11.9% apparently applied to all occupations; BNA does not report corporate attrition for nonteaching occupations per se. Though NCTAF cited Ingersoll (2002) as the source of their turnover rates, Ingersoll actually reported a nationwide average of 11 % based on BNA data for all employees during the decade prior to 2002, and 17% turnover for all teachers based on preliminary 2000-2001 TFS data. The correct mean corporate attrition rare for all employees during the years 1998-2001 was 14.1% (see BNA, 1999 BNA, ,2000 BNA, ,2001 BNA, ,2002 , not the 11.9% reported by NCTAF. The directly comparable corporate attrition rate for all teachers (public and private) was 13% based on Ingersoll's turnover estimate of 17%, as adjusted downward for school transfers within public school districts, not the 15.7% reported by NCTAF. Thus computed, the corporate attrition of all teachers (public and private) was less than that of all employees."}, {"section_title": "10", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "REASONS FOR LEAVING", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "TEACHING", "text": "In conceptualizing interventions that hold promise for improving retention, researchers focus on the question of why teachers leave teaching (Billingsley, 2005; Kozleski et aI., 2000; NCTAF, 2003) . According to national attrition data from 1994-1995 TFS for public school teachers, some of the main reasons for leaving were a variety of personal and family considerations (31%), poor health (5%), and school staffing actions (3%). Retirement accounted for 27%. Only 24% of exiting public teachers wanted to escape from teaching (i.e., to pursue employment in other vocations or because of dissatisfaction with teaching) as their main reason for leaving (Whitener et aI., 1997) .\nOne of the complications in understanding why teachers leave is the treatment of teacher retirement. Ingersoll (2002) reported that \"Contrary to conventional wisdom, retirement is not an especially prominent factor. It actually ac-countS for only a small part (12%) of total turnover\" of public and private teachers (p. 25)."}, {"section_title": "One ofthe complications in understanding why teachers leave is the treatment ofteacher retirement.", "text": "For Ingersoll, the base for computing the retirement percentage was \"total turnover\"-that is, the sum of all teachers who leave and who migrate to different schools. By contrast, the base for computing the retirement percentage used by Luekens et al. (2004) was just the number of teachers who leave. According to 2000-2001 TFS data, 30% of public school teachers who actually left teaching collected a pension from a teacher retirement system (Luekens et aI.) . Thus, the bases for computing retirement percentages by Ingersoll and Luekens et aI. differ in two ways: the types of turnover and the categories of teachers included. TFS data show that the turnover of public and private teachers differs greatly, including their reasons for leaving teaching. Therefore, aggregated data (as used by Ingersoll) distorts teacher turnover statistics for both public and private schools."}, {"section_title": "Fall 2008", "text": "\nTotal Teacher Turnover By Teaching Field and Year 1 J \u00b7 , .. ,"}, {"section_title": "NEED FOR EXPANDED", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ANALYSES OF TEACHER TURNOVER", "text": "This brief review of research on teacher turnover has identified a range of issues involving rates of attrition and migration, turnover of SETs versus GETs, attrition rates of beginning teachers, teacher attrition rates versus those in other occupations, and reasons for leaving teaching. Little published research has focused specifically on the turnover of SETs and on differences between the turnover of SETs and GETs, even though the turnover of SETs may be higher or otherwise pose distinctive problems for developing a qualified teaching force in special education. McLeskey (2005) reviewed the limited amount of statistics available on the three types of turnover of SETs and concluded that \"These statistics reveal an extraordinarily high level of instability in the special education teaching profession, resulting in teachers moving in and out of special education classrooms at a disquieting rate\" (p. xvii). In view of inadequacies in turnover data for SETs, he stated that more recent data and more extensive data are needed on the turnover of SETs-especiaily on the transfer of SETs to teaching positions in general education (McLeskey, Tyler, & Flippin, 2004) .\nAccordingly, this research investigated trends during a recent 9-year period in each of the three types of teacher turnover (attrition, teaching area transfer, migration), separately for SETs and GETs, using national data produced by the TFSs for 1991-1992, 1994-1995, and 2000-2001. These analyses addressed the main issues in turnover reviewed previously and were conducted with TFS data by the same methods to enable valid comparisons among them.

Special education included 15 main teaching assignment fields such as deaf and hard-of-hearing, developmentally delayed, and learning disabilities. All teachers who designated one of these 15 fields as their main teaching assignment were defined as SETs. Given that these teacher questionnaires included a category for \"other special education,\" all elementary and secondary teachers with a main assignment in any area of special education should have been able to identify themselves as such, regardless of the particular certification terminology used in their home state.

Each rype of turnover can be voluntary on the part of a teacher or based on administrative decision (i.e., involuntary on the part of a teacher). In the aggregate, these three SASS years represent the decade of the 1990s.\nAttrition. The TFSs provided information about leavers, teachers who left teaching employment following each of the three SASS school years. (Those who continued teaching employment are referred to as continuers.) Leaving teaching employment is called attrition. It is sometimes referred to as exit attrition to distinguish from other forms of attrition such as school attrition (i.e., leaving teaching in a particular school) and teaching area attrition (e.g., leaving a teaching assignment in special education for some other teaching assignment).\nTeaching Area Transfer. For teachers continuing teaching employment from one school year to the next, the TFSs provided information about who transferred from one teaching area to a different area (such as from special education to elementary education) following the three SASS years. These teachers are referred to as switchers; teachers who remained in the same teaching area are referred to as remainers. Switching is distinguished from other forms of transfer such as migrating to a different school. Teaching area transfer can co-occur with school migration.\nSchool Migration. For teachers continuing teaching employment from one school year to the next, the TFSs provided information about movers who migrated from one public school to a different school following the three SASS years.

Of the 64 MTAs listed in SASS teacher questionnaires, 15 were in special education with the remaining 49 in general education. A teaching area is a cluster of MTAs that have more in common with each other than they do with MTAs in other areas. Accordingly, we defined special education as 1 teaching area and general education was represented by 11 teaching areas: We based this classification of the 64 MTAs into 12 teaching areas on 10 categories NCES devised for this purpose (Seastrom, Gruber, Henke, Mc-Grath, & Cohen, 2002) . We adopted the 10 NCES categories, and added 2 more (vocational education and other general education) in order to classify all 64 MTAs. Teachers could out-switch at the end of each SASS school year from anyone of these teaching 14 areas to any of the other 11 areas during the succeeding TFS year. Likewise, teachers could inswitch from a prior school year to anyone of these teaching areas from any of the other 11 areas. It was also possible, of course, for teachers to switch MTAs within a teaching area (such as switching from developmentally delayed to learning disabilities within special education). However, within-area switching was excluded from the definition of \"teaching area transfer\" for the purposes of this research."}, {"section_title": "ANALYSIS PROCEDURES", "text": "Based on the samples of public school teachers completing the SASS and TFS teacher questionnaires, we computed national estimates of the weighted numbers of teachers of each type included in the design (along with associated percentages and standard errors) using special procedures developed by NCES for complex sample survey data (Tourkin et aI., 2004) . Because SASS data are subject to design effects from stratification and clustering of the sample, we computed standard errors for the national estimates and tests of statistical significance by the method of balanced repeated replications with statistical software (WesVar 4.2). We performed chi-square tests of the statistical significance of differences in various turnover percentages on the nationally estimated numbers of teachers, with probability levels based on the sample sizes available for these tests. Logistic regression tested the statistical significance of two predictors (teaching field, TFS year, and the field-by-year interaction) of each of the three types of teacher turnover.\nSome of the analyses were performed separately on teacher data from the three administrations ofSASS/TFS (1990-1992,1993-1995, and 1999-2001) , whereas other analyses were performed on aggregated teacher data from these three administrations. We used aggregated teacher data to increase sample sizes for several topics, permitting finer grain analyses (with adequate power) of teacher turnover phenomena separately for SETs and GETs that would not have been possible for separate TFS administrations.\nAs seen in Figure 1 , the annual attrition percentages of both public school SETs and GETs increased steadily and substantially during the 1990s from a level of about 5% to 8%. This trend was statistically significant (p < .001), whereas the overall difference in attrition between SETs and GETs was not, nor was the interaction term of year and teaching field. We tested the statistical significance of differences in the attrition percentages of Figure 1 by multivariate models predicting leaving teaching versus continuing in teaching. The predictor variables in the model were TFS year 0991-1992, 1994-1995, and 2000-2001) ; teaching field (special vs. general education); and year by field interaction term. Teacher attrition in special education appears to be equivalent in magnitude to that in general education during the 1990s.\nFigure 2 presents average annual attrition percentages by years of teaching experience for full-time and part-time (combined) SETs and GETs; differences between attrition percentages for SETs and GETs across years of teaching experience were statistically significant: x 2 (3, N =9,927) = 25.04, P < .001. Just as other research has shown for all teachers (e.g., Luekens et aI., 2004) , the highest rate of attrition of early-career SETs and GETs occurred during the first 3 years of experience (with lower and stable rates during the following 6 years). The main differences were that more than twice the annual percentage of SETs (than GETs) with 13 to 24 years of experience left teaching, whereas more GETs (than SETs) left after 24 years of experience. ence (e.g., 1-3) during the base year (e.g., 1999-2000) . This mean annual attrition rate for a range of years of teaching experience (e.g., 1-3) can be multiplied by the number of years in the range (e.g., 3) to obtain an estimate of the total annual attrition of teachers with that particular range of years of teaching experience. ::~2 % We computed annual rates of the nationally estimated number of public school teachers who left teaching employment, switched teaching area, or migrated to a different school from one school year to the next (e.g., from 1999-2000 to 2000-2001) as percentages of the total nationally estimated number of public school teachers during the base year (e.g., 1999-2000) . Thus, the rates of the three types of teacher turnover (attrition, teaching area transfer, and migration) are directly comparable because they were all computed by the same method.\nFor computing mean annual rates for each of the three types of turnover during a range of years of teaching experience (e.g., attrition during the 1-3 years of experience), we adopted the procedure used by NCES for attrition (Luekens et al., 2004) and by others (e.g., Ingersoll, 2003) . Specifically, the sum of the number of leavers (e.g., from 1999-2000 to 2000-2001) within a range of years of teaching experience (e.g., 1-3) was computed as a percentage of the sum of the number of teachers within the same range of years of teaching experi-Note.

Among the various business and nonbusiness occupations for which BNA reported data, we identified the nonbusiness category (and its subset, health care) as most comparable to the national teaching force. BNA reported turnover at the corporate level; that is, the percentage of employees of corporations who leave their employers annually (excluding departures that are due to reductions in force). For public school teachers, this is equivalent to attrition plus the migration of teachers from a local education agency (LEA; i.e., the employing entity) to schools in a different LEA or to private schools. We termed this specific type of turnover corporate attrition. For public school teachers, corporate attrition therefore excludes the migration of teachers among schools within an LEA.\nAs seen in Figure 3 , the annual corporate attrition percentage of SETs and GETs during the 1990s (aggregated) was comparable (about 10%), but clearly less than that from all nonbusiness occupations (about 13%). The average corporate attrition for all employers surveyed by BNA during this time was 12%. In making this comparison, it is important to recognize that BNA corporate attrition data for nonbusiness occupations excluded attrition that was due to reductions in force, whereas the teacher attrition percentage includes a small component that was due to reductions in force. Thus, there is no evidence that public school teachers left their LEA of employment at a higher rate than did employees from nonbusiness employers nationally. In fact, the corporate attrition rate of public teachers was actually lower than for nonbusiness occupations during the 1990s."}, {"section_title": "REASONS FOR LEAVING TEACHING", "text": "As shown in Table 2 , there is a variety of main reasons given by public school teachers for leaving teaching. To secure sufficient sample size for detailed analyses of this phenomenon, we aggregated attrition data across three TFSs during the 1990s. Even so, the samples for some of the particular reasons for leaving by SETs were small (i.e., less than 30). Therefore, we considered only the subtotals for the five categories of reasons shown in Table 2 .\nThere has been particular concern in the teaching profession that a high percentage of teachers leave (or \"escape teaching\") because they seek better career opportunities elsewhere or are simply dissatisfied with teaching-rather than leaving for personal reasons, professional development in education, and retirement. Escapees, in particular, have some reason for wanting out of teaching. However, as seen in Table 2 , only a minority of teachers leave to escape (about one third Exceptional Children of SET leavers and one fourth of GET leavers, a difference that is not statistically significant).\nOverall, SETs and GETs do not differ at a statistically significant level in their reasons for leaving teaching. In particular, however, a lower percentage of SETs than GETs left to retire, 16.5% vs. 28.8%, respectively, a statistically significant difference: x 2 (I, N = 5,035) = 5.84, P < .02.

Obviously, massive numbers of public school leavers did not secure better employment opportunities in vocations outside of education.

Nonetheless, almost one of every four specific teaching positions in both special and general education was subject to annual turnover during the 1990s. That is, as positions became open through the departure of incumbent teachers, they were filled with different teachers (assuming these open positions were not left vacant or discontinued-rare events according to Henke, Choy, Chen, et aI., 1997) . This degree of instability in the teaching staff of individual schools represents a serious problem that educational administrators must, and do, solve each year."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Clearly, teacher turnover has been high nationally as 22 to 23% of public SETs and GETs either left teaching, switched teaching area, or migrated to a different school annually during the 1990s. This level of turnover is even higher than reported elsewhere (e.g., Ingersoll, 2003) because we included teaching area transfer as part of turnover along with amition and migration. Not only is the rate of overall teacher turnover high, but it actually increased by more than a third during the 9 years from 1991-1992 to 2000-2001 because of growth in the rates of attrition and teaching area transfer. The field of education has allowed this to happen even though it has been recognized that teacher turnover is costly in terms of student achievement, school functioning, and financial expenditures (see Johnson et aI., 2005) . Of course, the impact of teacher turnover must be, has been, and no doubt will be managed every year by our public school systems. Its costs will continue to be paid, however, unless better ways to reduce teacher turnover are devised and implemented to scale.\nWe recognize that some initiatives to reduce the high and increasing rates of teacher turnover have been effective at the state and local levels. However, the cumulative effects of these initiatives have not been sufficient to hair the steady growth of turnover at the national level.

There are three main approaches to dealing with these problems: (a) initiate renewed efforts to reduce each of the three types of turnover, (b) improve the management of the costs of teacher turnover, and (c) increase the supply of qualified teachers-all of which are discussed in the following."}, {"section_title": "ATTRITION", "text": "Our analyses of teacher attrition are relevant to the issues of whether teacher shortages are mostly 24 due to excessive attrition or to inadequate supply and whether the most promising response to teacher shortages is expanded efforts to increase the retention of employed teachers or, instead, to increase the supply of qualified teachers. According to Ingersoll (2001) and NCTAF (2003) , excessive attrition (therefore, inadequate retention) is the crux of the teacher shortage problem because excessive attrition creates high demand for entering teachers. In this view, teacher supply would be sufficient (except in several subjects) if it were not for such high demand that is due to attrition.\nThe results of our research do not support this view. Instead, the evidence presented here suggests that teacher attrition has not been excessive in comparison with other vocations. The attrition of both public school SETs and GETs was less than that in nonbusiness occupations (and its health care component) during the 1990s. In addition, Henke, Zahn, and Carroll (2001) found that the attrition of public and private teachers (combined), during their first 3 years, was among the lowest of several occupations studied. Thus, teaching seems to be a reasonably appealing occupation in comparison with others. If teaching were relatively unattractive, initiatives to improve retention would have more promise of success. Consequently, the most promising approach to reduce teacher shortages is to increase the supply of qualified teachers.\nFurthermore, the perception that the teaching profession \"eats its young\" (e.g., Halford, 1998) is not supported by our findings, even though beginning teachers leave at a somewhat higher rate than experienced teachers before retirement age. Across four TFSs from 1988 -1989 to 2000 -2001 , Luekens et al. (2004 found that attrition was only about 2% higher for public teachers with 1 to 3 years of full-time teaching experience than with 4 to 9 years. We found a similar difference for SETs and GETs separately, with data from the three most recent TFSs. These higher rates are concentrated in the first 3 years of teaching, not the first 5 years. By Years 4 and 5, the attrition rates decline to the overall level seen for teachers with 4 to 9 years of experience (Boe, Cook, & Sunderland, 2005) . A somewhat higher rate of attrition for beginning teachers should be expected as they assess the fit of their qualifications and interests to the demands of classroom teaching. As others have noted as well, some beginning teachers are lacking in these respects and should leave (e.g., Johnson et al., 2005; NCES, 2005) .\nThe results of our research also indicate that that there is limited potential for policy initiatives and improvements in practice to reduce the attrition of qualified teachers in public schools. Only about one quarter of teacher attrition in general education (and one third in special education) is due mainly to teachers who seek better opportunities in other vocations or who are otherwise dissatisfied with teaching. It is reasonable to expect that dramatic improvements in induction pro-Exceptional Children grams, working conditions, administrative support, and salaries would reduce the attrition of a sizable percentage of this group. But such workplace improvements would likely have only a modest impact on the majority of teachers who leave (i.e., those who leave for personal reasons, poor health, job actions, and retirement).\nThus, the results of our research for both public SETs and GETs do not support NCTAF's (2003) perspective that inadequate teacher retention has become a national crisis. Instead, retention seems to have been as high as might reasonably be expected under prevailing conditions. Substantial improvement in teacher retention would require massive systemic changes in the culture of public schooling and even greater allocation of public funds. In spite of enormous efforts to improve public education during the past 2 decades, teacher attrition has increased. Given this, it is unrealistic to expect a level of sustained national commitment of sufficient scope to reduce substantially teacher attrition. Even containing its growth will be difficult. The implication is that it will be more productive for the field of education to make shrewd investments in increasing teacher supply than in reducing attrition.\nIt is unrealistic to expect a level of sustained national commitment of sufficient scope to reduce substantially teacher attrition. Even containing its growth will be difficult.\nIn these respects, the attrition component of teacher turnover is quite different than teaching area transfer and school migration in that only about a quarter of attrition is mainly job-related (most is for personal reasons and retirement), whereas transfer and migration are largely due to job-related considerations. Consequently, there may be more potential for educational policy interventions to reduce transfer and migration."}, {"section_title": "TEACHING AREA TRANSFER", "text": "Even though teaching area transfer (one type of turnover) poses serious problems for staffing schools, its study with large-scale national data has been neglected. Our tesults demonstrate that a somewhat higher percentage of SETs transfer to teaching assignments in general education than leave teaching employment. However, teaching area transfer is characteristic of the entire teaching force. Because both SETs and GETs transferred among teaching areas at comparable rates, teaching area transfer of SETs was not excessive by comparison. Without more information, it is not possible to determine whether the rate of teaching area transfer of GETs has been excessive. In spite of initiatives that may have been made to reduce teaching area transfer, our results show it has been an enduring and increasing phenomenon.\nAlthough the annual rates of teaching area transfer were high for both SETs and GETs (more than 10% in 2000-2001) , the number of teachers transferring between special and general education was not significantly different. Thus, there was no net loss (or gain) to special education in the number of teachers transferring berween these rwo broad fields.\nThere is some evidence from state-level data as to why SETs switch to teaching assignments in general education. One reason is that some beginning SETs, who were prepared to teach in general education, later found a teaching position for which they were more qualified (Schrag & Theobald, 1989) . Other research indicates that SETs switch to general education because of high stress and insufficient administrative support (Billingsley & Cross, 1991) . Unfortunately, TFS did not collect information nationally from SETs about their main reason for transferring to general education or from GETs about their main reason for transferring among teaching areas.\nThese findings suggest some potential for reducing the out-switching of SETs. First, improvement is clearly needed in the numbers of individuals prepared for teaching in special education. No doubt because the supply of such individuals was insufficient, 18% of first-time teachers hired into special education in 1999-2000 had been prepared for teaching in general education (Cook & Boe, in press ). Likewise, stress reduction and improvement in the administrative support for SETs may be possible, as advocated by Kozleski et al. (2000) . Nonetheless, as shown here, the national rates of teaching area transfer for both SETs and GETs increased rapidly during a recent 26 decade. Consequently, it is unrealistic to expect interventions of sufficient national scope to reduce substantially teaching area transfer. Containing its growth will be a challenge."}, {"section_title": "SCHOOL MIGRATION", "text": "As we have shown, SETs moved to a different school at a significantly higher rate than GETs (10.2% vs. 7.4%, in 2000 GETs (10.2% vs. 7.4%, in -2001 . In this comparison, the migration of SETs appears to have been excessive. Without more information, however, it is not possible to determine whether the migration rate of GETs was excessive. Nonetheless, a mover is just as costly to a school as a leaver is even though school migration does not represent a loss to the national teaching force (e.g., Ingersoll, 2001) .\nUnfortunately, we do not have specific information to report on the reasons for SET migration. From this research, we have shown that more than half the amount of school migration of both SETs and GETs occurred between schools within the same school district. In prior national research based on all public school teachers, the main reason for within-district migration was involuntary on the part of teachers (i.e., 51 % was due to school staffing actions; Boe et aI., 1999) . Thus, education administrators are responsible for a considerable amount of migration.\nBased on TFS data for 2000 -2001 , Luekens et al. (2004 computed the percentage of all public school teachers who rated various reasons for moving as very important or extremely important. By far, the rwo most important reasons (reported by about 40% of movers) were opportunity for a better teaching assignment (subject area or grade level) and dissatisfaction with administrative support at the previous school.\nEven though the major factors driving school migration (staffing actions, unfavorable teaching assignments, and inadequate administrative support) are subject to administrative interventions, migration held steady at a fairly high level during the 1990s. Either interventions intended to reduce migration have not been successful or policy makers have not initiated such interventions. Consequently, it is not realistic to expect that the management of public education will be im-proved sufficiently in the foreseeable future to reduce teacher migration substantially."}, {"section_title": "MANAGING TURNOVER", "text": "We recognize that high teacher turnover has been a costly and enduring problem. It should continue to be the subject of research and policy attention with a view to identifying feasible practices that will improve retention. Nonetheless, turnover is endemic to public education as currently organized. So long as this continues, other approaches to reducing the costs of turnover should be designed and implemented. One of these is to improve the management of turnover. With about one in four teaching assignments turning over every year as the national average, the task of managing these transitions is enormous.\nIn managing turnover, it should be recognized that a substantial majority of individuals involved are experienced teachers instead of firsttime teachers. All teachers switching teaching areas and moving to a different school have teaching experience, as do half of new entrants into public school teaching (the other half are firsttime teachers; Cook & Boe, in press). Thus, of the total annual turnover reported here, about 85% of teachers involved have teaching experience. Managing the costs of turnover, therefore, should be focused on issues associated with the turnover of experienced teachers-especially the 70% of annual turnover represented by teaching area transfer and school migration.\nOne cost of teacher turnover is organizational-a cost that can be managed by school personnel. With respect to teachers new to their assignment, it is important to minimize disruption in instructional programs by providing them with the perspectives, knowledge, and skills required to sustain the effective functioning of ongoing school programs and to integrate them into the faculty by opening lines of communication and building cohesion (e.g., Johnson et al, 2005) .\nTo accomplish this, schools might reduce the organizational costs of turnover by offering more varied and extensive induction programs tailored to a variety of specific circumstances. Induction programs currently exist particularly for individuals beginning their first year of teaching; these Exceptional Children should be retained and improved as needed. In addition, different kinds of induction programs should be designed and provided for the major influx of experienced teachers into open positions, that is, for those reentering teaching employment, moving from different schools, and switching teaching assignments (e.g., from general to special education).\nAnother approach to reducing the organizational costs of turnover is more standardization of curriculum and instruction. The greater the similarity between a teacher's training/experience and the requirements of a new teaching assignment, the easier it will be for the teacher to perform effectively. Although most schools will insist on retaining the freedom to innovate and to design programs tailored to local needs, a consequence will continue to be difficulties in inducting a substantial percentage of new teachers annually.\nAnother cost of teacher turnover is financial.\nAs reviewed by Johnson et al. (2005) , estimates of turnover costs vary widely and depend on many variables. The conclusion is inescapable, nonetheless, that the financial cost of the three types of turnover is enormous nationally. Based on U.S. Department of Labor turnover cost estimates, the Alliance for Excellent Education (2005) computed replacement costs of about $4.9 billion annually for teachers who leave teaching employment and who move to another school. Whatever the huge financial cost of teacher turnover, it must be paid. The development of more financially efficient methods for managing teacher turnover represents an important objective for education policy makers, executives, and researchers."}, {"section_title": "TEACHER SUPPLY", "text": "Another approach to the costs of teacher turnover is to increase the supply of qualified teachers. The national shortage of qualified teachers in many teaching areas is due either to excessive demand from attrition or to insufficient supply or both. Our conclusions from this research are that teacher attrition is not excessive in comparison with other vocations and that retention will not improve substantially unless prevailing conditions improve dramatically. This is unlikely; therefore, the supply of qualified teachers needs to be increased sufficiently to satisfY demand. Although the topic of teacher supply is too large and complex to be reviewed here (see Cook & Boe, in press; Curran & Abrahams, 2000; NCES, 2005) , we use special education to illustrate the need for enhanced supply. Of first-time SETs hired in 1999-2000, only 46% were extensively prepared to teach in special education; the others were either prepared in general education or had inadequate preparation (Cook & Boe) . It is not surprising that inadequate supply increases turnover as many SETs switch to assignments in general education for which they prepared."}, {"section_title": "BENEFITS OF TURNOVER", "text": "Although the costs of teacher turnover are a major concern, the benefits of teacher turnover should also be recognized and better understood. Unfortunately, these benefits are a neglected area of research. Our results, however, document some benefits. Of SETs who leave each year, about half are replaced by returning experienced teachers (for GETs, about 38%). This is indeed a \"revolving door,\" but the fact that so many former teachers return is a major asset to the field. Nonetheless, teacher turnover still entails costs, but the costs for training more first-time teachers would be even higher were it not for returning experienced teachers.\nIn addition, much of the attrition of teachers is an asset to the field of education because about one third of leavers became employed in nonteaching positions in education. As we have shown, more than four times as many leavers became employed in nonteaching positions in education the year after leaving than became employed in other vocations.\nA somewhat higher rate of attrition of teachers during their first 3 years of experience is not surprising, and some is probably constructive. New teachers explore the fit of their interests and qualifications for the demands of the profession. Not all are suited; hence, these should leave (Johnson et al., 2005; NCES, 2005; NCTAF, 2003) . And as Wayne (2000) concluded, only one quarter of beginning teachers leave to pursue other careers or because of dissatisfaction. Given these considerations, the somewhat higher rate of 28 attrition for public school teachers with 1 to 3 years of experience is not alarming and some of it is constructive."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS", "text": "Compared with the extensive analysis of teacher attrition and the reasons causing it, reported here and elsewhere, much more research should be devoted to understanding the reasons for teaching area transfer and school migration and for interventions that improve the retention of qualified teachers. In addition, a much better empirical understanding of the costs and benefits of teacher turnover will be useful in assessing tradeoffs and targeting interventions.\nTFS data on teacher turnover represent a 1year change. To supplement this, more research with long-range longitudinal data such as from the 10-year B&B study is needed to provide more detailed and precise information about turnover phenomena."}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS", "text": "Because our results are based on large national probability samples of public school teachers, they should not be interpreted as directly applicable to the state or local levels unless supported by other data from the relevant level. For example, attrition of SETs might be greater in urban than suburban school districts-another topic for further research. Other than the behavioral definitions of teacher attrition and school migration by TFS, SASS and TFS data are from teacher self-reports and therefore subject to errors of recall and bias.\nAs with all sample data such as SASS, the estimates reported are subject to sampling error as well as to measurement and recording error. All estimates should therefore be interpreted as approximate."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "A high rate of annual teacher turnover has been an enduring aspect of the teaching profession and will almost certainly remain so in the foreseeable future without dramatic improvements in the organization, management, and funding of public schools. Until then, an increased supply of quali- Fall 2008 fied teachers is needed to reduce teacher shortages created in large part by teacher turnover. In addition, the field of education should improve its understanding of the costs and benefits of turnover and improve its management of turnover in order to reduce its costs and enhance its benefits.\nWe recognize that rates of teacher turnover are exceptionally high in some teaching areas and types of schools (Guarino et aI., 2006) where interventions intended to improve retention might well be effective and beneficial even though having minimal impact on aggregate national rates. Fortunately, measures taken to improve teacher retention (e.g., better working conditions and higher salaries) will also make the teaching profession more attractive as a career choice and, therefore, will likely serve to increase teacher supply."}]
