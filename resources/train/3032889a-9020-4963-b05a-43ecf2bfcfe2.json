However, the clinical conversion from MCI to AD is unpredictable. Hence, identification of noninvasive biomarkers able to detect early changes induced by dementia is a pressing need. Purpose: To explore the added value of histogram analysis applied to measures derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for detecting brain tissue differences between AD, MCI, and healthy subjects (HS). Study Type: Prospective. Population/Subjects: A local cohort (57 AD, 28 MCI, 23 HS), and an Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (41 AD, 58 MCI, 41 HS). Field Strength: 3T. Dual-echo turbo spin echo (TSE); fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR); modified-drivenequilibrium-Fourier-transform (MDEFT); inversion-recovery spoiled gradient recalled (IR-SPGR); diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Assessment: Normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) masks were obtained using the T 1 -weighted volumes for tissue segmentation and T 2 -weighted images for removal of hyperintensities/lesions. From DTI images, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AXD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were obtained. NAWM histograms of FA, MD, AXD, and RD were derived and characterized estimating: peak height, peak location, mean value (MV), and quartiles (C25, C50, C75), which were compared between groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under ROC curves (AUC) were calculated. To confirm our results, the same analysis was repeated on the ADNI dataset. Statistical Tests: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), post-hoc Student's t-test, multiclass ROC analysis. Results: For the local cohort, C25 of AXD had the maximum capability of group discrimination with AUC of 0.80 for \"HS vs. patients\" comparison and 0.74 for \"AD vs. others\" comparison. For the ADNI cohort, MV of AXD revealed the maximum group discrimination capability with AUC of 0.75 for \"HS vs. patients\" comparison and 0.75 for \"AD vs. others\" comparison. Data Conclusion: AXD of NAWM might be an early marker of microstructural brain tissue changes occurring during the AD course and might be useful for assessing disease progression.

The identification of noninvasive biomarkers with the ability of staging MCI patients is becoming more and more critical for patients' management and clinical trials. While the standard diagnostic criteria for MCI are based on clinical/neuropsychological assessment, 1 several biomarkers, 2 have been proposed to improve diagnostic accuracy, such as medial temporal lobe atrophy, 3 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging measures such as betaamyloid plaque load and index of cerebral glucose metabolism, 4, 5 and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta-amyloid and phospho-tau. 6 However, medial temporal lobe atrophy has been shown not to be an early biomarker, being not evident in the asymptomatic stage of AD, 7 while CSF assessment is an invasive procedure and PET imaging requires the injection of a radioactive tracer that could present side effects (eg, allergic reaction). A large body of literature has demonstrated that white matter (WM) damage is present since the early clinical stages of AD, and strongly contributes to the disease progression. 8 Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is one of the preferred magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for WM investigation in vivo, detecting macro-and microscopic tissue abnormalities. 9 To date, several DTI-derived indices (eg, fractional anisotropy [FA] , mean diffusivity [MD] , axial [AXD] , and radial diffusivity [RD] ) have been proposed as reflecting different aspects of WM microstructure and damage. 10 Against this background it is conceivable that these different DTI parameters may change differently across AD evolution, possibly reflecting different aspects of AD pathophysiology (eg, axonal damage and loss, demyelination, etc.). Histogram analysis has been largely used to analyze data coming from MRI for the investigation of various neurological disorders. [11] [12] [13] This approach offers the advantage, compared to region of interest or voxel-based analyses, of being operator-independent and of summarizing the information from a whole image into a few simple numerical indices.\nThe principal aim of this study was to define the evolution of WM damage as assessed by different DTI-based histogram parameters at different AD stages.

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) were identified by consensus of two trained observers (with 3 and 10 years of experience in head imaging analysis, respectively) on the T 2 -weighted image (the longest echo time image of sequence 1 ), using semiautomated local thresholding contouring software (Jim 4.0, Xinapse System, Leicester, UK, http:// www.xinapse.com/). FLAIR images were used to increase confidence in lesion identification. Binary lesion masks and lesion volumes were then calculated. The T 2 -weighted images were then affine-registered to the T 1 -weighted images (MDEFT) using ANTs. 24 The same transformation parameters were applied to the lesion mask. Then lesions were stripped from the T 1 -weighted images, which were then processed using SPM8 (www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) toolbox VBM8 (www.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm/download/) to yield local volumes maps of gray matter (GM), normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), and CSF. These maps were used to compute global brain tissues volumes (GMvol, NAWMvol, CSFvol). To account for subjects' head size differences, the global brain tissue volumes were expressed as percentages of the total intracranial volume (ICV 5 GMvol1NAWMvol1WMHs_vol1CSFvol), by computing GM fraction (GMvol/ICV), NAWM fraction (NAWMvol/ICV), and lesion fraction (WMHs_vol/ICV).

This way we could create histograms of each DTI measure (FA, MD, AXD, RD) distribution in the NAWM (four histograms per subject).\nAn absolute histogram was created by dividing the full range of image intensity into a number of bins, each spanning a fraction of the full range and counting the number of voxels with a value falling in each bin. Absolute NAWM histograms were computed using 0.5% of the maximum wide bins (200 bins). Absolute histograms were then normalized, dividing by both the bin width and the total number of voxels contributing to the histogram. The effect of normalization is to make the shape of the histograms independent from the brain size. 26 Histograms were analyzed following guidelines available in Ref. 26 , using in-house MatLab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) scripts. To increase the reliability of peak detection, the histograms of NAWM were smoothed using an 8 th order median filter. Next, from each normalized and smoothed histogram, we derived: peak height (PH), peak location (PL), 25 th centile (C25), 50 th centile (C50), 75 th centile (C75), and mean value (MV).

ROC analysis is typically used for two-groups diagnostic problems. 27 In our case (three groups) we used the multiclass problem approach. One method for handling n > 2 classes is to produce n different ROC curves, one for each class. In particular, the ROC curve for class j (with j spanning from 1 to n) refers to the classification performance in which j is the positive class and all other n-1 classes are combined to form the negative class. 27 While this approach can be straightforwardly applied to n mutually independent classes, the three classes involved in this study (HS, MCI, AD) do not fulfill this criterion, MCI being a prodromal stage of AD.

Several previous studies attempted to define the features of diffusivity changes in the advanced stages of AD 28 and to identify correlations with clinical evaluations or measures of cognitive decline such as the MMSE score. However, it remains to be clarified whether a simple quantification of DTI parameters can support patient staging.\nIn the current study we used histogram analysis, which is able to detect subtle global changes in the brain tissue and is particularly indicated when dealing with a diffuse disease such as AD. 29 Histograms summarize the information derived from large portions of tissue (in our case, the whole NAWM) into a curve, which can be characterized by simple metrics. In this work we compared the diagnostic reliability of a number of histogram metrics, computed for FA, MD, AXD, and RD. Our study strongly suggests that the information delivered by AXD of NAWM is the most informative DTI measure regarding the biological evolution of AD in the human brain. The data analysis identically performed on a local dataset (108 subjects) and ADNI dataset (140 subjects) has indeed found in both cases that AXD histogram-related parameters had the best performance in distinguishing AD, MCI, and HS.\nIn particular, with the post-hoc t-test analysis we found that, for the local cohort dataset, C25, C50, MV of MD, AXD and RD were able to distinguish patients (MCI, AD) from healthy subjects. More interestingly, C25 AXD was as the only parameter different in each group and the most sensitive parameter to differentiate either AD Similarly, the analysis on the ADNI dataset has shown that MV of MD and AXD and C75 of AXD were all significantly different in each group, but the ROC analysis highlighted MV AXD as the measure with the maximum AUC value in the two comparisons.\nC25 AXD and MV AXD accounted also for the patients' level of global cognitive impairment of the two cohorts, as highlighted by the post-hoc correlation analysis.\nIt is meaningful that in two independent datasets we observed that AXD was the best discriminator between groups (C25 AXD for local dataset and MV AXD for ADNI dataset). In terms of histogram features, however, we found some differences between datasets. For the local dataset, C25 was the best discriminator, while for the ADNI dataset it was MV. We can speculate on the source of this inconsistency, bearing in mind that these features ultimately reflect the shape of the histograms, which in turn depend on the NAWM masks, on the DTI maps and on the anatomical to DTI space coregistration. All values are expressed as: mean [SD] . Diffusivity measures are expressed in 10 -3 mm 2 /s. All indices were compared between groups using Student's t-test. Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple comparisons (P < 0.05). AD 5 Alzheimer's disease; AXD 5 axial diffusivity; C25 5 25th centile of histogram; C50 5 50th centile of histogram; C75 5 75th centile of histogram; FA 5 fractional anisotropy; HS 5 healthy subjects; MCI 5 mild cognitive impairment; MD 5 mean diffusivity; MV 5 histogram mean value; NAWM 5 normal appearing white matter; PH 5 peak height of histogram; PL 5 peak location of histogram; RD 5 radial diffusivity. Nevertheless, the results of the two histogram analyses converged in selecting axial diffusivity as the best discriminator, and yielded similar AUC values for C25 AXD (for the local cohort dataset) and MV AXD (for the ADNI cohort dataset), therefore indicating a similar group discrimination capability.\nWM damage in AD has been interpreted on the basis of two coexisting main pathophysiological mechanisms 33 : neurodegeneration and myelin damage. The former mechanism induces axonal damage caused by Wallerian degeneration, 34 secondary to the effect of cortical neuronal loss.\nConcurrently, homeostatic repair mechanisms are activated by demyelinating processes, with amyloid and tau accumulating as by-products of these mechanisms. Evidence 34 suggests that in the early stage of the disease these pathological processes coexist and are relatively independent, while at later stages Wallerian degeneration seems to prevail. Reduced AXD and increased RD have been proposed as specific markers of axonal degeneration and demyelination, respectively, based on animal models. 34, 35 However, this interpretation in human brain data has been challenged. 36 In particular, little evidence of reduced AXD has been reported, with the majority of studies reporting increased AXD in multiple conditions, including AD. 37 A previous study comparing these indices in patients with AD at differing stages 38 showed increased axial diffusivity as the earliest sign of white matter change. They speculated that these changes could reflect early inflammatory events such as microglial activation, which has been implicated in AD pathophysiology. 39 In accordance with these findings, we found in both the local and ADNI datasets an increase of MD, AXD, and RD in the NAWM of patients (MCI, AD-probably driven by the latter) when compared with healthy subjects, while only changes in AXD were able to also distinguish MCI from AD.\nThe interpretation of increased AXD as a marker of inflammation is very speculative, and alternative explanations are possible, including some form of axonal degeneration. This would fit with the hypothesis of Wallerian degeneration secondary to distal cortical atrophy, as the neuropathological process underlying WM damage in AD, particularly along the main cholinergic pathways. Currently, our data do not allow us to draw a firm conclusion on the substrate of the measured change.\nRegardless of the pathological substrate, our data indicate that AXD histogram-derived parameters are the most promising indexes among the ones here investigated for patient stratification. With regard to the potential clinical impact of our study, the results of ROC analyses and posthoc correlation analysis are promising. Although these results need to be confirmed by further studies on larger patient populations and different MRI scanners and DTI protocols, the ROC analyses results indicate that AXD features in the NAWM have the capability of discriminating between groups, while the post-hoc correlation results highlight that AXD features account for the patients' level of global cognitive impairment, thus expressing the clinical impact of brain involvement. These findings suggest that histogram features of AXD might be reliable biomarkers to be used in clinical trials (ie, patients' staging and follow-up) and, possibly, as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings. In future work, it will be interesting to test if the classification performance, and consequently the clinical usefulness, could be improved by using a linear/nonlinear combination of AXD features and/or exploiting more sophisticated classification algorithms, such as those used in machine learning (eg, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest).\nOne might argue that neuropsychological assessments provide a comparable performance at a lower cost. However, MRI is typically performed at the time of diagnosis, and current DTI protocols (available on all clinical scanners) would add only a few minutes to the basic clinical protocol. The advantage of imaging biomarkers is that they are more objective and might be more sensitive than MMSE at the very early stages. Clearly, more validation is needed before these tools can be translated into the clinic.\nThere were some limitations in our study. First, this study lacked longitudinal data. Moreover, data for DTI analysis are relatively easy to acquire; nevertheless, recent development in microstructural imaging suggest that more sophisticated approaches 40 can provide more specific information about WM. Future studies are warranted to investigate whether more accurate biomarkers for AD progression can be obtained by applying histogram analysis to indices derived from these advanced models of diffusion. An important observation is that the spatial resolution of DTI might affect the results of histogram analysis. While further investigations are required, the current recommendation would be to match the ADNI protocol. Another potential source of bias is the different resolution of T 1 -weighted and T 2 -weighted data, which were coregistered for the purpose of obtaining the NAWM mask. While ideally one would acquire data with similar geometry, in this case the sequences were optimized for brain segmentation and lesion segmentation, respectively. Regarding lesion segmentation, it is also legitimate to wonder whether, as patients tend to have higher lesion load, this could introduce a bias. However, we excluded participants with lesion volume larger than 25 ml and all histograms were normalized by the total voxel count. This implies that, for every participant, the number of total lesion voxels was at least 20-30 times less than the number of NAWM voxels. Including/excluding in the NAWM histograms such a small amount of voxels would not affect the shape of the histograms, which would be substantially unchanged.\nFinally, it should be noted that the local cohort groups were well matched for age and gender, but the level of education was higher in healthy controls compared to the patients' groups (education is not available for the ADNI cohort). While this may introduce a potential bias, it is a fairly common occurrence in this kind of study.\nIn conclusion, our findings suggest that histogramderived measures of AXD in NAWM might be a sensitive marker of microstructural brain tissue changes occurring during the course of AD and might be useful to predict the rate of disease progression, and hopefully to be used as an index of response to medication in pharmacological trials."}]
