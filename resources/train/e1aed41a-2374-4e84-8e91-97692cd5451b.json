While such policies may increase total period fertility rates, they will be less effective at increasing total human capital."}, {"section_title": "opment.", "text": "3 This paper contributes to the literature by using a novel identification strategy to uncover the effects of a changing maternal characteristic. Unlike race, ethnicity, and innate genetic ability, maternal age at first birth reflects a choice on the part of women that may respond to financial incentives, cultural norms and policy environment. Three biological fertility shocks are employed as instrumental variables for motherhood timing: (1) whether first pregnancy ended in miscarriage, (2) whether conception of the first child occurred while using contraception, and (3) elapsed time from first conception attempt to first birth. They are plausibly exogenous factors outside of a woman's control that shift actual motherhood timing away from optimal or expected timing by about 6 months to 1.5 years. 4 The evidence from this approach builds on previous studies using cross-sectional or within-family comparisons, and expands the range of maternal ages considered beyond the teenage years.\nFurthermore, the paper provides evidence that the channel for the positive effect is not limited to changes in family composition or to higher income.\nThe key relationship studied in this paper is between motherhood timing and child cognitive ability, as measured by Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT) mathematics and reading scores. 5 At the individual level, test scores have long been a strong predictor of educational attainment and earnings, and their importance has only increased in recent decades (Murnane, Willet, and Levy (1995) , Neal and Johnson (1996) , Currie and Thomas (2001)) .\nAt the national level, test performance in mathematics and science is strongly related to economic growth, and may matter more than years of completed schooling (Hanushek and 3 Murnane, Maynard, and Ohls (1981) argues that the general dearth of suitable instruments available to researchers studying families is the result of a lack of compelling theory and the fact that many potential instruments are themselves choice variables. 4 This identification strategy, similar in spirit to Hotz, Mullin, and Sanders (1997) , was first employed in Miller (2006) to estimate the impact of motherhood timing on career path. Sections 4 and 5 of this paper provide evidence supporting the validity of the instruments in the current context of child cognitive outcomes.\n5 The PIAT is a well-known test that has been used extensively in studies of child cognitive development and of its impact on later outcomes. Test takers are not rewarded based on their performance. As a result, scores most likely reflect some combination of ability and motivation, or cognitive and non-cognitive components of human capital (Segal (2006) ). Kimko (2000) , Barro (2001) ).\nUsing data on first-born children aged 5 to 14 in the NLSY79 Children sample, this paper finds delayed motherhood leads to significant increases in PIAT test scores. The relationship is robust to the inclusion of various controls for observable elements of maternal human capital, as well as the use of instrumental variables to address the potential endogeneity of motherhood timing."}, {"section_title": "Background on Child Cognitive Development", "text": "This study contributes to the larger interdisciplinary literature on the determinants of child cognitive development. Although many previous studies have linked maternal characteristics and behaviors to child test scores, this is the first to establish the causal connection between motherhood timing and child ability using biological fertility shocks as instrumental variables. In addition, the paper contributes by exploring the potential channels for the effect.\nPrevious research into the relationship, consisting primarily of cross-sectional comparisons, finds test score benefits associated with motherhood delay.\n6 In order to interpret the estimates as causal, however, it is necessary to assume that motherhood timing is exogenous, conditional on covariates such as education, test scores and family background. This assumption is invalid if women who are more devoted mothers choose to have children sooner or if women who are more ambitious and accomplished choose to delay. In the first case, prior estimates will understate the benefit from delay, while in the second case, they will overstate it. OLS will also be biased for older children if there is a correlation between unmeasured school quality and motherhood delay.\n6 See Roosa, Fitzgerald, and Carlson (1982) . Other studies of test scores, not focused on the effects of motherhood timing, still include it as a control. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Fryer and Levitt (2004) finds significant gains from delay in a model with an exceptionally wide range of covariates.\nMore recent studies exploit the sampling of the NLSY79 to conduct within family comparisons of children born to sisters who became mothers at different ages. Geronimus, Korenman, and Hillemeier (1994) associates teen motherhood with lower test scores using OLS models, but with higher scores in models with family fixed effects. However, the paper uses data only through 1990, and the result appears to be an artifact of the limited range of maternal ages represented in the early years of the data. When the dataset is extended beyond the first 3 waves of the Children survey, the family fixed effects framework yields positive effects of motherhood delay for first-born children that are statistically significant for reading, and robust to including controls."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "The main disadvantages of the within family comparison strategy are that a segment of the sample is lost and a great deal of important variation in the data is absorbed in the fixed effects, thus reducing the precision of the estimated effects of motherhood timing. At the same time, family fixed effects may not solve the endogeneity problem.\n8 The validity of the estimates still relies on the assumption that differences in behavior between siblings are random. In this context, it means that a woman who begins childbearing younger is no different from her sister who delays in any unmeasured dimension that matters for child cognitive development, including parenting quality of either mother or father. If women who are more family oriented choose to begin childbearing before their sisters and also to invest more time and energy in playing with and educating their children, the bias will be negative, and benefits of delay understated. If more capable mothers, conditional on observables, delay 7 See Table 4 in Turley (2003) : in the sample of first-born cousins, the estimated effect of maternal age at first birth on child reading score drops from 0.078 (significant at 0.1%) in OLS to 0.054 (significant at 5%) with family fixed effects. Effects on math and vocabulary scores drop from 0.054 to 0.020 and 0.046 to 0.024, respectively. The full specification includes marital status and income as control variables. Since these variables are likely affected by motherhood timing, and may constitute an important channel for the effects, their inclusion as controls may bias the results against finding a beneficial effect of delay. However, in a pattern consistent with the the investigation of channels in Section 7 of this paper, the additional controls have little effect on the main estimates.\n8 This point is clearly acknowledged in the prior literature. See for example the discussions in Geronimus and Korenman (1992) and Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1995) . childbearing relative to their sisters, the bias will be positive. Sibling fixed effects models will also be biased if researchers fail to account for birth order effects, in this case, of the mothers (Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2005) ).\nSince no single approach is ideal, and previous work has yielded mixed results, it is important for researchers interested in uncovering the effects of delay to accumulate evidence using various empirical strategies. This paper builds on the previous approaches by incorporating the possibility that motherhood delay is a choice that may be related to unmeasured individual-specific traits and life experiences that differ even within families.\n9 Similar instrumental variables strategies using biological variation from miscarriages (Hotz, Mullin, and Sanders (1997) ) and age at menarche (Klepinger, Lundberg, and Plotnick (1999) ) as well as regional policy variation in welfare generosity and access to family planning services (also in Klepinger, Lundberg, and Plotnick (1999) ) have yielded important insights into the effects of teenage motherhood on women's human capital and career outcomes. The biological shocks used as instrumental variables in this paper are selected for their potential to shift motherhood timing for women in their twenties and early thirties."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Framework", "text": "Test performance is generally modeled as the outcome of innate ability, family inputs and school inputs, cumulative to the time of performance measurement (Hanushek (2002), Todd and Wolpin (2003) The baseline empirical model of child test scores takes the following form:\nwhere i provides a unique index for each mother and oldest child pair, M otherA1B i is the 10 Miller and Zhang (2007) illustrates the importance of both quality and quantity dimensions of maternal investment. In-depth observational studies comparing the parenting styles of mothers of different ages have produced somewhat mixed results. There is evidence of a positive association of age at first birth with \"supportive maternal behaviors\" such as praise and affection and a negative association with \"aversive interactions\" such as criticism and physical punishment (Conger, McCarty, Yang, Lahey, and Burgess (1984) ). Barratt and Roach (1995) rated teen mothers in their sample as less appropriate in their interactions with their first-born infants and less vocally responsive than older mothers. However, Philliber and Graham (1981) detected no significant independent relationship between maternal age on various dimensions of interactions with children.\n11 Berger, Hill, and Waldfogel (2005) use NLSY79 data to show that women who returned to paid employment within a few months of childbirth were less likely to breastfeed or to provide their babies with preventative medical care. In OLS and Probit models on my sample, breastfeeding is positively associated with maternal age at first birth, but the relationship is negligible, negative and statistically insignificant under instrumental variables.\nmother's age at first birth, and X it includes child age at testing (flexibly captured by a series of indicator variables), sex, race and ethnicity. In the full regression model, the X it matrix includes controls for maternal characteristics such as test scores, educational attainment, and substance use during pregnancy. The model is first estimated using ordinary-leastsquares (OLS). Later, the exogeneity assumption on M otherA1B i is relaxed, and the model is estimated using the 3 biological fertility shocks as instrumental variables (IV) for motherhood timing.\nIn addition to establishing the overall relationship, this paper explores the primary channels for the effect. This is accomplished by estimating expanded versions of the empirical model that separately include measures of family income and family structure. Although these variables are themselves likely endogenous, it is useful to see how their inclusion influences the estimated impact of motherhood delay, \u03b2 A1B . The first instrument is an indicator for the woman's first non-aborted pregnancy ending in miscarriage or stillbirth."}, {"section_title": "Data Description", "text": "12 Medical evidence does not support a strong impact of behavioral factors on miscarriage risk. Rather, over 85% of miscarriages occur within the first trimester of pregnancy and over 90% are caused by genetic defects or other anomalies that prevent the fetus from developing properly (Porter (1999) ). Since miscarriage has been associated with some extreme behaviors such as heavy alcohol use or drug addiction, control variables are added for substance use during first (or earliest reported) pregnancy, such as smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and using marijuana or cocaine.\nThe second instrument, an indicator variable for contraceptive use at the time of pregnancy, is taken from a combination of two questions asked after each live birth. The first asks if the woman used contraception prior to the pregnancy, and the second, if she ceased contraception prior to conception. The indicator is intended to identify women who first became pregnant \"accidentally\" and in spite of precautionary efforts.\nThe third instrument, time to first conception, is constructed using biennial information on contraceptive use. Among women who report prior contraceptive use, a woman's first conception attempt is defined to start in the first year that she reports sexual activity and no contraceptive use. The lag is defined as the number of years between the woman's first attempt and the birth of her first child. For women who never report using contraception or whose first attempt is identified after their first birth, the variable is set to zero, making it a non-linear function of inferred conception attempt and motherhood timing. A companion dummy variable for \"reported contraception prior to first birth\" is included to remove the potential bias from contraceptive use.\nSince the key variables are based on self-reported miscarriage and contraceptive use, there is a danger that systematic misreporting could compromise the identification strategy.\nHence, it is worthwhile to confirm their validity with outside sources. Although one may be concerned about under-reporting of miscarriages, the 13% rate in the sample is in line with medical estimates of about 15% of all recognized pregnancies ending in miscarriage (Regan (2001) ). While a direct comparison of contraceptive use variables is not available, some general features of the NLSY match data from independent sources such as the Alan Guttmacher Institute and the National Surveys of Family Growth (NSFG). The most popular type of contraception for childless women is the birth control pill, although the pill has been somewhat replaced by condoms for women in more recent cohorts.\nThe unintended pregnancy variable has a mean of 0.33 in the sample. This may seem high when compared with failure rates of properly used contraceptive methods, but is lower than the NSFG reported rates of unintended pregnancy (57% of pregnancies in 1987). The NLSY79 also asks if pregnancies were \"desired\" and women in the sample commonly report that their children were not planned. In fact, the fraction of children who are \"intended\" is quite low. For example, consider responses to the 1982 question, \"Just before you became pregnant the first time, did you want to become pregnant when you did?\" 11.6% of respondents said \"Yes,\" 4.2% said \"Didn't matter,\" 63.8% said \"No, not at that time,\" and 20.5% said \"No, not at all.\" These comparisons provide some corroboration for the accuracy of reported miscarriage and contraceptive use in the NLSY79, and support the claim that biological shocks play a role in human fertility.\nMiller (2006) also shows that the unintended pregnancy instrument is not operating through differences in the type of contraception used. However, the consistency with which a woman used contraception could be a source of bias. Consistency may be correlated with the intensity of preferences against childbearing or with the organizational skills of the woman. The main regressions controls for mother's AFQT score and education, which together proxy for organizational skill. Furthermore, the main results are unchanged when additional controls are included for the mother's and her spouse/partner's expressed desire for the child."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "Another concern that applies to all of the instruments is that the data may be contaminated by systematic misreporting of contraceptive use or miscarriage among women who intentionally aborted. Systematic misreporting, if present, would most likely be related to a woman's religious beliefs and attitude towards abortion, contraception and motherhood. A spurious correlation would exist between religion and the measured instrumental variables, while the true instruments would be uncorrelated. In fact, neither a woman's religious affiliation (at birth or in the present), nor her frequency of attendance at religious services, has any statistical power in predicting any of the three instruments. In regressions of each of the instruments on the basic controls and indicators for religion, the religion variables were statistically insignificant, both individually and jointly, which implies that misreporting is unsystematic in relation to beliefs.\nThe second survey is a biennial panel, starting in 1986, and interviewing the biological children of female NLSY79 respondents. This survey contains child demographic information such as sex, race and ethnicity, as well as the child cognitive outcome variables: Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT) scores. 14 The test was administered in every survey year to children aged 5 and older. These scores are available separately for sub-tests that measure achievement in mathematics, reading recognition, and reading comprehension. The analysis makes use of age-specific standard scores. Average scores in the sample, shown in Table 1 are above the mean of 100 in the norming sample, and standard deviations are below the norming sample's value of 15. An overall scaled score is also computed for each test-taker by summing the scaled scores across the three subject areas. The total test score mean is 13 The main regressions in Table 2 are repeated with 4 additional variables: 2 to indicate if the child was \"desired\" by his or her mother and by her spouse/partner, and 2 to indicate if the \"desired\" questions went unanswered. With the inclusion of these variables, the OLS and IV estimates remain positive and significant with values of 0.53 and 0.89, respectively.\n14 These are included as part of the NLSY79 Child survey. The PIAT is a widely-used assessment with demonstrated high reliability.\n319.12 and standard deviation is 34.5.\nThe NLSY79 sample is restricted to women whose first biological child was interviewed in NLSY79 Children survey, and was born after 1982, the first survey year with contraceptive information. This restriction implies that test scores from 1986 are excluded from analysis.\nThe analysis focuses on each woman's first-born child. This avoids the potentially confounding effects of birth order.\n15 When considering later-born children, the current framework is unable to disentangle the impact of a mother's age at the time of her first birth from the impact of her age at the time of the tested child's birth and from the impact of fertility spacing. Spacing itself may be endogenous, as in Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1995) , where later fertility decisions respond to observed birth outcomes from prior pregnancies. Hence, the results should be interpreted as applying to first-born children, and may not extend naturally to their younger siblings. Table 1 .\n15 Belmont and Marolla (1973) establishes the relationship between birth order and intelligence test scores for the cohort of Dutch men born between 1944 and 1947. The association does not depend on social class or spacing or fertility (Belmont, Stein, and Zybert (1978) ). Kristensen and Bjerkedal (2007) argues that \"social order\" within a family is the true source of the effect.\n16 In a comparison of later-born cousins, Turley (2003) finds positive and significant effects of motherhood delay (measured by age at first birth). When the IV model in this paper is estimated on a sample including later-born children, the effect of Mother A1B is elevated to 1.01 (s.e. of 0.32). However, the interpretation of the coefficients is not as clear.\n17 In a robustness exercise reported in Table 5 , we see that the main results are unchanged when estimation is conducted on a reduced sample of 521 children aged 5 or 6 at the time of testing.\nBefore estimating the full model of the Section 3, it is useful to examine the raw relationships between test scores and maternal age in the data. Figure 1 plots the distributions of total test score for first-born children of women in each Mother A1B category: 18 to 20, 21 to 23, 24 to 26, 27 to 29, and 30 or older. Each figure shows a histogram of test score densities overlaid with a Kernel density curve. Two facts emerge. First, the distributions are largely overlapping. This implies that if one were to repeatedly draw children at random from each of the Mother A1B bins, the child with the youngest mother will frequently outperform the others. Motherhood timing does not appear to be the key determinant of test scores.\nSecond, the distributions are noticeably different, and test scores for children born to older women have greater density at higher scores. The remainder of this section will focus on average differences in scores. Table 2 reports the main regression results for first-born children. The effect of motherhood delay on test scores is positive and significant. The dependent variable is total standardized test score, and each column includes a set of indicators for child age (not reported for clarity). Tests were conducted biennially on children aged 5-14, yielding up to 5 scores for each child in the sample. Robust standard errors, clustered at the child level, are reported and used in hypothesis testing. The coefficient of interest, mother's age at first birth (A1B), decreases by a quarter when controls are added for child race and ethnicity, and by another two thirds when controls are added for observable maternal human capital, in the form of aptitude test score when young, and indicators for educational attainment. Controls for contraceptive use prior to and substance use during pregnancy are included in the next column to ensure to validity of the instrumental variables, but these have a negligible effect on the coefficient of interest. With the full set of controls, a year of motherhood delay is associated with a 0.533 increase in child total test score, statistically significant at the 1% level.\nIf there are unobserved maternal traits that are related to both motherhood timing and to child ability, such as omitted aspects of maternal ability, ambition, and personality, the OLS estimates will be biased and inconsistent. We address this potential concern by instrumenting for Mother A1B with biological fertility shocks, largely unanticipated events, outside of the woman's control, that shift actual motherhood timing away from expected or optimal timing. The final column reports instrumental variables (IV) results, which are larger and less precisely estimated that OLS: a single year of motherhood delay leads to a 0.927 increase in test scores, significant at the 5% level. These magnitudes are non-trivial, equivalent to between 5% (OLS) and 10% (IV) of the test score difference between children of college graduates and those of high school dropouts. A 7 year delay produces gains on par with the black-white score difference. At the same time, as suggested by Figure   1 , motherhood timing is clearly not the main source of test score differences. A standard deviation increase in Mother A1B will lead to 11% of a standard deviation increase in total test scores. In fact, the R-squared value implies that the entire model explains only about a quarter of the observed test score variation.\nThe instrumental variables have strong and reasonable estimated effects in the first stage regression predicting motherhood timing:\nwhere i provides a unique index for each mother and oldest child pair, M otherA1B i is the mother's age at first birth, X it is the vector of controls in the main regression equation, and Z i is the vector of instrumental variables excluded from the main equation. Failed contraception reduces maternal A1B by 0.83 years (s.e. of 0.18, significant at .1 percent), duration of first observed conception attempt increases it by 0.79 (s.e. of 0.036, significant at .1 percent), and miscarriage at first pregnancy increases it by 0.49 (s.e. of 0.25, significant at 5.3 percent). For a typical woman, the instruments cause about 6 months to 1.5 years of fertility shifts. These are small, but not trivial, effects that provide identification in the second stage, where the Mother A1B coefficient should be interpreted as the average effect of a year of motherhood delay due to biological fertility shocks. The instruments are jointly highly significant, with an F-statistic of 180.\nMiller (2006) also provides evidence supporting the exogeneity of instruments. They are uncorrelated with a woman's religious affiliation or her attendance at religious services.\nWhile they predict wages for mothers, they fail to predict career outcomes for women prior to motherhood. This suggests that the IV estimates of career effects are not operating through a correlation between the instruments and fixed omitted maternal factors. As a further validity check in this paper, we exploit the fact that there are three instruments for a single endogenous variable, and test the implied over-identification restrictions. Hansen's J test statistic and its corresponding P-value are reported below each IV estimate. The null hypothesis is that the additional instruments are exogenous (under the assumption that at least one is valid), and the high P-values reported in the tables indicate failures to reject the null.\nFurthermore, IV estimation is repeated omitting one of the individual instruments in turn.\nThe positive relationship is confirmed, although it is not always statistically significant."}, {"section_title": "18", "text": "The next two tables show OLS and IV results from estimating the full model separately for each of the three test subjects: mathematics, reading recognition and reading comprehension.\nThe OLS estimates in Table 3 are positive and significant for each subject separately, and smallest for reading comprehension. The IV estimates in Table 4 are positive for each subject, but not statistically significant for reading comprehension. Some variables, such as 18 Omitting miscarriage leads to a point estimate for Mother A1B of 0.997 (s.e. of 0.41), omitting duration of first conception attempt leads to 0.623 (s.e. of 1.41), and omitting failed contraception leads to 0.911 (s.e. of 0.41). When the model is estimated on the larger sample of all children within the age range 5-14, born after 1982, the effect of Mother A1B is positive and remains statistically significant at conventional levels (1% to 8%) with the full set of instruments or after omitting any single IV.\nmother's AFQT score and college graduation, have similar positive effects on scores in each of the three subjects. Others, such as child sex, vary across subjects; girls outperform boys in reading recognition, but lag in mathematics. Somewhat surprising are the large positive coefficients for cocaine use during pregnancy: since only 17 mothers in the sample report cocaine use, the variable may be unduly influenced by outliers.\n19 These results show that the benefits from motherhood delay are present for both reading and mathematics."}, {"section_title": "Robustness Tests: Sampling and Weights", "text": "One may be concerned that the positive findings presented above are driven by some unusual property of the sample. Results from additional sample robustness exercises are reported in Table 5 . A related concern is that children of older mothers may be at an increased risk for adverse health outcomes such as learning disabilities, and systematically less likely to take the PIAT.\nTrimming the left-tail of the score distribution for children of older mothers would artificially inflate their average scores. This seems unlikely in the data, however, since missing test scores (for a child in the sample) are not systematically related to Mother A1B: under Probit and IV-Probit models, the relationship is statistically insignificant (P-values of 0.48 and 0.877) and inconsistent in direction.\nAs an artifact of the sampling procedure, in which the children of a fixed cohort of women are surveyed, the older children in the sample are more likely born to women with lower A1B.\nTo ensure that this feature is not introducing bias, the next two panels report results from estimates on a reduced sample of test scores: those achieved by children ages 5-8 at the time of testing, and by children ages 5-6. The last group includes only 1 score for each child, and includes children born between 1983 and 1999 to women between 18 and 40 years old.\nAgain, the main results are confirmed, and somewhat strengthened on the smaller sample.\nFinally, one may be concerned that an unusual group of women, either teenage mothers or women who delayed childbearing into their thirties, are the driving source of the findings.\nIn the next two panels, this is shown not to be the case. When teen mothers are excluded, and when the sample is limited to women with A1B between 20 and 29, motherhood delay continues to improve children's test scores. The former restriction eliminates 149 observations, and highlights a key contribution of this paper: while previous studies have focused on the effects of teenage pregnancies, this paper considers the effects of delay for women at older ages. The latter restriction is particularly useful in light of the fact that female fecundity is known to decline with age. The drop is highly non-linear, and is most prominent after the mid-30s. Verifying the results on the limited range of Mother A1B provides some reassurance that the miscarriage and time to conception variables are not being affected by age at first pregnancy attempt."}, {"section_title": "Channels for the Main Effect", "text": "This section aims to uncover the underlying channels through which motherhood delay improves child human capital. In particular, we use observable controls to explore the first two channels listed in Section 3: improved financial status, and changes in family structure.\nThis exercise is important for scientific and policy motivations. As an example of the latter, consider the implications if the benefits to children from motherhood delay run exclusively through financial status. A policy that promotes early motherhood through a tax break or subsidy can also be designed to transfer sufficient wealth to the parents to partially or fully offset the loss in income. In that case, the next generation's total human capital will grow.\nIf, instead, the primary channel is not financial, subsidies will be less effective (depending on the degree of substitutability) at protecting children's human capital.\nThe results in Table 6 provide evidence that income is not the primary channel. The first approach to income draws on a key finding from Miller (2006) Table 2 .\nThe second approach to income is to include an additional control for mother's wage rates in the year prior to the birth of the child. The new estimates are valid for inference on the more limited set of children whose mothers worked in the year before their birth.\nThe restricted sample size is reduced from 4623 to 4019. If pre-motherhood wage rates are positively correlated with an unobserved element of maternal human capital that is transmitted to children, the coefficient on wages is biased upward. The sign of the bias is reversed under the scenario that women with higher ability spouses or partners earn lower wage rates, possibly due to less accumulated work experience. The estimated effect of premotherhood wage rates is statistically insignificant in both columns 3 and 4 of the table. The point estimates are small: it would take an increase in wages of $7/hour (or a doubling of the average wage) to increase total test scores by 0.26 to 0.35. Inclusion of pre-motherhood wage rates leaves the main estimates on Mother A1B largely unchanged in magnitude or significance. Thus, the first two sets of estimation results in Table 6 provide evidence that maternal income is not the key channel for the effects of motherhood delay. In the final specification, the income of the father (spouse or partner of the mother) is included as a control, along with an indictor for missing income information. Again, the Mother A1B\nestimates are largely unchanged: the IV estimate is 0.924 (standard error of 0.41) and the OLS estimate is 0.478 (s.e. of 0.204).\nTurning to the second proposed channel, Table 7 presents results from regressions that include controls for family structure. The first column reports OLS results with all three family structure controls: indicators for mother married before first birth and mother never divorced or widowed, and a count of the number of children born to the mother. Only family disruption has a significant relationship with test scores, with a 3.613 score advantage for children in stable households. The remaining columns contain IV estimates that echo the OLS findings. The additional controls are added in turn and then together, with only marital disruption showing an association. One should hesitate before interpreting these effects as causal, however, since prenatal risk factors and child cognitive development can themselves influence marital stability and later fertility. The key insight from the table is that the inclusion of these variables does little to alter the main coefficient estimate for A1B, which remains significant. The joint implication of this table and Table 6 is that the mechanism for the motherhood delay effect lies primarily in the unexamined channels and not in financial status or family structure. Although it may be tempting to attribute the residual effect to the third remaining channel, the quality of maternal inputs, obtaining direct evidence remains a goal for future research.\nAlthough it is well known that motherhood delay has increased in the United States and in other countries in recent decades (Chen and Morgan (1991) ), the implications of this demographic shift are not fully understood. This paper shows that motherhood delay leads to improved test scores for first-born children. This effect is present even after controlling for observable and unobservable dimensions of maternal human capital. Although financial status and family structure may be channels for this effect, they do not appear to be dominant. These results have direct implications for individual women considering their optimal timing of motherhood.\nThe results also suggest the presence of a \"quantity-quality\" tradeoff that may potentially "}]
