[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Synaptic dysfunction is linked to cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. Thus, measurement of synapse proteins in cerebrospinal fluid may be useful biomarkers to monitor synaptic degeneration. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of the postsynaptic protein neurogranin are increased in Alzheimer's disease, including in the predementia stage of the disease. Here, we tested the performance of cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin to predict cognitive decline and brain injury in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. An in-house immunoassay was used to analyse neurogranin in cerebrospinal fluid samples from a cohort of patients who at recruitment were diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease with dementia (n = 95) or mild cognitive impairment (n = 173), as well as in cognitively normal subjects (n = 110). Patients with mild cognitive impairment were grouped into those that remained cognitively stable for at least 2 years (stable mild cognitive impairment) and those who progressed to Alzheimer's disease dementia during follow-up (progressive mild cognitive impairment). Correlations were tested between baseline cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin levels and baseline and longitudinal cognitive impairment, brain atrophy and glucose metabolism within each diagnostic group. Cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin was increased in patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia (P 5 0.001), progressive mild cognitive impairment (P 5 0.001) and stable mild cognitive impairment (P 5 0.05) compared with controls, and in Alzheimer's disease dementia (P 5 0.01) and progressive mild cognitive impairment (P 5 0.05) compared with stable mild cognitive impairment. In the mild cognitive impairment group, high baseline cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin levels predicted cognitive decline as reflected by decreased Mini-Mental State Examination (P 5 0.001) and increased Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (P 5 0.001) scores at clinical follow-up. In addition, high baseline cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin levels in the mild cognitive impairment group correlated with longitudinal reductions in cortical glucose metabolism (P 5 0.001) and hippocampal volume (P 5 0.001) at clinical follow-up. Furthermore, within the progressive mild cognitive impairment group, elevated cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin levels were associated with accelerated deterioration in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (b = 0.0017, P = 0.01). These data demonstrate that cerebrospinal fluid neurogranin is increased already at the early clinical stage of Alzheimer's disease and predicts cognitive deterioration and disease-associated changes in metabolic and structural biomarkers over time.\nInitiative; FDG = 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose; MCI = mild cognitive impairment; MMSE = Mini-Mental State Examination; PBS = phosphate-buffered saline 3374 | BRAIN 2015: 138; 3373-3385 "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and a major health problem. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by pathological hallmarks including neuronal and synaptic degeneration and loss together with deposits of aggregated amyloid-b and tau (Blennow et al., 2010) . Biochemical (including CSF measurements of amyloid-b 42 and tau) and neuroimaging (including PET and MRI) biomarkers may be used to monitor amyloid-b and tau pathology, cortical glucose metabolism and atrophy (Dubois et al., 2014) . 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET is a marker of cortical glucose metabolism that may be related to synaptic function (Mosconi et al., 2008) , but until recently, no biomarker reflecting the synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease has been available.\nSynaptic dysfunction and loss are directly linked to memory disturbances and other cognitive symptoms already at the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, and are believed to precede neuronal degeneration and loss (DeKosky et al., 1990; Bertoni-Freddari et al., 1996) . Neuropathological studies have shown that synaptic loss is evident already at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of Alzheimer's disease (Masliah et al., 2001; Scheff et al., 2007) and is more strongly correlated to the degree of cognitive dysfunction than plaque and tangle pathology (Davies et al., 1987; Blennow et al., 1996; Sze et al., 1997; Masliah et al., 2001) . Thus, because synaptic loss occurs early and correlates with cognitive deficits in patients with Alzheimer's disease, biomarkers reflecting this pathophysiological process could be useful for studies of disease mechanisms, to improve tools for early diagnosis and prognosis, and to monitor drug effects on synaptic degeneration in clinical trials of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease.\nWe have previously shown that several pre-and postsynaptic proteins, such as SNAP25, synaptotagmin and neurogranin, are detectable in CSF (Davidsson et al., , 1999 . Neurogranin is a post synaptic protein that is enriched in dendritic spines and plays an important role in long-term potentiation and memory consolidation (Gerendasy et al., 1997; Pak et al., 2000; Huang et al., 2004) , which are abnormal in Alzheimer's disease. It contains a calmodulin-binding IQ domain that interacts with and sequesters apo-calmodulin (the Ca 2 + -free form of calmodulin). On rise of the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration, neurogranin releases calmodulin, freeing it to bind Ca 2 + and activate downstream signalling molecules (Hayashi, 2009 ). In a pilot study, we showed by immunoprecipitation and semi-quantitative western blotting that CSF neurogranin is increased in Alzheimer's disease dementia and correlates with abnormally elevated levels of CSF tau (Thorsell et al., 2010) .\nTo investigate the potential of CSF neurogranin as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, we recently produced monoclonal antibodies directed against neurogranin C-terminal regions and showed by mass spectrometry that neurogranin is metabolized into a series of endogenous peptides derived from the C-terminal part of the protein (Kvartsberg et al., 2014) . We further developed and used a hybrid immunoaffinity-mass spectrometry method and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to analyse and quantify CSF neurogranin (Kvartsberg et al., 2014) . In three independent clinical cohorts, a marked increase in CSF neurogranin levels was found in patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia as well as in the MCI stage of the disease (prodromal Alzheimer's disease) compared to controls, with higher CSF neurogranin levels correlating with a more rapid change in cognition during clinical follow-up (Kvartsberg et al., 2014) . These findings suggest that CSF neurogranin is altered in early stage Alzheimer's disease and correlates with cognitive decline.\nIn this study, we present results on CSF neurogranin in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort of cognitively healthy controls, subjects with MCI and patients with Alzheimer's disease dementia. We tested the specific hypotheses that CSF neurogranin is increased in Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy control, that high CSF neurogranin predicts MCI conversion to Alzheimer's disease dementia and that CSF neurogranin correlates with changes in cognition and Alzheimer's disease molecular pathophysiology, as reflected by FDG-PET and MRI, over time."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of MCI and early Alzheimer's disease. The Principal Investigator of this initiative is Michael W. Weiner, MD, VA Medical Center and University of California -San Francisco. ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the USA and Canada.

Even though there are several neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease, including amyloid-b and tau pathology, synaptic pathology is not only a very early change, but is probably also the direct substrate of cognitive decline, showing a tight correlation with degree of cognitive symptoms and dementia (Davies et al., 1987; Blennow et al., 1996; Masliah et al., 2001; Sze et al., 1997) . A biomarker reflecting this pathophysiologic process may be useful for studies of the underlying disease mechanisms contributing to Alzheimer's disease, to predict progression of disease and may serve as a surrogate marker in treatment trials to monitor effects on reducing the rate of synaptic degeneration. Therefore, in the present study we evaluated CSF neurogranin levels in the ADNI cohort and investigated its performance to predict cognitive decline and indices of brain injury. Neurogranin is highly expressed in the same grey matter brain regions that are affected in Alzheimer's disease, i.e. the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, while it is almost absent in the thalamus, cerebellum, brainstem and the spinal cord (Represa et al., 1990) . This synaptic protein is primarily expressed in excitatory neurons and is concentrated in distal dendrites and dendritic spines (Alvarez-Bolado et al., 1996) , where it regulates calmodulin availability, thereby playing an important role in the regulation of synaptic signalling, long-term potentiation induction and memory consolidation (Baudier et al., 1991; Huang et al., 1993; Diez-Guerra, 2010) . Consequently, this synaptic protein may thus serve as a biomarker to monitor an important aspect of Alzheimer's disease molecular pathogenic mechanisms that previously has been difficult to assess in living patients.\nCSF neurogranin was significantly increased in Alzheimer's disease dementia and progressive MCI as compared with healthy control. These findings validate our previous study in which we showed an increase in CSF neurogranin levels in Alzheimer's disease dementia and progressive MCI (Kvartsberg et al., 2014) . In that study, we demonstrated that neurogranin is metabolized into a series of C-terminal peptides using hybrid immunoaffinity-mass spectrometry and that the endogenous peptide neurogranin , which is the dominating endogenous peptide in human brain tissue, is significantly increased in Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy control subjects (Kvartsberg et al., 2014) . In two independent clinical cohorts including Alzheimer's disease dementia and healthy control subjects, the samples were analysed by both hybrid immunoaffinity-mass spectrometry and an in-house developed immunoassay and the results were highly correlated in both clinical studies. In our previous study, we also showed that progressive MCI patients had increased CSF neurogranin levels compared to stable MCI (Kvartsberg et al., 2014) , a finding that we confirmed in the present study. In conclusion, CSF neurogranin is significantly increased in Alzheimer's disease dementia and progressive MCI as compared to healthy control and also in progressive MCI as compared to stable MCI.\nBiomarkers for pathological changes that are present before overt clinical onset would be highly valuable in longitudinal clinical studies on Alzheimer's disease. To investigate whether CSF neurogranin levels can be used to identify MCI patients with an underlying amyloid-b pathology, each group included in the study was dichotomized into either amyloid-positive (amyloid-b 1-42 5 192 pg/ml) or amyloid-negative (amyloid-b 1-42 4 192 pg/ml). As expected, the CSF neurogranin levels were significantly increased in the CSF amyloid-b-positive Alzheimer's disease group. In addition, high CSF neurogranin levels were also found in the amyloid-positive progressive MCI group, suggesting that CSF neurogranin is an early pathophysiological marker of Alzheimer's disease-related synaptic loss. This is further supported by the finding that the 32 healthy control subjects who converted to MCI or Alzheimer's disease dementia during follow-up had increased CSF neurogranin levels compared to the other healthy control subjects and the finding that high CSF neurogranin correlated with a more rapid rate of cognitive decline in MCI patients. When evaluating CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease, it is important to consider that there is a continuum of pathology, e.g. in amyloid plaque numbers, without any clear discrimination between patients with Alzheimer's disease and cognitively intact elderly who died from other reasons (Curtis et al., 2015) . Further, mixed pathology is very common in elderly patients with dementia. Indeed, elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease have multiple pathologies; except for tangles and plaques a large proportion also have TDP-43 and -synuclein as well as vascular pathologies (Kovacs et al., 2013) . Cerebrovascular co-morbidities such as subtle hippocampal ischaemic injury and cerebral cortical microinfarcts cannot be consistently identified, even using high resolution MRI. This overlap in pathology may confound the diagnostic performance of a putative Alzheimer's disease biomarker. In agreement with this reasoning, the best diagnostic separation for CSF neurogranin was found when dichotomizing the diagnostic groups into CSF amyloid-b-positive and negative subgroups.\nThe current data set also allowed us to examine the associations of CSF neurogranin levels with two other key biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease: hippocampal atrophy rate measured by volumetric MRI and cortical glucose metabolism assessed by FDG-PET. We found associations between high CSF neurogranin levels and increased rate of hippocampal atrophy as well as reductions in cortical glucose metabolism, especially when testing the combined MCI group. Considering that synaptic dysfunction and loss probably is the main cause of the reduced cortical glucose metabolism in Alzheimer's disease and that loss of neuropil (i.e. neurites, and pre-and postsynaptic elements) underlie hippocampal atrophy, we suggest that CSF neurogranin indeed is an independent novel biomarker for synaptic pathology in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.\nIn conclusion, our findings support the use of CSF neurogranin as a biomarker for synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease. CSF neurogranin was increased already in predementia stages of Alzheimer's disease and higher concentrations correlated with a higher rate of cognitive deterioration, decreased glucose metabolism and higher hippocampal atrophy rates. We propose that CSF neurogranin levels are an independent measure of synaptic integrity which previously has been difficult to assess in living patients. Future studies may further explore this biomarker in relation to other aspects of Alzheimer's disease, as well as in other neurodegenerative disorders, and for its potential roles in clinical research, trials and practice."}]
