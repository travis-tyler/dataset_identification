[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Until recently, the biologic, aesthetic, and economic values of wetlands were largely unappreciated. United States federal legislation, such as the Swamp Lands Act of 1850 and farming innovations, encouraged the draining of wetlands. In the 1930's and 1940's, the US government provided free engineering services to farmers who wanted to drain their lands (Dahl and Johnson 1991). Much ecosystem damage has been done and the conterminous United States has lost over half of its wetlands (Dahl and Johnson 1991). Some states have lost more wetlands than others. For example, California has lost over 91% of its wetlands whereas Maryland has lost over 64% (Dahl and Johnson 1991;Tiner 2005). In the last half of the 20th century, public recognition of the value of wetlands along with concern over accelerating rates of wetland loss led to a change in society's perception of wetlands. Interest in wetland conservation has increased and new governmental policies (e.g., the Highly Erodible Land Conservation and Wetland Conservation Compliance (Swampbuster) provisions that were introduced in the 1985 US Farm Bill) have removed most of the wetland drainage incentives for agricultural lands. Other US legislative acts, such as the Clean Water Act (which grew out of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948Act of as amended in 1972Act of and 1977, are now used to protect wetlands Wetland protection is further supported by the US federal no net wetland loss\" policy (Federal Geographic Data Committee 1994). Efforts are being made to conserve remaining wetlands and many policies have been adopted in support of this goal. Accurate and up to date wetland maps assist in the proper implementation of wetland regulations. For the United States to effectively manage its remaining wetlands, their abundance, distribution, boundaries, and quality must be better understood. The way in which society interacts with wetlands is largely dependent on what value they assign to these natural resources. This value is subjective and is often measured by the function that the resource serves. Therefore, a better understanding of wetland ecosystem functioning within the landscape is necessary in order for society to place a value on wetlands (National Research Council 1995). As natural resource management becomes more holistic and moves towards ecosystem management, the synoptic view that remotely sensed data provides will become increasingly important (Finlayson and van der Valk 1995;Klemas 2001). Remote observation of wetlands is particularly necessary because they are often difficult to access on the ground, and on-site mapping at the landscape scale is usually cost prohibitive (Harvey and Hill 2001;Rundquist et al. 2001;Baker et al. 2006;Silva et al. 2008). Remotely sensed imagery has the potential to add to our understanding of wetlands within the wider landscape setting and to better ensure their preservation via an increased understanding, more informed management practices, and a heightened appreciation of this unique resource. Remotely sensed data can be used to create not only maps of wetland presence, but also estimates of wetland condition and function (Rosenqvist et al. 2007). Significant effort has been made by scientists and managers to provide quality map products and recently developed remote sensing technologies have the potential to further improve their detail and reliability. The diversity of remotely sensed data and the techniques available to process these data have increased rapidly since the 1970's, when the US first began to systemically map national wetland resources. Still, the dynamic nature of these ecosystems (e.g., ephemeral hydrology), their diversity (e.g., variations in plant structure and phenology), and the often small proportion of the landscape that they occupy challenge existing sensors. Recent advances in the quality and availability of radar, lidar, and other types of data, as well as the introduction of new processing methods hold great potential for the furthering of regional wetland mapping and monitoring efforts. These different geospatial datasets provide complementary information about wetland presence and function. This paper reviews the advantages and disadvantages of applying different types of remotely sensed data, including aerial photographs, multi-spectral, hyperspectral, passive microwave, radar, and lidar data, to the mapping and monitoring of wetlands."}, {"section_title": "CURRENT US REGIONAL WETLAND MAPPING PROGRAMS", "text": "Multiple state and federal agencies have produced regional wetland maps over the last thirty-five years and these maps have developed rapidly. One of the most common wetland mapping methods uses both remotely sensed and field data. Natural resource managers have been using a combination of remotely sensed imagery and field data since the 1970's and the techniques and the quality of data used have been rapidly evolving. In the past, most maps were produced by government agencies, such as the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), but today private organizations are also contributing to the effort. Two commonly relied upon US federal wetland mapping programs are discussed below."}, {"section_title": "NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program", "text": "The NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) is a nationally standardized database of land cover and habitat change produced for the coastal areas of the United States (NOAA 2008). This regularly updated database was established in the 1990's to assist scientists, mangers and regulators in better understanding the coastal environment, the interactions between major land cover types (e.g., wetlands and uplands), and the impact of those interactions on marine organisms (Dobson et al. 1995). In doing so, C-CAP promotes an ecosystem-based approach to natural resource management. Unlike NWI, C-CAP maps are created in a digital environment using image processing software. It primarily relies on digital satellite imagery, field data, and other ancillary data in a geographic information system (GIS) format (Dobson et al 1995). C-CAP maps have been produced for multiple dates, at 30 m spatial resolution. Current efforts are focused on adding additional dates and production of finer resolution products in specific regions (Nate Herald 2008 personal communication). Data summaries, reports, and digital maps are available online (www.csc.noaa.gov /landcover). C-CAP is produced in coordination with several other federal agencies as part of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), facilitated by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium, and serves as the coastal portion of NLCD. Map production methods are nearly identical to those used to produce NLCD data (www.mrlc.gov ) for the interior portion of the US, with the largest difference being that C-CAP includes additional wetland classes which are not mapped in the interior of the US. Similar to NLCD, C-CAP primarily relies on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data, although additional satellite imagery is used in some regions. These additional imagery sources include Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS). Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) High Resolution Visible (HRV) data, IKONOS, and Quickbird (Dobson et al. 1995;NOAA 2008). The finer resolution imagery, such as IKONOS and Quickbird, are used to gather more detailed information for training or in areas of enhanced interest (e.g., areas of rapid change; Nate Herold 2008 personal communication). In addition to the standard NLCD land cover classes, C-CAP also maps palustrine forested, palustrine scrub/shrub, pal ustrine emergent, estuarine forested, estuarine scrub/shrub, and estuarine emergent wetlands, as well as palustrine aquatic beds, and estuarine aquatic beds. In this way, C-CAP contains more detailed wetland classes than NLCD created for the interior of the country but it is less detailed than NW!, providing less information about hydrologic regime and other parameters. C-CAP products from different years are compared to determine the amount, rate and types of changes to land cover which have occurred between map dates. By doing so, C-CAP can be used to assess cumulative impacts of land cover change on ecosystem health (e.g., water quality and habitat quality). Although its coarser spatial resolution makes C-CAP more suitable for regional rather than finer scale applications, it has been found to be relatively accurate. In addition its standardized, digital production aids in timely distribution of consistent, up to date maps. In 1991, field data were used to investigate the reliability of NWI and C-CAP maps. Random locations were examined and NWI was found to be 88-100% accurate while C-CAP was found to be 63-97% accurate (Burgess 1995). Henderson et al. (1998) found that C-CAP data were useful for parameterizing non-point source pollution water quality models. The integration of wetland and upland land cover categories makes C-CAP particularly well suited for parameterizing water quality models since many models have been designed to import land cover data but few ingest wetland specific maps. Although the models may not distinguish between all wetland categories present in C-CAP, the fact that they are available, readily ingested and easily collapsible into more generalized NLCD categories makes their use more likely in the future. Both C-CAP and NW! are exploring different methods for rapidly updating their maps. One of these methods is cross-correlation analysis (CCA), a technique developed to detect changes in land cover using multispectral satellite data (Koeln and Bissonnette 1999). 1-louhoulis and Michener 2000have developed a similar process that can also be used to update wetland maps although this particular method is not currently used by C-CAP. An important advantage to these methods is that coarser resolution digital data can be used to rapidly screen for changes in areas which were originally mapped with more costly, finer resolution imagery."}, {"section_title": "Other Wetland Mapping Efforts", "text": "NW! and C-CAP are two examples of regional wetland maps being used today. Other federal efforts to map or monitor wetlands include the US Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) National Resource Inventory. NRCS also produces the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO). Although SSURGO is not a map of current wetlands, it does contain information on hydric or wetland soils which can be used to infer either current or historic wetland presence. If a hydric soil is present, this usually indicates that a wetland either is or was once present at the location. In addition, some states are also producing their own wetland maps. For example, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources produces detailed wetland maps I I using a methodology similar to the US FWS NW! program (Burgess 1995). The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation also produces wetland inventory maps based on photo i nterpretati on of aerial photographs (Johnston and Meysembourg 2002;New York State Department of Environmental Conservation 2008). As an increasing number of federal, state, and local agencies within the US have produced their own wetland maps, it has become increasingly important to develop a wetland mapping standard so that these maps can be compared across jurisdictional lines and dates. Since 1993, the Wetlands Subcommittee of the Federal Geographic Data Committee has been working to coordinate and integrate the collection of wetlands data by various US government agencies. This integration is divided into four increments: I) standardize terminology, definitions, and classification schemes used by government agencies to gather information concerning wetlands; 2) coordinate the collection of wetlands data by government agencies; 3) evaluate the consistency of wetlands data and statistical results collected by government agencies; and 4) analyze the public policy implications and feasibility of the coordination of wetlands information. This program has made improvements on the coordination of government agencies involved in wetlands data collection (Federal Geographic Data Committee 1996;Shapiro 1995;Federal Geographic Data Committee 1994) and a draft wetland mapping standard was available online (www.fgdc.gov ) at the time this chapter was written. The purpose of this standard is to enhance current and future, but not -Remote Sensing Data for Regional Wetland 'vlapping in the L nited States 79 necessarily historic, wetland mapping efforts. The standard specifies minimum data quality standards for inclusion in the US National Spatial Data Infrastructure when these activities are conducted or funded by the US federal government (Federal Geographic Committee 2007)."}, {"section_title": "WETLAND HYDROPERIOD: A KEY WETLAND MAPPING PARAMETER", "text": "By basic definition, wetlands are simply wet-lands (Reed 1993). For that reason, one of the main parameters that should be considered when mapping wetlands is wetland hydrology. Fluctuations in the areal extent, duration, and frequency of wetland flooding and soil saturation are called wetland hydropattern or hydroperiod (National Research Council 1995;Mitsch and Gosselink 2007). Wetland hydroperiod results from all transfers of water into and out of a wetland (National Research Council 1995;Mitsch and Gosselink 2007). Although numerous factors interact to influence wetlands, hydroperiod is the single most important force controlling not only the formation, and therefore the location, but also the functioning of a wetland (Reed 1993;Nestler and Long 1997;Mitsch and Gosselink 2000;Baghdadi et al. 2001;Toyra et al. 2002;Bartsch et al. 2007;Beeri and Phillips 2007;Martinez and Le loan 2007). Since wetlands are often situated at a hydrologic edge (Chopra et al. 2001;Chiu and Couloigner 2006), small changes in hydrologic regime can cause substantial changes in ecosystem characteristics and function (Mitsch and Gosselink 2000). Hydrologic conditions control important abiotic factors, which in turn influence wetland biogeochemistry, soils, and vegetation. Wetland chemistry, soils, and vegetation are therefore unique and they interact to serve a variety of functions valued by society, such as pollution reduction and flood control (Whitehead and Thompson 1993;Richardson 1994;Hruby et al. 1995;Whigham 1996;Poor 1999;Woodward and Wui 2001;Baker et al. 2006). Approximately half of all animal and plant species included on the US threatened or endangered species list depend on wetlands during a portion of their lives (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2002). Information on hydroperiod can be used to infer the types of functions that may be served by a wetland (Nestler and Long 1997;Cole and Brooks 2000;Mitsch and Gosselink 2007). Wetland soils (hydric soils) and vegetation (hydrophilic vegetation) can often be distinguished from upland soils and vegetation on remotely sensed images. Additionally, remotely sensed data can discern subtle topographic features that greatly influence the function of wetlands. Certain conditions (e.g., topographic depressions) can encourage the concentration of water and therefore the origination of wetland hydrology. Moreover, coarser landforms that favor the formation of wetlands, such as the margins of stream, can also provide important clues to the location of wetlands. For the above stated reasons, remote sensors (i.e., people who analyze remotely sensed images) monitor wetland hydrology, hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and/or conditions which encourage the concentration of water to map wetlands."}, {"section_title": "DIFFICULTIES INHERENT IN WETLAND MAPPING", "text": "Regardless of the methodology used to map wetlands, there are numerous difficulties inherent in the mapping process. These limitations may be related to a variety of factors including the character of the wetland being mapped, the map scale, the natural conditions present at the time of data collection, the spectral and spatial resolution of the imagery used, the software and hardware used to process the data, and the skill of the image processor (Tiner 1999). It should be noted that the specifications necessary to produce a \"good\" wetland map depend heavily on what that map is being used for. For example, a relatively fine scale wetland map like NWI may not be necessary when assessing wetland abundance at a global scale but it would be helpful when attempting to determine exactly where to locate a wetland mitigation site. Similarly, it may be less important to use a wetland map that accurately delineates forested wetlands if a researcher or natural resource manager is trying to locate potential habitat for an endangered bird which only lives in marshes, wetlands with nonwoody vegetation."}, {"section_title": "Temporal Considerations", "text": "The timing of image collection is vital to the accurate mapping of wetlands (Klemas 2001). Ideal times can vary by hour, day, month, or year and by wetland type. Generally, the more water present in an area, either in the form of soil saturation or flooding, the more unique an area will appear as compared to surrounding uplands, and the easier it will be to identify the area using remotely sensed data. However, hydroperiod is a highly dynamic parameter in many wetlands and these wetlands must be imaged at specific times to capture water levels at their peak. For example, moisture levels can vary due to tides, rainfall events, the melting of snow and ice, the release of upstream dams, or changing levels of evapotranspiration (a combination of evaporation and transpiration primarily controlled by temperature and plant physiology). It is also important to consider the fact that precipitation and wetness conditions change from year to year (e.g., drought or flood years) as well as between seasons. For that reason, images captured during years of average weather conditions will best represent the location of wetlands. However, in some circumstances the collection of imagery during weather extremes may aid the mapping of wetlands. For example, Munyati (2000) found that some wetlands in Africa were readily apparent during droughts when wetland vegetation was the only green vegetation present in the landscape. Ideal timing of imagery collection for wetland map creation depends on the type of wetland being mapped. Deciduous forested wetlands are best mapped during the spring before leaf-out. At this time, the tree canopy interferes less with the detection of the ground and water tables tend to be high due to snowmelt and/or an extended period of low evapotranspiration rates. Because evergreen vegetation retains its leaves year round, evergreen forested wetlands do not have an optimal time for imagery collection based on vegetative state. Submerged aquatic vegetation (SA y ), on the other hand, is best mapped during maximum biomass, low turbidity, low wave/wind action, and during low tide. When collecting remotely sensed data over tidal areas, it is difficult to obtain images that are recorded at the same tidal level. This is not only due to the difficulty of obtaining adjacent scenes at the same tidal level. It is also due to tidal flooding that proceeds gradually upstream so that wetlands within a large estuarine system are in different stages of flooding at one point in time (Tiner 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Considerations", "text": "The spatial resolution or scale of imagery affects what can and cannot be interpreted in a wetland map. All maps have a minimum mapping unit (MMU) and a target mapping unit (TMU). The MMU represents the smallest wetland that appears on the map, while the TMU estimates the smallest wetland that is consistently mapped. The TMU will differ not only based on the spatial resolution of the imagery used to create the map but also based on the type of wetland being mapped (Tiner 1999). For example, easily identified wetlands, such as coastal marshes and flooded basins, will have a smaller TMU than wetlands that are more difficult to identify, like drier or evergreen wetlands. To map wetlands at a certain MMU, requires an appropriate scale of imagery. For example, when mapping wetlands in Maryland using color infrared aerial photography Tiner and Smith (1992) recommended imagery with a spatial scale of 1:58.000 to produce maps with a MMU of 0.4 ha and 1:24,000 imagery to produce maps with a MMU of 0.1 to 0.2 ha. The use of finer resolution imagery, however, requires a greater mapping effort. A spatial resolution of 1:24,000 or better is recommended for local wetland mapping when boundaries need to be precise and smaller wetlands need to be identified. Whereas, broader scale imagery, such as 1:58,000, are more appropriate for national mapping efforts (Tiner 1999). Generally, as the resolution of imagery used to map wetlands becomes finer, wetland boundaries are more distinct and refined, smaller wetlands are mapped, stereoscopic details become obvious, and difficult to identify wetlands become more easily identified. However, finer scale imagery only increases the quality of wetland maps to a point. For example, wetlands are easier to delineate at 1:12,000 than 1:5,760. This is due to extremely fine details, like tree branches, that make it difficult to delineate wetlands at this scale (Tiner and Smith 1992). It could be said at this point that the forest (or forested wetland) cannot be seen through the trees\" at this finer scale."}, {"section_title": "Wetland Type Considerations", "text": "The most difficult types of wetlands to map are palustrine forested wetlands (Jacobson et al. 1987;liner 1990;Sader et al, 1995;Kudray and Gale 2000;Klemas 2001;Wright and Gallant 2007), evergreen wetlands, and wetlands with ephemeral hydrology (Augusteijn and Warrender 1998;Kudray and Gale 2000). Palustrine forested wetlands are difficult to map because their canopies often prevent viewing of the ground's surface and the trees found in this type of wetland are identical or spectrally similar to those found in upland forests (Sader et al. 1995;Augusteijn and Warrender 1998;Klemas 2001). Moreover, relatively small variations in topography are capable of forming these types of wetlands. As a result, all forested wetlands, but especially small, isolated forested wetlands (e.g, vernal pools) are one of the most difficult types of wetlands to detect due to a combination of the presence of the forest canopy, often ephemerally hydrology, and in the case of vernal pools their size. Although they are difficult to detect using remotely sensed images, the mapping of palustrine forested wetlands is vital because they represent approximately half of all wetlands found in the US (Sader et al. 1995) and they are the most likely type of wetland to be lost in the future (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2002). New techniques need to be developed to remotely sense forested wetlands. Although forested wetlands are often more readily identified with finer resolution imagery, this is only true to a degree. Wilen and Smith (1996) argue that the challenge to identifying forested wetlands lies not in spatial resolution but in spectral resolution. Promising technologies for meeting the forested wetland mapping challenge include radar and lidar. In addition, better quantification of the influence of hydrology on the spectral signature of forested wetlands using hyperspectral data would be helpful. Rundquist et al. (2001) called for the increased characterization of the composite vegetation-water spectral signature of emergent vegetation. For forested wetlands, the impact of hydrology on the spectral signature of the leaf layer after it has been exposed to flooding (leaves on the ground) may also be helpful if it is the leaf layer and not soils that are being remotely sensed. Since evergreen wetlands retain their leaves year-round, it is difficult to determine hydroperiod or soil type beneath them. Sometimes evergreen wetlands provide hints regarding their status. Evergreens growing in wetlands may be shorter than those growing elsewhere or they may show signs of chlorosis due to water stress (Tiner 1999). With deciduous or evergreen forested wetlands, it may be possible to view saturated soils or understory wetland characteristics through canopy openings. Wetlands exist along a continuum of soil moisture conditions, between permanently inundated, deepwater habitats and drier areas that do not sustain the soil moisture levels needed to support anaerobic soils. Many of the drier wetlands are difficult to identify on the ground yet alone with remotely sensed data. The more difficult it is to map a wetland on the ground, the more conservatively it will be mapped with remotely sensed data (Tiner 1999)."}, {"section_title": "THE POTENTIAL OF DIFFERENT SENSORS FOR", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "WETLAND MAPPING", "text": "Aerial photographs have traditionally been used to map wetlands and some current wetland mapping programs use multispectral images (Baghdadi et al. 2001), but recent research suggests that other types of remotely sensed imagery have promise for wetland delineation. The National Research Council (1995) concluded that certain types of imagery may provide enhanced wetland mapping capabilities over traditional photo interpretation methods. This section investigates the advantages and disadvantages of using aerial photography and multispectral, hyperspectral, passive microwave, radar, and lidar imagery for wetland mapping. This is not an exhaustive review of all types of remotely sensed imagery. Instead it represents the types of imagery that are most common and that researchers have suggested have the greatest potential to improve wetlands mapping. This section discusses both spaceborne and airborne imaging systems. It is important to not only differentiate between different types of imagery but also between the different platforms used to collect those images since there are advantages and disadvantages inherent to these vantage points. The advantages of using satellite imagery for wetland mapping include coverage, timeliness, lower costs, and the ease with which it can be integrated with other types of data in a GIS (Dobson et al. 1995; Federal Geographic Data Committee 1992; Papa et al. 2006). But the use of satellite data also implies certain limitations. These limitations include the often greater interference of weather with satellite data collection. In the past, the use of satellite data has meant broader spatial resolutions but this in no longer the case with new generation sensors (e.g., IKONOS and Quickbird) that collect finer spatial resolution data."}, {"section_title": "Aerial Photography", "text": "The combination of aerial photographs and manual photo interpretation has been and continues to be the most commonly relied upon wetland mapping method (Lyon and McCarthy 1995; National Research Council 1995; Phinn et al. 1999;Harvey and Hill 2001). This is primarily due to the use of well-established methods and protocols, the availability of current and historic data over broad areas (Baker et al. 2006), the comparatively fine spatial resolution of aerial photographs (Klemas 2001), and of course the relatively reliable results obtained from such efforts (Rutchey and Vilchek 1999;Harvey and Hill 2001;Wright and Gallant 2007), In addition, the aerial platform provides flexibility with the timing of data collection that the satellite platform lacks. For example, airplanes can collect images at certain times of the day that correspond with optimal tidal levels whereas the overpass time of satellites is usually predetermined. Historic aerial photographs are available for much if not all of the US providing a valuable baseline for change detection analysis (Baker et al. 2006). One of the most common sources of aerial photography used for wetland mapping in the US is the US National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP) and the National High Altitude Aerial Photography (NHAP) program, both directed by the US Geological Survey (USGS). One of the major differences between aerial photography and satellite data lies not in the character of the data but with the methods that have traditionally been used to process those data. Aerial photography is often classified by a photointerpreter without computer automation of the mapping process. Photo i nterpretati on relies on the human eye to make qualitative decisions based on the image's tone, color, spatial patterns, texture, height/topography, associations, and other characteristics. The accuracy of these decisions can benefit from the experience and judgment of the photo interpreter. The interpretation of aerial photography also benefits from the use of stereoscopic viewing. Stereoscopic viewing helps the photo interpreter determine relative variations in elevation and vegetation height. Topographic variations provide clues as to where wetlands would likely form and information on vegetation height aids in the determination of wetland type (e.g., forested versus shrubscrub). Changes in plant height may also indicate soil moisture and other abiotic conditions (National Research Council 1995). Studies have compared the use of aerial photographs and aerial photo i nterpretat ion to the use of multispectral data for wetland mapping in different environments (Rutchey and Vilchek 1999;Harvey and Hill 2001). One of the major disadvantages of aerial photographs as compared to multispectral data is the relatively lower spectral resolution of the aerial photographs but the superior spatial resolution of aerial photographs can compensate for this disadvantage. A study conducted in the Florida Everglades found that SPOT data overestimated the amount of cattail present in an impounded wetland due to confounding factors, such as, fire, hydrology, periphyton species composition, and macrophyte morphology. Aerial photography was better able to overcome these difficulties and map cattail in these areas due to the experience and reasoning of the photo interpreter (Rutchey and Vilchek 1999). Harvey and Hill (2001) compared the ability of multispectral data (SPOT and Landsat TM) to that of aerial photographs and manual interpretation techniques for mapping an Australian freshwater swamp. Although fourteen land cover types could be delineated from 1:15.000 aerial photographs with 89% accuracy, only three broad land cover types could be distinguished using the multispectral data while meeting minimum accuracy requirements (:!^80%). The difference in accuracy between the aerial photographs and multispectral data was, in part, attributed to the contextual and textural information used by the photo interpreter (Harvey and Hill 2001). Although the manual interpretation of aerial photography is the most commonly used method for detailed wetland mapping, this method is subjective (Finlayson and van der Valk 1995;Augusteijn and Warrender 1998;Baker et al. 2006), time consuming and therefore cannot be quickly updated (Phinn et al. 1999;Harvey and Hill 2001;Wright and Gallant 2007), is relatively expensive (Dobson et al. 1995: Mumby et al. 1999Lunetta and Balogh 1999;Phinn et al. 1999;Harvey and Hill 2001;Klemas 2001;Hirano et al. 2003), and has difficulty mapping certain wetland types (see section 2.1). There are inherent limitations to the use of human vision to classify a map (Rutchey and Vilchek 1999) and these decisions are inherently subjective so resultant maps may vary according to the person who creates them (Finlayson and van der Valk 1995;Augusteijn and Warrender 1998;Baker et al. 2006). Mumby et al. (1999) estimate that the creation of maps for a relatively small area (150 km2) may take six times as long using aerial photo interpretation rather than automated interpretation of digital airborne imagery and that the cost of manual interpretation of aerial photographs will increase at a faster rate than the cost of digital interpretation. The inability of the US FWS to use aerial photointerpretation methods to map wetlands for the entire US (starting in the 1970s) illustrates the cumbersome nature of aerial photointerpretation for broad scale mapping. The type of aerial photograph used to create a wetland map has the potential to affect map accuracy. Although photo interpretation has traditionally been a manual process, which utilized analog photographs rather than digital images, analog aerial photographs can be converted to digital. Still the challenge of scanning in large numbers of photographs and normalizing photographs for variations in illumination, angle of acquisition, and sometimes even phenology and atmospheric conditions remains a challenge (Phinn et al. 1999). Digital cameras are an improvement over analog aerial photographs and can be processed using methods similar to those used for processing multispectral images (Phinn et al. 1999), although the lack of spectral information is still a limitation (Becker et al. 2007;Silva et al. 2008). If possible, it is usually advantageous to use color or color infrared aerial photographs to map wetlands, rather than black and white images. Color infrared film is usually preferred for wetlands mapping because it includes more spectral information than true color film and allows for greater contrast between different plant communities (Tiner 1999;Federal Geographic Data Committee 1992). Dale et al. (1996) found that color infrared aerial photography was a valuable tool in the identification of wetlands. A major exception to this statement occurs when mapping submerged aquatic vegetation (SA y). The relatively low spectral resolution of aerial photographs significantly limits their use for the detection of SAV in general (Silva et al. 2008). However, the use of true color film for SAV detection is preferable to the use of color infrared film due to the superior ability of shorter wavelengths Remote Sensing Data for Regional Wetland Mapping in the United States 85 energy (the visible bands which compose true color imagery) to penetrate the water column (Tiner 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Multispectral", "text": "Multispectral sensors (Table 1) provide information on solar reflectance from materials on the Earth's surface in multiple portions of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., visible, near infrared, mid-infrared, and thermal), at relatively fine (1 -5 m) to medium spatial resolutions (10 -30 m) and some also provide thermal data. Sensors with coarser spatial resolutions, such as the AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) with approximate 1 km resolution, are usually not considered viable options for wetland mapping at the local to regional scale (Munyati 2000;Ringrose et al. 2003), so they are not discussed below. Relative to aerial photographs, satellite borne multispectral sensors provide enhanced spectral resolution (multiple bands) and are capable of imaging a larger area at once (Rundquist et al. 2001;Li and Chen 2005), which simplifies image interpretation. Studies have found that the increased spectral resolution of multispectral data enhances wetland mapping (Federal Geographic Data Committee 1992;Phinn et al. 1999;Harvey andHill 2001 -, Toyr\u00e4 et al. 2002) and, in some cases, helps compensate for reduced spatial resolution (Harvey and Hill 2001). In addition, if fine detail is not required these images are usually less expensive than aerial photographs (Mumby et al. 1999) and they can be collected regularly, as dictated by satellite orbits (Rundquist et al. 2001;Li and Chen 2005). Therefore, these sensors provide not only increased spectral but also increased temporal resolution over aerial photographs, both of which are important for distinguishing different wetland classes. The comparatively fine temporal resolution of these multispectral sensors is complemented by a relatively long historic record (e.g., Landsat MSS first launched in 1972). Finally, their digital format and standardized imagery allow for automated, repeatable classification of wetlands and other land cover types (Houhoulis and Mitchner 2000;Ausseil et al. 2007). The infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is often collected by multispectral sensors (Table 1), is considered to be particularly well suited for wetland mapping applications (Federal Geographic Data Committee 1992;Phinn et al. 1999;Munyati 2000). This is due to the high spectral response of vegetation in the near-infrared coupled with the strong absorption of water in the same region, which makes for a sharp contrast between water and vegetation in the near-infrared (Lyon and McCarthy 1995) and water absorption features (portions of the electromagnetic spectrum with distinctly lower reflectance when water is present) in the mid-infrared. Both multispectral and hyperspectral data can take advantage of this contrast with individual bands over these regions. The use of color-infrared (CIR) aerial photos can also improve wetland detection via information on the near infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, the use of color infrared photographs is not as advantageous as the isolation of these regions through the use of distinct bands by way of digital multispectral images (Lyon and McCarthy 1995). Although many of the older satellite systems, such as Landsat MSS, Landsat TM, and SPOT, offer improved spectral resolution, their spatial resolution is often insufficient for mapping smaller or more complex wetlands (Welch et al. 1999 Note that many of the more recent commercial satellites are pointable and therefore the repeat frequency can vary. This list is not comprehensive. Multiple bands in one portion of the electromagnetic spectrum are denoted with an \"x\" and then the number of bands (e.g.. x2). Sensor name (Sensor), spatial resolution in meters (Resolution), the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum sampled by each band (Bands), swath width (Width), temporal resolution or number of days between overpasses (Repeat). the years the sensor has operated (Life-Spam Present abbreviated as Pres.), and websites where more information about the sensors can be found are provided in the table. Phinn et al. 1999 suggests that current multispectral sensors (Landsat TM, SPOT XS, and IRS-IC) are limited to mapping wetlands with a MMU greater than 9 ha, although other studies estimate that Landsat TM is capable of mapping wetlands at much finer MMU (0.8 -1.0 ha; Federal Geographic Data Committee 1992; Lunetta and Balogh 1999;Wright and Gallant 2007). Landsat MSS data (80 m spatial resolution) have been used to map wetlands with varying levels of success (Moore and North 1974;Severs et al. 1974;Bennet 1987). Severs et al. (1974) were able to use Landsat MSS bands 5 (red) and 7 (near infrared) to classify wetland patches of -4 ha or more into four broad categories (i.e., marsh, seasonally flooded depressions, meadow, and open water). However, in another case, researchers had difficulties using Landsat MSS to map large, homogenous coastal wetlands, which are among the easiest wetland types to map (Ramsey and Lame 1997). The use of Landsat TM for inventorying wetlands is also limited due to the lack of spatial detail (Ramsey and Lame 1997;Wilen and Tiner 1989). Newer satellite data, such as IKONOS, provide finer spatial resolution multispectral data (Table I). For example, IKONOS collects 4 m resolution data over the blue, green, red, and near-infrared areas of the electromagnetic spectrum and Quickbird collects 2.4 m data in the blue, green, red, and near-infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. It has been predicted that newly available finer resolution multispectral sensors (e.g., IKONOS. Quickbird, and Orbview) should provide an increase in wetland mapping capability (Phinn et al. 1999). As with aerial photography, multispectral images can only be collected during the day and their collection is limited by cloud cover and atmospheric conditions (e.g., haze). These limitations may preclude the regular and repetitive collection of data that is required for certain wetland studies (Baghdadi et al. 2001;Costa 2004;Costa and Telmer 2007). This is especially true if combined with infrequent temporal coverage (e.g., satellite repeat frequency). Unfortunately, the optimal period for data collection may be short. For example, in many forested regions of the US there is a short time period between ice/snow melt and the leafing-out of trees, after which features below the forest canopy are usually obscured. More than one study has cited the presence of a vegetative canopy as one of the main deterrents to accurate wetland mapping using multispectral data (Moore and North 1974;Carter 1982;Alsdorf et al. 2007;Costa and Telmer 2007). Unless significant gaps in the canopy are present, the hydrologic conditions on the ground cannot be observed. In the sub-tropics and tropics optimal time for image collection often corresponds with the periods of increased C loudiness (precipitation events). Since Landsat TM can only be acquired every 16 days, the chance of collecting a relatively cloud-free image during this optimal period is small (Federal Geographic Data Committee 1992). The ability of some sensors (e.g.. SPOT and Quickbird) to collect data at multiple view angles has the potential to reduce the time between satellite overpasses and therefore increase the likelihood that images can be collected during times when conditions on the ground are optimal. When using multispectral and even hyperspectral imagery, there is often a trade-off between spectral and spatial resolution (Harvey and Hill 2001;Becker et al. 2007), with finer spatial resolution sensors having fewer bands (e.g., 1KONOS, Quickbird, and OrbView) and sensors with more bands having coarser spatial resolution (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS]). Adequate spatial resolution is necessary since wetland patches are often small. However spectral resolution is also important because the spectral character of different land cover classes is often similar and adequate spectral resolution is necessary to distinguish different land cover types (Harvey and Hill 2001). Wetlands that are spectrally distinct from surrounding land cover types will be mapped more accurately with multispectral images than those which are not (McCarthy et al. 2005). Therefore no one existing multispectral sensor is optimal for wetland mapping (Becker et al. 2007) in all situations and the success of wetland mapping efforts often depends just as much on the type of wetland being mapped as the type of imagery being used. However, the literature does support some generalizations regarding the utility of available multispectral data. Two of the most commonly used groups of multispectral sensors include SPOT (Jensen et al. 1991;Rutchey and Vilcheck 1999;Ringrose et al. 2003;Toyra and Pietroniro 2005) and Landsat (Sader et al. 1995;Baghdadi et al. 2001;Townsend and Walsh 1998;Toyr\u00e4 et al. 2002;Baker et al. 2006;Wright and Gallant 2007). Landsat data have been found to be preferable to other multispectral satellite data for wetland detection (Hewitt 1990;Bolstad and Lillesand 1992;Harvey and Hill 2001) and the recent announcement that it will be distributed free of charge after January of 2009 makes its use even more attractive. Although Harvey and Hill (2001) found that both Landsat TM and SPOT XS were adequate for mapping broad categories of wetland types, the coarser spatial resolution seven band Landsat TM data were preferable to the finer resolution four band SPOT data for mapping wetlands in a freshwater Australian swamp. Longer wavelength bands, especially the mid-infrared Landsat TM band (band 5; 1.55 -1.75 pm), have been found to be especially useful for the detection of water (Federal Geographic Data Committee 1992;Phinn et al. 1999;Harvey and Hill 2001;Toyr\u00e4 et al. 2002). The Federal Geographic Data Committee (1992) identified Landsat TM bands 4 and 5 as most effective for wetland delineation. Landsat TM bands 2, 3. and 4 have been found to be helpful for identifying the presence of understory vegetation (Congalton et al. 1993), which is helpful for mapping some forested wetlands (Harvey and Hill 2001). Sader et al. (1995) found that Landsat TM could be used to distinguish between forested wetland, other wetlands, forested uplands and other uplands with an accuracy of approximately 80%. Temporal resolution was found to be an important variable when using Landsat TM to map a diverse group of wetlands on the border between Maryland and Delaware. When the accuracy of a wetlands map produced with single date leaf-on (June) TM imagery was compared to one that was produced using multi-temporal TM data (leaf-on and leaf-off [April]), the multi-temporal map was found to be more reliable (Lunetta and Balogh 1999). The leaf-on data were used primarily to produce a land cover map and the leaf-off data were used to detect wetland hydrology. The accuracy of the multi-temporal wetlands map was superior to that of the single date map. 88% accuracy versus 69% accuracy respectively. Forested wetlands were found to be especially difficult to map without the use of multi-date imagery. On the other hand, open water areas are relatively easy to identify using Landsat data. Beeri and Phillips (2007) used Landsat TM and ETM+ to estimate hydroperiod in wetlands with open water with high accuracy (96% detection of water bodies greater than -15 m). They suggest the use of SAR data to improve the detection of water beneath emergent vegetation and fine resolution elevation data to locate areas of likely inundation since the presence of vegetation (Moore and North 1974;Carter 1982) and sediment (Engman and Gurney 1991) reduce the effectiveness of multispectral data for the detection of inundation. SPOT data have also been useful for wetland mapping, especially when differentiating between medium to small wetland patches which are spectrally distinct from other land cover types. Toyr\u00e4 et al. (2002) found that SPOT was capable of detecting flooded wetlands with between 66% and 80% accuracy in freshwater wetlands with a combination of forests and non-woody (i.e., herbaceous) vegetation. The Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS) may be used more frequently for land cover mapping in the future as the availability of current high quality Landsat images becomes less certain due to the instrument malfunction which occurred in the Landsat 7 (ETM+) sensor in July of 2003 and the uncertain future of Landsat 5 (TM) due to its advanced age. However, the lack of a mid-infrared band on the IRS-Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor (LISS)-II sensor was found to limit wetland detection (Johnston and Barson 1993;Mahlke 1996). In complex wetland environments, more traditional statistical classifications commonly used with multispectral imagery (e.g., supervised and unsupervised classification) may have limited utility (McCarthy et al. 2005). In these cases and when greater accuracy is required in general, the use of different classification techniques can improve the accuracy of resultant maps. For example, the use of indexes, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (cite) or transformations, such as the tassel-cap transformation may improve the discrimination of different wetland types (Sader et al. 1995;McCarthy et al. 2005;Wright and Gallant 2007). Huguenin et al. (1997) found that subpixel spectral analysis was significantly better than traditional classification methods (ISODATA, maximum likelihood, and minimum distance) for mapping bald cypress trees and tupelo gum trees in Georgia and South Carolina when using Landsat TM imagery. Subpixel spectral analysis identified cypress with 89% accuracy and tupelo gum trees with 91% accuracy when they occurred in pure stands or mixed with other species (Huguenin et al. 1997). Classification trees have proved helpful for wetland mapping (Wright and Gallant 2007), partially because they can be used to incorporate data from a variety of sources (Wright and Gallant 2007). When using Landsat ETM+ images to identify wetlands, a Stochastic Gradient Boosting decision tree technique was found to be more accurate (86.0%) than a Classification Tree Analysis (73.1%; Baker et al. 2006). Chiu and Couloigner (2006) improved classification accuracy by using a Fuzzy C-Means classifier to represent the boundary between different wetland types. This method represents the transition between different wetland types as it often is on the groundgradual. In addition to the improvement of wetland maps via the use of different classification methods, acquiring multispectral imagery at multiple view angles may enhance the discrimination of different land cover types, including wetlands (Vanderbilt et al. 2002;Dupigny-Giroux 2007). This enhanced discrimination is due to the varying appearance of wetland vegetation and water signatures when viewed from different angles and is sometimes called a directional signature (Dupigny-Giroux 2007). POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectance) data were found to reliably discriminate three cover types (open water, emergent vegetation above inundation, and non-inundated cover types) when images were collected at angles which maximize specular reflectance of the water surface (i.e., maximize the interception of sunglint by the sensor; Vanderbilt et al. 2002). Pinty et al. (2002) found that multi-directional signatures could be used to distinguish between inundation and dark soils, which often appear similar on multispectral images. Another study found that ratios of AirMISR data collected at different angles [fore and aft of nadir (26.1\u00b0, 45.6\u00b0, and 60.0\u00b0)] were capable of distinguishing not only different wetland types in a forested area of Maine but also moisture gradients in emergent wetlands, species type and vigor, the relative proportion of water and vegetation, and areas of vegetation undergoing moisture stress (Dupigny-Giroux 2007). Dupigny-Giroux (2007) postulates that a multi-angle approach may help map evergreen wetlands. Another study found that a combination data collected to maximize sun glint and spectral mixture analysis could be used to detect areas of wetland inundation, with accuracy of within pixel estimates of inundation increasing with increasing pixel size (Vanderbilt et al. 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Hyperspectral", "text": "Hyperspectral data are characterized by numerous, narrow spectral bands collected in the visible, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and sometimes thermal portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. For example, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) satellite borne Hyperion sensor provides imagery with 220 spectral bands at a spatial resolution of 30 m. NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) has been flown on a variety of different aircraft and has 224 narrow, contiguous spectral bands from 400 to 2500 nm (10 nm wide bands) and a pixel size of 20 in (Vane et al., 1993). These numerous, finely segregated spectral allow analysts to identify different materials based on their spectral signature\" or diagnostic patterns in absorption and reflection usually associated with the molecular and/or cellular properties of the material (Kokaly et al. 2003;Schmidt and Skidmore 2003). Although the use of spectral signatures can be very helpful in imagery analysis, these signatures can vary temporally with phenology and environmental conditions (Judd et al. 2007;Silva et al. 2008) making generalizations difficult, and therefore mapping through time and space challenging (Schmidt and Skidmore 2003). In addition, the importance of texture and context should not be discounted (Hirano et al. 2003) even when spectral resolution is extremely high. Similar to other types of imagery, hyperspectral data are capable of detecting parameters that can be used to infer wetland function. However, in addition to more obvious parameters (e.g., habitat fragmentation) hyperspectral data have the potential to detect biochemical properties such as nutrient and chlorophyll content (Schmidt and Skidmore 2003;Judd et al. 2007). Although the detection of these properties is currently unlikely to be part of a local to regional wetland mapping program, this may change in the future. The drawbacks of hyperspectral data include those of all optical data, such as an inability to penetrate vegetation cover, sensitivity to clouds and other weather events, and restricted use to daylight hours. Additional restrictions of hyperspectral data include large data volume (Phinn et at. 1999;Hirano 2003;Laba et at. 2005;Becker et al. 2007), less developed/more complex image processing techniques (Phinn et al. 1999;Klemas 2001;Hirano et al. 2003: Laba et at. 2005, and the relatively poor availability of hyperspectral data in general and high price of commercial data. All of these drawbacks should be lessened as technologies mature. At present, fine to moderate resolution hyperspectral data are primarily available from airborne sensors, although an experimental hyperspectral satellite (Hyperion) collects a limited amount of medium resolution (30 m) data. As of 2008, Hyperion has greatly exceeded its life expectancy and shows signs of decline. MODIS, another satellite borne hyperspectral sensor with 36 bands, is less promising for local to regional wetland mapping due to its relatively coarse spatial resolution (250 to 1000 m). Although MODIS's broad spatial resolution is not ideal for most regional wetlands mapping, its launch does provide hope for the availability of finer resolution hyperspectral satellite data in the future. Even the spatial resolution of some commonly available finer resolution datasets (e.g., Airborne Visible/infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and Hyperion) may be too coarse for some wetland mapping applications (Hirano et at. 2003;Becker et at, 2007). Until hyperspectral data become more available, their use in operational wetland mapping programs is unlikely (Phinn et al. 1999;Govender et at. 2007). As more hyperspectral sensors begin to collect data, data will become more available and processing techniques will advance. With time the ever-increasing capabilities of new hardware will be able to better handle hyperspectral's large datasets. When these problems are solved, hyperspectral data could be used to supplement other types of remotely sensed data in regional wetlands mapping, especially if more specific information on plant species presence or other factors is necessary. For now, it is more likely that hyperspectral images will continue to be used to identify narrowly defined wetland classes and plant species of interest (Sahagian and Melack 1996;Klemas 2001;Schmidt and Skidmore 2003;McCarthy et at. 2005), including invasive species (Laba et at. 2005). Although the availability of satellite derived hyperspectral data and even publicly available US government sponsored airborne data (AVIRIS) is currently limited and fine spatial resolution data are not available, the availability of finer spatial resolution commercial data is increasing. There are currently several hyperspectral sensors being commercially produced and flown aboard aircraft including the CASI 1500, AISA Eagle, and AISA Hawk. The CASI 1500 is capable of collecting up to 288 bands between 380 and 1050 nm at a spatial resolution as high as .25 m (www.itres.com ). The AISA Hawk and Eagle are often used together, since they collect information from different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Eagle is capable of collecting up to 488 bands between the wavelengths of 400 and 970 nm, while the Hawk is capable of collecting 320 bands between the wavelengths of 970 and 2450 nm (www.specim.f,). The spatial resolution of the Hawk and Eagle sensors will vary based on platform and sensor parameters. Hyperspectral sensors have primarily been used to map wetland plant species (Hirano et al. 2003 (Anderson and Perry 1996). A review of several research projects involving the use of hyperspectral data for mapping aquatic vegetation found that accuracies ranged from 70 to 96% (Silva et al. 2008). Schmidt and Skidmore (2003) found that the spectral signatures of different salt marsh vegetation types were significantly different and they propose that these differences should allow identification of individual species using hyperspecrtal imagery. Other studies have found that the mapping of various marsh vegetation species is possible (Judd et at. 2007). Hirano et al. (2003) found higher accuracies when mapping spike rush (100%) as compared to red mangroves (40%). Although hyperspectral data, like all optical data, are limited by the tree canopy during much of the year, hyperspectral data have been used to detect forested wetlands during the leaf-on period. This can be accomplished by detecting water stress in some tree species, because when some tree species are exposed to flooding they have elevated reflectance in the green (550 nm) and near-infrared (770 nm) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. This approach has been shown to be effective in monospecific stands of facultative wetlands trees (Anderson and Perry 1996). Hyperspectral data are particularly well suited for the mapping of SAy, since the water column reduces reflectance from the vegetation itself making detailed examination of spectral characteristics necessary to identify SAV (Silva et at. 2008). Similar to the analysis of multispectral data, spectral unmixing methods to can be used with hyperspectral data to estimate the fraction of endrnembers included in each pixel (Roberts et al. 1993;Lillesand and Kiefer 1994;Rosso et al. 2005;Judd et al. 2007). This type of analysis has the potential to be more precise when using the numerous bands available with hyperspectral images, although the selection of truly pure (unmixed) endmembers can be a challenge (Filippi and Jensen 2006;Judd et al. 2007). By estimating the fraction of plant species per pixel, spectral unmixing methods can be used produce a more accurate wetland vegetation map (McCarthy et at. 2005). Rosso et at. (2005) applied spectral mixture analysis and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis to AVIRIS data in order to map marsh vegetation. Both approaches were found to be suitable for mapping marshes, although the multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis had the advantage of incorporating more than one endmember per class. Other classification approaches, such as neural networks, have also proved beneficial. Filippi and Jensen (2006) found that neural networks performed better than end member based approaches. This neural network approach has the additional advantage of not requiring the initial input of spectral endmembers."}, {"section_title": "Passive Microwave", "text": "Passive microwave radiometers operate in the same spectral range as active radar sensors, such as synthetic aperture radars. but they sense microwave energy that is naturally emitted from objects. The emission of this energy is dependent on numerous factors including, surface roughness, temperature, soil and vegetation water content, bulk density, and soil texture. Passive sensors can be used to measure soil moisture, depth to shallow water table, and biomass, which are all important characteristics for locating wetlands (Shutko et at. 1997;Jackson et al. 1999). Indeed, sensitivity of passive microwave systems to soil moisture has been well established (Du et at. 2000;Shi et al.2006). Passive microwave sensors usually detect energy between 0,5 to 30 cm. Below 0.5 cm the sensor is sensitive to clouds and rain and above 30 cm radar, television, and other forms of radiation will interfere with microwave reception. It is also between 0.5 and 30 cm that passive microwave sensors are most receptive to soil moisture. To best detect soil moisture, energy should be collected from 2 or 3 radiometers in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum between 0.5 and 30 cm (Wilen and Smith, 1996). The broad spatial resolution of most passive microwave sensors, such as the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), the Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), limits their use to large geographic regions (Martinez and Le Toan 2007). Even if synthetic aperture technology is used, spaceborne passive microwave sensors can still only achieve a spatial resolution of between 10 and 30 km, a scale that is insufficient for regional wetlands mapping (Jackson et al. 1999). This resolution can be partially remedied by the use of spectral mixture models, which can detect subpixel endmembers. Even with spectral unmixing, spaceborne microwave radiometers are still limited by their coarse spatial resolution (Smith 1997). Photo Science and Geoinformatic, two commercial companies, tested airborne passive microwave sensors for their sensitivity to wetlands and also found that spatial resolution was a problem. It was not felt that these sensors would provide improvements over present methods of regional wetland mapping (Wilen and Smith 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Radar", "text": "Imaging radars (radio detection and ranging) provide information that is fundamentally different from sensors that operate in the visible and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is primarily due to the much longer wavelengths used by SAR sensors and the fact that they send out and receive their own energy (i.e., active sensors). One of the most common types of imaging radar is synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SAR technology provides the increased spatial resolution that is necessary in regional wetland mapping and SAR data has been used extensively for this purpose. For these reasons the following discussion will focus exclusively on SAR sensors and data. SAR sensors have different operating parameters, including not only multiple wavelengths, but also polarizations and incidence angles. It is important to appreciate differences in these instrument specifications because the selection of optimal wavelength, polarization, and incidence angle is vital for successful wetland mapping (Harris and Digby-Arbus 1986;Baghdadi et al. 2001;Costa and Telmer 2007). Optimal specifications vary based on the goals of the mapping project and the environment in which it is being carried out. Microwave wavelengths commonly used for remote sensing include: X-band (2.4 -3.8 cm), C-band (3.9 -7.5 cm), L-band (15 -30 cm), and P-band (30 -100 cm; Jensen 2000). Electromagnetic energy transmitted from the SAR sensor towards the surface of the Earth is composed of an electric and a magnetic component. These two components travel, at the speed of light (3 x 108 m sfl ), orthogonal to one another. The orientation of the electric component of electromagnetic energy (perpendicular to the direction of travel) determines the polarization of that energy. In all but the newest satellite based sensors (i.e., RADARSAT-2 and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar [PALSAR]) the energy is either transmitted or received horizontally (H) or vertically (V), relative to the surface of the Earth. SAR bands are often described by their wavelength (e.g.. X. C, L, or P) and polarization (e.g.. Remote Senin Data lot' Regional \\\\ etland \\'l pplIn. in the L n ted States HI-I horizontally transmitted and received and VV = vertically transmitted and received). The energy from SAR sensors is also transmitted and received at different angles relative to the Earth's surface. These incidence angles are measured relative to an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface of the Earth, with smaller angles being closer to perpendicular to the terrain and larger angles being closer to parallel. It is primarily the wavelength, polarization, and incidence angle of the microwave energy in combination with certain key characteristics of Earth's surface (dielectric property, size/roughness, and structure) that determine the amount of energy reflected in the direction of the sensor and therefore received by the sensor. Water content determines the dielectric property of most natural materials. Typically, the higher the water content, the higher the dielectric constant (a measure of the aptitude of a substance to conduct electrical energy) of the material and therefore the greater the amount of incident energy returned from the material (Jensen 2000). When mapping and monitoring wetland ecosystems, imaging radars have many advantages over sensors that operate in the visible and infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Microwave energy is sensitive to variations in soil moisture and inundation, and is only partially attenuated by vegetation canopies, especially in areas of lower biomass (Kasischke and Bourgeau-Chavez 1997;Kasischke et al. 1997a;Kasischke et al. 1997b;Townsend and Walsh 1998;Baghdadi et al. 2001;Townsend 2001;Townsend 2002;Rosenqvist et al. 2007;Lang and Kasischke 2008) or when using data collected at longer wavelengths (Hess et al. 1990;Hess et al. 1995;Martinez and Le Toan 2007). The sensitivity of microwave energy to water and its ability to penetrate vegetative canopies, make SAR ideal for the detection of hydrologic features below vegetation (Hall 1996;Kasischke et al. 1997;Kasischke and Bourgeau-Chavez 1997b;Phinn et al. 1999;Rao et al. 1999;Wilson and Rashid 2005). SAR data can even be used to detect freeze/thaw events (Bartsh et al. 2007) because the dielectric of ice is much lower than that of water. The presence of standing water interacts with the radar signal differently depending on the dominant vegetation type/structure (Hess et al. 1995) as well as the biomass and condition of vegetation (Toyra et al. 2002;Costa and Telmer 2007). When exposed to open water without vegetation, specular reflection occurs and a dark signal (weak or no return) is observed (Dwivedi et al. 1999). making the detection of open water relatively simple. The radar signal is often reduced in wetlands dominated by lower biomass herbaceous vegetation when a layer of water is present due largely to specular reflectance (Kasischke et al. 1997a). Conversely, the radar signal is often increased in forested wetlands when standing water is present due to the double-bounce effect (Harris and Digby-Arbus 1986;Dwivedi et al. 1999). This occurs in flooded forests when energy that is sent out by the sensor is reflected strongly by the water surface away from the sensor (specular reflectance) but is then redirected back towards the sensor by a second reflection from a nearby tree trunk. The use of small incidence angles (closer to nadir) is thought to enhance the ability to map hydrology beneath the forest canopy via increased penetration of the forest canopy (Hess et al. 1990;Bourgeau-Chavez et al. 2001;Toyra et al. 2001). The temporal resolution of available radar data is relatively high for a variety of reasons. Radar sensors can collect data regardless of solar illumination, cloud cover, and most rain events (shorter wavelength [e.g., X-band] radar can be sensitive to intense rainstorms). For example, the use of radar data is particularly helpful in areas of northern Alaska where daylight can be limited and cloud cover prevalent (Evans 1995;Baghdadi et al. 2001). The temporal resolution of SAR data is also increased by the ability of certain satellite borne sensors (e.g., Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR), RADARSAT-1, and RADARSAT-2) to collect data at multiple incidence angles, thus reducing the time between satellite overpasses. The availability of multiple well-calibrated (Martinez and Le Toan 2007) satellite borne sensors further increases the temporal resolution of SAR data because those data can be used to gather information about the same area of interest. Although knowledge of radar data characteristics and processing methods have developed considerably, further research is required in order to capitalize on all of the potential benefits that SAR data can provide to the wetland mapping process (Horritt et al. 2003;Costa 2004). The interpretation of SAR data is less intuitive than that of optical imagery (Silva et al. 2008) and the methods and software used to process SAR data are less developed than those for optical data. In addition, the sensitivity of SAR data to variations in elevation often requires radiornetric and geometric corrections that utilize a digital elevation map. Finally, until recently only moderate resolution (30 m) satellite borne SAR data were available, although RADARSAT-2 data are now available (2008) at a spatial resolution of 3 M. Seasat, launched in 1978, was one of the first imaging radars to be used to study wetlands and other ecosystems (Place 1985;Pope et al., 1997;Ramsey et al. 1998). Researchers found that the L-HH microwave energy transmitted by Seasat was particularly sensitive to flooding, even below forest canopies due to the increase in backscatter caused by double-bounce scattering between tree trunks and the flooded surface (Krohn et al. 1983;Place 1985;Hess et al. 1990;Pope et al. 1997). In addition to Seasat, the ability of L-l-lH SAR to map inundation in forested wetlands has been well documented with a variety of other sensors (Table 2) including AIRSAR (an airborne sensor), Spaceborne Imaging Radar (SIR)-C, and Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS)-1 (available from 1992 -1998; Ormsby et al. 1985;Hess et al. 1995;Wilen and Smith 1996;Townsend and Walsh 1998;Martinez and Le Toan 2007). After the successful launch of European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-1) (1991 to 2000) and ERS-2 (1995 to present) and RADARSAT-1 (1995 to present), C-band data were increasingly available (Table 2) and wetland studies using these shorter wavelength data were initiated. Researchers found that although C-HH band radar data were not as well suited for forested wetland studies as those from L-HH SARs, they could be used to monitor inundation patterns, especially in areas of lower biomass (Townsend and Walsh 1998;Townsend 2000;Costa 2004;Lang and Kasischke 2008). C-VV data from the ERS systems (from which the longest continuous record of SAR observations exist) have primarily been used to study herbaceous vegetation (e.g.. Kasischke et al. 2003;Grings et al. 2006), but have also been successful in detecting inundation under forest canopies during the leaf-off period (Kasischke et al. 1997b;Townsend 2002). Although SIR-C/X-SAR (deployed onboard NASA's Space Shuttle) only collected data during the spring and fall of 1994, it provided new details regarding the advantages and limitations of spaceborne multi-wavelength (X, C, and L bands), polarimetric (capable of sending and receiving multiple polarizations at the same time) SAR (Hall 1996). This advancement led to the ability to detect finer details of vegetation structure and therefore improved the accuracy of wetland classifications from space (Pope et al. 1994;Hess et al. 1995;Hall 1996;Smith 1997;Bourgeau-Chavez et al. 2001)."}, {"section_title": "Table 2. Commonly used spaceborne SAR sensors", "text": "Please note that specifications are approximate and not all specifications are available at the same time. Sensor name (Sensor), platform type (Platform), spatial resolution (Resolution), wavelength band (Bands), incidence angle (Incidence), polarization. swath width (Width). the years the sensor has operated (Life-Span; Present abbreviated as Pres.). and websites where more information about the sensors can be found are provided in the table. For example, Hess et al. (1995) and Pope et al. (1994) used SIR-C data to identify various wetland vegetation types and found that the discrimination of these classes was best when using multiple wavelengths and polarizations. Recently SAR sensors have been launched which offer multiple polarizations (ASAR; launched 2002) and even polarimetric data (PALSAR;2006 to present and RADARSAT-2;2007 to present). The additional information offered by these sensors is predicted to further improve the utility of SAR data for wetland mapping applications (Pope etal. 1997;Baghdadi et al. 2001;Sokol et al. 2004;Touzi et al. 2007). There are now more opportunities to use and fully explore the potential of SAR data for wetland mapping due to the relatively recent launch of ALOS PALSAR and RADARSAT-2. Both PALSAR and RADARST-2 are capable of providing data with polarimetric data which has been found to improve the detection of wetlands (Horritt et al. 2003;Baghdadi et al. 2001). Additional SAR sensors are currently being planned (e.g., Radar Imaging Satellite). These extra satellites will not only increase the amount of data available for analysis, they will also increase collection frequency, and the variety of polarizations and frequencies available (Ramsey 1997). The launch of additional SAR satellites by the US and other countries will increase SAR capabilities and applications. NASA is working towards the launch of multiple radar satellites, including the Deformation, Ecosystem Structure, and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynI), the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP), the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) sensors. The DESDynI and SMAP sensors are scheduled to be developed and launched (2010 2013) before SWOT (2013 -2016). The DESDynI sensor will contain an interferometrjc L-band SAR (<35 m resolution) and non-imaging lidar (1064 nm laser; -25 m horizontal, and I m vertical spatial resolution) component. DESDynI will, in part, be designed to map and monitor ecosystem characteristics (e.g., biomass and tree height) particularly in forests. The SMAP sensor will contain a SAR and microwave radiometer and is designed to monitor soil moisture and freeze-thaw events. Although the coarse resolution of the sensor (>1 km) will limit its ability to map wetlands at a regional scale, its fine temporal resolution (2-3 day) would provide valuable information concerning the provision of wetland ecosystem services as they are influenced by hydroperiod. SWOT will, in part, be designed to inventory freshwater storage in water bodies, such as wetlands. It will contain a kit-band (2 cm) near-nadir SAR interferometer, a multiple frequency microwave radiometer, and a ku-band nadir-looking radar altimeter (vertical resolution of a few cm). These details and more regarding the sensors discussed above can be found in the US National Research Council (2007) publication entitled Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond.\" In addition to the new SAR satellites planned by the US, the governments of other countries are also planning to launch new SAR satellites in the future. These planned satellites include the Radar Imaging Satellite (RISAT; ?3m spatial resolution, multiple polarization C-band; India; Misra et al. 2005) and the Multi-Application Purpose SAR (MAPSAR; ?3m spatial resolution, multiple polarization L-band, Germany and Brazil; Schroder et al. 2005). Radar not only has potential to detect different types of wetlands; it can also be used to study the condition and function of these valuable areas. Recent advances in radar remote sensing data and processing have made the estimation of biomass and other forest parameters possible on a landscape scale (Le Toan et al. 1992;Kellndorfer et al. 1998;Kasischke et al. 1997b;Mougin et al. 1999;Martinez and Le loan 2007). The ability of radar to map flooding under forest canopies, where optical data would not be able to detect inundation, is particularly promising (Kasischke and Bourgeau-Chavez 1997). Although microwave sensors can currently only be used to estimate soil moisture within the first 10 cm of soil, new models are being developed to help extend this estimate (Li et al. 1998). Additionally interferometric techniques can be used to create extremely accurate digital elevation models using radar imagery. These models have been used to monitor wetland vegetation height and biomass (Simard et al. 2006) and the impact of management practices on wetland hydrology (Wdowinski et al. 2008). Methods that use a combination of different bands and polarizations or synergistic approaches that use imagery from multiple radar instruments as well as optical data often provide superior results (Sahagian and Melack 1996;Smith 1997;Augusteijn and Warrender 1998;Toyra et al. 2002;Li and Chen 2005;Toyra and Pietroniro 2005) because they bring different pieces of information to the process. Decision tree analysis is a good option when combining different types of SAR (Baghdadi et al. 2001) or SAR and optical data (Li and Chen 2005). The use of multi-temporal radar data combined via an intensity, hue, and saturation (IHS) transformation has also been found to improve wetland mapping (Kushwaha et al. 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Lidar", "text": "Similar to radar sensors, lidars (light detection and ranging) are also active sensors, sending and receiving energy produced by the sensor. However, lidars use energy with much shorter wavelengths (VIS and near-infrared) than radars (microwave). There are multiple types of lidar data including waveform and more readily available discrete point return lidar. Waveform lidars sample the entire laser pulse return (echo) whereas discrete point lidars only record a certain number returns (e.g., 2 or 4). This discussion will focus on discrete point return lidar data which are often available from state or local governments (Roger Barlowpersonal communication; Vierling et al. 2008) or are readily available from commercial mapping companies (Rosso et al. 2006). The vast majority of lidar data used to inform wetland mapping has been discrete return lidar data. However, it should be noted that waveform lidar technology is rapidly advancing and waveform lidar data are presently being Remote Sensing Data for Regional Wetland Mapping in the United States 97 collected by some companies. Therefore the use of waveform lidar for wetland mapping and monitoring purposes will likely increase in the future. Lidars emit short pulses of energy, often from the blue-green (bathymetric lidar) or the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (standard for terrestrial applications), and these pulses illuminate very small portions of the land's surface (Goodwin et al. 2006;Vierling et al 2008). A recent survey of airborne lidar sensors (Lemmens 2007) found that most terrestrial lidar sensors operate in the 900 to 1550 nm range. Lidar data can be used to calculate highly accurate x,y,z locations through the use of an onboard Global Positioning and Inertial Navigation System and by calculating the distance to an object by recording the amount of time it takes for an emitted pulse, or a portion of that pulse, to return to the sensor (Vierling et al. 2008). Discrete point lidars usually detect between two and four returns per laser pulse and the strength of those returns is largely determined by the types of materials that the pulse interacts with on the ground (similar to all optical data). For example, pure water strongly absorbs near-infrared energy and green leaves strongly reflect near-infrared energy. Therefore the intensity of near infrared lidar returns from water are normally weaker than those coming from a tree canopy. Lidar derived digital elevation maps (DEMs) are often used to enhance wetland mapping based on optical (Lichvar et al. 2006;Vierling et al. 2008) data, radar data, or both (Li and Chen 2005;Toyr\u00e4 and Pietroniro 2005). In this way, landscape position (e.g.. slope, depression, or peak) can be made part of the wetland mapping process similar to the information provided by stereoscopic viewing of aerial photographs. This additional information can aid in the detection of wetlands which are normally difficult to identify, such as vernal pools (Lichvar et al. 2006). Although topographic information is commonly available (e.g., photogrametrically derived data and USGS topographic maps) for the United States, the spatial resolution of these data is often not sufficient for wetland identification, especially in areas of subtle topographic change. In general conventional, non-lidar derived DEMs have much coarser vertical accuracies (1 -10 m) than those derived from lidar (15 cm -I m; Murphy et al. 2007b). Lidar derived DEMs can be used to detect subtle variations in topography (Toyra and Pietroniro 2005) that are often not visible when using the finest resolution optical data. Although the automated processes typically used to analyze digital data do not benefit as directly from the judgment of the analyst as they do in manual photogrammetry. digital DEMs can be used to estimate wetness indices based on slope and contributing area (Tenenbaum et al. 2006;Murphy et al. 2007b). In this way the lidar data are being used to provide some of the same information that is often ascertained by photointerpreters via stereoscopic analysis. Areas with higher wetness indices are more likely to contain wetlands (Murphy et al. 2007b). In addition, DEMs can be used to ascertain information on the functions that wetland serve by providing information on hydrologic connectivity and surface flow pathways (Sorensen et al. 2006;Murphy et al. 2007a). However, lidar provides information not only on elevation, but also on the intensity of the lidar return. The intensity of the lidar return may be helpful for estimating wetland hydrology (Brzank et al. 2004) below the surface of vegetative canopies, provided those canopies have gaps at the time when the lidar data were collected. The increasing availability of lidar sensors that use various wavelength lasers (Lemmens 2007), likely means that proper instrument selection will be increasingly important in a wetland mapping process. The relationship between laser wavelength and water absorption features in the near infrared region maybe critical. Although lidar derived DEMs and other lidar data provide opportunities for improved wetland mapping, these data do have restrictions. Similar to radar, the processing methods for lidar vary significantly from those developed for more traditional optical sensors (e.g., multispectral). A large reason for this is the fact that lidar data is often presented as point clouds which must then be interpolated to create DEM grids. Software has been developed to process these point data, but often it must be purchased separately from software developed to analyze other types of remotely sensed data. In addition, lidar data should be collected to different specifications based on their application and data collected for one application may not be suitable for another. For example, higher point densities may be needed from mapping in forested areas of relatively subtle topographic change. Point density can be improved by increasing the number of pulses, flying the platform at a lower altitude, decreasing the beam divergence angle, or simply collecting data over the same area twice (Goodwin et al. 2006). Collecting data from high platform altitudes (>3000 m) may compromise the ability of the dataset to resolve the Earth's surface below forest canopy by weakening the return signal since only signals above a certain threshold level are detected (Goodwin et al. 2006). The utility of lidar data is also limited in certain vegetation types. For example, Rossso et al. (2006) found that lidar could not be used to accurately map ground elevation under dense herbaceous vegetation. Some researchers have found that the accuracy reports provided by commercial vendors are insufficient (Rosso et al. 2006). Finally, although the price of obtaining and processing commercial lidar should decrease in the future, it is still relatively high (Vierling et al. 2008)."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In the past, researchers have debated as to whether spatial or spectral resolution is more important to the mapping of wetlands. It appears from available research that a combination of spatial and spectral resolutions is needed to map wetlands with remotely sensed data. The necessary spatial resolution, of course, depends upon the size of the wetland patch that is being mapped. For example, as a general rule, it takes an area three by three pixels wide to identify an object on the ground. The more similar a cover type is to adjacent cover types, the larger the area that will be needed (Federal Geographic Data Committee 1992). Although a minimum spatial resolution is needed to map wetlands, spectral information is also vital, especially when mapping wetlands with indistinct spectral signatures, such as forested wetlands. It is this optimal combination of spatial and spectral resolution that is necessary to best map wetlands. If available, the incorporation of finer resolution optical data into the mapping process can be used to effectively increase the spatial resolution of coarser resolution optical imagery (Dymond and Shepherd 2004). This process, often called pansharpening when panchromatic data are used, increases the ability to detect smaller wetlands. Different types of data are sensitive to different components of the landscape. These components (e.g., soil moisture, presence or absence of standing water, biomass, vegetation height, cellular structure, and more) can then be synthesized to compose a superior wetland map. This data fusion is aimed at reducing classification error by incorporating more spectral information. Since radar and optical data are sensitive to very different landscape characteristics, the combination of radar and optical data can significantly improve wetland mapping (Sahagian and Melack 1996;Kushwaha et al., 2000;Ramsey et al. 1998;Lyon and McCarthy 1995;Toyra et al. 2002;Silva et at. 2008) and provide a superior land cover map (Rignot 1997;Ramsey et al. 1998). Optical-radar fusion has been shown to improve the accuracy of land cover mapping by as much as 10% (Haack and Bechdol 2000). Radar data not only bring to classifications information on inundation, plant structure, and biomass, the data have also been found to improve soil moisture estimation, even in forested wetlands (Lang and Kasischke 2008). Although optical sensors may be sensitive to soil moisture, some researchers believe that they are less suitable for this application due to their relatively low signal to noise ratio (Neusch and Sties 1999). Multispectral and hyperspectral data do, however, provide superior information concerning the identity of vegetation communities derived mainly from the molecular and cellular structure of the plants. The potential of optical-radar fusion for wetland mapping is furthered by recent increases in the availability of multiple wavelength (e.g., launch of Radarsat-2, PALSAR, and Terra SAR-X) and multiple polarization radar data and the improvement of the spatial resolution of both optical (e.g., Quickbird, 2.4 m) and radar (i.e., Radarsat-2, 3 m) data. The availability of radar data and techniques to process radar data have improved to the point that the Canadian government is using SAR data as part of their national wetland mapping program (Milton et at. 2003;Li and Chen 2005). The US government (NASA) is currently working towards the launch of new radar satellites (e.g., DESDynI, SMAP, and SWOT), as are the governments of other countries including Germany and Brazil (MAPSAR) and India (RISAT). Companies currently collecting fine resolution optical data are planning to expand their capabilities which will make the acquisition of these datasets during optimal time periods easier. For example, DigitalGlobe which currently provides QuickBird data is expanding their data delivery options with the addition of WorldView-1 (0.5 m pachromatic) which was launched in fall of 2007 and WorldView-2 (0.46 m panchromatic and 1.8 m 8 band multispectral data) which is scheduled to be launched in early 2009. The combination of the three DigitalGlobe satellites will provide daily <1 m data over the entire globe (personal communication -Brett Thomassie; information also available at www.digitalglobe.com ). Newer technologies (e.g., hyperspectral, SAR, and lidar) have the potential to solve many Of our most intractable wetland mapping challenges. Hyperspectral data can be used to identify wetland patches which are spectrally indiscernible using multispectral data and are often better at identifying individual plant species (e.g., invasive plants) than multispectral data. SAR data can be used to reveal subtle patterns in hydrology which indicate the presence of wetlands that are normally difficult to identify (e.g., forested wetlands) and the functioning of all wetlands. Lidar data can be used to locate low tying areas which often harbor wetlands, especially when they have a large upland contributing area. Fine resolution lidar data can also be used to locate vernal pools which are often very small and flooded for relatively short lengths of time. The identification of vernal pools is important since these small areas often have a disproportionate impact on biodiversity, especially when compared to the small area that they occupy on the landscape. In addition, their ability to provide habitat is particularly vulnerable to climate change. For example, small changes in hydroperiod can lead to their failure to provide breeding habitat for many amphibian species. Lidar data can also be used to map hydrologic flow pathways which regulate the ability of wetlands to provide valuable ecosystem services (e.g., water quality). The future holds promise for an expanded wetland mapping toolbox with greater availability of currently used remotely sensed data, new remotely sensed data, more robust hardware, and new processing capabilities. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the available sensors are expected to increase rapidly along with the accessibility of the data (Glackin 1998). Technology assessments in 1996 concluded that the full potential of then current remote sensing imagery had not been satisfactorily explored (Sahagian and Melack 1996;Wilen and Smith 1996) but now, recently available imagery provides an even greater opportunity for advances in wetland mapping. In addition to spectral resolution, temporal resolution is also vital to the advancement of wetland mapping. Multitemporal imagery can improve wetland mapping capabilities (Toyra et al. 2001;Li and Chen 2005), especially when images are collected during different seasons and moisture regimes (Kushwaha et al. 2000). Wetlands are inherently dynamic systems and multi-temporal data are often needed to detect these changes. Changes in plant phenology (Silva et al. 2008) and biomass, as well as changes in soil moisture and flooding patterns, are seen throughout the year (Lyon and McCarthy 1995). Multitemporal SAR data can be used to map hydroperiod as it changes in response to seasonal variations in weather and phenology and periods of extreme weather (i.e., floods and droughts; . These hydroperiod maps can not only be used to infer wetland function (e.g., denitrification), they can also be used to update wetland boundaries as they shift in response to climate and land cover change and to identify lands that are transitional between wetlands and uplands. These transitional lands which are not flooded or saturated long enough to be considered wetlands may still serve important ecosystem services which are considered to be typical of wetlands (e.g., habitat provision and biogeochemical transformations). One example of these transitional areas is prior converted wetlands presently on agricultural fields. Many have been drained enough to allow for cultivation but remain flooded or saturated for considerable portions of the year. It should also be noted that the collection of imagery during drought, flood, or normal years can have a large impact on wetland mapping outcomes and ideal time of collection depends on the ultimate goal of the mapping project. Selection of the ideal spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of remotely sensed imagery, as well as acquisition date will of course depend on the specific goals of the mapping project and the resources available to carry-out the project. Selection of the appropriate type(s) of imagery is vital to enhanced wetland mapping, but the addition of ancillary data (Sader et al. 1995;Li and Chen 2005) and the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and hydrologic models can also greatly benefit the mapping process. Ancillary datasets that are beneficial to the wetland mapping process include (but are not limited to) information on soils, water bodies, topography, current and prior land use, tides, and weather. Decision support systems (e.g., decision trees, GIS, and hydrologic models) can then be used to extract valuable information from these ancillary datasets in combination with remotely sensed data. The National Research Council (1995) found that GIS holds great possibilities for the study of wetlands and that models make wetland delineation more successful and expeditious. For example, a modified version of a water management simulation model (DRAINMOD) was used to aid in the definition and identification of wetlands via their hydrology (Skaggs et al. 1994). Doren et al. (1999) hypothesized that in the future a combination of aerial photography, rapidly advancing satellite imagery (e.g., hyperspectral data and fine spatial resolution multispectral data), and GIS will allow the detailed mapping of wetland vegetation comparable to those created with detailed ground surveys. Others offer a more cautious predication. Cowardin and Golet (1995) argued that although remotely sensed data in conjunction with GIS and modeling hold promise for improved wetland mapping, wetland maps will never be perfect as they are an attempt to put artificial boundaries on natural gradations. This ecological reality can never be fully reconciled, but wetland scientists can develop improved maps to reduce errors. The rapidly updateable maps that digital data and especially satellite images provide support adaptive management of wetland ecosystem services and other natural resources. The value of a wetland map can be increased dramatically when it is used in a modeling framework or a GIS. Spatially explicit information concerning the size, type, location, and other details concerning wetlands can be used in models and other decision support systems. Wetland function may be inferred by some of the characteristics that can be illustrated with a wetland map, such as hydrology, biomass, area, shape, location, and relation to other landscape features, like streams and agricultural fields. For example, the frequency and extent of flooding greatly affects many wetland functions including organic accumulation and storage, primary productivity, and nutrient cycling (Mitsch and Gosselink 2007), Wetland area, location, and number can give us information concerning flood and pollution control. As updated maps demonstrate that wetlands are disappearing, a loss of function is often inferred. But this loss is not purely through the reduction in wetland area. It is also due to a reduction in linkage, average size, and other attributes that can be assessed with a map (National Research Council 1995). Ultimately, this characterization of the loss of wetland function may help the public understand the consequences of wetland destruction (Tiner 1997a)."}]
