[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Yet, in apparent contradiction to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, 7 cortical atrophy is maximal, not in A\u2424 rich regions, but in medial temporal structures. 5 Another recent challenge to A\u2424's posited central role in AD pathogenesis, discussed by others, 5 comes from the clinical underperformance of A\u2424-modifying therapies including immunotherapy-mediated A\u2424 clearance that failed to halt the dementia progression. 8 Paralleling the lack of frontal atrophy is an apparent lack of frontally mediated cognitive dysfunction in preclinical and mild AD, 2-6 but this missing \"frontal effect\" might reflect insufficient study sensitivity due to small patient numbers and a limited range of frontal cognition measures. In patients with established dementia, cerebral A\u2424 deposition is widespread, but preclinically is more focally concentrated in the frontal lobe, temporal pole and neocortex, and posterior cingulate. 1 If A\u2424 impairs neuronal function, then preclinical APOE 4 carriers could show accelerated decline on tests sensitive to frontal lobe function as they do on memory tests.\nWe previously reported that memory, but not letter fluency (a frontally sensitive task), declines in APOE 4 carriers during this preclinical period. 9 Because a single frontal measure may not be sufficiently sensitive, we explored the differences between preclinical APOE 4 carriers and noncarriers on a battery of frontal/executive measures to test the hypothesis that A\u2424 deposition adversely affects cognition.\nMETHODS Study participants. From January 1, 1994, through December 31, 2009 , cognitively normal residents of Maricopa County age 21 years and older were recruited through local media ads and underwent APOE genotyping and longitudinal neuropsychological assessment every 2 years. Determination of APOE genotype was performed using Taqman single nucleotide polymorphism assays. 10 All identified 4 homozygotes (HMZ) were matched by age, gender, and education to one 4 heterozygote (HTZ; all with the 3/4 genotype) and 2 4 noncarriers, but many additional heterozygous persons and noncarriers were also eligible for enrollment. Each participant had screening tests that included a neurologic examination, the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D), Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and Structured Psychiatric Interview for DSM-III-R. We excluded anyone with potentially confounding medical, neurologic, or psychiatric problems. None met published criteria for MCI, 11 AD, 12 other forms of dementia, or major depressive disorder. 13 Entry criteria included scores of at least 27 on the MMSE (with at least 1 of 3 on the recall subtest), 10 or less on the Ham-D, and perfect scores on the FAQ and IADL."}, {"section_title": "Clinical sample.", "text": "Those who subsequently met published criteria for MCI, AD, or any form of dementia during follow-up, and were thus excluded, were used to test any findings from the main analysis. The longitudinal neuropsychological data from these 27 individuals were examined to determine whether any identified frontal measures showed actual decline from the normal to MCI and dementia states. Test decline was considered present only if both of 2 raters (R.J.C. and D.E.C.L.) agreed in independent ratings.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents.

For additional data on longitudinal", "text": "modeling, see appendix e-1 on the Neurology \u00ae Web site at www.neurology.org. To isolate the effect of longitudinal cognitive change for our neuropsychological measures, we used a statistical method to gauge change in performance over time. 17 The acceleration of the rate of decline for each of the predetermined measures for carriers (collectively and also separately for each of the subgroups of HMZ and HTZ) was compared to those of the noncarriers using a mixed model approach for modeling cross-sectional and longitudinal data. 17, 18 A quadratic model was selected to allow for comparison of the acceleration in the rate of decline between groups, as well as linear effects (velocity of decline Longitudinal change results are summarized in table 2. As previously reported, only AVLT-LTM showed greater acceleration of decline (quadratic effect) in APOE 4 carriers relative to noncarriers ( p \u03ed 0.04). WAIS-DSS ( p \u03ed 0.01) and PASAT-3 ( p \u03ed 0.02) showed greater velocity of decline (linear effect) of 4 carriers relative to noncarriers. When carriers were subdivided into HMZ and HTZ and compared to noncarriers, significant quadratic effects were found only for the AVLT-LTM and only in HMZ ( p \u03ed 0.01). WAIS-DSS was the only measure to show a significantly steeper decline in HTZ than noncarriers (linear trend, p \u03ed 0.03). HMZ declined more than noncarriers on all mental arithmetic tests (linear trends, PASAT-3, p \u03ed 0.01; PASAT-2, p \u03ed 0.004; WAIS-arith, p \u03ed 0.048) in addition to the AVLT-LTM ( p \u03fd 0.001). When frontal/executive measure comparisons were adjusted for AVLT-LTM, the results did not change. APOE 4 gene dose effect was significant for AVLT-LTM ( p \u03ed 0.01, linear trend) and borderline for the PASAT-2 second ( p \u03ed 0.06, linear trend).\nThe IGT results are summarized in table e-1. A total of 44 4 noncarriers, 27 e3/4 HTZ, and 12 4 HMZ over age 50 years completed the IGT. The groups did not differ by age, educational background, or performance on any neuropsychological measure. IGT t score ( p \u03ed 0.046) and total net score ( p \u03ed 0.021) declined with increasing age for the group overall, but there were no significant interactions with APOE genotype or carrier status.\nA total of 13 4 HMZ, 9 4 HTZ, and 5 4 noncarriers (11 women and 16 men) who were cognitively normal at entry converted to MCI (n \u03ed 25) or AD (n \u03ed 2) after a mean follow-up interval of 86.6 \u03ee 44.0 months (3.8 \u03ee 1.6 test epochs) and so were excluded from the above analyses. The frequency of test decline is summarized in table e-2. Memory was clinically impaired in all cases and in 75%-78% of cases AVLT LTM and complex figure test recall scores showed clear evidence of progressive decline over successive epochs up to the clinical diagnosis. PASAT declined in 50% of cases, all 4 carriers ( p \u03ed 0.042). WCST declined with similar frequency but with no difference between 4 carriers and noncarriers. DISCUSSION APOE 4 influences the age at onset of AD in a gene dose-dependent fashion. 19, 20 By age 65 years, healthy-appearing APOE 4 carriers have higher amounts of cerebral amyloid than noncarriers evident both on autopsy 21 and amyloid-ligand (PiB) PET, 1 reduced CSF A\u2424 levels, 22 and declining memory performance on neuropsychological tests. 9 Collectively, these changes define and characterize the preclinical stage of AD.\nThe amyloid cascade hypothesis based upon autosomal dominant mutations that cause early onset familial AD is the prevailing model for AD pathogenesis. 7 It is supported by numerous studies that collectively reveal a variety of A\u2424-mediated adverse effects on neuronal physiology [23] [24] [25] implying that areas of A\u2424 deposition in the brain should manifest impaired function. 26 In transgenic mice, A\u2424's role in neurodegeneration and memory loss is upstream from and dependent upon tau. [27] [28] [29] In patients, A\u2424 deposition precedes hippocampal atrophy that in turn correlates most directly with memory loss. 2 We again found an acceleration of memory decline in preclinical APOE 4 carriers beginning around age 55-60 years, but no similar acceleration of decline on any frontal/executive measure despite the greater amount of fibrillar amyloid in frontal than medial temporal regions. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The frontal/executive measures we used were age-sensitive, surveyed a wide range of relevant skills, and comprised a unique dataset in the extensive literature of cognitive aging. Although none demonstrated significant quadratic effects, several showed significant linear effects (uncorrected for multiple comparisons), particularly mental arithmetic tasks in 4 HMZ, the group with the heaviest frontal amyloid burden. 1 This could reflect the direct effect of A\u2424 itself on neuronal function or another pathophysiologic factor that causes both A\u2424 deposition and neuronal dysfunction.\nIn a small but separate group of individuals with incident MCI and AD who were excluded from the study, the PASAT declined in 50% of cases (as did the WCST), which was far more than other frontal measures. We did not find PASAT decline in the 5 APOE 4 noncarriers, but this probably reflects the small size of our clinical sample. Although it has been reported that executive measures are more likely to decline in 4 noncarriers with very mild AD, 30 differences in test batteries, cohort characteristics, and study design may account for the seemingly divergent findings obtained in our study. However, it should be noted that both studies concur on the absence of robust frontal dysfunction in APOE 4 carriers.\nCognitive studies of normal aging have consistently demonstrated declining frontally mediated skills including working memory and psychomotor speed. [31] [32] [33] Our findings are consistent with this age effect, but less so with a further APOE genotype interaction. Our IGT administration was a first attempt to encompass an aspect of frontally mediated cognition that is not generally surveyed in cognitive aging studies or well-captured by traditional psychometric tests. Others have shown that the IGT in cross-sectional studies is sensitive to early stage bvFTD. 16 Our cohort of 4 carriers was similar in size to these bvFTD cohorts, yet they did not perform less well than noncarriers despite their greater frontal A\u2424 burden.\nPreclinical AD is a recently characterized entity 34 that provides the opportunity to directly test brainbehavior relationships related to the relatively focal patches of specific pathology including frontal lobe A\u2424 and medial temporal neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). While the tests in our battery should not be inferred to reflect precise anatomically defined frontal subsectors, they are nonetheless sensitive to frontal/executive func-tion more generally. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 2 Melbourne Healthy Aging Study, 4 and others 5, 6 have examined the relationship between neuropsychological test performance and cerebral A\u2424. All found memory to be the major area of decline; none found significant frontal effects. In the ADNI cohort, memory decline correlated most directly not with PiB uptake, but with hippocampal atrophy, although the atrophy itself correlated with PiB uptake. 2 There was no clinical or cognitive decline associated with progression of PiB retention in an ADNI-Mayo Clinic preclinical cohort, although the cognitive battery used was abbreviated to the MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating. 35 Areas of maximum PiB uptake correlated poorly with cortical atrophy, leading to speculation about selective vulnerability of the hippocampus to A\u2424-mediated toxicity. 5 Neuropathologic studies have shown that A\u2424 deposition begins in neocortical regions and not the hippocampus. Conversely, NFT formation begins in the entorhinal cortex, is nearly universal over age 65 years, and is part of normal cognitive aging (including preclinical stage AD). 36, 37 Medial temporal NFT pathology provides a more proximate explanation for preclinical stage hippocampal atrophy and memory loss 38 although acceleration of NFT formation in the presence of A\u2424 is possible.\nThrough longitudinal modeling of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery in a large cohort, we found faster decline on mental arithmetic tests in APOE 4 homozygotes. Yet none showed an acceleration of decline as did memory, and a large number of tests in other domains failed to discriminate APOE 4 carriers and noncarriers at all. There are several possible explanations for this. First, A\u2424 may not be as neurotoxic in humans as animal models have suggested. We cannot distinguish between the direct toxicity of amyloid itself or another factor that caused both cognitive decline and amyloid deposition, the latter even potentially formed in reaction to the insulting event as a protective mechanism (thus attenuating frontal dysfunction). Second, assuming A\u2424 is neurotoxic, its density may have been insufficient during the preclinical period to cause enough dysfunction for these tests to detect. Consistent with (but not proving) this possibility, we found clear examples of progressive decline on the WCST in individual cases at the later stage of incident MCI and AD. Third, poor baseline test performance could reduce our power to detect subsequent decline, particularly on the more difficult tests in our battery. However, even in a post hoc analysis when poor baseline performers of the WCST were excluded, we still did not find evidence of greater decline in 4 carriers. Fourth, other tests and frontal lobe-mediated functions were not fully assessed, such as social cognition, response inhibition, interference/conflict monitoring and control, and source mem-ory. Finally, soluble amyloid monomers and oligomers not imaged with PiB-PET may cause greater neuronal dysfunction than fibrillar amyloid. 23, 24 This might explain the greater impairment of memory in the absence of medial temporal PiB uptake, but is speculative.\nPreclinical acceleration of memory decline in APOE 4 carriers was not accompanied by acceleration of any frontal measure decline. APOE 4 HMZ had greater velocity of decline on mental arithmetic tests, but our data cannot distinguish between the potentially direct neurotoxic effects of A\u2424 itself, or another factor that caused both neuronal dysfunction and amyloid deposition. This finding should be regarded as exploratory and warrants confirmation in an independent cohort. While autosomal dominant familial AD clearly establishes a role for amyloid in AD pathogenesis, and multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated the potentially deleterious effects of amyloid on neuronal function and survival, our relative paucity of findings, taken together with prior studies showing poor correlation between amyloid and atrophy, and the therapeutic failures to date of amyloid-modifying therapies, suggest that it may be time to reconsider amyloid's currently envisioned role in pathophysiologic models of AD."}]
