[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Corn (Zea mays L.) comprises 95% of the feed grain production in the United States. The area dedicated to corn production in the southeastern United States has increased over the past decade, raising concerns about environmental degradation, and creating a need for more sustainable productions systems. One production system that addresses these concerns is the white clover (Trifolium repens L.) living mulch (LM). Previous research defined a sustainable LM system for corn production, but questions regarding water use efficiency (WUE) of the system remain. In this experiment, soil moisture was monitored in the top 30 cm of the soil, from 0 to 15 and 15 to 30 cm, during the corn growing season in a LM, crimson clover (CC) (Trifolium incarnatum L.), and cereal rye (CR) (Secale cereale L.) cover crops. We found that soil volumetric water content (VWC) was greater in the CR treatment than in the LM throughout the growing season, whereas CC and LM were similar 60 days after planting (DAP). The VWC between corn rows was greater in the CR and CC treatments than the LM in both years of the study. The CC and CR treatments had greater WUE than the LM treatment in both years of the study. The WUE was reduced in cover crop treatments in 2016 compared with 2015, likely due to drought conditions in 2016. These results suggest the LM system may be best suited to regions with high rainfall, soils with high water holding capacity, and/or supplemental irrigation."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "C orn comprises the majority of the feed grain production in the United States (Capehart, 2015) . The traditional region for corn production is the midwestern United States, but the area dedicated to corn in the southeastern United States increased by 50% between and 2016 (USDA, 2016 . Increasing the area dedicated to corn raises concerns about negative environmental consequences, such as eutrophication and soil erosion. Although it is accepted that the use of winter cover crops reduces erosion and nutrient loss (Czapar et al., 2002; Daigh et al., 2014; Pantoja et al., 2015; Marcillo and Miguez, 2017) , less than 4% of the farmland in Georgia is planted to cover crops according to the 2012 census of agriculture (USDA, 2014) . The most common annual cover crops used in Georgia are cereal rye (CR) and crimson clover (CC). Cereal rye provides an excellent cover crop to control soil erosion, but has disadvantages of increased soil N immobilization due to a high C/N ratio, potentially delayed planting of cash crops, and excessive residue may be difficult to manage (Snapp et al., 2005) . Crimson clover is a legume and has the advantage of fixing its own N, but germination and establishment, cost of establishment, and lack of a reliable calculation of N credit are problematic.\nA persistent problem with annual cover crops is cost and risk associated with establishment (Snapp et al., 2005) . Use of perennial legume species is of interest to avoid annual reseeding of the cover crop and take advantage of biologically fixed N to replace fertilizer N (Zemenchik et al., 2000; Duda et al., 2003; Affeldt et al., 2004; Kramberger et al., 2009) . However, the ability of the legume to survive under shaded conditions for extended periods and/or the inability to regrow following cash crop harvest have been impediments to adoption of these systems (Snapp et al., 2005) . Sanders et al. (2017) manipulated row width and herbicide banding patterns to develop a white clover living mulch (LM) cover crop system capable of re-establishng to near 100% basal cover between corn harvest in late summer and corn establishment the following spring.\nThe use of a white clover LM cover crop system has several environmental and agricultural benefits. The LM system can increase the structure and function of the soil microbial community (Nakamoto and Tsukamoto, 2006; Deguchi et al., 2007) , reduce erosion (Hall et al., 1984) , increase the supply of nutrients to the row crop (Teasdale et al., 2007; Deguchi et al., 2012) , and reduce"}, {"section_title": "Core Ideas", "text": "\u2022 Living mulch cover crops help stabilize erosive soils when used with row crops.\n\u2022 White clover living mulch systems use water in the surface 15 cm of soil.\n\u2022 Supplemental irrigation is necessary to support a living mulch corn production system. \u2022 Canopy closure induces soil moisture equilibration due to shading of the clover.\n\u2022 Water use efficiency is less in the living mulch system, especially during drought.\nherbicide use (Hartwig and Ammon, 2002) . The LM functions as a companion crop system, and the two species have distinctly different production periods throughout the growing season. White clover reaches peak biomass early in the corn growing season prior to corn canopy closure, whereas peak corn production occurs nearly 60 d later (Sanders et al., 2017) . Given the temporal differences between the peak growth periods of the two species, there are likely differences in patterns of resource utilization. Transpiration occurs during periods of photosynthesis and biomass accretion (Baldocchi, 1994) , and therefore the water use patterns in the LM system are likely to mimic the growth of the cohort species. We hypothesize that additional water demand by white clover in the LM system will decrease soil volumetric water content (VWC), increase water use, and decrease water use efficiency (WUE) when compared with corn growing in annual cover crop systems. The objectives of this study were to evaluate white clover and corn growth, grain yield, VWC, water use, and grain WUE in LM, CR, and CC cover crop systems under uniform irrigation."}, {"section_title": "MATeRIALS And MeTHodS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Site description", "text": "The experiment was performed in 2015 and 2016 at the J.

The soil at the research site is a Cecil sandy loam (fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults). Soil samples were taken from the 0-to 15-cm depth and 15-to 30-cm depth at the time of reflectometer installation to determine soil texture and bulk density using the hydrometer (Gee and Or, 2002) and core methods (Grossman and Reinsch, 2002) , respectively. Additionally, the soil profile at the site was described to a depth of ~2 m and samples were taken from each horizon and analyzed for texture and bulk density (Table 1) .

Soils were amended with lime, K, and P so that pH was at least 6.2, and K and P were a minimum of 280 and 90 kg ha -1 , respectively. The research site was prepared by disking the soil twice, followed by a cultipacking operation, and seeded on 17 Oct. 2014 and 20 Oct. 2015 . Seeding rates were 9, 28, and 90 kg ha -1 for 'Durana' white clover, 'Dixie Reseeding' CC, and 'Wrens Abruzzi' cereal rye. The white clover seed was broadcast using a spin-cast manual push fertilizer/seed spreader (TurfEx, Madison Heights, MI) onto the seed bed, the CR and CC seed were broadcast by hand, and the plot area was cultipacked a second time after seeding to ensure proper seed-soil contact. The cover crops were allowed to establish under natural rainfall conditions throughout the fall, winter, and early spring months. The cover crop treatments were assigned to the research area using a randomized complete block design with three replications in plots, which were 6.1 \u00d7 7.3 m.\nFour water content reflectometers (CS625, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) were installed in the center of each plot on 2 Jan. 2015 and 17 Feb. 2016 and connected to a data logger (CR206, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT). The reflectometers were installed at a 30\u00b0 angle to the soil surface so that each reflectometer monitored a 15-cm vertical column of soil. They were arranged to monitor depths of 0 to 15 cm and 15 to 30 cm, both between and beneath where rows of corn were to be planted, referred to as locations hereafter. The data loggers were programmed to record measurements at 10-min intervals for the duration of the corn growing season. Ten-day VWC averages were calculated for each depth-location (i.e., 0-15 cm beneath corn row, etc.), within each plot using the VWC data collected using the reflectometers and data loggers. These values were used to compare water content and use patterns throughout the corn growing season among the three cover crop systems.\nThe CR plots were treated with a broadcast application of glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine) at a rate of 1.1 kg a.i. ha -1 35 d prior to corn planting on 27 Mar. 2015 and 24 Mar. 2016.

The LM plots were treated with a combination of glyphosate and dicamba at rates of 1 kg and 0.5 kg a.i. ha -1 , respectively, using a hooded sprayer 14 d prior to corn planting on 17 Apr. 2015 and 14 Apr. 2016. Shields were placed inside the sprayer hoods to limit spray width to a 20-cm band on 90-cm centers.\nCorn (Dekalb DKC64-69, GENVT3P) was planted on 1 May 2015 and 28 Apr. 2016 using a no-till planter (John Deere 7300 MaxEmerge, Deere and Co., Moline, IL) set on 90-cm row widths at a population density of 90,000 plants ha -1 . The CC and CR plots were treated with a broadcast application of atrazine (1-chloro-3-ethylamino-5-isopropylamino-2,4,6-triazine) and pendimethalin (3,4-dimethyl-2,6-dinitro-Npentan-3-yl-aniline), each at a rate of 1 kg a.i. ha -1 , when corn seedlings were at the VE stage. The LM plots were treated with the same herbicide combination using a hooded sprayer, which only applied herbicide to the same 20-cm bands into which the corn was planted. No herbicide was applied to the area between the corn rows where the white clover was growing. The CR treatments received 56 kg ha -1 N at planting and 224 kg ha -1 N at the V6 stage. An N credit was calculated using the University of Georgia potentially minearlizable N calculator (http://aesl. ces.uga.edu/mineralization/) from textbook values of N and cell wall content of CC at the bud stage, which was 105 and 102 kg ha -1 for 2015 and 2016, respectively. Corn in the CC treatments were topdressed with an additional 168 kg ha -1 N at the V6 stage in both years. White clover growth in the LM treatments is dynamic and the N contribution from the system difficult to estimate. Thus, case-history experience was used to estimate the appropriate amount and timing of N fertilizer. Our previous work indicated that 56 kg at V6 was appropriate (data not published). Supplemental irrigation was applied uniformly to the plots using overhead sprinkler irrigation systems."}, {"section_title": "Corn Height, white Clover Mass, and Corn Canopy Light Interception", "text": "Corn height was estimated weekly by averaging the heights of 10 randomly selected corn plants from the center two rows of each plot.

Rising plate meter measurements were made at 10 locations within each plot, and mean clover mass estimated using the calibration curve for that week.\nCorn canopy light interception was measured weekly until the VT stage of corn development. A line quantum sensor (Model LI 191sb, Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) was used to measure the amount of light above the corn canopy and the amount of light reaching the clover canopy in the LM plots, or the surface of the cover crop residue in the CC and CR plots, at two locations in each plot. The percentage of light intercepted by the corn canopy was then calculated using Eq. \nThe three cover crop treatments had similar corn height until 62 DAP in 2015, after which the LM treatment was shorter (Fig. 2) . The CR and CC treatments had similar corn heights throughout the 2016 growing season, but the LM treatment was shorter 27 DAP to the end of the growing season. All three cover crop treatments had final corn heights in excess of 230 cm in both years of the study.\nCorn canopy light interception was similar among the three cover crop treatments at all sampling dates in 2015, except for 40 DAP (Fig. 3) .

All three treatments had greater WUE in 2015 than in 2016. dISCUSSIon Corn height and shading are of primary interest when investigating the competitive relationship between the corn crop and the underlying white clover LM cover crop (Sanders et al., 2017) . The shading by the corn results in the clover senescing its leaves and releasing additional nutrients for the corn crop at approximately 40% light interception. Consistent with previous studies (Sanders et al., 2017; Andrews et al., unpublished, 2018) clover biomass decreased at approximately 40% canopy light interception. Drought effects in 2016 and reduced corn height, delayed canopy development and time to 40% light interception until 56 DAP, approximately 16 d later than in 2015 (Fig. 3) . High temperatures (Al-Ghumaiz, 2012), drought stress (Dodd and Orr, 1995; Grieu et al., 1995) , and shading (Lin et al., 1998; Ehret et al., 2015; Sanders et al., 2017) are detrimental to white clover growth and the combination of stresses appeared to have induced a reduction of clover biomass prior to 40% light interception.\nCover crop residue was visible for both the CC and CR treatments even after corn harvest. Under irrigated conditions, soil moisture can be replenished after annual cover crops have been killed prior planting cash crops and the cover crop residues often serve to conserve water (Dabney et al., 2001) . Conversely, the white clover in the LM treatment actively grew and competed with corn plants for water and nutrients until corn canopy closure in the LM system (Fig. 5) . Therefore, the dead residue likely conserved water in the annual cover crop system, whereas the white clover in the LM system was a competitor with the corn. To our knowledge, these are the first data comparing water use among annual cover crop systems and a LM cover crop system.\nCorn height and grain yield decrease when plants are subjected to drought stress, when in competition with other plants for resources, or a combination of the two (Eck, 1986; Panahyan-e-Kivi et al., 2012; Aydinsakir et al., 2013; Reid et al., 2014; Soderlund et al., 2014) . Water stress at vegetative, silking, or grain fill can have negative impacts on corn yield (Eck, 1986; Soderlund et al., 2014; Benjamin et al., 2015) but the greatest impact is at the vegetative (V1-V12) and silking (R1) stages (Eck, 1986; Soderlund et al., 2014) . Thus, the droughty climatic conditions of 2016 were especially detrimental to corn growing in the LM treatment as soil VWC was lower from the V6 to the R1 stage, compared with the annual cover crop treatments (Table 3 , Fig. 5 ).\nDespite their environmental benefits, winter cover crops can have negative effects on the following year's crop growth under rainfed conditions. Both cereal and leguminous annual cover crops can reduce crop height compared with no cover crop. Height reduction can be due to N immobilization if the C/N ratio is high, poor residue removal, and/or depletion of soil moisture prior to planting (Ebelhar et al., 1984; Czapar et al., 2002; Norsworthy, 2004; Miguez and Bollero, 2006; Pantoja et al., 2015) . However, the reduction in corn height within the LM treatment was under irrigated conditions in both years, even when soil VWC would suggest water was not a limiting factor. However, the height reduction was exacerbated by drought in 2016 (Fig. 2) . This response is consistent with other studies when corn was grown in clover-based LM systems (Martin et al., 1999; Ziyomo et al., 2013) . In addition, high temperatures (Al-Ghumaiz, 2012) , drought stress (Dodd and Orr, 1995; Grieu et al., 1995) , and shading (Lin et al., 1998; Ehret et al., 2015; Sanders et al., 2017) are detrimental to white clover growth. Consistent with previous studies (Sanders et al., 2017; Andrews et al., unpublished, 2018) , clover biomass decreased at approximately 40% canopy light interception. Drought effects in 2016 and reduced corn height delayed canopy development and time to 40% light interception until 56 DAP, approximately 16 d later than in 2015 (Fig. 3) .\nShorter corn plants is a disadvantage in the LM treatment because of reduced leaf senescence and N release by the white clover resulting from greater light penetration to the white clover canopy (Sanders et al., 2017) . Leaf loss and residue mineralization accounts for the majority of the N release in the LM system. Nitrogen mineralization from plant residue and soil increases as water content increases with maximum mineralization occurring under field capacity and slightly saturated conditions (Stanford and Epstein, 1974; Myers et al., 1982; Quemada and Cabrera, 1997) . In a neighboring study, Andrews et al. (unpublished, 2018) documented reduced N mineralization in a LM system because of insufficient soil water content in 2016. Given the disparity in VWC in the LM system of this study it is likely that corn also had insufficient N supply in 2016 because of droughtrelated effects on N mineralization in the LM treatment. . Soil volumetric water content (VWC) of the three cover crop systems over the course of the corn growing season averaged over both years, both locations within the plot, and both depths. Different letters indicate significant differences (P \u2264 0.05) in VWC on a given day after planting (DAP). Arrows at V6 and R1 indicate when corn was in the sixth leaf and silking stage, respectively. Table 2 .

"}, {"section_title": "ConCLUSIon", "text": "The objective of growing cash crops in living mulch systems is to optimize productivity of a system rather than maximizing production of either cohort species since they both compete for the same resources necessary for plant growth. Competition for available resources is likely to vary depending on environmental conditions, even though the cohort species may have different production seasons. Such is the case with the white clover LM cover crop system of corn production. Corn grain yield was lower in the LM cover crop system than when annual cover crops systems were used in this study. However, the severity of yield reduction was greater during the 2016 drought year than in 2015, when normal rainfall was received, even though supplemental irrigation was applied. Lower yields in both years resulted in lower WUE of the LM system, but drought in 2016 resulted in a greater impact on WUE of the LM system than in 2015 when rainfall was normal. The advantage of the white clover LM cover crop system is the reduced need for N fertilizer and ability of white clover to suppress weeds in between the corn rows. However, savings from reduced N and herbicide application are partially offset by the need for additional irrigation during corn production. The results of this study indicate that the LM system may be restricted to regions that receive high amounts of rainfall during the corn growing season, have soils with high water holding capacity, and/or have access to supplemental irrigation to accommodate competition for water between the cohort white clover and corn crops.
