Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey continuously innovates in order to improve its programs' quality. The Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey has engaged in high-quality distance education for the past 25 years throughout which it has tested different techniques for teaching face-to-face but also remote courses.

Thus, the university's success depends on affordability."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Given the Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey has tried different delivery methods for distance education throughout its history, it has realized that not all methods work for all programs. Thus, it has chosen different methods for different programs. Moreover, in 25 years, technology has evolved; thus, its methods and tools have also evolved. It has used land lines, satellites, and the Internet. It has used static and dynamic content. It has conducted synchronous and asynchronous courses.\nIn today's eLearning scenario, main types of eLearning exist: synchronous, asynchronous, and a mix (blended eLearning). Synchronous eLearning involves real-time online studies through chat and videoconferencing, whereas instructors can conduct asynchronous learning even while students remain offline. Typically, instructors deliver asynchronous eLearning courses via Web-enabled discussion boards where students complete the course at their own pace and at a time they find convenient (Skylar, 2009; Piotrowski, 2010; Sun & Chen, 2016 ).\nAn asynchronous elearning environment gives students more time to reflect and collaborate with their peers and provide peer feedback (So & Brush, 2008; Brindley, Walti, & Blaschke, 2009; Harris, Mishra, & Koehler, 2009; Lin, Hong, & Lawrenz, 2012; Simonson, Smaldino, Albright, & Zvacek, 2014; Pendry & Salvatore, 2015 , Shahabadia & Uplaneb, 2015 . The asynchronous method has become most popular eLearning method because many free and easy-to-use eLearning tools that require minimal guidance and minimal hardware exist (Meloni, 2010; Simonson et al., 2014) . It also has other benefits. It forces every student in the class to participate in the discussion. It makes it easier to participate for students who are shy and not comfortable with face-to-face discussions. And it holds individual students accountable and responsible for their own learning. Moreover, in this asynchronous learning model, the instructor becomes a facilitator instead of a lecturer, which positively influences the learning experience.\nBy leveraging eLearning, students can take courses from all around the state and at their own pace. The courses include material in electronic format such as videos, PowerPoint presentations, documents, and so on. Students can interact among themselves and with the instructor using a standard LMS that provides email, wikis, forums, blogs, chat, and other communication tools. Students can submit projects or class related work using hot potatoes, SCORM packages, questionnaires, and other means. eLearning has allowed the university to reduce the number of students who fail distance education courses from 40 percent to eight percent because, eLearning, unlike traditional distance education, demands interactive, hands-on-participation from students.\nAs an educational tool, eLearning leverages information technology (IT) to allow people to learn anywhere and at any time. In addition, eLearning allows learners to easily share all types of material in electronic formats such as videos, presentations, and documents. Aparicio, Bacao, and Oliveira (2014) assert that educators first used eLearning in 1983 and White (1983) defined it as \"learning by using electronic sources such as TV, computers, videotape recorders, Teletext, and videotext, among others\". Therefore, eLearning merges teaching and learning with technology. It uses forums, email, messaging, videoconferencing, podcasting, webpages, and many other communication technologies. With eLearning, educators can create engaging environments that allow them to develop activities that enhance knowledge-creation and knowledge-sharing activities. One needs to consider that the lecturer's role changes in online courses (Bezuidenhout, 2015) . Higher education institutions constantly seek innovative ways to apply knowledge (Siadat et. al, 2015) in order to improve teaching and research (Alterio & McDrury, 2003) . Therefore, in today's constantly changing and evolving environment, educators need to support teaching and learning activities using new and innovative information technologies (IT). Past research argues that online courses offer the \"opportunity to create a highly social learning environment, characterized by participation and interactivity for both students and instructors\" (Brindley et al., 2009 ). Rocco and Michael (2018) argue that eLearning students first need to perceive the approach as useful; therefore, educators need to clearly communicate learning paths, objectives, and outcomes. Then, one can enhance users' disposition to engage in this learning approach by promoting a sense of \"community\". Finally, educators need to clearly stipulatethe digital skills and competencies that students must have before starting the eLearning experience.\nMexican universities face significant challenges in trying to implement eLearning initiatives. These challenges sometimes make it difficult or impossible to create eLearning programs. Some such challenges include cost, time, technology availability, and resistance to change (Ali & Magalhaes, 2008) . In the UAA, we have also faced challenges as Table 4 shows. In the table, we also briefly explain how we have tried to solve it. \nOnline universities go through the same accreditation process as brick-and-mortar universities. Accrediting agencies apply the same standards to all institutions regardless of their modality. However, in an online university, information systems fully mediate students' experiences. Moreover, all the individuals who participate in the educational process must consistently engage in it and understand the nature of online communication. Just like everywhere else, the departments and individuals who interact directly with students play a critical role in the latter's success. This online interaction between departments, instructors, and students directly affect students' experience and performance. Research universities have traditionally offered four-year doctoral degrees with the expectation that students will pursue the degree on a full-time basis, live in or close to the campus, and will work for the university. Online doctoral programs, on the other hand, allow students to pursue this advanced degree with more flexibility by doing it on a part-time basis and/or with reduced residency requirements. While this structure applies to all academic programs, we discuss only doctoral programs in this section. Given the advantages in pursuing a doctoral degree online, the demand for these programs has increased in the last decade. According to the 2016 report from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (NSF, 2016), an average of 46,882 people earned a doctoral degree from American universities every year since 2000, and the number keeps growing. In the last few years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of doctoral programs offered online and a growing interest among doctoral candidates to complete doctoral programs online and on a part-time basis (Paliktzoglou & Suhonen, 2011) . Online doctoral programs will continue to grow and mainly cater to those adult audiences.\nThe experiences in both of these institutions included many threads common to the ones that the prior panelists presented. Thus, Ferran primarily discussed issues that they did not discuss or that did not emerge as important in their institutions: students', faculty's, and administrators' expectations for eLearning; MOOCs; the different requirements for course preparation and faculty workload; flexible solutions that better fit the different learner types; and how to better serve students with disabilities."}, {"section_title": "Technologies and Learning Modes", "text": "In this section, we describe several models that the Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey has used. It has experimented with synchronous satellite (or Web) transmission, semi-synchronous Web-based classes, and asynchronous online classes. Some courses and programs required a combination of models and some included a face-to-face component (hybrids) . Table 1 illustrates the characteristics of different distance education models that the institution has tested. The table compares the distance education models with the traditional classroom face-to-face lecture model. To define a point of reference, in Table 1 , we first describe a traditional face-to-face classroom model in which students attend full lectures at a set time in a given physical classroom. This model, the traditional model that educators have used for centuries, has limited reach since it requires physical presence in a given room. As such, it also requires students to live nearby for the course's duration. The classroom itself might contain little or much technology (from chalk to smartboards and sophisticated equipment). The instructor might use the available technology or not."}, {"section_title": "Synchronous Model with Live Satellite Broadcast of Lectures", "text": "Distance education started with correspondence courses (though we do not discuss that modality here), and the new models start with synchronous technologies. Educators designed these courses to mirror a regular classroom as much as possible. Instructors taught courses synchronously and broadcasted the full class live via satellite to students in the different campuses who could participate in the class via phone or two-way teleconference (or videoconference). Therefore, only a small number of campuses could participate. The model required an expensive production setting and technical personnel, but it provided an experience as close to a traditional classroom as possible for students in remote places. As such, the institution could offer advanced courses to students in small campuses who would not otherwise have access to specialized faculty without their needing to leave their community.\nTecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey initially broadcasted an e-commerce course live to 500 undergraduate students in 16 cities across Mexico. This model allowed the instructor to develop a close relationship with students at a level that resembled a regular course. The instructor could call on a particular student and expect an answer during the live discussions. However, the model required expensive production and broadcasting equipment, and it had limited reach due to the satellite transmission's technical limitations."}, {"section_title": "Semi-synchronous Model with Prerecorded Clips and Satellite Sessions", "text": "Given the high costs associated with full satellite broadcasts, the Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey developed a new, a semi-synchronous model as an alternative. As such, the new model used prerecorded video clips in addition to some satellite sessions. However, these video clips (basically pre-recorded lectures) still required expensive production equipment and specialized support staff.\nTecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey designed an e-government seminar tailored to working practitioners using prerecorded clips with online exercises and complemented it with biweekly synchronous satellite broadcast sessions to discuss cases and receive lectures from special guests regarding their egovernment experiences. This seminar, which the World Bank and the Office of The President of Mexico co-sponsored, reached over 1,000 information technology (IT) specialists in nine countries. This model proved a good fit for part-time geographically disperse students who could not attend a regular course but still benefited from personal contact."}, {"section_title": "Semi-synchronous Model with Prerecorded Clips (or Prerecorded Full Lectures) Discussing Weekly Topics and Optional Online Webex Sessions for Case Discussions and Questions", "text": "Next, the institution designed a semi-synchronous model with prerecorded clips on weekly topics that used online WebEx technology rather than satellite transmissions. The institution mostly used WebEx sessions for case discussion, Q&A sessions, and one-to-one meetings between the instructor and individual students. In some cases when appropriate, the institution used the prerecorded lectures or the WebEx technology to deliver an entire class session.\nThe institution still uses this model for some e-commerce and technology courses. It includes a comprehensive course-shell prepared in its course learning management system (LMS) (Blackboard) with pre-recorded clips on topics and readings for each week/module. The model includes weekly activities such as case analysis, special projects, and short quizzes that students need to complete individually and in teams. Students do not need to attend the live (synchronous) online sessions and can also watch them later since the institution records them.\nThis alternative only became available when high-bandwidth Internet connections became the norm across the country. The course has minimal transmission costs since it uses the Internet as a delivery platform; however, the course still requires production facilities and specialized support staff to develop high-quality professional videos. Currently it is not clear if the additional expense required for high-quality professional videos is worthwhile. A few years back, the preference was for personal low-cost YouTube videos that provided a richer and more personal interaction between instructors and students. Nonetheless, business school students tend to equate a video's quality and formality with the course's and institution's quality. Given the value of the Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey's brand name recognition, it still produces high-quality professional videos for its courses."}, {"section_title": "Semi-synchronous Program with an Opening and Closing Face-to-face Seminar", "text": "The MATI/MSIT Dual Graduate Degree Program, which the Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey conducts in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), represents one of the former's most successful online programs. The program attracts accomplished professionals from many countries in Latin-America and starts with a one-week face-to-face seminar in Pittsburgh at CMU. Subsequently, students undertake online semi-synchronous courses (half from CMU and half from Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey) for two-and-ahalf years. The degree concludes with a one-week seminar in Monterrey at Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey where students present their final projects. Students receive two master degrees (one from each institution).\nThis type of seminar has been very successful. The initial face-to-face seminar allows students and instructor to gain a good degree of intimacy that later allows them to develop rich online interactions. They also develop many cues that they can later use to more quickly and clearly communicate. Alumni have commented that they also find the closing face-to-face seminar useful in cementing their relationships, which, in some cases, have lasted for years. As we state above, educational institutions can provide education, a certificate, and social capital. However, purely online programs tend to have much less social capital than in purely face-to-face programs. A hybrid program can provide social capital even among students who otherwise would not usually connect given their distant geographical location."}, {"section_title": "Findings", "text": "eLearning constitutes a viable alternative for delivering higher education. At the Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey, students who have taken well-designed online courses have performed on standardized tests as well as students who have taken the same course in a traditional setting. Nonetheless, the institution has found the hybrid format to outperform either pure form. Indeed, rather than compromising the two pure forms, the institution has found that hybrid programs gain from synergies between them.\nExperience showed that designing an online course requires special preparation and consideration for the material, the teaching methodology, and the technology available for interaction. In addition to the usual challenges in defining the course content and objectives, when designing an online course, one requires leading-edge technology and top-quality support materials. However, the instructor may not even have expertise in video technology, graphical design, or the necessary teaching techniques. To overcome these obstacles, designing online courses requires several specialists that aid the subject-matter expert in designing a technologically feasible, visually attractive, and pedagogically coherent course.\nNo single model works best for eLearning. In designing effective and efficient online learning courses, one must consider factors such as the students who will take them, resource availability, and the supporting team's expertise. In addition, technology continues to evolve, and students expect courses to incorporate bleeding-edge technologies. One cannot use the same course model forever, and new versions of a course will require new technology.

It takes students 18 months to complete (see Figure 1 ) and prepares business leaders to disrupt and transform. The program takes place over two face-to-face periods on campus and three core virtual periods. This hybrid offering provides the best of both worlds. The face-to-face part helps Volume 45 10.17705/1CAIS.04524 Paper 24 students bond among themselves and with the instructor.

The debates' format (i.e., in writing) allows students maximum time to reflect and think critically about each topic According to eLearning best practices, a critical challenge in eLearning involves engaging students in online discussions. In online discussion forums, students often feel pressure to post a given number of posts per session even if they had nothing new or valuable to add to the conversation and, as a result, often post comments just to meet the required number without using higher-order thinking. In some extreme cases, students can post too much and make it difficult for other students to follow the discussion. Asynchronous eLearning also poses some challenges regarding teaching style. Research has repeatedly shown enthusiastic instructors to be more effective than lackluster instructors in traditional classroom settings (Day, 2004 use in asynchronous environments. However, the extant literature on asynchronous learning shows that this method has a significant impact on instructor workload (Chang, Shen, & Liu, 2014 , Bezuidenhout, 2015 . Table 3 below shows some recommendations to improve online courses based on IE Business School's eLearning case experience. \u2022 As a forum moderator, the instructor must negotiate and communicate online participation rules before the course starts. Agree on the expected contributions from each student to avoid disappointment and problematic collaboration and evaluation. \u2022 In terms of participation evaluation, instructors need to provide clear guidelines about their expectations for online participation (see third recommendation). They often also need to present such expectations in an engaging manner (e.g., during an initial graded and brief course discussion or in a brief introductory quiz) rather than simply write them in the syllabus."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "2: Limit the number of posts to a reasonable amount", "text": "\u2022 Instructors need to define the number of posts they expect students to make either beforehand or in negotiation with the class.

In October, 2016, IE Business School launched its WOW Room, a futuristic learning space that combines the school's teaching excellence with the latest technologies. With this project, unique in Europe, IE Business School further strengthened its commitment to innovation and broke with traditional on-site, blended, and online education models. The WOW Room transforms the learning experience through elements that include artificial intelligence, simulations in real-time, big data analysis, interactive robots, emotion recognition systems, and the presence of experts using holograms.\nThe WOW Room simulates real situations. Inside, students make decisions under pressure, find themselves amid business crises, define production processes in factory environments, negotiate war situations, and resolve diplomatic conflicts between countries. Professors can either be physically present in the WOW Room or be projected in hologram form and moved around the room by a robot in order to interact with students. In addition to simulations, professors can use artificial intelligence and big data analysis on large screens. They receive student participation statistics and propose votes on debate subjects to promote collaboration. The room records all classes to enable students to subsequently access and review content.\nThe WOW Room, a physical space, resides on IE University's Madrid campus with 48 screens that comprise a digital tapestry of 45m 2 in the form of a \"U\" with up to 200 degrees of vision.

However, \"old school\" lecturers often complained about why they should change given that their current methods work.\nOne can address resistance to change by having lecturers participate in the development projects . That way, they would have ownership over the project, feel part of the solution, and could even motivate other lecturers to use the new tools."}, {"section_title": "Developing Custom eLearning Tools", "text": "In the past years, IT has increasingly affected and changed the way we teach and learn. Today, we reside in an inflection point where institutions (educational or not) must face and manage the teaching processes, particularly in regards to distance education. Nowadays, distance education must include the Internet as a medium (Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1alvo & Pardo, 2015) , and distance education has started becoming eLearning that includes highly interactive and media. The traditional educational system uses an instructor-student model where instructors prepare and deliver a lecture in front of the students inside a classroom. Recently, educational institutions' structure has undergone major changes; the initiative to extensively use technology stands out. Past literature reports that educational institutions have increasingly begun to adopt and use technology (Aparicio et al., 2014) .\nOn the other hand, educational institutions have not completely accepted new technology since many do not see it as a fundamental part of education's critically needed expansion, strengthening, and diversification. Here, education tools such as eLearning could an easier and more flexible approach (Singh, O'Donoghue, & Worton, 2005) . eLearning is about not only adding technology to the educational process but also changing old strategies and creating new learning methods to disseminate content (Aparicio et al., 2014) .\nOff-the-shelf eLearning solutions lack specific features that a particular group might be familiar with or that their learning style requires. Therefore, off-the-shelf eLearning solutions do not provide optimal outcomes. However, off-the-shelf eLearning tools cost less than custom ones and serve as a good starting point to test options. Thus, UAA used them as a first option. These tools enhanced how lecturers delivered content and kept in contact with their students, while students benefited from having a single point of delivery for all the material in their courses.\nEach semester, the university offered training on using the eLearning tool in order to enhance its adoption; however, few lecturers used it. Therefore, the university implemented a policy that mandated that they had to perform some clerical activities through this platform. Unfortunately, neither action increased its use since many instructors did not want to adopt and use it and students did not like its interface or its features. Thus, the tool did not deliver the expected outcomes.\nGiven the off-the-shelf eLearning tool's failure and the necessity to move forward toward effective eLearning, the university looked for other options. Meanwhile, universities in developing countries continue to struggle for obtain higher budgets, and Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Aguascalientes did not differ in that regard. eLearning tools require considerable investment, and designing one's own own tools requires even more. Therefore, while eLearning constitutes a route to better and more education, it does not constitute an easy option for universities in developing countries. Thus, as always, we require creative solutions to solve this issue.\nWith this idea in mind, a group of students from the computer systems bachelor degree program and its instructor (the panelist) developed a custom eLearning/knowledge management/social network tool that supported the specific needs that instructors and students identified. The development took a full academic year. They developed the tool based on information gathered from 147 students from programs related to information systems and information technology. These students answered a questionnaire that asked them for their desired features and for the content that the platform had to store. Just as with the off-the-shelf LMS, in this custom-designed LMS, instructors can deliver content such as videos, documents, PowerPoint presentations, and other digital content to students. In addition, other tools allow instructors and students to contact each other. These tools include wikis, forums, blogs, chats, and social networks. Students can deliver projects or other class-related material using hotpot, SCORM packages, and questionnaires. However, this tool does not suit all types of educational activities. Therefore, the panelist argued that educators need to adapt eLearning tools to different types of students and different types of knowledge (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995) to provide optimal outcomes.\nAfter developing the tool, it was used in two sections of two courses (interface design and distributed databases) to deliver and to retrieve content, provide feedback, and communicate with a total of 52 students. Further, 95 percent of the participants added at least two different files, 85 percent actively participated in discussions using forums, and all students graded each other's contributions. After finishing the semester, results showed that only one student failed the interface design course (1.9%) and none failed the distributed databases course. Comparing these results with the previous year, we found that, with the same instructor, about 11 percent failed the interface design course and 14 percent failed the distributed databases course. The custom-developed eLearning/KM/SN tool constituted the only significant difference between the groups. Thus, although the sample size was small, we can argue that such a tool makes a difference by allowing students to study not only in the classroom but anywhere at any time. Nonetheless, we need further research to support such a finding.\nIn addition, we developed an online tool intended to teach workers how to use statistical process control (SPC). When educators teach this particular subject using face-to-face lectures, participants require previous knowledge about statistical topics such as dispersion analysis and central tendency measurements. However, the main issues in teaching this subject include scarce training materials, training costs, trainees forgetting what has been taught, time constraints, and expertise availability. The eLearning tool addressed these issues since it included algorithms for anomalies that use fuzzy logic rules, increased the number of examples that students could solve during the training sessions, interpreted the charts, and identified and illustrated where anomalies (if any) resided. We developed two versions of such tool: one included expert systems capabilities (expert system for training (EST)) and the other did not (information system for training (IST)).\nIn order to test outcomes, we (presenter and unnamed colleagues) used a three-group study. Each group had five training sessions about SPC using different training tools. The study had only one instructor in order to control the effects of teaching styles and to avoid compensatory coaching for any group. The three groups received the same notes for the course. One group (ESTG) used the EST, while the second group (ISTG) used the IST. The instructor trained the third group (NOSG) using traditional means (i.e., blackboard, markers, and so forth). We organized sessions into three parts. In the first part, we told trainees in the ESTG and ISTG groups to review instructions provided online and on paper, while the NOSG group reviewed a lecture. In the second part, students solved and presented cases, and, in the final part, the instructor asked them to explore their own data sets, which the instructor collected on paper (ISTG and NOSG) or in text files (ESTG) . At the end of the day, the researcher examined how the trainees' solved examples to assess their motivation to learn. In all three groups, trainees' results demonstrated a high level of motivation. We compared performance results for the three experimental groups to assess which group learned the best. The study measured the training's effectiveness (dependent variable) via an exam at the end of the training course. We conducted the three training courses on a daily basis for five consecutive days.\nWe offered each course during the same time frame over three consecutive weeks. Participants could freely enroll in any of the three courses. Enrollment occurred on a first-come, first-served basis. After students had enrolled, we randomly assigned the training type (EST, IST, traditional) to each course. We offered ISTG the first week, ESTG the second week, and NOSG the third week.\nWe administered an exam at the end of the fifth session for each group. The exam comprised of 15 exercises. Some exercises contained anomalies, and some did not. We graded each exercise in two parts depending on exercise type. Correct anomaly identification comprised two actions: 1) identify an anomaly correctly and 2) identify which points contribute to the anomaly. Based on that, we graded an exercise with anomalies as follows: we awarded a point to participants when they correctly identified a particular anomaly (part one) and another point when they correctly marked the points that contributed to the anomaly identified. We graded an exercise without anomalies as follows: we awarded a point when participants correctly identified the chart as free from anomalies (part one). At the end of the quasi-experiment, we administered a questionnaire to participants.\nAll participants completed all five sessions and answered the final exam. By comparing overall grades, the analysis shows that the three groups performed differently. ESTG subjects performed best; in fact, the distribution for the ESTG was not normal with 11 of 25 subjects scoring a perfect 10. The ESTG group mean (9.29) was one full point higher than the ISTG group mean (8.29), and 3.6 points higher than the NOSG group mean (5.69). In addition, on average, ESTG subjects required less time to complete the final exam. Thus, overall, subjects in the ESTG had the best performance and required less time to answer the same exam."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Educators should use eLearning more extensively in our educational system. eLearning enhances the learning experience and reaches learners that cannot attend a traditional institution due to geographic or time constraints. Further, people can learn at their own pace. Lecturers can make content available to students to learn anywhere at anytime. For some students, eLearning provides a better educational or training experience. At UAA, it has also reduced the number of students who fail courses from about 40 percent to around eight percent (when compared to distance education courses) because it requires hands-on student participation.\nIn addition, this model of leveraging student learning activities to develop practical and useful tools generates better-prepared graduates who have more job opportunities and a higher quality of life while reducing the cost of education.

For example, students enroll because they:\n\u2022 Have completed already graduate degrees and want a terminal degree.\n\u2022 Want to conduct and publish research in an area of their practical expertise.\n\u2022 Want a degree that will increase their credibility as consultants or advisors and legitimize their extensive current expertise.\n\u2022 Want a promotion at their current place of work where they need research skills.\n\u2022 Want a degree that allows them to give back to society after retirement by teaching or consulting.\n\u2022 Want to make their family proud by exemplifying perseverance and hard work.\nMaking sure that students select the program that better fits their motivation and educational goals will guarantee their success in the program. For instance, a traditional doctoral program in business that emphasizes research may be a better fit for individuals who want to do more research versus a professional doctorate in business administration (DBA) program that emphasizes applied research, which may suit individuals who plan to make contributions to practice. Nonetheless, both options are available online."}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of Online Doctoral Programs", "text": "Like traditional doctoral programs, online doctoral programs have two phases: an initial phase with regular coursework and a second phase dedicated to developing a dissertation. Just like all other programs, doctoral programs have highly structured coursework (which does not imply that they have a predetermined course list). However, they have a much more flexible and unstructured dissertation phase. It is the case that many doctoral students never finish their dissertation because they get distracted and Volume 45 10.17705/1CAIS.04524 Paper 24 change interests, the doctoral mentor or advisor needs to assure that the student stays on track and finishes the dissertation. Ensuring students finish their dissertation becomes more difficult with online programs because mentors and students interact less frequently because the part-time student will have many other responsibilities. However, an excellent online doctoral program can leverage IT to surmount this hurdle."}, {"section_title": "Doctoral Coursework", "text": "Trident University offers pre-dissertation courses through the LMS, and these courses require significant planning and preparation. Unlike face-to-face courses, one needs to completely develop an online course before one delivers it on the first day. Subject-matter experts develop course content in collaboration with instructional designers and editors. Individuals who develop the courses might never deliver them. The instructors (those who deliver the courses) must have the required expertise and need to familiarize themselves with the course according to its design. Table 6 compares the coursework between online and face-to-face programs. At Trident University, students have 24/7 access to course content that includes readings, background information, course materials (e.g., PowerPoint and video presentations), modular assignments, and an asynchronous discussion. The university also offers live webinars for core courses, which are recorded for the students who cannot attend synchronously. Students review course materials, engage in discussion forums, conduct independent research, synthesize the findings, engage in critical analysis, and submit written assignments by the expected due dates.. The LMS records all these interactions, and instructors grade them in the LMS as well. When the course begins, the instructor needs to communicate the course expectations and structure to students, provide useful feedback via standard rubrics that assess learning outcomes, and provide written or verbal feedback on all assignments and communications that students submit.\nTraditional doctoral programs usually benefit from having cohorts, but this approach does not necessarily work, nor does it benefit students in online programs because they reside in various locations and work at different paces. Adult learners in online doctoral programs may need to take breaks because they have family and work priorities. Online doctoral students have a strong motivation and expertise, but pursuing the doctoral degree usually comes in third or fourth place in their list of priorities. Instructors in doctoral programs must know their students and understand their particular circumstances. They need to find a balance between being flexible with students and challenging them to produce rigorous and quality work. Usually, online doctoral students appreciate the challenge. However, one needs to remember that, given their maturity, older doctoral students (in comparison with the younger undergraduate student) better understand the importance of learning in order to earn the doctoral degree. Moreover, most doctoral students made the voluntary decision to study for a doctoral degree and appreciate and enjoy the learning experience."}, {"section_title": "Dissertation Work", "text": "Universities generally expect doctoral students to contribute to knowledge through original research using scientific methods that culminate in a doctoral dissertation or thesis with that contribution. To make a relevant contribution, students must pursue a dissertation topic related to their area of expertise.\nDuring the dissertation phase, students engage in independent research under their dissertation chair's (advisor's) supervision. Depending on the institution, the doctoral student in the second phase might only pay a continuing registration fee or enroll in a dissertation course that might or might not have a grade. The student might need to just enroll in that course every semester until the student defends the dissertation, and the course might not have any specific deliverables. However, most institutions have a limit on the number of semesters that a student can stay in that phase. This work has the same independent nature in both face-to-face and online doctoral programs. In both cases, the quality of the individual's research determines its defense and approval readiness. However, advisors might need to agree with students on some course deliverables every semester in online and part-time doctoral programs to assure that students stay on track. Table 7 compares dissertation work between online and face-to-face programs. \u2022 A dissertation committee reviews and approves the dissertation.\n\u2022 Students meet with their dissertation chair in person.\n\u2022 Students defend their proposal/dissertation in person.\n\u2022 A dissertation committee reviews and approves the dissertation.\nOne challenge in this stage of any doctoral program concerns tracking the dissertation's progress and documenting the interaction between students and their chair because this interaction can occur in different formats (phone, video conferences, email, and even actual face-to-face meetings).\nAgain, at Trident University, our online students benefit from our intensely using IS to manage the doctoral program. A systematic approach to the dissertation phase becomes even more effective due to students' maturity (Davis, Parker & Straub, 2012) . One needs to embed this systematic approach to the dissertation work needs in the LMS. Our LMS has features that manage and track whether students complete every doctoral dissertation milestone (i.e., qualifying exam, dissertation prospectus completion, proposal defense, IRB approval, dissertation defense, etc.). The LMS also provides an electronic portfolio that highlights students' teaching and research philosophies and social networks and wikis to engage students and share knowledge. A structured approach to the dissertation work can improve doctoral students' performance and improve their confidence in conducting and completing research projects.\nStudents need to complete a doctoral dissertation in a reasonable amount of time that follows their program's expectations. Students identify and update a dissertation completion plan in the LMS, which serves as a foundation for their overall graduation strategy. The tracking system captures data about their progress with their dissertation and each milestone and makes this data visible to the student, the dissertation chair, and the administrative staff in the program. All stakeholders know the latest status of the dissertation, use information consistently, and can collaborate to help the student complete each milestone in a timely manner. Visualization tools allow instructors to gain rapid insight into students' progress via using interactive dashboards that administrators monitor to assess dissertation progress and provide support when needed. All these system tools and initiatives focus on improving retention and graduation rates."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Doctoral programs will continue to grow in the US and worldwide. Online doctoral programs will also continue to grow in number. Information systems play an essential role in helping educators deliver coursework and students manage their dissertation work. The information systems that educators use to deliver online doctoral education must align with dissertation research's goals and must directly involve the doctoral student, the dissertation chair, and administrators. Online program instructors and Volume 45 10.17705/1CAIS.04524 Paper 24 administrators must increasingly use visualization tools (such as interactive dashboards) in order to better monitor and gain rapid insights into their students. Experience at Trident University has shown that using these tools can also improve retention and graduation rates.\nOne can use eLearning as an effective way to transfer knowledge. The Internet constitutes a viable format for delivering higher education, and its use continues to increase across the world (Seaman et al., 2018) . The demand for online education has also increased (Nguyen, 2015) ; nonetheless, it has to be effective to deliver expected outcomes. Thus, educators and researchers need to understand its effectiveness. This panel discussed eLearning best practices based on their experience. As Reynoso found, if one uses the right tools, one produces better courses and can reduce how many students fail. Moreover, students attending online courses can perform on standardized tests as well as students who take the face-to-face course (like they did in Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey). Doctoral programs do not particularly differ. According to Guzman, online doctoral programs can also be successful, but information technology plays a more critical for delivering and managing them.\nPast research (Nguyen, 2015) argues that online education could be an effective tool in reducing education's cost because institutions can spread the cost over more students compared to traditional education settings. However, one needs to remember that online courses generally have higher preparation costs.\nLearners attend universities to acquire new knowledge, receive a document that certifies that they have such knowledge, and to live a specific social experience that enhances their personal network and provides them with valuable social capital. At this time, online education does not provide all three of these benefits. However, some eLearning models can provide two. Today, eLearning offerings have swamped the market (Johnson, 2006) . Some are legitimate, but some are scams (Brown, 2006) . Unfortunately, students cannot easily differentiate between them until they have already invested substantially in one option.\nFurther, eLearning cannot replace the instructor entirely because, as some studies have shown (e.g., Serdyuokva & Serdyuokva, 2013), most students prefer to take instructor-led classes. The debate about eLearning versus traditional learning environments should not involve only radical technocentric or technophobic positions; rather, it should include an understanding of the context in which each one can improve education (Bernard, Borokhovski, Schmid, Tamim, & Abrami, 2014; Saghafi, Franz, & Crowther, 2014) . Education should be available to all individuals equally, which includes individuals with disabilities. The US and Europe have laws to assure students with disabilities can access education (Edmonds, 2004) . Making online courses feasible for many (but not all) individuals with disabilities represents a viable but expensive proposition. However, doing so constitutes a requirement, not an option.\nAs Estevez mentioned in his presentation and Webb, Gill, and Poe (2005) have discussed, one can feasibly teach online in the case modality either synchronously (using videoconferencing technologies) or asynchronously (making heavy use of discussion boards). Given all the examples presenters presented in this panel, we can conclude that no single best eLearning model exists. It can be synchronous or asynchronous. Further, no universally best ratio for student-tostudent, student-to-instructor, or student-to-computer interaction exists. Further, to design effective and efficient online courses, designers must consider factors such as the students who will take them, resources' availability, and the supporting team's expertise.\nOnline courses must have the same rigor as face-to-face courses (Ausburn, 2004; Swan, Day, Bogle, & Matthews, 2014; Nortvig, Petersen, & Balle, 2018) . However, as all the panelists experienced, developing rigorous online courses takes more time and resources than developing face-to-face courses. Analogously, experienced online students recognized that, while they appreciated eLearning's flexibility, they had to invest more time to complete the tasks.\nDeveloping an online course requires more investment than developing face-to-face courses; however, as the panelists experienced, it does not have to be prohibitively expensive. Online education requires both institutions and instructors to make a considerable investment. Institutions require the relevant infrastructure, tools, qualified personnel, and norms to develop and deliver courses (Lister, 2014) . Sophisticated videoconferencing rooms with dozens of screens, professional audiovisual studios, and specialized audiovisual personnel can provide outstanding and luxurious eLearning, but, as the examples from the panel illustrate, educators do not need such things to provide excellent online education.\nTeaching face to face is much more forgiving than teaching online. Developing online courses requires pedagogy (Sderyukov, 2015) . Technology does not replace good teaching nor planning (Nilson, 2016) . eLearning can provide customized experiences that include several optional activities for each learning outcome. If each activity focuses on a different type of learner (visual, auditory, or kinesthetic), then it will be faster and more efficient for each learner. However, the learner must do at least one activity for each learning outcome. Nonetheless, just like face-to-face courses, online courses must include individual and team activities (Bernard et al., 2014) .\nCourses have two phases: design and delivery. In face-to-face courses, one can merge the, and they do not need comprehensive design as much as online courses do. In online courses, one must finish the design phase before one begins the delivery phase. Further, subject-matter experts (typically the instructor) design face-to-face courses. On the other hand, designing technologically feasible, visually attractive, and pedagogically coherent online courses also requires supporting specialists (Chen, 2007) : a subject-matter expert, an educational designer, and an IT professional. Online course delivery focuses on the instructor promoting, supporting, and managing student-to-faculty interactions. Online courses require one to continuously update both the subject matter and the technologies used. Institutions, instructional designers, and instructors have to continuously scan the market for new technologies ripe for incorporation into new or existing online courses.\nThe students who take and faculty who provide online courses have different and sometimes opposing assumptions. Some relate to the synchronicity, rigor, workload, pace, and the importance of deadlines. Past research (Saadatmand & Kumpulainen, 2014) has identified that online courses often overwhelm students. Therefore, instructors must inform them about all rules and expectations on the first day of class or even earlier.\nInformation systems constitute a key tool for delivering and managing online education. Online program instructors and administrators should increasingly use visualization tools, such as interactive dashboards. These tools allow them to better monitor and gain rapid insights into students and faculty performance. Prompt and timely feedback represents a critical success factor in eLearning (Chen, 2007; Gedik, Kiraz, & Ozden, 2013) . Such feedback also improves retention and graduation rates.\nStandardized LMS do not yet include all elements that all schools need, and their high cost prohibits some institutions from adopting them. Some open source LMS (such as Moodle) exist, but institutions still need to train and implement them at considerable cost, and they often do not include as many options as commercial ones. While custom developed systems cost just as much if not more than commercial ones, educational institutions (as in the case of UAA) can leverage their faculty and students to develop tools that can improve the educational process.\nMassively open online courses (MOOCs) (and their variants) represent a new type of textbook and will not replace instructors just as the original textbook has not. Institutions can successfully use MOOCs to improve traditional face-to-face course by flipping the classroom and having a local subject-matter expert (instructor) lead and facilitate the class discussions and grade students' deliverables. In the past two decades, online education (eLearning, technology-mediated knowledge transfer) has grown exponentially (Seaman et al., 2018) , and evidence suggests that it has positively affected the number of students who pursue higher education (Goodman et al., 2016) . Still, many challenges associated with it remain (Gillett- Swan, 2017; Palvia et al., 2018) , and we still lack a comprehensive educational framework for eLearning (Nickols, 2011) . Nonetheless, the number of institutions leveraging it continues to increase amid a confusing market where fraudulent offerings also continue to rise. In summary, one can accomplish online education in many different ways and with varying budgets. However, as long as it builds on solid educational principles and technology mastery, it can be as effective as (if not more than) traditional face-to-face education."}, {"section_title": "Governors State University & La Salle Barcelona (URL)", "text": "Carlos Ferran presented last.

It offers high-quality education at the lowest price possible. GSU was founded in 1969 as an experimental and innovative institution. During its beginnings, it focused on innovation (particularly in distance education). As time passed on, it became a more traditional institution, and it progressed to offer online education. However, GSU has a minimal budget though still focuses on providing high-quality education. Not long ago, the university's college of business created its first fully online supply-chain management MBA. Before starting the program, the college did its homework and examined the requirements for effective eLearning.\nLa Salle Barcelona, a small, coeducational, private Lasallian higher education institution affiliated with the De La Salle Brothers (a Roman Catholic religious teaching order), resides in Barcelona, Spain. It is a university inside a university; that is, it forms part of Ramon Llull University).

La Salle Barcelona leverages eLearning and works with another fully online institution that resides in Andorra. Students at La Salle come from many different countries (from Europe and abroad), most speak more than three distinct languages, and they are technology savvy."}, {"section_title": "Elearning Expectations", "text": "Online education does not require colocation; however, many students that live on campus still want to take one or two online courses since they can complete them according to their own schedule (Young, 2017) . However, online education is not always asynchronous. Online courses can have the same scheduling restrictions that face-to-face courses have. In fact, many instructors want and expect to teach online that way. Thus, one can offer online courses synchronously or asynchronously, but one needs to advertise the course correctly. When students see a course offered online, they should also see if it will be synchronous or asynchronous. Students should not find out this information on the first day of class. Note that most students assume that online courses will be asynchronous, while many instructors assume that it will be synchronous Students and instructor tend to have different expectations for online courses. Findings from interviews that Ferran has conducted with faculty and students about their views on eLearning have shown that:\n\u2022 Students assume that the instructor will be available 24/7, while the instructor might expect to be available only twice a week for around three hours and another 10 to 20 minutes for three more days. Faculty have widely different expectations about their weekend availability.\n\u2022 Students tend to expect that an online course will be easier and often less rigorous than the face-to-face counterpart, while instructors tend to have the same expectations for all courses.\n\u2022 Students expect to invest less time in online courses than in face-to-face courses; however, many find out later that they actually require more time to complete online courses.\nTherefore, instructors need to disclose their expectations by the first day of class or even earlier. Misunderstandings on the above issues tend to decrease students' satisfaction with a course (and the instructor) and increase the number of students that drop out of the course.\nTraditionally, universities hire subject-matter experts with terminal degrees and throw them into the classroom without any prior pedagogical training. They expect them to land on their feet and deliver engaging and interactive lectures that enlighten students. Traditionally, instructors would write a brief outline about what they expect to teach and what the students have to deliver-in other words, the syllabus (which can have much or little detail depending on the instructor and the institution's regulations). This process usually works because professors are brilliant and/or have sage in the stage. However, this strategy does not work for eLearning. While a face-to-face course might only have a delivery element, an online course has two clear parts: design and delivery. Designing on the go does not work.\nDesigning online courses consumes a lot of time and resources. Ferran recounted how he had designed several online courses (unfortunately by himself) and invested over 600 hours of work in each one, and he considered none as good as they could be. Furthermore, each course section also required a \"setup\", which, depending on the course, could take a couple of minutes to 10 hours of work. In some institutions, a special department creates each section, but, in others, the instructor does it. Some courses adopt a design that allows one to easily copy them (master course shells), while others do not. Furthermore, when the courses leverage various eLearning platforms rather than only one LMS, creating a new section becomes even harder.\nDesigning online courses also requires pedagogy and andragogy (Adebisi & Oyeleke, 2018) . While many universities have a college of education, other colleges often disregard their findings and their importance. K-12 teachers must study how to educate, but higher education professors do not. One cannot develop a good online course with subject-matter expertise alone. Therefore, either the university professor needs to study education or acquire an education expert's or educational designer's assistance. Furthermore, eLearning requires bleeding-edge technologies, which neither the professor nor the educational designer will likely have mastered or have proficiency in. Therefore, eLearning requires a third team member: someone with IT knowledge. In summary, designing an excellent online course requires three types of expertise: subject matter, pedagogy/andragogy, and IT/IS.\nAn excellent online course engages students and provides relatively quick feedback to learners (Vai & Sosulski, 2015) . Learners can engage with the computer (student-to-computer interactions), with other learners (student-to-student interactions), and with the instructor (instructor-to-student interactions). An excellent online course provides all three interactions, although, depending on the design and the subject Volume 45 10.17705/1CAIS.04524 Paper 24 matter, a course might have more of one than another. However, these interactions must be relatively quick and, in the case of instructor-to-student interactions, will depend on the delivery and not the design.\nAlthough many students expect to interact with cutting-edge technology, more technology or more expensive technology does not always equate to better results. The technology must align with the subject matter and students (Sun, 2016) . Many institutions also expect that all students already know how to use the technology. However, while millennials are familiar with technology, not all students are millennials, and, while they may be familiar with technology, it might differ from the technology that the course uses. Instructors must provide clear instructions (and maybe boot camps) on how to use the technology that the course uses. They need to clearly specify expectations about what the students must know and have at the start of the course (or earlier). Moreover, one needs to remember that non-traditional students could be less familiar and less comfortable with the technology.\nTo implement an online program, GSU decided to adequately train its faculty in pedagogy, andragogy, and the etools that the program would require. Such training represented no easy task. Professors do not like to be told what to do and much less that they do not know something. Furthermore, training is not cheap, and professors require an incentive to take the course. Therefore, GSU decided to pay for course design. Professors were (and generally are) paid for delivering courses, not for designing them."}, {"section_title": "Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)", "text": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) represent a special type of eLearning. MOOCs differ from other forms of eLearning because anyone can freely access them, they have thousands of students with only one or two instructors, and they do not provide certification or social capital. In 2011, Christensen and Eyring (2011) predicted that MOOCs would lead to disruptive innovations in higher education. Today, MOOCs come in many variants, and educators use them in many different forms. However, they no constitute a silver bullet.\nMOOCs basically represent \"textbook 3.0\" (Lee, Cho, & Kim, 2015) , and, unfortunately, the third version has not revolutionized education as much as the first one. Guttenberg's invention constituted a radical change, and it has revolutionized education. Audio recordings, video recordings, tapes, CDs, DVDs, the Internet, cellular phones, and tablets have all incrementally improved that original textbook. MOOCs or some version of them such as small private online courses (SPOC) might replace the traditional textbook, but they will not make up the whole eLearning experience. In fact, while MOOCs have affected higher education, they represent just one more tool for education (Porter, 2015; van Valkenburg, 2018) .\nAt the start (just like with any other technology), many feared MOOCs. Many heated discussions have occurred regarding MOOCs in faculty senates across the country (Kolowich, 2013) , and some have even voted to ban them from their campuses. Many professors thought that, as legislators said, MOOCs could replace them. However, they have not replaced professors and they never will. Unfortunately, 10 percent of students who take MOOcsl never learn the subject matter. Graciously, 10 percent will learn the material without the help or intervention of the instructor, and the other 80 percent will continue to need some form of a master, mentor, or instructor to help them understand the material.\nMany institutions continue to develop MOOCs. Today, the most renown institutions in the world develop them for marketing purposes. In other words, institutions use them as showcases and to remind people about their stature. However, those same institutions barely use them for teaching purposes. On the other hand, we have seen a trend in which smaller institutions that lack the name and the big pockets to leverage those MOOCs to make their programs better (Sahami, Martin, Guzdial, & Parlante, 2013; North, Richardson, & North, 2014; Richardson & North, 2016; P\u00e9rez-Sanagust\u00edn, Hilliger, & Alario-Hoyos, Kloos, & Rayyan, 2017) . In other words, widely known institutions develop and finance MOOCs, while smaller ones use them as a tool in their classes. However, they do not use them in a manner that leaves students to themselves; rather, a local facilitator supports them (the course instructor in the smaller university) who guides, supports, and evaluates the student.\nLa Salle Barcelona exemplifies an institution that leverages MOOCs to improve its courses. There, instructors search for the most applicable MOOC and assign it to the class. They provide no lectures, but they do have class discussions about what students find and do in the MOOC. Thus, while in a MOOC, students grade students and often the blind leads the blind; however, at La Salle Barcelona, an instructor facilitates the course, grades the work, and leads the students. Using the MOOC in a course for which its creators did not design it poses a difficult task. The designer needs to be creative. Using MOOCs actually implies more rather than less work for instructors. Instructors who leverage MOOCs in a course need to prepare adequately and be highly knowledgeable in the subject matter. They do not deliver pre-packaged lectures but answer questions from better-prepared students who have already viewed the lectures and the discussions in the MOOC. In reality, this process resembles what some call \"flipping the classroom.\"\nIn interviews with administrators regarding this methodology, Ferran found a general inclination towards believing that, in these cases, the instructor would not need to be such an expert in the subject matter but an excellent facilitator. However, the interviews with faculty who had used this methodology indicated that fthey felt far more challenged with respect to their knowledge about the subject matter in these MOOC flipped classes than in the standard ones because students came to the classroom far better prepared, asked much more sophisticated questions, and had more time to participate in these interactions.\nFlipping the classroom transforms passive lectures into dynamic and interactive conversations with students. Some researchers have thought flipping the classroom to increase students' academic achievements (Chen et al., 2018) . However, flipping the classroom does not represent a new phenomenon. Ferran recounted how, at his dinner table (with parents who had been professors for several decades), he often heard tales about how every seven years the student would \"revolt\" at their university and demand a change from their professors about providing lectures (or reading the textbook aloud) during class time because students could not answer questions if they had not first heard the lectures. Seven years later, students demanded that professors not give lectures that textbooks already said because the students had already read it. Faculty should engage students in discussing the material. Unfortunately, seven years later, students would revolt again to reinstate back the lectures since they lacked preparation for the conversation. This seven-year flip cycle has occurred for over 50 years."}, {"section_title": "Preparation and Workload", "text": "Faculty have a much higher workload in an online (or hybrid) course than in a face-to-face one (Tomei, 2006; Mupinga & Maughan, 2008; Taft, Perkowski, & Martin, 2011; Wright, 2014; Owens, 2015) , and improvisation will not work. Rather, eLearning requires much more pedagogy/andragogy than face to face. Improvisation might work for some in the stage (of a classroom or theater), but it will not work in the online classroom. One cannot easily move a successful face-to-face course to the online environment. That is, one cannot simply record and pass on an engaging, face-to-face, 45-minute master lecture to online learners. Videos do not yet capture the richness that face-to-face interactions provide, and face-to-face audiences, while potentially anonymous, cannot as readily and politely stand up and leave the auditorium.\nThe material used for eLearning requires much more thought than for face-to-face courses. A PowerPoint presentation differs from an experienced and articulate presenter that leverages it in the background. PowerPoint represents only a small part of the whole experience; thus, the online class needs much more than simple copies of those files. Moreover, online students do not find old textbooks (or basic scanned PDF files) acceptable. eLearning requires rich media that students can search and bookmark. Today's online student requires more than one single source of authoritative knowledge. Just like a Google search returns many possible pages that might contain the information one has searched for, an online course should provide the student with several sources for knowledge. Moreover, these sources should not all be of the same type or format but should also cater to the different learners (see Section 6.6).\nOnline course designers need to look for many more sources of information and activities for students. They need to look for engaging activities that students will want to engage in. Further, they need to make sure that the course contains material and activities for all the course's expected learning outcomes.\nExperience has shown that students need to commit more to online courses. A synchronous face-to-face course forces the student to go to a specific classroom at a specific date and time every week for several weeks. If students go to that place at a different time or to a different place, they know that they have missed the opportunity (the class). They can easily mark a calendar for the class times and make sure to attend. However, marking one's calendar for \"some time\" this week in \"any place\" that fits involves much more difficulty. Thus, students need to have more motivation and discipline to follow an online course. The \"push\" signal that exists in the scheduled face-to-face classroom becomes a \"pull\" signal that needs to come from the student on a regular basis. eLearning is not for everyone. Moreover, most students will need to learn how to do eLearning, so most higher education institutions need to develop boot camps for eLearning in a similar way that they have boot camps for first-year students. In Ferran's experience, most online-only institutions separate design from delivery. They tend to have teams that include a subject-matter expert, an educational designer, and an IT person developing the courses. However, most traditional brick-and-mortar institutions still keep design and delivery together. Thus, most instructors are not paid for the time and effort invested in designing the online course shells."}, {"section_title": "Different Types of Learners", "text": "While some recent studies argue that different learner types do not exist (Willingham, Hughes, & Dobolyi, 2015; Truong, 2016; Kirschner, 2017) , many still propose theories that describe different learner types. However, many different theories classify learners in many different dimensions (Cassidy, 2004) . The visual, auditory, and kinesthetic (VAK) learning style model represents one of the most popular and used one. The model argues that individuals have a preference for one learning style and tend to be more effective or more efficient in one mode than in the other, though the same individual can learning through several styles (Dunn & Dunn, 1978) . Therefore, a course that includes the preferred mode will in itself be more effective and efficient for that specific individual.\nThe pedagogy literature indicates that instructors should include activities of all types so that everyone has an opportunity to learn in their preferred mode. The current trend is to have some learning objectives covered with visual activities, other objectives with auditory activities, and the rest with kinesthetic ones. Unfortunately, these courses are neither effective nor efficient for anybody and provide an average experience at best. These courses at the end discriminate against everyone (equal opportunity discriminator) rather than against a few or no one. However, eLearning can differ entirely.\nAn ideal online course should contain three activities (one visual, one auditory, and one kinesthetic) for each learning outcome. One should not require the learner to do all three activities but at least one. The learner should decide which one to use to accomplish the given learning outcome. Of course, implementing such options equates to developing three courses rather than one, but it undoubtedly represents the most effective solution.\nTo complicate the issue, learners might also have a preference to learn in a social or in a solitary environment. However, that preference might in some cases counter what really works for them. In other words, some introverts might need to interact with others in order to understand and learn specific material, while some extroverts might need time to think and digest the material rather than argue about it with others. Thus, courses should have activities that students do in teams but also activities that they do individually. Thus, unlike learning styles where learners themselves should choose which one to do, courses require both team and individual activities."}, {"section_title": "Serving Students with Disabilities", "text": "Preferred learning styles have nothing to do with learners with a disability. Some students cannot see or hear the material. Further, other students have disabilities that do not allow them to concentrate for extended periods of time or that mean they need more time to understand communication. Nonetheless, these learners have the same rights as everyone else to gain knowledge from any course. The American with Disability Act (in the US) and the European Accessibility Act (in Europe) enforce such rights. These legislations ensure that people with disabilities have equal access to education (and other services).\nDepending on disability that an individual has, an online course might constitute a more appropriate solution to learning (though not always). Unfortunately, we have not found viable solutions for all disabilities, but, for those that we have, the law stipulates that we make it available. For example, \"easy\" solutions for deaf people or people who cannot hear well exist: interpreters for face-to-face classes and transcripts for audio material in an online class. For people with color blindness, one can differentiate material in ways beyond color. However, for completely blind individuals, the solution becomes much more complicated.\nAt this stage of eLearning, educators should provide transcripts, alternative tags, and differentiation in charts and pictures that do not rely only on color. However, one cannot easily implement these options.\nProviding transcripts for lectures might itself amount to a taxing task. The instructor can type the material. The instructor or institution could pay someone to transcribe the material. Alternatively, systems that automatically generate the transcript could process the material. Ferran discussed how he used Dragon Dictate, Watson + Amara, and the Popup archives-none of which proved that successful. Finally, he presented an existing facility inside YouTube that automatically generates closed captions for short videos. That option proved the most effective of all of them, but it worked only for YouTube videos. In the US, courts have enforced disability laws and required universities to provide such transcripts for all their material. At first sight, that would seem positive for society; however, the opposite sometimes arises. In one instance, a judge required the University of California Berkeley to provide transcripts for more than 10,000 educational videos that they offered online for free. Given the cost to significant generate those transcripts, the university opted to comply with the law by eliminating all the videos from public access. While a \"fair\" solution (since the university no longer discriminated against anyone), it meant no one could benefit from the videos.\nAs instructors and educational designers, we have to carefully comply with all the regulations that pertain to our activity. As legislators, we need to strive to write non-discriminating laws that help as many citizens as possible. We need understand technology's limits. Ethically, we need to develop courses and laws that will benefit everyone equally as efficiently and effectively as possible. However, if we are not able to develop a course that can help everyone, should we then restrain from doing one that will only help some? This becomes an ethical dilemma and its solution differs based on the ethical framework one uses.\nIdeally, individuals can access education anywhere and at any time in a style they find most comfortable. However, we have not reached that technical reality as yet, and we need to make sure that we do not compromise rigor and effectiveness for expediency, efficiency, or illusionary justice. Nonetheless, eLearning has proven effective and efficient and need not be expensive."}]
