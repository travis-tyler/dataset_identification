Similar expression patterns in CSF and plasma have been described, including elevations in eotaxin 3 and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) levels. Data suggest that multiplex immunoassay panels using CSF and blood samples may have some usefulness in differentiating patients with AD from healthy control subjects (HCs) and perhaps in identifying patients with early stages of the disease.\nTo further explore the potential of multiplex immunoassay panels to identify plasma biomarkers of AD, the present study uses a 190-analyte version of the panel applied in prior plasma and CSF studies 17, 22, 23 to examine changes in patients with AD and MCI using a subset of baseline and 1-year plasma samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort.

Significant differences in ApoE plasma concentrations as a function of ApoE allelic status were noted (eg, \u03b52/\u03b52, \u03b52/\u03b53, \u03b52/\u03b54, \u03b53/\u03b53, \u03b53/\u03b54, and \u03b54/\u03b54), with \u03b53/\u03b54 or \u03b54/\u03b54 carriers expressing the lowest ApoE plasma protein levels irrespective of diagnosis, while those with an \u03b52 allele expressed the highest levels of ApoE protein even in the presence of an \u03b54 allele ( Figure 4A ). The ApoE allelic status was associated with differential concentrations of other proteins that were identified in the univariate analysis for some group comparisons. For example, C-reactive protein was low in participants with 1 or more \u03b54 alleles and was highest in \u03b52/\u03b53 carriers ( Figure 4B ). Monokine induced by gamma interferon (also known as CXCL9) exhibited lowest levels in participants with 1 or more \u03b54 alleles ( Figure 4E ), while IL-13 ( Figure 4D ) showed elevations.

Statistical analysis showed on average 80% to 90% sensitivity across models, and incorporation of plasma analytes improved specificity from 40% up to 70% and 80% in differentiating patients with AD from HCs, suggesting some usefulness of the multiplex immunoassay panel as a screening tool. Increases in PP, TN-C, MMP-1, eotaxin 3, and NT-proBNP levels and decreases in IgM and ApoE levels were consistently observed across all group comparisons in the ADNI cohort. Notably, ApoE protein levels were lowest in patients with MCI who progressed to dementia. Perhaps the most intriguing observation was the identification of a biochemical profile based on ApoE genotype in the AD, MCI, and HC arms. Previous studies 13, 14, 17, 18, 21, 25, 26 have described bloodbased biomarkers in patients having AD, with little consistency across studies. When the same platform is applied across cohorts, similarities in the biomarkers begin to emerge. Specifically, increases in PP, eotaxin 3, and plasma NT-proBNP levels, observed in the present ADNI cohort, have been previously described in CSF samples obtained from patients with AD. 22, 23 In addition, evidence from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Aging group (H.D.S., written communication, June 2012) and from the Texas Alzheimer's Research Consortium 17 shows increased levels of PP, TN-C, and eotaxin 3 in plasma samples, suggesting that changes in these analytes are robust across cohorts when tested on the same platform. It should be noted that the Texas Alzheimer's Research Consortium used an earlier version of the panel (which did not include ApoE or NTproBNP) than that used in the present study.\nPerhaps the most notable finding from the ADNI cohort was the identification of a protein profile associated with ApoE allelic status, a known risk factor for AD. For example, ApoE protein, C-reactive protein, and gamma interferon plasma protein levels were lowest in Apo \u03b54 carriers, while IL-13 levels were elevated. Many of the plasma-based biomarkers previously described in the literature 13, 15, 17, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] (eg, cortisol, cystatin C, chromogranin A, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, and pregnancy-associated plasma protein CA19-9) also showed some associations with the ApoE genotype (eTables 1-3 and eAppendix), suggesting that differences may in part be driven by genotypic status in addition to dementia status. The present data support a phenotypic plasma signature associated with the ApoE genotype and could provide some explanation for the biological variability of blood-based biomarkers of AD described in the literature. 13, 15, 18 Clearly, examination in much larger cohorts is needed.\nThree common biological themes seemed to be associated with the top plasma biomarker changes in the ADNI cohort. The first biological theme appeared to be associated with metabolic markers that might be altered by cholinergic tone but most likely were driven by concomitant medication use (eg, PP). In fact, evidence indicates that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can alter PP release, 31 suggesting that alterations in PP observed in the Figure 3 . Plasma protein expression levels of plasma apolipoprotein E (ApoE) at baseline and at 1 year. Diagnosis was based on that at up to 48 months' follow-up. Levels of ApoE were lowest in patients with Alzheimer disease and in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who progressed to dementia compared with healthy control subjects and patients with MCI who remained dementia free at 48 months' follow-up. Data are expressed as mean values (nonimputed raw data) and 95% CIs.\nADNI cohort may be a function of acetylcholinesterase use. Alternatively, abnormal cholinergic tone may be driving abnormal expression of PP in patients with AD. The second biological theme appeared to be linked to vascular pathologic conditions (eg, TN-C, MMP-1, and NTproBNP). For example, TN-C has been associated with vascular remodeling, and NT-proBNP has long been studied in the context of cardiovascular disease. 32, 33 A recent study 34 examining 464 individuals 75 years or older without dementia demonstrated a significant association of NT-proBNP levels with cognitive decline, and NTproBNP has been reported to be elevated in patients with subcortical vascular dementia. 35 Notably, increases in natriuretic peptide levels in patients with AD have previously been described by Ewers et al 11, 12 and by Buerger and colleagues, 36 with speculation that endothelial remodeling during dementia might be detectable by peripheral vascular markers. The third biological theme seemed to revolve around the phenotypic signature of an ApoE genotype, perhaps best characterized by ApoE protein levels, the acute-phase C-reactive protein, and a subset of interleukins, and is probably the most notable of the categories. It has been hypothesized that ApoE is critical for A\u2424 clearance, although it remains less clear whether low levels of ApoE actually contribute to AD pathologic changes. 37, 38 The ApoE genotype also seems to be loosely associated with increases in several inflammatory cytokines. Indeed, eotaxin 3, one of the top biomarkers in the ADNI plasma data set, can be released following stimulation with interleukins such as IL-3 and IL-4, 39 and levels might be driven by modulation of interleukin levels. Further longitudinal studies relating changes in plasma and CSF ApoE and cytokine concentrations over time to changes in cognition and AD brain pathologic conditions in at-risk older individuals will likely further clarify the biological relevance of these associations.\nSignificant care should be taken in the interpretation of the present data set. For example, many of the observed changes may be a function of concurrent medication use (eg, PP). Furthermore, several common comorbidities exist in patients with AD, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus, that may be more reflective of vascular pathologic conditions (eg, TN-C, MMP-1, and NTproBNP) and are not that specific to AD. Finally, changes in one biomarker may drive changes in others within the panel (eg, interleukin influence on eotaxin 3), suggesting that many of the top biomarkers may be redundant and part of a larger common signaling cascade.\nIn summary, the ADNI plasma biomarker data confirm CSF studies reporting increased levels of PP, eotaxin 3, tenascin C, and NT-proBNP in patients with AD and MCI. When plasma biomarkers were combined with baseline demographics, the combined models showed high sensitivity and improved specificity, suggesting their usefulness as a potential screening tool. Further studies to confirm these findings are merited. Finally, the ADNI plasma biomarker data suggest a distinct phenotypic profile associated with ApoE allelic status. Additional research will help to delineate whether a blood-based multiplex immunoassay panel that includes these analytes can deliver as a screening tool for AD.
