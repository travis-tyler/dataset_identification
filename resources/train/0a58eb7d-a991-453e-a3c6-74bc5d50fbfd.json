[{"section_title": "PREFACE", "text": "Ph.D.s1 in the sciences, engineering, and the humanities have traditionally sought and secured employment in academe. However, during the past 10 years. the academic job market has tightened considerably because of both the greater number of qualified applicants available for academic positions and changes in students' preferences for study. Thus, the more recent and less experienced doctorate recipients are facing a new employment situation in that they are experiencing greater difficulty in both obtaining and retaining academic positions. As a result, there has been a marked change in the role of postdoctoral appointments and a shift in employment from academe to government and business settings among these more recent Ph.D.s. These trends are worthy of further examination because of their possible effects on the early , or patterns of Ph.D.s. Furthermore. academe is experiencing changes tnat could have far-reaching effects on the direction and quality of research and teaching. Feld mobility may also be on the increase because of the differences in employment opportunities among fields and the economic constraints confronting Ph.D. recipients. The purpose of this report is to provide a greater understanding of the current career paths of recent Ph.D.s. The report focuses primarily on the employment status of the 1973-1976 science. / engineering, and humanities Ph.D.s. These Ph.D.s were selected for the study because we believe that 5-8 years after receiving their doctoral degree, individuals are in the process of making some major career decisions--e.g., teaching versus management, tenure -track versus nontenure-track, academic versus nonacademic employment, job in Ph.D. field or job in a related but different field. Inaddition, A secondary data source used in this report is the Doctorate Records File's Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED).4 The significant Information used from this source concerns individuals' career plans at the time they received their doctoral degrees."}, {"section_title": "Limitations of the Data", "text": "The estimates presented in this report are subject to nonsampling and sampling errors. Nonsampling errors may arise from such sources as misinterpretation of questions by respondents, errors in coding and processing the responses, and bias from failure to respond to the survey. Sampling error, or standard error, is a measure of the precision with which an estimate based on the survey sample approximates the average result of all possible samples of equal size conducted under the same conditions. The size of the sampling error is directly related to the number of responses received from the sampled group.5 In some cases, the number of responses is too small to support estimates of individuals in certain degrees and/or degree years. In -these cases, survey results have been merged into aggregated categories. 2See Appendix A for a copy of the 1981 Survey of Doctorate Recipients questionnaire. 3See Appendix B for an explanation of the SDR sample. 4The Doctorate Records File (DRF) is based on the NRC's annual Survey of Earned Doctorates, an ongoing compilation of information taken from the questionnaires completed by all new Ph.D. recipients in U.S. universities.

Phr:D. production has approximately doubled with each decade, thus resulting in multiple applications for positions that have traditionally been filled by.doctorate recipients. during the 1970s, the number of both women and racial/ethnic minorities earning doctorates has increased at a rapid rate. On the whole, the percentage of Ph.D.s obtaining academic employment has decreased in the last 20 years. The lack of employment opportunities in academe has, however, been somewhat compensated by the availability of postdoctoral appointments and jobs in the private sector, primarily in business/industry and government. Within the academic system, the attainment of advanced rank and tenure has been affected by projections of declining student enrollments and the increased numbers of Ph.D.s available for academic positions. Recent Ph.D.s are increasingly being employed in off-ladder nontenure-track positions. In general, the employment situation for new Ph.D.s is brightened by the growth of nonacademic opportunities, but the new Ph.D.s need to be able to compete successfully with other more experienced candidates for private sector jobs in today's and tomorrow's ever.changing labor market sector. The fields of study selected by graduate students have certainly been influenced by the availability of employment opportunities in those fields, as well as by research funding in both academe and the private sector. The postgraduation plans for Ph.D.s have also changed= dramatically over the last two decades. There has been a substantial Increase irrthe percentages of Ph.D.s who are still seeking employment or planning postdoctoral study immediately after receipt of t6 doctoral degree. Some of the findings of this report are as follows: Science and Engineering 1-'.D.s The number of individuals with doctoral degrps in science and engineering has, been vastly increased by the production of the 1970s. In fact, almost as many scientists and engineers earned their doctoral degrees from 1977 to 1980 as had done so between 1938 and 1959. (Table 1."}, {"section_title": "1)", "text": ".01 Although male science and engineering Ph.D.s outnumber females, the number of women earning doctoral degrees in science and engineering has increased at a rapid rate. In contrast, the production of male science and engineering doctorates, after steady increases through the 1960s, has decreased slightly during the 1970s. (Table 1.2) Overall, the number (25,700) of racial/ethnic minority group members who earned science and engineering Ph.D.s between 1970 and 1980 was more than double that of the 1960s (10,300). These minority scientists and engineers are predominantly Asians/Pacific Islanders (70 percent of the 1981 science and engineering minority Ph.D. population). (Table 1.3) The percentage of new science and engineering Ph.D.s with definite postgraduation plans for employment has declined over the past 20 years: almost two-thirds of the 1960 -1964 graduates had firm commitments for employment immediately after receiving their doctorates compared to only half of the 1977-1980 graduates. (Table 1. 34 percent of the 1973-1976 graduates were either seeking employment or committed to a job immediately after receipt of their doctorates. (Table 1.4) The difficult employment situation confronting Ph.D.s in the biological sciences is demonstrated by the fact that as many as 6 percent of the 1973-1976 Ph.D.s in that field held postdoctoral appointments 5-8 years after receiving their doctorates. (Table 1.5) Pk.D.s with degrees in physics/astronomy and mathematics had-)the highest incidence of field mobility among scientists and engineers: as few as 60 percent and 66 percent, respectively, of the 1973-1976 graduates in those fields were working in jobs in their doctoral specialty area in 1981. (Table 1. Ph.D.s in the life sciences lag about one year behind other science and engineering fields in promotions to associate professor. (Table 1.26) This may be tied to the increasing trend among life scientists to pursue postdoctoral study rather than employment immediately after receiving their doctorates. Only 22 percent of the academically employed 1973-1976 science and engineering Ph.D.s with definite postdoctoral study plans at graduation held the rank of full or associate professor in 1981, compared to over 60 percent of those with firm commitments for immediate employment after receiving their doctorates. (Table 1. Although 57 percent of the 76,000 humanities doctorate recipients in the United States earned their doctoral degrees between 1970 and 1980, the production of humanities doctorates has declined during the 1970s. (Table 2.1) Slightly over half (53 percent) of the male humanities Ph.D.s earned their degrees between 1970 and 1980, compared to as many as 70 percent of the women. (Table 2.2) The percentage of humanities Ph.D.s with firm job commitments when they graduated has shown a substantial decline over the past 15 years: 87 percent of *the 1965-1968 graduates had definite job commitments when they graduated compared to only 59 percent of the 1977-1980 graduates. (Table 2.4) For 1973-1976 humanities Ph.D.s, a larger percentage of women were part-time employed in 1981 than were men (12 percent and 4 percent, respectively). In addition, another 9 percent of the women were not employed in 1981 compared to 3 percent of the men.

An estimated 95 percent of the doctorate rec1pients in computer sciences in the United States in 1981 had earned their doctorates between 1970 and 1980, and almost half of these Ph.D.s did so during the last four years (1971)(1972)(1973)(1974)(1975)(1976)(1977)(1978)(1979)(1980). Other science and engineering fields that have demonstrated high rates of growth since the 1960s include the social sciences, psychology, and the medical sciences--nearly 60 percent of the individuals in each of these fields had earned their doctorates between 1970 and 1980.  Table 1.2 points out the changing situation in the number of science and engineering Ph.D.s granted to women. Although male Ph.D.s still outnumber females, the number of women earning doctoral degrees in science and engineering fields is still increasing at a rapid rate, while the number of men appears to have decreased slightly during the 1970s. Only 7 percent (3.300) of the female science and engineering Ph.D.s in the United States in 1981 had earned their doctoral degrees during the 1950s. That percentage more than doubled in the 1960s when 19 percent (8,600) of the female science and engineering Ph.D. population earned their doctoral degrees. In fact. approximately 69 percent (30.700) of tfie female doctoral scientists and engineers had earned their doctorates just during the last 11 years (1970)(1971)(1972)(1973)(1974)(1975)(1976)(1977)(1978)(1979)(1980). an increase almost triple the percentage of degrees earned by females in either of the previous two decades. The upward trend in the number of science and engineering doctoral degrees awarded to women appears to be continuing into the present. It should be noted, however, that more than three-fourths of the doctoral degrees awarded to women are in the fields of psychology, the biological sciences, and the social sciences, For male science and engineering Ph.D.s, the percentage earning their doctorates during the 1960s (30 percent) was double the percentage of 1950-1959 graduates (15 percent). Between 1970 and 1980, the number of science and engineering doctorates awarded to men decreased slightly, although it was still larger than for past decades (49 percent of the total number of science and engineering held by men in the United States in 1981). In 1981, approximately 11 percent (39,300) of the science and engineering doctoral population was made up of individuals who classifieJ themselves as members of racial/ethnic minority groups: Blacks, American Indians/filaskan Natives, Hispanics, or Asians/Pacific Islanders (Table 1.3)."}, {"section_title": "_to", "text": "Compared with past decades, the number of racial/ethnic minority group members receiving doctoral degrees in science and engineering increased dramatically during the 1970s.6 Almost two-thirds of the 39,300 minority group members with science and engineering Ph.D.s in the United States in 1981 had earned their doctorates between 1970 and 1980 compared to approximately one-half of the non-minority science and engineering Ph.D.s. Overall, the number of minority group members who earned science and engineering Ph.D.s between 1970 and 1980 was more than double that of the 1960s. It should be noted that of the estimated 25,700 science and engineering Ph.D.s earned by minorities during the 1970s, 18,100 were awarded to Asians."}, {"section_title": "Postgraduation Plans", "text": "The postgraduation plans of science and engineering Ph.D.s at the time their doctoral degrees were awarded have varied over time. The expectations and plans of new Ph.D.s, and their subsequent actions have been influenced by the availability of research and employment opportunities in academe and in the private sector. In general, the percentage of science and engineering Ph.D.s who had firm plans for a postdoctoral study appointment at the time they earned their degrees has increased during the past 20 years. Projections of declining student enrollments and the general economic climate have made academic employment somewhat difficult to obtain and to retain. Ph.D.s are finding diversified employment opportunities in other employment sectors such as business/industry and government. Ph.D.s who earned their doctorates between 1973 and 1976 have made or are currently making career decisions in an employment market that differs markedly from that of previous Ph.D. graduates. The incidence of employment in the traditional academic world is considerably lower now, while nonacademic employment has increased.  Plans at graduation also appear to be related to the field in which the degree is granted. For example, while Ph.D.s with degrees in the EPT fields (engineering, mathematics, computer sciences, and the physical sciences) resemble the total science and engineering population in their immediate postdoctoral plans, those with degrees in the life sciences and behavioral/social sciences have plans that are considerably different. Over 44 percent of the 1973-1976 Ph.D.s with life science degrees had made a definite commitment for postdoctoral study or were seeking such an appointment immediately following the receipt of their doctoral degree. less than 50 percent of those Ph.D.s planned to accept or seek employment immediately after receiving their doctorates. This trend of pursuing postdoctoral study is particularly evident among the most recent life sciences Ph.D.s; as few as 29 percent of the 1977-1980 graduates had definite employment plans at graduation compared to 56 percent of the 1960-1964 graduates. These trends could be attributed to a number of factors, such as the tight employment market, the necessity for additional study in order to pursue one's own research endeavors, the benefit of having advanced training before seeking employment, and the increased availability of postdoctoral appointments for life scientists. Table 1.4 points out that far fewer postdoctoral appointments are available to Ph.D.s in the behavorial and social sciences areas than in life sciences; therefore, they are much more likely to enter the job market as soon as they graduate. For 1973For -1976 Ph.D.s in the behavorial or social sciences fields, 84 percent were either seeking employment or were committed to a job immediately after receipt of their doctoral degrees. By 1981, the 1973-1976 graduates had been in the doctoral lab;;r pool for 5-8 years and, therefore, had made or were making decisi)ns concerning their ultimate career goals. How their postgraduation plans relate to actual employment will be examined in the following sections of the report. The 1981 employment status of these individualt will also be compared to that of other Ph.  It may be assumed this high percentage is related to both the tight job market and the fact that postdoctoral appointments were viewed as an option for increasing one's chances for future employment. Nonetheless, it should be noted that these Ph.D.s have been in the doctoral labor pool for 5-8 years and are in temporary positions having salaries generally lower than those for regular jobs. Further evidence of the gloomy employment situation for biological scientists is that 2 percent were unemployed and actively seeking jobs; for all science and engineering Ph.D. fields combined, the percentage who were unemployed but seeking employment is slightly less than one percent. Overall, a higher peroffilage of the individuals who had firm employment plans when they received their Ph.D. were full-time employed in 1981 (97 percent), compared to those who were still seeking employment at graduation (91 percent). On the other hand, 1973-1976 science and engineering Ph.D.s who were still seeking employment at graduation were more frequently part-time employed (3 percent) or not employed (4 percent) in 1981 than those with firm postdoctoral or employment plans. This is especially true for Ph.D.s in the behavioral and social sciences, where of those still seeking employment at graduation, 5 percent were part-time employed and another 7 percent were not employed in 1981. Overall, 6 percent of the 1973-1976 science and engineering Ph.D.s with definite postgraduation plans for postdoctoral study still held postdoctoral appotntments in 1981, 5-8 years after receiving their doctorate. Among life scientists, the percentage of Ph.D.s who were still on postdoctoral appointments in 1981 was even higher (10 percent). Also of note is the fact that irregardless of immediate In comparison with other science and engineering fields, the more difficult employment situation facing life sciences Ph.D.s is shown in   1938-1980 1938-1959 1960-1964 Year of Doctorate \nAmong academically employed 1973-1976 humanities Ph.D.s, more than 97 percent with definite employment plans at the time of graduation held faculty positions in 1981, and 64 percent of them were full or associate professors. In contrast, for those academically. employed in 1981 who had been seeking employment at the time of Ph.D. receipt, approximately one-fourth held off-ladder positions (i.e., instructor, other faculty, and nonfaculty staff) and another 45 percent were at the assistant professor rank. *Includes only those employed full-time or part-time at colleges and universities."}, {"section_title": "FIELD MOBILITY", "text": "Field mobility is defined in this report as \"having earned a Ph.D. in one field and being employed in another field.\" The mobility from doctorate specialty to field of employment for 1973-1976 science and engineering Ph.D.s who were employed full-time or part-time in 1981 is given in Table 1.8. At least 85 percent of the Ph.D.s in engineering, psychology, the earth/environmental sciences, and the medical sciences were employed in the same broad field as their doctoral degree specialty. Ph.D.s with degrees in physics/astronomy and mathematics had the highest rate of field mobility--as few as 60 percent and 66 percent, respectively, were working in jobs in their doctoral field. It should be noted, however, that individuals who switch fields often accept jobs in related fields. For example, more than one-  When academic and nonacademic sectors are, examined separately, the picture changes even more dramatically for certain science and engineering fields (Table 1.9). For 1973-1976 mathematics Ph.D.s, 83 percent of those academically employed (i.e., 2-year colleges, 4-year colleges, medical schools, or universities) in 1981 were working in mathematics compared to only 35 percent of those in nonacademic jobs. Similar differences may be seen for Ph.D.s in physics/astronomy, the biological sciences, and the social sciences. For Ph.D.s in other science and engineering fields, the percentage employed in the doctoral specialty area did not differ significantly by sector of employment. the reasons that Ph.D.s give for accepting employment outside their area of specialty after years of study may reflect how these individuals perceive employment opportunities in the various fields of science and engineering (Table 1.101. Regardless of ser, the major reason given by 1973-1976 science and engineering Ph.D.s for accepting cull-time employment in a field other than their doctoral specialty area is that more attractive career options were available in the new area (44 percent). In contrast, 48 percent of the part-time employed Ph.D.s indicated that they were working outside their doctoral specialty because a position was not available in their Ph.D. area. Women also cited family and marital constraints as a reason for being employed outside their Ph.D. area much more often than men (9 percent of the full-time employed women and 18 percent of the part-time employed women, in contrast to only 1 percent of the full-time employed men and none of the part-time employed men). From Table 1.8 it was shown that the incidence of employment in the doctoral specialty was dependent on the field of doctorate; hence, the reasons for working outside the doctoral specialty by field of doctorate may also vary by doctoral specialty. As seen in Table 1.11, and as noted before, the most frequently reported reason for being employed outside one's specialty field was the availability of mire attractive career options in another specialty area. For elample, as many as 47 percent of the 1973-1976 Ph.D.s in the EMP fields gave \"more attractive career options\" as the reason for accepting employment outside their doctoral specialty area; for life scientists and behavorial/social scientists, this percentage was 38 and 41 percent, respectively. The absence of jobs in their Ph.D. fields was listed as the second most frequent reason for leaving those fields. Conversely, the percentage reporting employment in business or industry is higher for graduates of the 1970s than it is for 1960s' graduates. On the other hand, approximately the same percentage (31 percent) of the most senior doctoral scientists and engineers (1938-1959 graduates) were working in business/industry in 1981 as were the most recent graduating cohort (1977)(1978)(1979)(1980) Ph.D.$). It should be noted, however, that analysis c:). the SDR data showed that the older Ph.D.s were more often in self-employing enterprises. Looking at percentages, one sees that the EMP fields have shown the largest shift into business and industry; 35 percent of the 1960-1964 Ph.D.s in EMP fields were working in business and industry settings in 1981 compared to 53 percent of the 1977-1980 graduates. Among behavorial and social scientists, nonacademic employment has also increased for more recent Ph.D.s, with the largest increases In percentages being shown in government and \"other\" nonacademic areas. In 1981 almost half of the 1973-1976 science and engineering Ph.D.s were employed full-time or part-time at academic institutions, and another one-third were working in business or industry (Table  1. 1938-1938-1960-1965-1969-1973-1977-1981  Note: \".Academe\" includes 2-year colleges, 4-year colleges, medical schools and universities. \"Business /Industry\" also includes self-employment. \"Other\" includes elementary/secondary schools, private foundations, hospitals/clinics, other nonprofit organizations, and any other nonacademic employers.

As is true with science and engineering Ph.D.s, the achievement of senior academic rank for humanities doctorates is dependent upon the type of institution at which an individual is employed. Of the 12,100 full-time academically employed humanities Ph.D.s who earned their degrees between 1973 and 1976, over 96 percent were in faculty positions (Table 2.26). Of these faculty members, only 10 percent were full professors, 46 percent were associate professors, and 32 percent were assistant professors. Across all types of academic institutions, the majority of the 1973-1976 Ph.D.s were in the rank of associate professor. Advancement to full professorship for humanities Ph.D.s was slower in the universities than in other academic settings. Only 6 percent of the university-employed humanists were full professors. but as many as 48 percent were associate professors, and 36 percent were assistant professors. The Ph.D.s in 4-year colleges had higher percentages in full professorships (14 percent), but the percentages of those in the associate and assistant professor ranks were similar to those at universities (48 percent and 32 percent, respectively). Although 19 percent of the 1973-1976 humanities Ph.D.s employed at 2-year colleges held the rank of full professor, another 45 percent were in off-ladder positions (i.e.. instructors, other faculty, and nonfaculty)."}, {"section_title": "Type of Institution", "text": "Both tenure status and attainment of tenure differ according to the type of academic institution where the individual-is employed (Table 1.

"}, {"section_title": "4J", "text": "As seen in Table 1.22, individuals in the 1973-1976 Ph.D. cohort who have remAined at the same institution from 1977-1981 are more likely to be in tenure-track positions and to have attained a tenured position within eight years after receipt of the doctoral degree than these who have switched academic institutions. Slightly more than three-fourths of the 1973-1976 science and engineering Ph.D.s known to be a,ademically employed in 1977 were still at the same institution in 1981; among these, 64 percent were tenured, and another 26 percent were in tenure-track positions. In contrast, the 1981 Survey revealed that only 19 percent of those employed at a different institution than in 1977 were tenured, and as many as 51 percent were in tenure-track positions but not yet tenured. On the other hand, only 7 percent of those employed at the same institution in 1981 as in 1977 were in nontenure-track positions, compared to as many as 26 percent of 'those who switched academic institutions. Clearly, science and engineering Ph.D.s who attain a tenure-track position and remain at the same academic institution for at least four years are much more successful in attaining a tenured position than are those who change academic institutions.  23). Of the faculty members, only 7 percent were full professors while 42 percent were associate professors, and 39 percent were assistant professors. Instructors, administrators, and individuals in \"other\" faculty positions constituted the remainirg small percentage of faculty. Attaining the rank of full professor seems to be most difficult for those employed by medical schools/universities (5 percent, compared to 11 percent in 4-year colleges and 18 percent in 2-year colleges). As many as 8 percent of the Ph.D.s employed by medical schools/universities held nonfaculty positions. In 2-and 4-year colleges, only 3 percent of the Ph.D.s held nonfaculty potitions. By field, the highest percentage of 1973-1976 Ph.D.s with full professor rank was shown by those having EMP degrees and employed by 2-year colleges (27 percent). [The reader should note, however, that this percentage is based on a total of only 300 Ph.D.  The position held by an academically employed Ph.D. varies, depending on whether the individual is full-time or part-time employed (Table 1.24). Only 7 percent of the full-time employed science and engineering Ph.D.s held nonfaculty positions in 1981, compared to 23 percent of those who were employed part-time. Furthermore, among those in faculty positions, individuals employed part-time were much more likely to hold instructorships or other nonprofessorial positions (34 percent, compared to only 5 percent of the Ph.D.s employed full-time). In fact, only 7 percent of those Ph.D.s who were employed part-time in academe in 1981 held the ran::: of full or associate professor, compared to almost half of the academically employed full-time.    1938-1938-1960-1965-1969-1973-1971-1981Position 1980195919641968191219761980 Total   [1973][1974][1975][1976] Ph.D.s in the behavorial and social sciences were somewhat more likely to hold faculty positions (94 percent, compared to 90 and 91 percent, respectively, of the life science and EMP Ph.D.s ). Behavorial scientists appeared to receive promotions to the rank of full professor at a faster rate than did, those in other fields: as many as 24 percent of the 1973 behavorial sciences Ph.D.s were full professors in 1981, whereas only 6 percent of the 1973 EMP Ph.D.s and 3 percent of the 1973 life scientists held this rank. In fact, it appearz from comparing percentages at the higher ranks across fields and years, that life science Ph.D.s lag about one year behind other science and engineering fields in promotions to associate professorships--a typical market response to a generous supply.  As seen in Table 1.27, the decision to continue study immediately after the doctorate, rather than to accept or to seek employment, has an impact not only on tenure status but also on academic position. Among Ph.D.s who were employed in academe full-time or part-time in 1981, over 60 percent of those with definite plans for employment immediately after Ph.D. receipt held the rank of full or associate professor, compared to only 37 percent of those still seeking employment at Ph.D. and 22 percent of those with definite plans for postdoctoral study.) In contrast, as many as 13 percent of those with definite postdoctoral study plans were employed in nonfaculty positions in 1981 compared to only 4 percent of those Ph.D.s who had jobs immediately after graduation. It should be noted, however, that this does not take into account the different institutional distributions, i.e., individuals planning to teach in lower-ranking institutions may not need additional postdoctoral study, while those who,want to do research at the more prestigious schools often must have a tew years or postdoctoral study and may face tougher competition once employed.  It seems clear that the climup the academic ladder has slowed over the years."}, {"section_title": "J", "text": "Further evidence of this is the fact that all science and engineering fields showed an iwease between 1975 and 1981 in the percentage of Ph.D.s: in the rank of assistant professor 5-8 years after the doctorate. Academic institutions appear to retain individuals in lower ranks due to increased competition for such ranks, projected declining student enrollment, and the resulting reduction is the number of new faculty positions. Individuals who stayed at the same institution also received promotions to the full and associate professor ranks at a faster rate; nearly two-thirds of the faculty members at the same institution in 1977 and 1981 held full or associate professorships, compared to only slightly more than one=third of those who were at different institutions. Again, it is clear that individuals who can obtain faculty positions immediately after the doctorate and remain at the same institution 5-8 years are much more successful at being promoted than those who change academic institutions. As was true for the sciences, the number of humanities doctoral degrees awarded during the past 21 years showed a rapid rate of increase. The percentage who earned their doctoral degrees during the 1960s (25 percent) was double the percentage earned during the previous decade (12 percent). Furthermore, the representation of the 1970-1980 humanities Ph.D. graduates (57 percent) was double that of the 1960s. However, the production of humanities doctorates has declined during the 1970s. Meld of Ph.C. Compared to production in past decades, the fastest-growing humanities fields during the 1970-1980 period were music, art history, and \"other\" humanities: approximately two-thirds of the individuals in those fields earned their doctoral degrees during that period. In contrast, the slowest rate of growth occurred for the fields of classical languages/literature and speech/theater (46 and 50 percent, respectively, earned their doctorates between 1970 and 1980). It should be noted, however, that--with the exception of music--the production of humanities doctorates has declined during the 1970s; and in fact, the increase in music doctorates may be attributed to the introduction of Doctor Of Musical A is degrees in the 1970s, rather than an increase in musicology Ph.D S While the percentage of men who ea from 1970 to 1980 (53 percent) was ne (28 percent), the percentage offema their doctorates during that'time wa percentage of those who earned degree percent, respectively (Table 2.2).

Only 3 percent of the 1973-1976 Ph.D.s were considering postdoctoral study, and of these, approximately half were still seeking a postdoctoral appointment at the time of their graduation (Table 2.4). There was little variation by year of Ph.D.; however, the 1977-1980 Ph.D.s had the highest percentage of Ph.D.s planning postdoctural study (1 percent in \"other\" languages; 5 percent in \"other\" humanities; 4 percent in philosophy; and 3 percent each in history and English/American literature). It should be noted, howeyer, that the percentage who were still seeking postdoctoral study constituted, in several fields, almost.half of those with plans for postdoctoral study. For all humanities fields there has been a steady decline in the percentage of humanities doctorate recipients who had firm job prospects at the time they received their doctoral degrees since the mid-1960s. "}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "As seen by the continuing decrease in the percentage of humanities Ph.D. recipients with firm job commitments immediately after receiving their doctorate, the job market for humanities doctorates has not been able to keep pace with the large increase in the production of new doctorates in the 1970s. The following sections examine the employment status of the 1973-1976 Ph.D.s and compares these graduates with those from other Ph.D. years in terms of type of employer, academic rank, and tenure status."}, {"section_title": "EMPLOYMEN1 STATUS OF 1973-1976 PH.O.S", "text": "The employment picture for the 1973-1976 humanities doctorkte recipients is not as bright as it was for those in the science and engineering fields. As shown in Table 2.5, only the field of history had over 90 percent of its doctorate recipients in full-time employment in 1981 (91 percent). \"he percentage of humanists holding part-time positions ranged from 9 percent for those in \"other\" humanities to 4 percent for those in history. Only about 1 percent of the humanists in the various fields held postdoctoral appointments. Although an average of 2 percent of the 1973-1976 humanities doctorates were unemployed put seeking employment, this employment status varied by field. Wier 3 percent of the Ph.D.s with degrees in \"other\" languages were seeking employment. In contrast, Ph.O.s in philosophy had the lowest percentage of those unemployed but seeking employment:(0.4 percent). However, for philosophy Ph.D.s, three-fourths of the 5 percent employed part-time were seeking full-time employment. Furthermore, more than 4 percent of the Ph.O.s in philosophy had dropped out of the labor force. When employment data are presented by sex, differences in employment status surface. Far greater female Ph.D.s in the humanities were part-time employed than men (12 percent, compared to 4 percent). With the exception of yh.D.s in philosophy, less than 80 percent of the 1973-1976 female humanists were employed in full-time jobs in 1981. It should also be noted that as many as 6 percent of female humanists had dropped out of the labor force by 1981, compared to less than 1 percent of the men. \"Other languages' are classical and modern foreign languages and literature; \"Other humanities\" include art history, speech/theater, music, library sciences, general humanities, and any other humanities fields not given above. Those 1973-1976 humanities Ph.D.s with firm employment plans immediately after the doctorate had a higher percentage of full-time employment in 1981 than did those who were still seeking employment at the time of Ph.D. receipt--93 percent compared to 80 percent (Table   2.6). Those who had been seeking employment it the time of graduation . were much more likely to be part-time employe.' (13 percent) or unemployed and seeking employment (4 percent as of 1961 than those with firm postgraduation job commitments. For Ph.D.s who earned their degrees after the early 1960s, there is a direct relationship between the number of years since receiving their doctorates and their 1981 employment status (full-time versus part-time). The more years these Ph.D.s are in the doctoral labor pool, the greater their chances of being full-time employed (Table   2. Across all Ph.D. year groups, with the one exception of the 1965=1968 graduates, less than 80 percent of women Ph.D.s were employed in full, -time jobs, and more than 10 percent were in part-time positions. In addition, almost 10 percent of the female humanists who received their doctoral degrees since 1969 were not even employed in 1981.

Music and art history graduates were most likely to be employed in their doctoral specialty in 1981 (89 and 84 percent, respectively), in contrast to Ph.D.s in \"other\" humanities and history (51 and 57 percent, respectively). Among the history Ph.D.s, almost 11 percent were employed in the behavortal and social sciences fields and another 8 percent both in \"other\" humanities (which includes library sciences) and professional fields. Philosophy Ph.D.s had the highest percentage--nearly 5 percent--employed in the EMP (Engineering, Math, and Physical Sciences) fields; whereas about 7 percent of the speech/theater Ph.D.s held jobs in education and another 7 percent were employed in behavorial and social sciences (which includes communications) .  See the Specialties list in Appendix A for list of fine fields included under each broad field. 'Other Humanities' includes the fine fields of library/archival sciences, general humanities, and any other humanities fields not listed above. As seen from Table 2.9, when those employed in academic (colleges and universities) and nonacademic settings are compared separately, music and art history Ph.D.s continued to have the highest incidences of employment in their doctoral specialty. For Ph.D.s in music, 93 percent of those employed in\" academe and 82 percent of those employed in nonacademic settings were employed in the field of music. Among art history Ph.D.s, about 91 percent of those academically employed were working in art history, compared to only 56 percent of those in nonacademic job settings. In contrast, among all other humanities fields, approximately one-third or less of those working in nonacademic job settings were able to secure employment in their doctoral specialty, compared to approximately 60 peitent or more of those employed at academic institutions. the reasons given by Ph.D.s for being employed in areas other than their doctoral specialty fields provide an indication of the state of the job market as seen by recent humanities doctorate recipients. About half of the employed 1973-1976 humanities Ph.D.s not working in their doctoral specialties were in other fields because positions in their specialty areas were not available (Table 2.  National Research Council. There also appears to be a relationship between the field of employment (as opposed to field of doctorate) and the reasons given by field-switching humanists for their being employed outside their Ph.D. fields (Table 2.11). Slightly more than two-thirds of the 1913 -1916 humanities Ph.D.s employed in the behavorial and social sciences in 1981 indicated they were so employed because positions in their doctoral fields were not available, compared to only 29 percent of those employed in education. By contrast, among this latter group, almost half said that they were in education jobs because they offered more attractive career options, and another 11 percent had been promoted from their doctoral field to administrative positions in education. Geographic location and salary were not strong motivating forces behind movement from Ph.D. field to another employment field for humanities Ph.D.s. "}, {"section_title": "TYPE OF EMPLOYER", "text": "In 1981, 83 percent of the 68,000 employed humanities Ph.D.s were working in higher education institutions.

Table 2.12 provides data, however, that show a change in this trend among the more recent humanities doctorate recipients.
