USDA is an equal opportunity provider and employer.\n1 Every 5 years, USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) engages in a comprehensive study of the U.S. farm economy, known as the Census of Agriculture. The Census examines various facets of farm ownership, structure, and production and marketing practices. Beginning with the 1997 Census, NASS has collected specifi c information from farm operators regarding their use of direct-to-consumer marketing outlets to sell food for human consumption, recognizing that many farmers are turning to direct-toconsumer sales as a way to increase their share of consumer food expenditures.\nThis factsheet on direct marketing developments and trends is designed to provide an overview of the growing importance of direct marketing to U.S. farmers, in general, and to specifi c regions and States, in particular, by extracting and summarizing data from the 2007 Census of Agriculture, and comparing these data with those from 1997 and 2002. Among the issues examined in the factsheet are absolute changes in the value of direct marketed food products, the share of total agricultural sales for direct marketed food products, and the relative importance of direct marketing at regional and State levels. Charts 1 through 6 compare direct-to-consumer sales across censuses or with total agricultural sales as recorded in the censuses. Chart 7 takes a slightly diff erent approach to calculating direct-to-consumer sales as a share of the food system. The total agricultural sales fi gures are modifi ed to refl ect the exclusion of crops and agricultural practices not falling under NASS's defi nition of direct-to-consumer marketing.\nIntroduction\nThe value of direct-to-consumer food marketing in all regions increased during the last decade (Chart 1)."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "Every 5 years, USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) engages in a comprehensive study of the U.S. farm economy, known as the Census of Agriculture.

From 1997-2007 direct-to-consumer food marketing grew by 104.7 percent in the United States, while total agricultural sales increased by only 47.6 percent (Chart 2). The role of direct-to-consumer food marketing in the agricultural sector is most prominent in New England. All six New England States are on the list of top ten States in direct-to-consumer food marketing as a share of total agricultural sales (Chart 3). The average rate of growth for direct marketing in the ten fastest growing States is more than four times greater than for total agricultural sales. In these States direct marketing grew by an average of 220 percent, compared to an average growth rate of only 53.2 percent for total agricultural sales (Chart 5).\nChart 5: Top 10 States, Growth of Direct-to-Consumer Food Marketing, 1997 Marketing, -2007 Farms with more than $50,000 in direct-to-consumer sales accounted for only 2.8 percent of the total number of farms who sold directly to consumers, but they captured 58.1 percent of all directto-consumer farm sales. Farms with annual direct-to-consumer sales below $5,000 captured 11.7 percent of the direct marketing sales while representing 77.4 percent of farmers engaged in direct marketing (Charts 6a and 6b).
