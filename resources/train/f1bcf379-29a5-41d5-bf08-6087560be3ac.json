[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Over the last quarter of a century, the world has undergone rapid change. Almost every aspect of human life is more complex and interdependent, requiring knowledge of human and social systems as well as physical and biological systems. The social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) sciences 1 contribute penetrating insights on such issues as the causes and consequences of confl ict, how individuals and groups perceive and misperceive hazards, how they understand or misunderstand the risks they run in their daily lives, and how they organize and structure their interactions and transactions. Understanding and utilizing this knowledge require basic competence in the SBE sciences in all citizens, and a talent pool of SBE scientists to undertake research and teach about it. Determining how best to improve education and training in the social and behavioral sciences is a challenge. Under the aegis of the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE) Directorate, and with the active participation of the Education and Human Resources (EHR) Directorate, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has committed itself to this task. This report, undertaken at the request of NSF, is an outgrowth of that ambition. The purpose of the report is to provide guidance to NSF on the development of a strategic plan for education and training in the SBE sciences. The report focuses on four levels of education-K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral and early career stages-and on diversity issues. In each area, the report addresses key needs, impediments and challenges, and best practices as well as the components of an action plan. The action plan itself is presented in three parts: enhancements to existing NSF programs, new opportunities and initiatives, and immediate steps. An outline of the plan is presented in the Action Plan Summary Table (see pages 19-20). NSF's commitment to SBE science education and training complements two priorities in the Foundation's fi ve-year strategic plan (FY 2003(FY -2008, NSF's Workforce for the 21 st Century st Century st initiative and the Human and Social Dynamics priority area. In 2003, NSF took explicit steps to engage the wider scientifi c community in providing guidance on education and training in the SBE sciences. First, in January 2003, representatives of approximately 20 social and behavioral science societies attended a Planning Meeting and discussed the state of education and training in their respective fi elds. Second, in June 2003, 120 leading social and behavioral scientists and educators participated in a National Workshop. (Appendices A-C provide information on the Workshop.) At the June Workshop, participants engaged in intensive discussions about ongoing programs, innovations, and opportunities at the four stages of education and examined key needs, impediments, and best practices in education and training in the SBE sciences. In the plenary sessions and breakout groups, all participants addressed the topic of diversity. Considerable research and analysis were undertaken in the preparation of this report and action plan. Also, information presented at the January Planning Meeting and the background papers and materials prepared for both meetings contributed valuably to the report. While all of this work was very useful, the deliberations at the National Workshop provided the basis for the report. In that sense, this plan of action is a collective product refl ecting the ideas and input of many experts."}, {"section_title": "Improving Kindergarten through Grade 12 Education in the SBE Sciences", "text": "Current Context"}, {"section_title": "Key Needs", "text": "The social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) sciences are largely absent from the K-12 curriculum, and their presence in the high school curriculum is limited, especially compared to the natural sciences. Major investments in curriculum, materials, and teacher training are required to meet current and future needs.\nThe progress made by groups convened by national professional associations or higher education commissions notwithstanding, there remains substantial need to move beyond \"trickle down\" knowledge, notable initiatives, and institutional symbols of support to structural and institutional change. Colleges and universities all grapple with the dual purposes of exposing undergraduates to the thoughts, materials, and methods of fi elds of inquiry while simultaneously attracting, nurturing, and preparing some of these students to pursue advanced degree training. In almost every SBE science, recognition of the importance of a sequenced and integrated curriculum, sound methodological training, and research-based experience far outstrips implementation of these objectives.\nThe SBE sciences of the 21st century need advanced skills and methodological tools in order to address the vexing problems facing society. The contexts wherein SBE scientists work are also changing. Graduate training in the SBE sciences should be rethought to produce excellent researchers with skills appropriate to diverse work settings. The core curriculum, research training, and mentoring merit fresh consideration in light of changing opportunities and changing career goals and motivations of graduate students. Notwithstanding the fact that the SBE sciences are generally more diverse than other fi elds of science, there remains a need for a workforce that includes the fuller participation of underrepresented minorities in these sciences. Efforts to meet these needs should be guided by a cohesive human resource policy for the SBE sciences, as is warranted in all fi elds of science.\nMost SBE disciplines invest primarily in the development and design of doctoral education and devote less attention to professional growth and education after doctoral training. The absolute number of postdoctoral appointments in science and engineering has increased rapidly, but relatively few of these opportunities to enrich the doctoral research experience and establish a research program exist for SBE scientists. The SBE sciences would benefi t greatly from a signifi cant increase in the number of postdoctoral positions and programs. Beyond postdoctoral appointments, new PhDs in all employment sectors would benefi t from explicit professional support during the fi rst several years of their careers. The skills and competencies requisite to scholarly productivity and to the advancement of scientifi c careers require continued development during early career stages, especially for women and underrepresented minorities.\nNumerous studies demonstrate that diversity in education contributes to broadening perspectives, encouraging tolerance, and promoting the development of critical thinking and related skills. Building a scientifi c workforce that mirrors the U.S. population challenges all fi elds of science, including the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Absent intentional efforts to alter recruitment and retention in higher education, the achievement gap between minority populations and non-Hispanic whites will persist or widen. Better recruitment and retention of women at the advanced degree level in the SBE sciences, in particular in certain disciplines and subfi elds, are also needed. The absolute numbers and the proportions of persons of color in the SBE sciences remain quite small, notwithstanding increases over time.\nThe social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) sciences are largely absent from the K-12 curriculum, despite the fact that science competencies are best learned early and in developmentally appropriate ways. Each year, some 53 million students attend elementary and secondary schools in the United States. Yet, they receive almost no exposure to the theories, concepts, or methods of the SBE sciences, nor are they made aware of the interconnectedness of social, biological, and physical phenomena. Although more SBE science courses are available in high schools, they are few in number in comparison to natural science offerings. Furthermore, when SBE content is part of the K-12 curriculum in social studies or elective courses, the materials too often emphasize facts rather than the study of social and behavioral processes as science. 7 Data on Advanced Placement (AP) courses indicate the limited presence of the social, behavioral, and economic sciences in the high school curriculum and their secondary status. In the 37,000 public and private secondary schools in the United States, SBE Advanced Placement courses may be the only offering in one or another of the SBE fi elds, and they are rarely capstone courses preceded by prerequisites. In 2002, AP psychology, economics, and geography courses were taken, respectively, by 52,000 students in 2,400 schools, 32,000 students in 2,000 schools, and 3,250 students in 400 schools. In comparison, AP biology, chemistry, and physics courses were taken, respectively, by approximately 98,000 students in 6,900 schools, 61,500 students in 5,500 schools, and 37,500 students in 3,350 schools. Even in a fi eld like psychology where more students take AP courses than in physics, AP physics is taught in 50 percent more high schools than is psychology (3,350 schools in comparison to 2,400). The relative paucity of the SBE sciences in grades K-12 presents a complex challenge. In formal education, major investments in curriculum, materials, and faculty development are required to meet current and future needs. Strategies need also to be developed that better incorporate the social, behavioral, and economic sciences into K-12 education, emphasizing their connections to each other, to other fi elds, and ultimately to school or work transitions. Outside of school, in the informal settings where science education occurs (e.g., science museums, media programming, after-school community programs), important opportunities could be nurtured to integrate the social, behavioral, and economic sciences into science learning. Introduction of the social and behavioral sciences early in and as a part of the elementary school science curriculum provides an excellent context for science learning more generally. Exposing young students to science on phenomena familiar and of interest to them offers an effective framework for learning how to ask testable questions, collect systematic data, inspect and test hypotheses, and produce insights and information. Also, early and frequent exposure to the social and behavioral sciences can avert the misconception that social and behavioral phenomena are not amenable to systematic study and explanation.\nFor more than a decade, the social and behavioral sciences, like many fi elds and disciplines within the arts and sciences, have been engaged in reexamining and reforming undergraduate education. The progress made by groups convened by national professional associations or higher education commissions notwithstanding, there remains substantial need to move beyond \"trickle down\" knowledge, specifi c notable initiatives, and institutional symbols of support to structural and institutional change. In 1998, for example, the Boyer Commission on Educating Undergraduates in the Research University called for signifi cant transformations in undergraduate education to make research-based learning the standard. Yet, a survey undertaken three years after the Boyer Report found that only 25 percent of responding universities reported participation in research by at least half of their social science students. Small colleges and large-scale universities all grapple with the dual purposes of exposing undergraduates to the thoughts, materials, and methods of a discipline or area of inquiry while simultaneously attracting, nurturing, and preparing some of these students to pursue advanced degree training. 13 Particularly in SBE sciences that have very large service courses and train large numbers of undergraduate majors, these goals may seem distinct and diffi cult to reconcile. Yet, in reality, the very same analytic reasoning and inquiry skills are essential for both advanced  1989-1990. 15 Although the SBE disciplines and fi elds have pursued a range of strategies to alter education at the baccalaureate level, much remains to be done. In almost every SBE science, explicit recognition of the importance of a sequenced and integrated curriculum, sound methodological training, and research-based experience far outstrips implementation of these objectives. There is also a general awareness that strengthening SBE undergraduate education will require comprehensive faculty development in substantive knowledge, teaching techniques (e.g., active learning), and advising and mentoring. Finally, there is growing recognition of the desirability of rethinking how undergraduate programs in the various SBE sciences relate to each other and align with prior or subsequent education (i.e., K-12 education, two-year college education, and graduate education). U.S. colleges and universities are quite diverse in terms of their size, structure, mission, and the composition of their student populations. Consonant with this variation, the SBE sciences have an opportunity to advance public literacy in these sciences, to prepare undergraduates for numerous career options, and to enrich the skills and knowledge of those pursuing advanced scientifi c training in these fi elds. There are barriers and challenges in doing so, as set forth below, but sustained NSF presence, commitment, and funding can produce meaningful and realistic methods and models of change.\nGraduate education in the social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) sciences has changed little over the past several decades. Yet, during this period, almost every discipline has become more specialized and, in some instances, has spawned new disciplines and fi elds (e.g., cognitive science from psychology). Despite these changes, there has in principle been far more acknowledgement of the need to rethink graduate education and training than has occurred in practice. The need for such rethinking arises not only endogenously as these sciences have become more complex, but also exogenously as the changing nature of human life and its social organization requires new knowledge from all arenas of inquiry. 17 The SBE sciences of the 21st century have evolved to a stage where the next generations need advanced skills and methodological tools in order to address the vexing problems facing society. While specialized knowledge is important, there is growing awareness that social and behavioral scientists need rigorous training in diverse modes of inquiry and methods of analysis as well as education in how best to use these skills for different purposes. Also, there is greater appreciation that training requires enhanced interdisciplinary integration across the SBE sciences and between these sciences and other fi elds. 18 16 National Academy of Sciences, Reshaping the Graduate Education of Scientists and Engineers (Washington, DC: National Academy of Sciences, 1995). 17 In addition to a need for integrated training across disciplines, there is also a need to prepare the next generation of SBE scientists for research that is multi-level in scale and international or comparative in scope. 18 For SBE fi elds like law and social science or education research that have their foundation in multiple disciplines, education occurs in different disciplinary departments and professional schools (e.g., law schools and schools of education). From one vantage, such fi elds have already been working on interdisciplinary integration as central to their research and tend to be more refl ective and critical. From another vantage, education and training in these fi elds constitute a \"distributed\" system where a cohesive strategy may be eclipsed by what is either intellectually central to constituent disciplinary departments or to the primary mission of professional schools. See Felice J. Beyond changes in the SBE sciences and in society, the contexts where SBE scientists work are also changing. While SBE scientists still tend to be located in the academy more than scientists trained in many other fi elds, SBE scientists are increasingly present in non-academic work settings-aligned with growing demand and awareness of opportunities in research institutes and laboratories and the public and private sectors over the last several decades. 19 Even within higher education, more graduates are taking jobs in two-and four-year colleges and non-research intensive universities. Graduate training in the SBE sciences faces the challenge and opportunity to rethink how to produce excellent researchers with skills appropriate to such diverse work settings. 20 Intentional department-wide planning is essential to enhancing the breadth and fl exibility of graduate training consonant with quality research and the specialty competencies of faculty. The core curriculum, research training, and mentoring merit fresh consideration in light of changing opportunities and changing career goals and motivations of graduate students. This rethinking should be pursued cognizant not only of the range of places where SBE scientists may work, but also of the growing need for them to collaborate with scientists from other fi elds and communicate to other professionals and the public. The role of a professional master's degree in preparing graduates for different employment sectors (including for high school teaching) should be an important part of any rethinking of graduate education. Another pressing need is to close the gap between the technical training required at the graduate level and the training currently provided in typical undergraduate programs. Prior chapters of this report have addressed the importance of pre-college and undergraduate education in improving the skills and capacities of those ultimately pursuing advanced degrees. Preparation for graduate work requires much more attention to problem formulation, quantitative methods, and the sophisticated use of qualitative modes of inquiry and analysis. Overall undergraduates have limited exposure to the principles and tools of undertaking SBE science, including an appreciation of ethics and the responsible conduct of research. As graduate education increasingly draws on students from a broader range of undergraduate institutions, graduate programs may need to help bridge that transition. Finally, there is a need for a more diverse workforce in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. While the SBE sciences are in general more diverse than other fi elds of science, racial and ethnic minorities (and women in some disciplines and subfi elds) are still proportionally lower in numbers and in specifi c types of employment. Outreach and the identifi cation of nontraditional pathways, targeted investments in training, and strategies to support persons who are often fi rst-generation in their pursuit of graduate careers are all necessary to enhance the presence of underrepresented minorities in the SBE sciences. The 1995 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on Reshaping the Graduate Education of Scientists and Engineers made similar observations regarding all fi elds of science. The report pointed to changing demands for new knowledge, the changing labor markets for scientists, the need for versatile scientists with a wider variety of skills, and the continued importance of a diverse talent pool. This report, now some nine years old, remains timely in its essential recommendations. It rightly acknowledged the special strength of graduate education in the United States in carrying out training in institutions \"where a large portion of the nation's best research is done\" (p. 1). While emphasizing the value of synergistic activity between research and training, the report also expressed serious concerns that \"[t]here is no clear human-resources policy for advanced scientists and engineers, so their education is largely a by-product of policies that support research\" (p. 2). There is need for a cohesive human resource policy to guide and support building human capacity in the SBE sciences. With the exception of some work led by SBE scientifi c societies, there has been little concerted effort within these disciplines to examine graduate education and training. Also, except for this 1995 NAS report, there has been no general consideration of education and training in science that is germane to all SBE fi elds. As with other fi elds of science, the content and structure of graduate education for the majority of SBE sciences remain the purview of individual graduate programs, despite greater or lesser consensus among them resulting from common disciplinary assumptions and needs. How to make this issue a top priority for graduate programs and for the SBE sciences remains a challenge.\nThere is a high-priority need to address the continuing development and training of social, behavioral, and economic (SBE) scientists beyond their doctoral degrees. Despite the very real challenges for SBE science education considered in prior chapters of this report, most SBE disciplines invest primarily in the development and design of doctoral education and devote little attention to professional growth and education after doctoral training. The postdoctoral period of professional transition is critical to building and solidifying skills; charting robust research agendas; locating one's scientifi c interests in the context of larger disciplinary or interdisciplinary concerns; and building strong networks of guidance, collaboration, and enrichment. Whether new doctorates pursue formal postdoctoral programs or are otherwise employed, opportunities and support at this professional stage are critical to both the quality of their research and their career advancement. Postdoctoral Positions and Programs. Since the mid-1980s, the number of postdoctoral appointments in science and engineering has increased rapidly, but relatively few such opportunities exist for SBE scientists. 30 Over the 30-year period from 1965 to 1995, for example, the number of doctorates receiving postdoctoral appointments in psychology increased from 22 to 32 percent, whereas the number in physics increased from 29 to 73 percent, in chemistry from 31 to 63 percent, and in the biological sciences from 40 to 71 percent. 31 The most recent data  Table 1 31 Although some of the dramatic rise in postdoctoral appointments in certain fi elds is attributable to changing employment opportunities and the limited academic market, in general those in postdoctoral positions report that they seek these experiences in order to obtain advanced training in their fi elds, training outside of their fi elds, or training with specifi c scientists. Mark C. Regets, \"Has the Use of Postdocs Changed?,\" NSF 99-310, Issue Brief (NSF 99-310) (1998). on such appointments vividly illustrate the lagging SBE situation: Of the 28,564 postdoctoral appointees in science and engineering in doctorate-granting institutions in 1999, 703 (2.5 percent) were in psychology and 451 (1.6 percent) were in all other social sciences combined. 32 At the same time that SBE fi elds were taking up only 4.1 percent of all postdoctoral appointments, they constituted about 30 percent of all doctoral degrees in science and engineering. Postdoctoral appointments-whether through fellowships, traineeships, or positions on research grants-provide an opportunity to enrich the doctoral research experience and establish a scholars' research program. Though postdoctoral appointments do not always realize their stated educational goals (the National Academy of Sciences report cited above outlines key areas for improvement in postdoctoral training), 33 such advanced apprenticeships are invaluable periods for honing scientifi c and professional skills and promoting career-long scientifi c productivity. Absent postdoctoral training immediately after graduate school or in early stages of a career, most newly minted doctorates in the SBE sciences move into tenure track or temporary academic positions where they face heavy teaching, course preparation, and service responsibilities before they have adequately sharpened their skills and established their research trajectories. Despite unevenness in the quality of postdoctoral training, it is far more intentional and institutionalized than the support and mentoring that junior faculty typically receive from senior faculty in most colleges and universities. The SBE sciences would benefi t greatly from a signifi cant increase in the number of postdoctoral positions and programs that offer strong developmental components, closer alignment with the contexts in which SBE researchers work, and explicit attention to building skills across specialties and fi elds. As with doctoral training, current postdoctoral programs in science (including in the SBE sciences) largely focus on preparing graduates for academic careers in research universities despite employment opportunities in a range of academic markets and in non-academic settings. In all fi elds of science, most postdoctoral positions are located in academic institutions; this is especially true of postdoctoral programs in SBE sciences. In addition, too little attention is paid to developing interdisciplinary skills and ties. Also, postdoctoral programs need to examine their mentoring and training components, the adequacy of support packages for appointees, the duration of the postdoctoral traineeship, and even the prestige of the appointment. Thus, along with the need to increase the number of postdoctoral positions and programs in the SBE sciences is the need to do so in ways that improve upon what often constitutes the postdoctoral experience. Career Development Beyond the Doctoral Degree. Capacity building and strengthening the human infrastructure for research are key to advancing productivity in the SBE sciences. The continuing education needs of junior and early career scientists vary by discipline, doctoral 32 National Science Foundation/Division of Science Resources Studies, Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering, 1999, Table A-17. 33 In 1998, the Association of American Universities issued a report prepared by its Committee on Graduate Education. This report includes some consideration of postdoctoral appointments and the analyses and recommendations therein are relevant for graduate as well as postdoctoral study. For the full report, see http://www.aau.edu/reports/GradEdRpt.html. training programs, professional location (e.g., research institutes, teaching intensive institutions, government agencies), and individuals' experiences (e.g., extent of prior research support, publications). While strategies should be fl exible, new PhDs in all employment sectors would benefi t from explicit professional support especially during the fi rst several years after their doctoral degrees. Academic and non-academic employers would be wise to consider professional development opportunities (e.g., seed money to nurture research ideas, reductions in teaching loads, travel support) as appropriate and sound investments. Also, national research societies can advance their disciplines and fi elds through intentional efforts directed to junior scholars. Professional development courses, workshops, and institutes on substantive, methodological, and professional issues or mentor-match programs can yield large dividends through enhancing the knowledge and networks of new SBE doctorates. In essence, the skills and competencies requisite to scholarly productivity and to the advancement of scientifi c careers require continued development during early career stages. For women and underrepresented minorities (especially those who are fi rst generation doctorates), there may be a special need for specifi c guidance in responding to the particular challenges they face in scientifi c and academic careers-ranging from stereotypes about their professional skills to being more in demand to advise students or serve on committees. Efforts on the part of senior colleagues, departments, disciplines, and institutions are important in alerting new scholars to obstacles and opportunities and in helping them overcome distinctive impediments. Strong signals about the legitimacy of seeking and receiving support are essential. So too are steps to ensure that such support is maximally available.\nExplicit attention to diversity in education and training is essential to any consideration of the future workforce in the United States. 37 Diversity in the United States is not just a core value; diversity in the workforce also affects the country's capacity to nurture democracy and encourage civic participation, maintain competitiveness in an increasingly global economy, enhance the quality of education, and promote the health and safety of all citizens. Numerous studies demonstrate that diversity in education contributes to broadening perspectives, encouraging tolerance, and promoting the development of critical thinking and related skills. Beyond the substantive enrichment of the social, behavioral, and economic sciences by scholars bringing diverse sets of interests, questions, and skills, learning is strengthened when guided by faculty and mentors of diverse backgrounds and expertise. In particular in higher education, SBE faculties teach large and diverse pools of students and thus are strategically well situated to introduce them to science. Building a scientifi c workforce that mirrors the U.S. population challenges all fi elds of science, including the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Demographic trends portend an increasingly diverse U.S. population in the 21 st century. From 1990 to 2000, the country's st century. From 1990 to 2000, the country's st minority population increased by 35 percent and the non-Hispanic white population by 3.4 percent. The U.S. Census Bureau forecasts that these trends will continue. Non-Hispanic whites will comprise 53 percent of the population by 2050 (a projected drop from 69 percent 36 Eleanor L. Babco, Trends in African and Native American Participation in STEM Higher Education (Washington, DC: Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology, 2003), p. 11. 37 This chapter focuses on outreach to and training of persons of color and women in the SBE sciences. Inclusive training in the SBE sciences also commends attention to persons with disabilities. The National Workshop and this report do not specifi cally address issues of access and opportunities for this population of researchers, though the issue is important. in 2000), Hispanics will account for the largest share of population growth, and the African American population will nearly double. Consistent with this overall pattern, the traditional college-age population will also increase by an estimated 16 percent from 2000 to 2015. Of these new students, it is estimated that 80 percent will be non-white and nearly half of these will be Hispanic. 38 Absent intentional efforts to alter recruitment and retention in higher education, the achievement gap between minority populations and non-Hispanic whites will persist or widen. In 2000, African Americans constituted just over 12 percent of the population, but earned 9 percent of all bachelor's degrees and 6 percent of all doctoral degrees; Hispanics totaled 12.6 percent of the population, but earned only 6.3 percent of all bachelor's degrees and 3.8 percent of all doctorates. 39 Completion rates for bachelor's degrees captures the problem: According to a report from the American Council on Education (cited above), in 2000, 28 percent of non-Hispanic whites completed baccalaureate degree programs compared to less than 17 percent of African Americans, and 11 percent of Hispanics. Although the presence of persons of color in science and engineering, including in the SBE sciences, has increased in recent decades, the absolute numbers and proportions are still quite small. 40 For most minority groups, there is both underrepresentation and attrition in these fi elds. The one exception is Asian Americans and Asian permanent residents who in 2000 constituted 3.6 percent of the U.S. population and 8.9 percent and 10.0 percent of those receiving bachelor's and doctorate degrees. 41 For other minority groups, the picture looks as follows: In 2000, African Americans earned 8.3 percent, Hispanics 7.2 percent, and Native Americans 0.7 percent of bachelor's degrees in science and engineering and an even lower proportion of doctorate degrees (African Americans earned 4.2 percent; Hispanics, 4.3 percent; and Native Americans, 0.5 percent of all PhDs). Focusing only on the SBE sciences as a subgroup, the drop off is much the same: At the bachelor's level, 9.8 percent and 7.9 percent of the degrees were, respectively, earned by African Americans and Hispanics in comparison to African Americans and Hispanics earning only 6.4 and 5.2 percent, respectively, of all SBE doctorate degrees. 42 In comparison to other fi elds of science, the SBE sciences have over time made more progress in attracting, retaining, and granting degrees to historically underrepresented minorities (African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans), especially African Americans. At the bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degree levels, the overall differences are modest, but stable. For example, in 2000, underrepresented minorities received 12.3 percent of the doctorates awarded in the SBE sciences in comparison to their only receiving 7.2 percent and 6.3 percent of the doctorates in natural and physical science and engineering, respectively. 43 Even for the SBE sciences, however, the overall numbers are small and well below the presence of underrepresented minorities in the general population or the need for this scientifi c talent pool to sustain SBE research and education. Better recruitment and retention of women is also needed at the doctorate degree level in the SBE sciences, especially in certain fi elds and subfi elds. As in science and engineering generally, 44 women earn more than half of all bachelor's degrees in the SBE sciences, but they earn lower proportions of doctoral degrees. In disciplines such as geography, sociology, psychology, and anthropology, women earn more than half of the doctorates, but in economics and political science, women are underrepresented. In 2000, 27 percent of doctorates in economics and 37 percent of those in political science were conferred on women. These proportions are somewhat greater than in the physical sciences but less than in the biological sciences. 45 Within subfi elds, considerable variation also exists. In psychology, for example, women are much more likely to receive PhDs in developmental, school, or clinical psychology than in experimental or cognitive psychology."}, {"section_title": "Impediments and Challenges", "text": "Impediments and challenges include determining where the SBE sciences should be situated in the K-12 curriculum (especially with respect to general science and social studies); developing appropriate curriculum, content, and materials; and focusing on pre-service and in-service teacher preparation. Interest in SBE science education comes at a time when the current emphasis in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 on reading and mathematics coupled with state-based assessment is preoccupying. Also, the absence of the SBE sciences in the National Science Education Standards and in education improvement programs affects the integration and legitimacy of these fi elds.\nKey impediments to enhancing literacy in the SBE sciences and enlarging the pool of individuals attracted to scientifi c careers include the absence of well-defi ned objectives for SBE general education; the complexity of designing courses that meet the needs of majors and non-majors; structural differences that impede the transition from associate to baccalaureatedegree programs; the inertia, inadequate resources, and absence of rewards that limit faculty collaboration on curriculum change; and the overall absence of an explicit plan for researchbased training and mentoring of SBE majors. While the impediments to improving SBE science education at the community college and baccalaureate levels are a varying mix of individual, fi nancial, and institutional factors that depend on specifi c contexts and circumstances, NSF's strong and historic leadership role in supporting the SBE sciences places the Foundation in a unique position to overcome these challenges.\nLongstanding practices and perceptions are the greatest impediments to transforming graduate education in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, including the dominant academic culture and the homogeneity of college and university faculty, limited funds for graduate student training and research, less explicit attention to mentoring and supervised research training than is desirable, and the absence of SBE scientists on most national commissions and committees (e.g., those convened by the NRC or AAAS) charged with improving science education.\nPostdoctoral training and early career development remain underdeveloped in the SBE sciences, absolutely and in comparison with the attention given in the natural sciences, biomedical sciences, and engineering. The fact that research tends to be funded on a small scale where resources are more limited for postdoctoral and junior-level appointments, that there is little of a tradition of providing systematic advice and mentoring beyond the doctorate degree, and that junior scholars get preoccupied with the day-to-day responsibilities of fi rst positions without a structure of support for developmental opportunities creates impediments for SBE scientists' building strong research programs and careers. Also, graduate department faculties tend to know best environments like their own, and thus there is limited exposure of advanced graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, and junior colleagues either to other academic options or to career opportunities in other sectors of employment. NSF resources and support can create the conditions and incentives for investing more heavily in this professional stage.\nCurrently there is a gap between aspiration and implementation in achieving more inclusive education in the SBE sciences. Despite examples of innovation, higher education in the SBE sciences requires reinvention to realize the goal of achieving excellence and inclusiveness for all. Changes that would facilitate the development and training of students and early career professionals of color are similar to those that more generally seem to engender professional growth and development (e.g., increased fi nancial support, better mentoring and guidance, better research training and access to information and networks). Areas that warrant special emphasis include the disparities among school systems in SBE science courses, the need for improved SBE capacity building and faculty development in Historically Black Colleges or Universities, targeted outreach at all levels of education in the SBE sciences to attract students of diverse backgrounds and aspirations, and the persistence of glass ceilings for persons of color and women in all science and engineering specialties.\nThere are serious impediments to the meaningful inclusion of the SBE sciences in the K-12 curriculum. These are typical of the challenges faced in making organizational change in any institution with longstanding practices of behavior, distributed decision making (in this instance, at the federal, state, school district, and school levels), and well-established structures of power and authority over content and resources. 8 A number of challenges are particularly worthy of note: First, there is the challenge of where and how the SBE sciences should be situated in the K-12 curriculum. As areas of science, the SBE sciences fi t logically in the broad science curriculum, and approaches need to be developed to infuse SBE concepts and content. Yet, a well-established history exists of including social and behavioral science content in the social studies curriculum. In general, however, social studies education is not directed to the development of scientifi c reasoning or literacy. Second, because K-12 education is a sequenced process of learning, age-and grade-appropriate materials will need to be developed for the SBE sciences in order to integrate these fi elds effectively into general science courses in elementary or middle schools. The materials and work products developed for SBE courses in high school cannot merely be simplifi ed if they are to be aligned with the cognitive development of younger children. Third, the comparative absence of materials, especially at the elementary school level, adds to the challenge of making change. There is a tremendous need for curriculum products that can enhance SBE science learning. For example, teachers need accessible materials that can help build understanding of the empirical basis of science; the differences between empirical and normative statements; the types of evidence needed for inferring causality; the difference between a concept, a variable, and an indicator; how to work with and think about data; the distinctions between individualistic and social explanations; and the like. The presence of such materials not only would facilitate the integration of the SBE sciences into the general science curriculum but also would enrich learning scientifi c reasoning in the general science curriculum more generally. Fourth, greater attention needs to be paid to how the absence of SBE science content, especially in middle school, abates interest in taking SBE courses in grades 9 to 12, and even affects the availability of such courses. High schools are unlikely to fi eld courses for which students are either not interested or unaware. Thus, the absence of SBE sciences in the general science curriculum has spillover effects on longer-term interest in the SBE sciences. Fifth, there has been insuffi cient focus in the SBE sciences on the content of curricula for the earliest stages of learning and education. Overall, social and behavioral scientists have paid limited attention to science education at the K-12 level and to the ideas, techniques, and understandings that children need to develop and master. Within and across SBE disciplines, scientists and educators face the challenge of addressing the \"what,\" the \"how,\" and the \"when\" of learning in these fi elds. Sixth, there is little teacher preparation in the SBE sciences, perhaps because SBE subjects are not considered to be core educational content. Training, skill development, and the enhanced professional identifi cation of SBE science teachers within the K-12 community should be given high priority. Also, SBE scientists in higher education need to improve their attitudes and outreach to those teaching SBE science at the K-12 level. Seventh, the absence of models for pre-service and in-service training of teachers in the SBE sciences, along with the paucity of support structures to attract and retain quality teachers in these fi elds, makes it diffi cult to introduce and sustain educational change. 9 At the broadest level, the next generations of teachers need to have suffi cient exposure to the SBE sciences so that they can undertake their work with a solid grounding in the social, cultural, political, and economic foundations of education. At a more specialized level, there is the challenge of preparing teachers well trained and conversant in the SBE sciences. Eighth, the current emphasis in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 on reading and mathematics, coupled with state-based assessment and testing of skill profi ciency in these areas, has narrowed the focus on these competencies, seemingly at the expense of other subjects and skill sets. While mathematics and reading could be taught through the lens of other academic subjects or domains, the interest in improving education in the SBE sciences comes at a time when state performance standards and testing tend to constrict the curriculum and encourage teaching to or for the test. Ninth, the National Science Education Standards released by the National Academy of Sciences in 1996 do not explicitly include the SBE sciences and make reference to human factors only from the perspective of a desire to understand individual and social dynamics that affect the conduct of science. 10 The symbolic and real impact of the SBE sciences being invisible in that document makes the effort to integrate and legitimize them far more formidable.\nThe gains to be realized from enhancing public awareness and literacy in the SBE sciences and from enlarging the pool of individuals attracted to scientifi c careers in these fi elds are enormous. 14 In every SBE discipline, there are departments that are successful in educating and training undergraduate students for advanced degrees. Many of these departments, however, still face the challenge of providing majors with skills to enter the labor market. Departments that integrate or offer additional training in research methods and experiences are enhancing students' comprehension of SBE fi elds as sciences as well as students' job-related skills. Departments with large numbers of majors face particular challenges in meeting these goals. 15 Each of the social and behavioral science disciplines prepared reports on the undergraduate major under the auspices of task forces convened by their scholarly associations. These reports provide important guidance to departments that seek to mesh the dual objectives of providing strong liberal arts education and the skills and reasoning consonant with developing scientifi c capacity. See, for example, John C.  Association, 1990). In 2002, a follow-up Task Force of the American Psychological Association (APA) on Undergraduate Psychology Major Competencies issued a report on the Undergraduate Psychology Major Learning Goals and Outcomes that sets forth ten goals and learning outcomes addressed to knowledge, skills, and values consistent with the science and application of psychology and consistent with liberal arts education. See http://www.apa.org/ed/pcue/reports.html. Among the key impediments to realizing those benefi ts are: First is the challenge of designing courses that meet the needs of undergraduate majors, potential majors, and non-majors. The SBE sciences have substantial responsibilities for general education introductory courses and most entering students have little or no background in these fi elds. This situation requires that courses often serve double or triple purposes. Also, limited cooperation among SBE science departments on matters of substance has been an impediment to collaborating on quality SBE general education for non-majors, whether taught within one SBE department or across several departments. Second, the absence of well-defi ned objectives for SBE general education makes it diffi cult to design and sequence lower-level courses for majors. Better articulation of what constitutes quality SBE general education would enrich SBE education in two-year and four-year colleges and the alignment between the two. Third, structural differences between two-and four-year colleges and the diffi culties students encounter in transferring from the former hamper baccalaureate SBE education in colleges and universities. In the absence of well designed articulation agreements between associate-and baccalaureate-degree conferring institutions, confl icts arise over matters large and small, from the way course credits are counted and calculated, to the defi nitions of disciplines, and over such broader questions as defi nitions of the arts, humanities, and sciences. Fourth, an impediment to curriculum transformation for baccalaureate programs in the SBE sciences is that department faculties too seldom work as groups to craft curricula based on learning objectives and a sequencing of courses that refl ect the instructional goals (in concepts and tools) they seek to meet. The inertia of longstanding practices and patterns in academic departments, traditional reward systems that favor individual accomplishment and autonomy, and a lack of information about the processes integral to effective teaching and learning (or indifference to their benefi ts) will continue to limit change in the absence of intentional commitments to do otherwise. Fifth, insuffi cient resources, the absence of institutional signals of support, and pressures on faculty time are real and symbolic impediments to department-wide examination of courses and materials and to the pedagogical changes essential to transforming SBE undergraduate education. At the individual level, there are issues of faculty workload, training, and development. At the department or other institutional level, there are issues of how to make intentional and sustainable change when resources and facilities are often quite limited and faculty-at various career stages, with varying backgrounds, and at different levels of motivation-may need to be convinced that changes are feasible and desirable. Sixth, the overall absence of an explicit plan for research-based training and mentoring limits the quality of the developmental experience for many SBE majors. Though disciplines vary (with psychology incorporating the most research training), research experiences and mentoring typically derive from one-on-one, ad hoc matches between faculty and students-with little department-level consideration of what research experience should be provided to all majors and with the elements of quality mentoring assumed, rather than examined. Seventh, the demands on faculty for quality research experiences can vary within and across disciplines, depending on the nature of the research and the research programs of interest to students or being undertaken by faculty. Projects that require intensive fi eldwork or the design and development of new research instruments can be far more demanding of faculty training and mentoring time than projects where students join laboratory teams when experiments are underway or where students are using extant databases. Eighth, SBE departments have put limited emphasis on examining pedagogical strategies in light of education research and cognitive psychology. Knowledge of how students learn, assessment instruments, and performance are seldom used as tools to evaluate students' progress and determine what works. It is diffi cult to work effectively with students or design sequenced curricula without better knowledge about how to enhance retention of knowledge, improve the integration of knowledge, and promote understanding and combining of concepts. Ninth, foundations, agencies, and other entities allocate insuffi cient funds to enhancing undergraduate education in the SBE sciences. College and university faculty members who are motivated to improve SBE education within or beyond their own disciplines have few or no incentives for devoting time and energy to such efforts within current reward structures, and may in fact encounter real disincentives. They are particularly discouraged by reports that NSF enrichment programs for undergraduate science education exclude (or are told to exclude) the SBE sciences. In sum, the impediments to improving SBE education at the community college and the baccalaureate level are a varying mix of individual, fi nancial, and institutional factors that depend on specifi c contexts and circumstances. For example, challenges to change may vary by available resources and by the scale of a department-in particular, student-faculty ratio and whether master's or doctoral programs are offered. Nevertheless, because of NSF's strong and historic leadership role in supporting the advancement of the SBE sciences, it is in a unique position to help overcome such challenges and impediments.\nAs with other arenas of institutional change, longstanding practices and perceptions create the greatest impediments to transforming graduate education in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Since departments are largely responsible for shaping graduate education, most challenges relate to departments' reinventing themselves as organizational units and linking their approaches to wider considerations in their disciplines or other SBE fi elds. Among the key impediments are the following: First, the challenge of changing the entrenched academic culture and business-as-usual practices is a key impediment to graduate education. Faculties operate with implicit understandings of their disciplines or fi elds and tend not to question these assumptions unless concerns are raised from outside of the department or new opportunities present themselves. Complacency, limited time, an infl exible reward structure, the view that graduate training is primarily for reproducing new faculty much like themselves, and the rarity of departments undertaking faculty-wide initiatives contribute to maintaining the status quo-absent insight, incentive, or leadership. Second, department faculties tend to be much more homogeneous in their backgrounds and views than their student bodies. These differences can affect day-to-day communication between faculty and students and the nature of long-term mentoring relationships. SBE graduate students may have different aspirations and priorities, including training for nonacademic employment. Even students who seek appointments at major research universities may view their relationships with those institutions and their local communities differently from the ways their mentors conceive them. The failure to respectfully accommodate different and varying interests and goals can erode student motivation, identifi cation, and confi dence in the career lines they have chosen and can also limit the quality and breadth of the training provided by faculty. Third, insuffi cient training support for graduate students is a major impediment to effective education. The absence of adequate support affects the quality of students' training, the timeliness of completion of their graduate work, and, under certain circumstances (e.g., family responsibilities), their ability to remain in school. For example, in 2002, approximately 35 percent of graduate students had research assistantships in the natural and physical sciences, compared to only about 15 percent in the SBE sciences. More than 50 percent of SBE graduate students relied on \"other\" forms of support compared to 25 percent of the graduate students in the natural and physical sciences. 21 Also, the National Science Foundation has awarded far fewer graduate fellowships and traineeships in the SBE sciences than in other fi elds of science and engineering. 22 Fourth, limited research funds create an impediment to graduate education and training in SBE fi elds and disciplines. There is a long-term pattern of less federal support for research in absolute dollars and of a net decrease of support for the SBE sciences compared to the natural and physical sciences and engineering. 23 The adequacy of research funding and the quality of training are linked. As wisely pointed out in the 2001 National Research Council report on Trends in Federal Support of Research and Graduate Education, decreased research support in a fi eld affects the supply of researchers directly by reducing the number of research positions and indirectly by signaling to prospective graduate students that some fi elds offer fewer opportunities (p. 5). Fifth, the amount and nature of research and training support can shape how training gets done and how students are exposed to a range of approaches. While the SBE sciences vary within and between fi elds, compared to other sciences, SBE graduate students often work more autonomously and with more limited interaction with their mentors than in fi elds where students are typically part of large-scale laboratories or research teams. Especially because of the relatively limited funds available to the social and behavioral sciences over the last quarter of a century, few SBE faculty and graduate students have experience with research practices that would prepare them for large-scale inquiry or work across disciplines or fi elds. Training is affected when interaction with a large number of scientists is limited and intermittent and when there are fewer opportunities for multiple mentors, including junior and senior peers. Sixth, most science-wide initiatives (commissions, committees, panels) aimed at improving education and training in science do not include or address the SBE sciences. The capacity of such initiatives to contribute meaningfully to rethinking graduate education in the SBE sciences or to sending symbolic signals of the importance of these fi elds erodes quickly in the absence of serious attention.\nFor far too long, SBE scientists have given insuffi cient attention to the role of postdoctoral training and early career development in enhancing research productivity. Although there is variation among the SBE sciences, overall they have moved toward collaboration at a slower rate than the natural and biological sciences, and thus the normative structures of these fi elds tend to support greater independence in scholarly research. 34 Since postdoctoral training almost by defi nition assumes explicit connection to a senior investigator, work group, or team, this mechanism of professional development might be expected to be less prevalent in SBE fi elds. Just as access to funding over time engenders research collaboration in science, so too the presence of fi nancial support can be instrumental in encouraging postdoctoral training. At present, impediments and challenges include the following: First, as already implied, postdoctoral training is most prevalent in large-scale centers or research contexts where the scope of work, including the scope of funding, can support both the research and training of postdoctoral appointees and professional research staffs. Perhaps as a function of far more limited resources than in other fi elds of science, the culture of science in the SBE sciences is typically smaller in scale and premised on more individuated work. Thus, the paucity of large-scale laboratories and centers has limited the venues for employing postdoctoral trainees and developing effective models for doing so. Second, for many new scholars, the pleasure taken at completing the doctorate is quickly overwhelmed by the strains resulting from the increasingly daunting task of building or linking to a research program and establishing an autonomous career. Absent appropriate advisement, new PhDs get caught up in meeting day-to-day responsibilities and too often are not well positioned to plan strategically for their research careers. At a broader level, the comparatively small size of many SBE disciplines, academic departments, and scholarly societies makes it diffi cult to mount programs that can enhance career development for new PhDs. Third, experienced SBE scientists too frequently assume that new scholars are savvy about how to manage and pace their early career efforts. Overall there is limited systematic advice, an absence of assistance in applying for research funding or preparing articles for submission, only modest opportunities for leave during the early career period, and mixed support for special programs designed to assist women and minorities. Too often, the time at which the fi rst sabbatical leave is earned comes too late or at a time when family obligations make it diffi cult for junior faculty members to go on leave. Fourth, graduate department faculties tend to know best environments like their own. The dominant culture of graduate education manifests limited awareness of the nature and conditions of employment in other kinds of academic and non-academic institutions; insuffi cient appreciation of the range of career options available to students completing doctorates; and an absence of deliberate, self-conscious attention to mentoring beyond that required for the completion of the doctoral degree. Moreover, there are few incentives for reshaping the assumptions and expectations of those involved in preparing doctoral students, training postdoctoral fellows, or guiding new scholars. Under the proper conditions and with adequate support and resources, however, these patterns and practices should be amenable to change.\nCurrently there is a gap between aspiration and implementation in achieving more inclusive education in the SBE sciences, with challenges and impediments varying at different levels of education. At the K-12 level, for example, the challenge is to craft and institute SBE programs that reach out to diverse students and prepare teachers for a sector of education where the SBE sciences have had only minimal presence. The initiatives outlined in the K-12 section of this report should be directed explicitly to persons of color, to men and women, and to recent and more experienced scholars to attract them to the challenge of conveying SBE education to children and youth in ways appropriate to their developmental levels. The challenge for postdoctoral and early career preparation is also formidable, more because of the absence of funding than the absence of testable models. While intentional programs for underrepresented minorities do not exist in great numbers, a number of available strategies seem promising for the SBE sciences. Despite examples of innovation, higher education in the SBE sciences requires reinvention to realize the goal of achieving excellence and inclusiveness for all. Some of the strategies considered previously with respect to undergraduate and graduate education and the 43  recommended components of an action plan could ameliorate some of the most serious obstacles to the education of underrepresented minorities and women. Challenges range from the very structure of the curriculum, ad hoc versus department-wide opportunities and planning, and the amount of faculty time devoted to mentoring and advising, to outreach strategies, admissions criteria, the fi t between pedagogy and learning styles, and the amount of student exposure to research training. In addition, there is a need for greater attention to diverse work sector opportunities and to student aspirations and goals. Absent incentives to change and a culture that supports it, faculties and departments can be passive or resistant-seeing change more as taking on new tasks than as transforming old ones. The programs and transformations that would facilitate the development and training of students and early career professionals of color are similar to those that more generally seem to engender professional growth and development. Any differences are more of degree than of kind. Foremost among the needs are more fi nancial support, better mentoring and guidance throughout the education process, improved training in the conduct of SBE sciences, and greater access to professional information and networks. Capacity building in quality and quantity is needed across the SBE sciences, but the need for increased numbers of underrepresented minorities to contribute to the social, behavioral, and economic sciences is especially acute. For underrepresented minorities in particular, challenges appear at the earliest steps on the path to career development and persist beyond doctoral training. Some that warrant special emphasis include: First, at the K-12 level, substantial disparities exist among school systems in access to materials and human resources. SBE science courses are rare even in secondary schools. For example, when Advanced Placement courses are present, they are more likely to be in schools where there are many other AP courses in science. There are also serious challenges to attracting teachers well trained in SBE sciences to K-12 teaching, given that science in these fi elds is less frequently taught by SBE-trained scientists than in other science and engineering fi elds. With fewer teachers trained in SBE sciences in K-12 education and a low proportion of persons of color pursuing advanced degrees in SBE fi elds, the probability of having teachers well tutored in their fi elds serve as positive role models and mentors for students of color is further diminished. Second, insuffi cient attention has been paid to faculty development and capacity building in the SBE sciences in Historically Black Colleges or Universities (HBCUs) and other minority serving institutions. 46 In science generally, but far less so in the SBE sciences, HBCUs have been important pathways into graduate training. Approximately 40 percent or more of bachelor's degrees in the life, mathematical, and physical sciences earned by African Americans were conferred by HBCUs while only about 20 percent of the social science bachelor's degrees were 46 An examination of the participation of HBCU faculty in NSF-funded research in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences is reported in Gregory N. Price, \"National Science Foundation-sponsored Basic Social Science Research at Historically Black Colleges and Universities: Assessment and Implications\" (Paper delivered at the 2004 Annual Convention of the Allied Social Science Associations, San Diego, CA, January 2004). earned at HBCUs. Given the critical role of HBCUs in doctoral degree production, 47 there is need to work with and strengthen the research and student-support infrastructure of SBE departments at these institutions. 48 Third, targeted outreach efforts need to be mounted at all levels of education in the SBE sciences to attract students of diverse backgrounds and aspirations. Outreach to high school students could include summer internship programs, assistance with college applications and SAT preparation, or other strategies that could make the college experience in SBE sciences attractive and attainable. Similarly outreach to HBCUs, community colleges with highly diverse student bodies, and other minority serving institutions is needed to engage students with the rewards of graduate education and training as well as career opportunities. Given the large number of students of color in community colleges, these institutions like the HBCUs are ripe for both faculty development and student training in the SBE sciences. Fourth, is the challenge of broadening the criteria for admissions to college and to graduate school. Barriers to using broader admissions criteria include institutional inertia, confusion about options, and concerns that alternatives will be no better and will take more time. The submission of portfolios by those applying to programs, the weighting of research and other related work experience, an emphasis on written work (including personal statements), and the examination of grades to identify areas of strength and progress over time can be used to complement or even substitute for standardized tests. Fifth, faculty members bring limited experience in working as a group on department-wide activities. While there are overall benefi ts to embracing collective goals, it is particularly important on issues of diversity. How this is done will vary. There is no one-size-fi ts all solution; disciplines and fi elds differ depending on institutional culture and mission. Departments can leverage their human and fi nancial resources if they work more systemically on strategies and plans. Changing the entrenched culture and a traditional reward system that has emphasized autonomous accomplishment requires long-term, sustainable effort. Sixth, effective mentoring and guidance are far too often absent for persons of color and women as SBE students, early career faculty, and mid-career scientists. Limited guidance, information, and support (e.g., on how to map careers, what to study, how to negotiate graduate school, how to land fi rst jobs, and how to prepare proposals and publish) can affect career productivity. In many SBE undergraduate and graduate programs, mentoring relationships are generally left to chance, with current reward structures providing few incentives for improved mentoring. Guidance, feedback, and supervision on substantive work; help in navigating learning environments; support in making transitions (e.g., from non-research institutions to graduate school); advice on  /6/2003Expenditures, FY 1973-2000 balancing education, career, and family; and help in building networks of contacts are essential to professional growth and development, but are rarely provided with enough intentionality to students and junior scholars. Seventh, glass ceilings persist for persons of color and women in all science and engineering specialties whether in the academy, government, research institutions, or industry. This pattern holds true across the SBE disciplines. An NSF Program like ADVANCE seeks to address organizational constraints through its Leadership and Institutional Transformation Awards. The fuller inclusion of the SBE sciences in such funding initiatives could yield better knowledge and models for change."}, {"section_title": "Best Practices", "text": "Some of the SBE disciplines and scholarly associations offer models of what can be done to improve SBE science education at the K-12 level. National committees of economists developed the Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics (1997), and the American Psychological Association developed and approved National Standards for the Teaching of High School Psychology (1999). Anthropology, economics, geography, psychology, and sociology, among others, have produced instructional materials and mounted teacher-training programs. Largely through the efforts of relevant scholarly societies, advanced placement courses are offered in economics, geography, political science, and psychology. An advanced placement sociology course is in development.\nBest practices in SBE undergraduate education emphasize research opportunities and researchrelated activities. Institutional change at the department level has been slow to occur. Exemplary practices include attention to an integrated and sequenced curriculum, methodological training and research experiences, active learning techniques, and quality mentoring. The American Sociological Association's Minority Opportunities through School Transformation Program emphasized department-wide, sustainable change in these areas. The Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) promotes the full integration of the SBE sciences in programs to stimulate undergraduate research and mentoring in all fi elds of science. Efforts like the UCLA Student Research Program provide a context and infrastructure to support student research and mentoring. Summer programs like the American Psychological Association's Summer Science Institute expose undergraduates to the elements of scientifi c inquiry and to research areas, researchers, and a cohort of students with research interests and potential.\nCurrent strategies to improve graduate education in the SBE sciences include programs devised by scholarly societies, academic institutions, various foundations, and combinations of two or three of these stakeholder types. For example, in political science, NSF's support for Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (EITM) is permitting summer training institutes at universities over a fi ve-year span to enhance the capacity of future researchers to link theory and inquiry. In education research, the American Educational Research Association leads two major initiatives with components directed to early graduate career and dissertation training. One of these efforts, funded since 1990 by NSF with contributions from the National Center for Education Statistics, focuses on the use of large-scale education databases in research. The Preparing Future Faculty Initiative (PFF), spearheaded by the Council of Graduate Schools and the Association of American Colleges and Universities, includes the SBE fi elds of communications, political science, psychology, and sociology and partners with universities and two-and four-year colleges in their ambition to train and mentor students in the full range of faculty roles and responsibilities. The Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate, which includes education among six scholarly fi elds, supports multiyear projects and experiments designed to enhance doctoral training and produce training models.\nGovernment agencies, academic institutions, and scholarly societies have supported postdoctoral and early career initiatives directed to the professional development challenges encountered by SBE scientists. Although extant programs are insuffi cient in number and levels of support, they offer examples of mechanisms that could be extended or transported across disciplines or institutions. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have among the most successful programs of support for institutional training and individual fellowships to ensure well trained scientists, including SBE scientists, in areas of health. An NIH award, for example, to the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill supports one-year postdoctoral and predoctoral fellows with an emphasis on research, strong mentoring, and working in a center environment on all aspects of research competencies. Focusing on education research, the American Educational Research Association (AERA) operates an intensive threeyear postdoctoral training program supported by the Institute of Education Sciences in the U.S. Department of Education. Outside of formal postdoctoral programs, there has been only limited attention to early career development of SBE scientists. For example, again from the area of health, the National Institute of Mental Health offers research support for early career transitions. Research societies also aim to do their part largely through professional development courses and workshops. Each summer, the American Psychological Association offers four-day Advanced Training Institutes to provide exposure to advanced technologies and methodologies. While these illustrations point to strategies that are feasible and desirable for the SBE sciences, there is need for sustained investment and evaluation to determine what works well in engendering successful research careers.\nA variety of successful programs have been established that recruit minority students; provide fi nancial support; and enhance skills and opportunities through mentoring, direct training, and networking. Some have long and enviable records of bringing minority scholars into the SBE sciences through a variety of effective mechanisms. In addition, a few innovative programs aim at producing systemic change in academic departments and other organizational units to alter practices overall. These programs are offered through scholarly societies in many instances, by individual academic institutions in other instances, and sometimes by both, often with support from public and private foundations. Notable examples for undergraduates include the American Economic Association's summer institute, operating for some 30 years and now at Duke University partnering with North Carolina A&T State University, and the American Political Science Association's Ralph Bunche Summer Institute also at Duke University and almost two decades old. Similarly longstanding at the graduate level are the Minority Fellowship Programs of the American Psychological Association and the American Sociological Association (ASA) providing predoctoral fellowship training in cooperation with graduate programs. Initiatives directed to systemic change are ASA's Minority Opportunities through School Transformation Program that worked with departments to enhance excellence and inclusiveness in undergraduate and graduate education, and the relatively new initiative of the History of Science Society directed to attracting faculty and students at HBCUs to the history of science as a fi eld of inquiry.\nRelative to the need for improved education in the SBE sciences in K-12 education, best practices are few and far between. Nevertheless, SBE disciplines and national professional associations offer models of what can be done: \u2022 The Council on Anthropology and Education (CAE), which is comprised of more than 800 anthropologists, has produced a series of teaching resources that help to integrate anthropology into the K-12 curriculum. \u2022 In 1992, the American Psychological Association (APA) established an affi liated organization-Teachers of Psychology in Secondary Schools (TOPSS). TOPPS produces unit teaching plans and workshops for teachers, operates national essay contests for high school students in psychology, and undertakes other education-related activities. In 1999, the APA Council of Representatives adopted the APA-approved National Standards for the Teaching of High School Psychology developed under the auspices of APA's Board of Educational Affairs and TOPPS. \u2022 With National Science Foundation funding, the Association of American Geographers developed curriculum materials that met the National Geography Standards for middle-and highschool use. Student activities and interactive CD-ROMs constitute the core of the materials. From these illustrations, it is evident that organizational leadership yields results and that course development must be accompanied by materials development and teacher training. All three components were part of the process by which Advanced Placement courses were established. AP courses themselves are best practices of sorts that enhance high school curricula, directly and indirectly. In the SBE sciences, AP courses are currently offered in psychology, economics, political science, and geography. Sociology is developing a prototype course with the active engagement of high school teachers of sociology. The national professional associations in the SBE sciences have usually led or been major players in bringing about these advances.\nMost of the best practices in SBE undergraduate education to date have emphasized research opportunities and research-related activities. The value of such experiences has been tested over many years with support and leadership from SBE science societies and funding agencies (e.g., through NSF's funding of REU supplements and sites). Institutional change at the department level, however, has been slow to occur despite recognition by a number of disciplines of the need to develop integrated and sequenced curricula, to devote greater attention to methods training and research experiences, to utilize active learning techniques, to incorporate quality mentoring, and to provide a broader spectrum of materials. Illustrative best practices making a difference in SBE undergraduate education include: \u2022 Since 1993, the American Sociological Association has led two major initiatives aimed at transforming undergraduate education through department change. The fi rst initiative, Minority Opportunities through School Transformation (MOST), funded by the Ford Foundation, worked with competitively selected departments on department-wide, sustainable change in terms of curriculum (emphasizing analytic and methodological skills), research training, mentoring, climate, and outreach to enhance the educational experience for all students. The second initiative (Integrating Census Data Analysis into the Curriculum), all students. The second initiative (Integrating Census Data Analysis into the Curriculum), all undertaken with National Science Foundation support, works with cohorts of departments and their faculties on the development of scientifi c reasoning skills by incorporating data analysis throughout the curriculum. \u2022 The Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) is a national membership organization dedicated to promoting undergraduate research and mentoring. Comprised of 380 institutional members (from primarily undergraduate institutions) and over 3,200 individual members (from more than 900 colleges and universities), CUR has promoted the full integration of the social sciences in all of its activities and programs. Explicitly emphasizing the importance of cross-disciplinary exchange, in 2001 CUR expanded its division structure (which also defi nes its governing Council) by adding a Social Sciences Division. Previously, a Psychology Division was the only SBE science division. \u2022 The UCLA Student Research Program (SRP), in tandem with the Undergraduate Research Center for Humanities and Social Science, provides opportunities for students' engagement in research under the guidance of mentors. While the vast majority of SRP students major in the physical and life sciences (82 percent of some 2,500 student annually), a sizable number of SBE students are funded each year, and the existence of the Center sends a strong signal of interest and support to SBE students. Course credit (up to four units for 20 hours per week), an SRP contract between student and mentor, and research-stipends for fi nancially eligible students all help encourage research experiences. The Center provides the infrastructure for supportive activities, including sponsorship of a poster day, assistance to departments in featuring their students' work, an undergraduate research website, an archive of collected data, a student journal, and funds to students to defray the costs of travel to present research papers. \u2022 Since 1996, the American Psychological Association (APA) has offered a nine-day Summer Science Institute. With demand for admission far exceeding available places (32 students are selected from about 500 applications), this APA program focuses on rising sophomores and juniors. While short in duration and not the intensive experience that, for example, REU sites provide, the institute stimulates bonds across a national talent pool of psychology majors, exposes them to interactive discussions about scientifi c inquiry and hands-on laboratory research, and conveys information about career options and graduate training. The APA model illustrates that some gains are possible with limited resources.\nThe SBE sciences have pursued a number of strategies to improve graduate education in their respective fi elds. The mix includes initiatives directed to institutional change as well as national programs of support and training: \u2022 Directed to graduate students and junior faculty in political science, the Center for Basic Research in the Social Sciences at Harvard University is coordinating four summer institutes (at Harvard, the University of Michigan, Duke University, and the University of California-Berkeley) on Empirical Implications of Theoretical Models (EITM). A parallel grant for four summer institutes was also provided to Washington University. With each summer institute being one-month long, this initiative aims to train the next generation of scholars (graduate students and junior scholars) to be better equipped to link theory and empirical work. NSF's support of this project was an outgrowth of a workshop held by the Political Science Program in 2001 on EITM to improve technical-analytic profi ciency. \u2022 The American Educational Research Association (AERA) operates two national programs to enhance the research skills and professional development of graduate students. Funded since 1990 by the National Science Foundation, with contributions from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the AERA Grants Program supports advanced graduate students using large-scale education databases in their dissertation work. 24 Each year, grantees selected from diverse SBE fi elds participate in an intensive conference and receive other professional support. With funding from 1994 to 2004 from the Spencer Foundation, AERA has also operated a Pre-Dissertation Fellowship Program. This program provides a one-year fellowship to doctoral students early in their careers. Drawing from a range of disciplines, awardees have a primary research interest in education. In addition to stipends and travel support, the Fellowship Program includes two training institutes (at the beginning and end of the fellowship year); a mentor from an institution other than the fellow's home site; special activities at the AERA Annual Meeting; and a cohort experience with a national group of scholars in training. \u2022 The Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) initiative is a cooperative effort of 43 doctoral degreegranting institutions and more than 295 partner institutions to enhance the preparation of future faculty in institutions of higher learning. Sponsored by the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) and the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) with support from the National Science Foundation, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the Atlantic Philanthropies, PFF programs provide doctoral students with opportunities to observe and experience faculty responsibilities at a variety of academic institutions with varying missions, diverse student bodies, and different expectations for faculty. The national PFF program (1) establishes a cluster model partnering a doctoral degree-granting institution with one or more community or liberal arts colleges; (2) addresses faculty roles in these institutions, including teaching, research, and service; and (3) establishes a system whereby doctoral students have multiple mentors and receive feedback for teaching and service as well as research. Of the SBE fi elds, communications, political science, psychology, and sociology have participated in the PFF Program. \u2022 The Carnegie Initiative on the Doctorate (CID), funded by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, supports multiyear projects to encourage reexamination of the preparation of doctoral students. The purpose of this program is to encourage and support departments' efforts to more purposefully structure their doctoral programs. The Foundation is working closely with six fi elds of study: chemistry, education (educational psychology and curriculum and instruction), English, history, mathematics, and neuroscience. The aim is to foster conceptual work and design experiments in a small number of selected departments that can enhance these doctoral programs and produce fi ndings that can be disseminated and potentially applied elsewhere. With the exception of education research, no other SBE fi eld is included under the CID guidelines. The approach provides a strategy for reexamination that could be adapted to the needs of the SBE sciences by other funding agencies, including NSF.\nGovernment agencies, private foundations, academic institutions, and scholarly societies have invested in initiatives and activities-large and small-that address some of the professional development and early career challenges encountered by SBE scientists. Although extant programs are insuffi cient in number to meet SBE science needs, they offer examples of mechanisms that could be extended or transported to other institutions or disciplines to improve early career training. The variation in these initiatives speaks to the importance of fl exible and adaptable approaches. All aim to provide positive developmental experiences for junior scholars and have their interests as the focal point. Many of the best known and most successful postdoctoral programs have been funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the National Research Service Act (NRSA) Program. Established by legislation in 1974, the purpose of the NRSA Program is to help ensure that a diverse and highly trained workforce is available to lead efforts to advance the country's biomedical and behavioral research agenda. NRSA is an excellent model of a fl exible funding mechanism. It provides institutional training (T32) grants and individual (F32) fellowships to ensure a continuing supply of well-trained scientists prepared to conduct cutting-edge research. The NIH has used the NRSA Program as the primary means of supporting graduate and postdoctoral research training, including behavioral and social science training related to health and well-being. The fi rst two examples below are supported by NRSA funding: \u2022 Established in 1976, the Program for Research on Black Americans (PRBA), one of several programs in the Research Center for Group Dynamics at the University of Michigan, has been a long-term site for postdoctoral training under the leadership of James S. Jackson. In 1991, PRBA received support from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for a multi-year program to support more than 50 minority postdoctoral scholars for training in substantive and methodological issues related to HIV/AIDS in minority communities. Recently, NIMH allocated support for postdoctoral training related to mental health disparities among racial and ethnic groups. This award provides for ten trainees appointed for two years to participate in training seminars, take advanced statistics and methods coursework, have one-on-one mentoring, meet weekly on progress and experiences, participate in academic writing with appropriate guidance, and engage in professional development activities through conferences and workshops. In addition to these trainees, other postdoctoral fellows from a range of disciplines participate. PRBA postdoctoral training also includes year-long and summer fellows taking coursework and doing research. \u2022 The Carolina Population Center (CPC) at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill operates a program of training for predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows. The postdoctoral trainees hold doctorates in such diverse fi elds as anthropology, sociology, demography, geography, and social statistics. With NRSA support, CPC offers one-year postdoctoral appointments that emphasize preceptorships between postdoctoral scholars and faculty sponsors; a weekly population seminar; research, writing, and proposal preparation; and sessions on research ethics. Scholars are early career fellows-ranging from those directly out of graduate school to those several years into their careers. With NRSA support from the National Institutes of Health, this funding permits intensive support and training to a cohort of scholars each year. \u2022 The American Educational Research Association (AERA) operates a postdoctoral training program funded by the Institute of Education Sciences (IES) in the U.S. Department of Education. While this AERA-IES Grants Program includes mechanisms of support for doctoral dissertation research and small research grants, the cornerstone of the program is a series of three-year postdoctoral fellowships, wherein fellows and their designated mentors work jointly on research problems. Priority is given to research that enhances the educational opportunities of underrepresented minorities in education, focuses on literacy and mathematics, and involves cutting-edge research. The program aims to strengthen the research infrastructure through professional development opportunities that provide fellows with training and research outside of their own specialties or in new analytic or methodological techniques. In addition to fellows' undertaking research, the program fosters strong mentoring relationships and interaction across cohorts of postdoctoral fellows. Fellows and their mentors come from diverse SBE disciplines, yet share a common interest in scientifi c research in education. As a by product of the program, cohorts of mentors also develop skills in working with postdoctoral fellows. \u2022 Outside of formal postdoctoral support, there has been limited attention to initiatives directed to the development of junior scholars early in their careers. The American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) has a fellowship program for newly tenured faculty members (about 20 each year) in the humanities and humanities-related social sciences that provides up to a one-year sabbatical in order to consolidate and extend research. For SBE scientists with specialties in mental health, there is the potential for early career support offered by the National Institute of Mental Health through the Behavioral Science Track Awards for Early Transitions (B/START). Similar programs in the SBE sciences might be desirable to provide research support for junior scholars or funding opportunities for mid-career scholars to change directions or master new technologies. While the SBE Directorate has some earlyand mid-career offerings, they are currently limited to certain programs and modest in scope and level of support. These funding mechanisms deserve consideration. \u2022 Almost all scholarly societies in the SBE sciences include professional development activities as part of their programs. Often associations hold courses or workshops aligned with their annual meetings; sometimes they operate additional institutes or workshops as freestanding initiatives. While scholars at all career stages take these courses, most attendees are advanced graduate students or scholars at early-to mid-career stages. For example, the American Statistical Association (ASA) and the American Psychological Association (APA) have formalized submission and review procedures to identify a roster of half-and full-day courses and also offer continuing education credits that can be especially useful for SBE scientists in non-academic appointments. In addition, the ASA and APA sponsor other developmental activities. For example, each summer, APA holds four-day Advanced Training Institutes to expose psychological scientists to important technologies and methodologies. These illustrations point to postdoctoral and early-career training strategies that are feasible and desirable for the SBE sciences. As with best practices at every educational level, there is need for both sustained investment and also assessment and evaluation to determine what works well in engendering productive and successful research careers.\nA variety of successful programs have been established that recruit minority students; provide them with fi nancial support through stipends and other means; expand their opportunities through mentoring, networking, and other direct methods of training; and in general provide guidance and encouragement at the undergraduate level, through graduate education, and into productive careers. 49 In addition, innovative programs have been established that produce systemic changes in departments and other organizational units, thus improving the quality of education for all students. Some examples of these programs, often initiated by the SBE scientifi c societies, include: \u2022 The American Economic Association (AEA) dedicates talent and resources to enhancing the undergraduate and graduate school experience of underrepresented minorities. With support from NSF, among others, the AEA for more than three decades has operated a summer program for undergraduates with an emphasis on minority scholars and scholarships. Under the auspices of AEA, the Department of Economics at Duke University is currently partnering with North Carolina A&T State University on this program. Also, in 1998, with leadership from the AEA's Committee on the Status of Minorities in the Economics Profession, the AEA commenced the Economics Pipeline Project that provides graduate students of color with an additional mentor to assist and advise at critical junctures throughout students' graduate careers. All participants attend a pipeline workshop each year where they have an opportunity to meet other minority students and their mentors. \u2022 The Ralph Bunche Summer Institute (RBSI) of the American Political Science Association (APSA) is currently supported through the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program. The RBSI is a fi ve-week, intensive program designed to simulate the graduate school experience; provide guidance and mentoring; and expand academic opportunities for African American, Latino/Latina, and Native American students. Starting its eighteenth year, the RBSI has helped talented minority students between their junior and senior years of college prepare for graduate school. The program emphasizes statistical analysis of data, research writing, and analytic skills and addresses career development issues (e.g., preparation for the Graduate Record Examination, meetings with leading scholars). The APSA partners with Duke University in the conduct of this Institute. Participants in the program typically pursue advanced degrees, with more than 50 percent continuing in graduate training in political science. \u2022 The Sociology Department at Texas A&M University conducts a summer training program (Research Experiences for Undergraduates Summer Institute) that operates for eight weeks with ten students. The program offers formal coursework with academic credit, participation in a research project under the supervision of a faculty mentor, a professional socialization seminar, preparation for the Graduate Record Examination, a capstone research presentation at the conclusion of the Institute, and presentation of a paper the following spring (after subsequent work at the student's home site) at the Southwestern Sociological Society meeting. The program has institutional as well as individual ambitions in addition to the specifi c training selected students receive. Faculty members from Texas university affi liated campuses nominate students, with the home mentor committed to providing support during the subsequent academic year. This link to Texas-area regional campuses helps contribute to the training of students more generally at these home institutions. This initiative is also made possible through NSF's REU Program. \u2022 Both the American Sociological Association and the American Psychological Association (APA) have offered national graduate fellowship training programs for underrepresented minorities with support from the National Institutes of Health and, in particular, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). For more than 30 years, these Minority Fellowship Programs (MFPs) have provided a package of support, training, and the opportunity to work with a cohort of Fellows that has produced the leading scientists of color in both disciplines and has greatly benefi ted the disciplines themselves. For example, launched in 1974, the APA's Minority Fellowship Program has supported more than 1,000 trainees at more than 85 different institutions-of whom more than 600 have earned doctoral degrees. About three quarters of the current applicants to the APA's MFP Program are women. The program success rate is excellent: 75 percent of participants graduate within seven years and more than 90 percent graduate within ten years. Most MFP Fellows pursue research and teaching careers. The ASA's MFP Program reports similar results. \u2022 As noted in the Undergraduate Education chapter, the Minority Opportunities Through School Transformation (MOST) Program of the American Sociological Association was an eight-year effort designed to achieve excellence and inclusiveness in education at the department level. Over this period, the program worked intensively with 11 departments (four of which were PhD-conferring and seven of which were BA-conferring) in order to produce intentional and sustainable change. MOST achieved dramatic results. For example, in 1993For example, in -1994, only about one quarter of the courses taught in MOST departments contained diversity content compared to more than 50 percent in 2000-2001. Overall, the percent of graduating minority majors nearly doubled during the program. By 2000-2001, 33 percent of the graduating majors were minorities, with many advancing to graduate study. Departments reported similar results for minority faculty. Although MOST was located in departments of sociology, the goal of the project was to identify strategies, best practices, and approaches to addressing barriers that could be transportable to all SBE sciences and to other fi elds as well. \u2022 The History of Science Society (HSS) is also directing attention to systemic change in educating students of color. HSS is the only scholarly society with a program of activities directed to change at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Working since 2003 with six HBCUs (Howard University, Morgan State University, Bennett College, Morehouse College, Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University), the HSS emphasizes partnering with HBCU faculty and administrators on building curriculum modules for teaching history of science. A key goal is also to involve undergraduates and faculty in projects on the history of science. The HSS aims both to attract faculty and students at HBCUs to the history of science as a fi eld of inquiry and to add to the limited body of knowledge about the history of science at HBCUs."}, {"section_title": "Components of an Action Plan", "text": "A commitment by the National Science Foundation to improve social, behavioral, and economic science education in the K-12 curriculum would send a strong signal to the scientifi c and education communities about the importance of capacity building and the inclusion of the SBE sciences in the \"family\" of science. Much can be done to advance SBE science education within the contours of existing EHR Directorate programs. Also, NSF should invest in innovations at the K-12 level to enhance the presence and quality of SBE education.\nIncreased investments by NSF would make a major difference in improving and transforming SBE undergraduate education. Strategies that make NSF's existing programs much more accessible to the SBE sciences offer the quickest results at the least cost.\nNo effort is more crucial to capacity building in the SBE sciences than NSF's increased involvement in SBE graduate education and training. NSF can play a signifi cant role by supporting initiatives to transform graduate education, create innovative training programs, and attract a wider and more diverse pool of talented students using strategies of the type set forth below.\n\n\nThe National Science Foundation is well situated to lead efforts to improve social, behavioral, and economic science education in the K-12 curriculum. NSF's presence would itself send a signal to the scientifi c and education communities about the importance of including the SBE sciences in the \"family\" of science. Moreover, the sustained funding that only NSF can provide is essential to the development of curricula, materials and products, as well as pre-and in-service training programs. Much can be done to advance SBE science education within the contours of existing NSF programs. The Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) has important programs already in place that could play a key role in improving K-12 SBE science education. Not unexpectedly, the most relevant programs for K-12 SBE science education are in the Division of Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education (ESIE). In addition, the SBE Directorate can collaborate with EHR and invest in strategic innovations at the K-12 level to enhance the presence and quality of SBE education. Existing programs, new opportunities, and immediate action steps are addressed below.\nThese examples point to some of the ways SBE undergraduate education is being enhanced. While funding has been limited in absolute dollars, the National Science Foundation has played a key role in supporting innovative projects. Increased investments would make a major difference in improving and transforming SBE undergraduate education. Among possible strategies, those that build on making existing NSF programs explicitly accessible to the SBE sciences offer the quickest results at the least cost. Extant programs within EHR are particularly ripe for SBE applications, and strategies to encourage submissions should be pursued. Since many of these programs cut across educational levels, they are considered more fully in the chapter on Diversity in SBE Science Education. These initiatives have valuable consequences for capacity building in doctoral training, and thus the overall absence of funding of the SBE sciences is problematic. For example, LSAMP and AGEP seek to enrich the pool of underrepresented minorities pursuing doctoral study and ultimately research careers in science. Such initiatives are essential to the SBE sciences. Whether SBE scientists are being excluded from these programs or whether they are not applying because they believe they do not qualify, the net effect is the same: Opportunities to improve SBE science education are being missed, and efforts to enhance the skills of SBE scientists are not being nurtured.\nTo date, the National Science Foundation has played only a limited role in supporting graduate education in the SBE sciences. The number of Graduate Research Fellowships, albeit critical, is a small proportion of the applicant pool to this program in any one year (about 10 percent) in the SBE and other sciences. Research assistantships have been the primary vehicle for graduate student support, but the overall small size and duration of research grants in the SBE sciences and the stringent success rate for funding make this at best an ancillary approach to graduate student training. Also, as emphasized above, faculty research grants are intended for research and are not per se aimed at training students. Doctoral dissertation research improvement grants-a longstanding mechanism of support in the SBE Directorate-are valuable, though available dollars cover only research expenses related to the dissertation. No effort is more crucial to capacity building in the SBE sciences than NSF's increased involvement in SBE graduate education and training. NSF can play a signifi cant role by supporting initiatives to transform graduate education, create innovative training programs, and attract a wider and more diverse pool of talented students. Promising strategies are set forth below.\n\nPrior chapters of this report offer facets of an action plan appropriate to challenges and opportunities at each educational level. They also emphasize outreach and the importance of attracting and retaining a diverse talent pool in the SBE sciences. This chapter highlights some additional ways to focus NSF strategies and intensify efforts to foster diversity in the SBE sciences."}, {"section_title": "Enhanced SBE Funding through Existing EHR Programs", "text": "Greater attention to the SBE sciences and access of SBE investigators to a number of existing programs in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) could materially advance SBE science education at the K-12 level. For example, a competition to support a Center for Learning and Teaching with a specifi c concentration in the SBE sciences could yield a cadre of professionals prepared to incorporate the SBE sciences in K-12 education. Also, the Instructional Materials Development Program, the Teacher Professional Continuum Program, and the Informal Science Education Program are ripe for proposals from and funding in the SBE sciences."}, {"section_title": "New Opportunities and Initiatives", "text": "The SBE and EHR Directorates should consider establishing a new, integrated initiative to advance education in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences at the high-school level. The SBE and EHR Directorates should also collaborate on a Teacher Training Initiative, and on the establishment of a \"Bridges to SBE Science Education\" Program similar to the joint program between the EHR and the NSF Engineering Directorates. The SBE Directorate should consider establishing a Research Experiences for High Schoolers (REHS) Program similar to the existing Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program.\nCollaboration of the SBE and EHR Directorates on the workshop that led to this report augurs well for continued cooperation on such efforts as a Systemic Reform of SBE Undergraduate Education Initiative to encourage long-term sustainable change, an SBE Educational Innovation Program that would seek to infuse SBE research results and advances into courses and curriculum, and an Undergraduate Faculty Enhancement Initiative that would provide support to institutions to prepare new faculty and retool experienced faculty in pedagogy or methods related to research courses or supervision of students in research.\nThe SBE and EHR Directorates need to collaborate on and invest in new opportunities to educate and train SBE graduate students. Priority consideration should be given to support for a Transformed Grants for SBE Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Program with an increased amount of funding ($25,000 to $30,000) to allow resources to be used for student stipends in addition to direct research costs. Also strongly recommended and worthy of priority consideration are a Transition and Early Career Initiative for Graduate Students, a Graduate Education Reinvention Program that would fund the development and implementation of model training programs, and a Preparing Future SBE Scientists Program that would emphasize research training in non-academic research institutions.\nThe absence of a tradition of postdoctoral and early career support in the SBE sciences commends it as an NSF priority. New initiatives that could make a difference include the EHR and SBE Directorates' collaborating on a Integrative Postdoctoral Research Traineeship (IPRT) Program in the SBE sciences to foster advanced scientifi c skills and address issues that transcend any one discipline, an SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program directed to capacity building for strong research careers, and SBE use of the NSF's Vertical Integration of Research and Education (VIGRE) Awards to encourage innovative training and integration of postdoctoral appointments. Also, worthy of consideration is establishing an SBE Stimulus Package Partnerships Program for Professional Development with scientifi c societies to support small-scale innovations aimed at advancing the professional development of junior scholars.\nNew initiatives to foster diversity in the SBE sciences could further promote a more inclusive talent pool of SBE scientists. Examples include the collaboration of the SBE and EHR Directorates on an SBE Diversity Innovations Program to foster long-term sustainable change in how academic, degree-conferring departments educate students at all levels, and an SBE Launch Awards Program (LAP) for Minority Scholars that would provide underrepresented minorities with a head start in undertaking research and building viable research programs.\n\nCollaboration of SBE and EHR Directorates on a Systemic Reform of SBE Undergraduate Education. This initiative would encourage proposals that seek to implement long-term sustainable change within SBE departments, across departments, or in interaction with centers. Curriculum reexamination, research-based training and mentoring, and the development of innovative materials and tools could all be features of such proposals. The emphasis would be on model programs that can be tested and transported to other institutions. This initiative should incorporate ongoing interaction among funded projects to share and disseminate information on systemic reform (perhaps by convening an annual grantees meeting). Any disciplinary or interdisciplinary program, department, institute, or school seeking to develop appreciation and comprehension of SBE-related sciences by undergraduates should be eligible to apply. Preparing Future Faculty-type projects could usefully be considered under this initiative as long as their strategies seek to produce institutionalized change.\nCollaboration of SBE and EHR Directorates on a Transformed Grants for SBE Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Program. The EHR and SBE Directorates are well situated to mesh their respective experiences with graduate research fellowships and doctoral dissertation improvement grants. Such an initiative would increase the size of these awards and allow the possibility of stipend support as part of a budget request. 26 Currently, depending on the participating SBE program, funding ranges from $5,000 to $12,000, without stipend support. 25 Graduate schools and departments of education could play an important role in training doctoral students in education research and preparing them to teach K-12 teachers in SBE sciences through participating in such programs. 26 Submission and review mechanisms need to be identifi ed for graduate students undertaking doctoral dissertations in SBE fi elds that do not have identifi able disciplinary or interdisciplinary programs in the SBE directorate (e.g., communications, education research, and parts of child development or demography when students are not in doctoral psychology or sociology programs, respectively). In the case of education research, EHR could initiate a doctoral dissertation improvement program to be jointly administered by the SBE and EHR Directorates. A maximum amount of $25,000 to $30,000 for dissertation improvement grants (over a oneto two-year period) is a funding range more in line with the time and costs of undertaking and completing doctoral work (and could include the use of funds for a stipend). This amount approximates the $30,000 that NSF now provides for Graduate Research Fellowships for one year and the $25,000 that the National Institute of Mental Health awards for doctoral dissertation grants for underrepresented minorities.\nCollaboration of SBE and EHR Directorates on an Integrative Postdoctoral Research Traineeship (IPRT) Program. The comparative absence of postdoctoral training in the SBE sciences and the need to foster advanced scientifi c skills to address issues that transcend any one discipline suggests the need for an Integrative Postdoctoral Research Traineeship Program in the SBE sciences. One of the goals of IGERT is to \"catalyze a cultural change\" in graduate education. In the SBE sciences, where postdoctoral training is rare and undervalued, there is a parallel need for a cultural change at this career stage. Following the IGERT model, IPRTs should also be fi ve-year awards submitted by investigators who seek to engage in research and postdoctoral training on important scientifi c themes requiring interdisciplinary innovation. While IPRT funding would focus on postdoctoral fellows, resources from these awards or other funding could appropriately be used to support graduate fellows and undergraduate research interns as part of creating effective research teams and workgroups and providing postdoctoral fellows with direct experience in training other students at different points in their career preparation. IPRTs would have the dual goal of expanding the research skills and capabilities of new PhDs (within two years of degree completion) under the guidance of seasoned mentors and of enhancing fellows' own experiences in training and supervising others. Proposals from research organizations as well as academic institutions and partnerships should be welcome. Problems within the Human and Social Dynamics (HSD) priority area would be especially ripe for IPRT focus. An SBE Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. The National Science Foundation could have a major impact on the scientifi c workforce in the SBE sciences by investing in a program of postdoctoral research fellowships. The imbalance between the large number of scientists who receive PhDs in the SBE sciences and the small number of postdoctoral appointments in these sciences compared to the natural sciences, engineering, and medicine suggests that SBE fi elds would benefi t greatly if new PhDs received advanced training, time for intensive research, and career development guidance in strengthening their skills and establishing research programs. Similar Fellowship Programs are present in other directorates and divisions outside of SBE in areas where capacity building is particularly important (e.g., microbial biology in the Directorate for Biological Sciences). Such a program would aim to identify fellows with strong training and career objectives as well as research plans. While applicants should be close to their PhDs (within two or three years), those in academic positions or with job offers should be encouraged to apply-with their home sites agreeing to stop the tenure clock. Academic and non-academic institutions should be eligible to be host sites. Also, any new initiative should be of suffi cient duration (e.g., a fi ve-to seven-year program) to permit meaningful assessment of the impact of such support on early cohorts of fellows and on the research environments in which they work. Institutions and individuals should be eligible to submit proposals.\nA great deal could be accomplished by ensuring that all existing NSF programs are open to applicants from the SBE sciences and are suffi ciently funded to enhance diversity in SBE fi elds. In addition, new initiatives to foster diversity in the SBE sciences could further promote a more inclusive talent pool of SBE scientists. Examples include: "}, {"section_title": "Immediate Steps", "text": "Three immediate steps to help reshape understandings of the SBE sciences in the K-12 and science communities are: an article co-authored by the Assistant Directors for the EHR and SBE Directorates suitable for Education Week, Science, or a similarly prominent publication stressing the importance of integrating SBE science education into the K-12 curriculum; a request from NSF to the National Research Council's (NRC) Committee on Science Education K-12 (COSE K-12) to include the SBE sciences in the National Science Education Standards; and a request to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to integrate the SBE sciences into its Project 2061.\nThree immediate actions that would advance and call attention to the importance of undergraduate education and training in the SBE sciences are: encouragement of nominations for the NSF Director's Award for Distinguished Teaching Scholars (DTS), convening a workshop of recent REU site grantees and SBE-CCLI grantees to examine their innovations, and a request from the highest levels of NSF leadership to the National Research Council that its Committee on Undergraduate Science Education explicitly include SBE sciences in future workshops and reports as well as in the composition of the committee.\nShort-term actions to improve graduate education in the SBE sciences include modifying the NSF proposal review criteria to include a proposal's effectiveness in advancing graduate student career development; holding a small SBE leadership conference on the 1995 National Academy of Sciences Report, Reshaping the Graduate Education of Scientists and Engineers; providing a venue for a meeting of principal directors and advisory committees working on Carnegie Initiatives, PFF Programs, and other graduate-level programs directed to rethinking graduate education; and commissioning or partnering on a study of SBE graduate education, focusing on the rates and causes of attrition and retention of graduate students in the SBE sciences.\nImmediate steps to improve postdoctoral and early career education in the SBE sciences include enhancing the prominence of existing postdoctoral training opportunities; convening a meeting of key private foundations and federal agencies to identify partners to help make postdoctoral training a more integral part of SBE science education; holding a meeting of key program offi cers and principal investigators involved in SBE postdoctoral programs to help design an SBE postdoctoral initiative and program solicitation; urging extension of the data gathering conducted by the SBE Directorate's Division of Science Resources Statistics to include detailed information on employment choices, research activities and productivity, and career trajectories across sectors of employment of new SBE doctorates; and working with the AAAS to include the SBE sciences in the AAAS Postdoc Network and the electronic career development database.\nHigh priority steps on the part of NSF to augment diversity in the SBE sciences include requesting that the NSF Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering (CEOSE) consider this report and recommendations related to diversity; clarifying how NSF staff can address the NSF goal of Integrating Diversity into NSF Programs, Projects, and Activities in making funding decisions; developing an NSF incentive program that rewards academic departments, centers, and other units in the SBE sciences for achieving substantial increases in the number of underrepresented minorities; funding the compilation of a Manual of Best Practices for Recruiting and Retaining Minority Students in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences; issuing a solicitation for research on minority access to and participation in SBE science education and training; and urging the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to enhance the relevance and utility of its Minority Scientists Network.\nMost of the above recommendations can be readily accommodated within existing or expanded programs. The most serious barrier to the inclusion of SBE science at the K-12 level is the longterm entrenched absence as well as the pervasive confusion and misperception about the place and presence of the SBE sciences in science as a whole. Some immediate steps could help start the process of reshaping understandings in the K-12 and science communities. Examples include: \u2022 Publish an article co-authored by the Assistant Directors for the EHR and SBE Directorates in Education Week or a similar prominent publication on the importance of and opportunities for integrating SBE science education into the K-12 curriculum. A parallel article in a publication like Science or the Chronicle of Higher Education could also be important in changing the mindset of the scientifi c community. \u2022 Request that the National Research Council's Committee on Science Education K-12 (COSE K-12), a standing committee of the Center for Education Standards, revise the National Science Education Standards so that the \"processes of science\" are set forth for SBE sciences (appropriate to grade level) in the same way that they are already specifi ed for physical science, life science, and earth and space science. If this task cannot be integrated into ongoing Phase III work of COSE K-12, it could be done as a supplement to the Standards. Continued NSF funding would help accomplish this task. COSE K-12 might draw on expertise in the NRC's Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education (DBASSE). \u2022 Work with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to integrate the SBE sciences into Project 2061. 11 This project is dedicated to reforming K-12 education nationwide so that all high school graduates are science literate when Halley's Comet returns in 2061. It will take resources to alter the work of this major program (ongoing since 1985the year that Halley's Comet was last visible from earth). NSF could request that AAAS review priorities, products, and ongoing initiatives of Project 2061 and consider short-and long-term strategies and support needs to integrate the social and behavioral sciences into Project 2061. 11 Project 2061 calls for inclusion of the history of science as a fi eld of inquiry, but it does not appear to be given consideration in curriculum materials or learning outcomes. If the history of science were incorporated as a social science, it could provide one vehicle for learning about the SBE sciences. See American Association for the Advancement of Science, Science for All Americans (Washington, DC: American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1989), chapter 13. \n\u2022 Publicize the program announcement for the NSF Director's Award for Distinguished Teaching Scholars (DTS) through outreach to SBE scientifi c societies and to grantees from SBE fi elds in the SBE and EHR Directorates. Encourage nominations of individuals notable for their signifi cant scholarship and their commitment to teaching. The impact on many different audiences of seeing that such awards are conferred on SBE scientists cannot be underestimated. \u2022 Convene a workshop of REU site grantees and SBE-CCLI grantees from fi scal years 2001-2003 to present their innovations (e.g., process, progress, pitfalls); identify commonalities in terms of course, curriculum, and educational practices; and consider strengths, gaps, next steps, and strategies for dissemination and diffusion. Include non-grantees from across the SBE disciplines and fi elds, including in research areas where there are not separately designated SBE programs (e.g., demography, education research, child development). Ensure a dissemination plan to make known promising practices and transportable approaches for improving SBE science education. \u2022 Request that the National Research Council's (NRC) Committee on Undergraduate Science Education explicitly include SBE sciences in future workshops and reports as well as in the composition of the committee.

Disseminate this announcement on the SBE and EHR pages of the NSF website, enlist the help of scientifi c societies and offi ces of sponsored research in its wide distribution, and encourage program offi cers to emphasize postdoctoral training and professional development opportunities in workshops and visits to academic institutions. \u2022 Redirect on a pilot basis some resources dedicated to evaluation contracts within EHR to postdoctoral evaluation programs aimed at both evaluation studies and training SBE postdoctoral fellows (including education researchers) in evaluation research. \u2022 Convene a meeting of key private foundations and federal agencies engaged in the support of SBE research and training initiatives to consider these recommendations and to identify funding partners that might participate in an effort to help make postdoctoral training a more integral part of SBE science education. \u2022 Given the limited number of postdoctoral training programs in the SBE sciences (and given that they are largely health-related), convene a meeting of key program offi cers and principal investigators of postdoctoral programs to build on their operational experience and wisdom to help design an SBE postdoctoral initiative and program solicitation. A new program should pursue those strategies likely to have the broadest possible impact on the SBE sciences as well as on the postdoctoral fellows themselves. Depending on the level of resources that can be mustered, decide whether to solicit institutional proposals from departments, research centers or institutions, or scientifi c societies; whether to entertain individual fellowship applications; or whether to encourage both as done under the National Research Service Act. \u2022 Extend the current statistical programs conducted by the SBE Directorate's Division of Science Resource Studies to gather, summarize, and interpret detailed information on employment choices, research activities and productivity, and career trajectories across sectors of employment of new PhDs.

Division-wide discussion, program offi cer training, or guidance on how best to weigh such factors could help to further transform this NSF-stated goal from principle to practice. \u2022 Develop an NSF incentive program that rewards academic departments, centers, and other units in the SBE sciences for achieving substantial increases in the number of underrepresented minority students, faculty, and researchers over given periods of time. Include in any such program, attention to academic units that partner across academic settings (e.g., initiatives between graduate programs and community colleges, 4-year colleges, and HBCUs). \u2022 Fund the compilation of a Manual of Best Practices for Recruiting and Retaining Minority Students in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences. Identifi cation of commonalities among effective programs in SBE disciplines and in diverse colleges and universities would be helpful in disseminating innovations to other academic units. \u2022 Support research (following a call for proposals) on ways to achieve diversity in the SBE sciences via basic understanding of such issues as how minority and disadvantaged students decide whether to pursue post-secondary education, what affects their selection of majors and their experiences as undergraduates, and the determinants of entry and attrition in graduate school. \u2022 Urge the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to enhance the relevance and utility of its Minority Scientists Network to the SBE sciences.

Other initiatives appropriate for enhanced support for the SBE sciences include the Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) Program and the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Enhancement (STEP) Program. Immediate returns would also be realized through major increases in funding for the Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) Program in the SBE Directorate and in particular for the site awards.\nNSF programs that rank high on potentially offering major returns in improved graduate education in the SBE sciences are the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship Program (IGERT) in the EHR Directorate, the NSF Graduate Teaching Fellows in K-12 Education (GK-12) Program in the EHR Directorate, and the Research Experiences for Graduates (REG) Supplements in the SBE Directorate. Expanded funding and increased access and visibility for these forms of support could have an important impact on SBE graduate students and on how institutions train SBE graduate students.\nOpportunities exist within NSF for program enhancements directed to the SBE sciences. In some instances, there is a need to broaden awareness of EHR or NSF-wide programs and reduce the perception or reality that SBE scientists are not eligible. The NSF-wide Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is an example of an initiative that needs to be more accessible and visible to SBE scientists. With a focus on the integration of research and teaching for junior faculty, these fi ve-year awards could usefully enhance the research and teaching of more SBE scholars than are currently funded under this initiative. Other types of support in the SBE Directorate exist only as small parts of one or a few programs and require much more infusion of funds. For example, the mid-career initiatives in the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program; the Cultural Anthropology Program; and the Law and Social Science Program could be structured into Directorate-wide activities and, with more resources, could make signifi cant gains. The Postdoctoral Fellowships and Small Grants initiative within the Science and Technology Studies Program is another example of a mechanism rarely used and potentially worthy of being instituted Directorate-wide.

The aim of this report is to provide a plan that is practical, feasible, and desirable within the context of NSF's structure, programs, and how the agency works. The report recognizes that strategic actions and implementation take time, but offers guidance on changes that can be introduced in the short-and longer-term. A number of issues critical to effective implementation are presented, including attention to the language used in extant programs and outreach, the commitment of new resources and the reallocation of funds to stimulate and support SBE science education enhancements, and assessment of which new initiatives should have the highest priority for adoption. Also, the report recommends attention to the structural arrangements at NSF to manage and monitor this strategic commitment and calls for immediate and demonstrable progress. Salient cross cutting themes that emerged from the Planning Meeting and the National Workshop and are evident in the report include: \u2022 the need for improved SBE science education at all levels of education. Despite increasing awareness of the importance of social and behavioral science knowledge, the gaps in SBE education remain large-especially at the earlier stages of science learning; \u2022 greater public understanding of the SBE sciences as integral parts of the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) sciences. Public comprehension of the SBE sciences would be greatly advanced by inclusion of the SBE sciences at early stages of science learning; \u2022 the critical leadership role of the National Science Foundation in advancing SBE science education. The National Science Foundation is the sole federal agency charged with advancing the health and well-being of science, including the SBE sciences. Beyond its internal resources, NSF is particularly well situated to support and encourage systemic improvement in SBE science education at all levels of education; \u2022 the need for culture change at NSF regarding SBE science education. Joint support from the SBE and EHR Directorates for a strategic plan for education and training in the SBE sciences can help to ensure that the SBE sciences gain the same level of access, intentional programming, and support as do the other fi elds of science and engineering; \u2022 the value of continuing to strengthen collaboration between the SBE and EHR Directorates. Institutional mechanisms should be devised independent of the rapport that exists between particular incumbent Assistant Directors; for example, cross-appointments to Advisory Committees or the inclusion of SBE scientists on the EHR Advisory Committee and science education experts on the SBE Advisory Committee; \u2022 the need to strengthen communications between NSF and the SBE science community on funding mechanisms to support SBE science education and on relevant NSF's funded projects, and the need also for NSF to facilitate the dissemination of information on best practices; \u2022 the advantages of collaboration between NSF and scientifi c societies and organizations on SBE science education issues. The SBE science societies and general science organizations (e.g., AAAS) offer opportunities for synergy in improving SBE science education; \u2022 the need to improve knowledge regarding education, training, and career trajectories. Research could provide the foundation for crafting strong programs to improve SBE science education; systematic study and evaluation of SBE science education and training programs are also essential; \u2022 increased investments in the social science of science, including research on SBE science education and professional development. Scientifi c research on the practices of science and on science education is essential. Consideration should be given to funding an NSF Center for Research on Innovation and Organizational Change in Academic and Scientifi c Settings. The National Science Foundation's commitment to devise a strategic plan to improve education and training at all education levels in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences is a major step in articulating and emphasizing the need for a cohesive human resource policy. Appropriately implemented, a priority emphasis on SBE science education can contribute substantially to public understanding of these sciences and their capacity to make important new discoveries. "}, {"section_title": "Action Plan Summary", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Need and Challenge for SBE Science Education", "text": "Over the last quarter of a century, the world has undergone rapid change. Almost every aspect of human life is more complex and interdependent. Advances in communications technology alone have changed the content, speed, scope, and ease of how individuals, organizations, institutions, and governments function and relate to each other. Around the globe, people rely on advanced knowledge and knowledge acquisition-whether for improving their health, increasing their prosperity, expanding their capacities, or promoting their security. This knowledge itself is complex. It requires an understanding of the synergy among physical, biological, behavioral, and social phenomena. The implications of this reality are two-fold: First, scientifi c reasoning and inquiry skills need to be more widespread, irrespective of employment sector or social role. Second, major investments in the research enterprise and in pursuing promising ideas are essential to keep pace with society's need for science. No area is more important for public literacy and for knowledge production than the social, behavioral, and economic sciences (SBE). Throughout the history of science, investments in SBE fi elds have lagged behind other sciences. Recent recognition of this gap requires not just more funds for research, but also efforts to build public support for SBE inquiry and the scientifi c talent pool to sustain it. 3 The social, behavioral, and economic sciences contribute substantially to the public good. These fi elds consist of such disciplines and interdisciplinary specialties as anthropology, economics, geography and regional sciences, history of science, law and social science, linguistics, decision and management science, political science, psychology, social psychology, sociology, and statistics, among others. Understanding and employing the knowledge provided by the SBE sciences are fundamental and requisite to sound decisions at the individual, group, societal, and global levels. Citizens and experts, for example, who lack basic grounding in economics will be ill-equipped to make intelligent choices among competing policies regarding budget defi cits and infl ation at the domestic level or about the national balance of trade and globalization at the international level. The SBE sciences contribute penetrating insights into such issues as the causes and consequences of confl ict, how individuals and groups perceive and misperceive hazards, how they understand or misunderstand the risks they run in their daily lives, and how they organize and structure their interactions and transactions. The methods of social science also provide essential tools for rigorously examining human phenomena and unraveling the effects of human and social factors. Individuals and households as well as agencies, fi rms, and governments would make sounder decisions and formulate more effective policies if the rigor in reasoning and in modes of inquiry produced by the SBE sciences were more widely shared. Utilizing this knowledge, however, requires basic competence in the SBE sciences on the part of all citizens. It also requires the advanced education and training of SBE scientists to undertake high-quality research and provide this teaching."}, {"section_title": "Goals and Framework of the Report", "text": "Determining how best to improve education in the social and behavioral sciences is a challenge. Congruent with its mission to advance the state of science and science education, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has committed itself to this task. Under the aegis of the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE) Directorate, and with the active participation of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), NSF seeks (1) to accelerate educational innovation and improve the quality and diversity of social and behavioral science graduates who enter the workforce, and (2) to advance knowledge and understanding of the social and behavioral sciences throughout our citizenry. This report is an outgrowth of that ambition. The purpose of this report is to provide guidance to NSF on the development of a strategic plan for education and training in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences based on extant information and extensive consultation with the scientifi c community. 4 The report offers concrete recommendations to improve education and training in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences at each of four levels of the education process-K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral and early career stages. It aims to identify steps that can make a difference in SBE education in the short-and long-term. 4 The report is undertaken in response to a request from the National Science Foundation for advice and guidance in the development of a strategic plan. Also, the report is relevant to and challenges educational institutions and administrators at each education level and at different types of institutions (e.g., public and private, 4-year colleges and universities; minority serving); scientifi c societies and professional organizations; and SBE academic departments, schools, and research institutes. Nevertheless, the focus of the report is on NSF and how, through its leadership role, extant funding programs, and potential new initiatives (including in partnership with other institutions), it can work to advance education and training in the SBE sciences. The report is written in the form of an action plan. For each level of education, the report presents a brief assessment of the current situation in terms of key needs, impediments and challenges, and illustrative best practices in SBE education. The components of an action plan are then set forth, focusing on (1) NSF educational initiatives especially ripe for a fuller integration of the social and behavioral sciences, 5 (2) initiatives or programs for NSF to consider, and (3) some immediate steps to signal and facilitate change. The report also addresses diversity as a key component in the training of a scientifi cally literate workforce across all levels of the education process."}, {"section_title": "Fit with NSF Priorities", "text": "NSF's interest in greater attention to SBE education and training complements two priorities in the Foundation's fi ve-year strategic plan (FY 2003(FY -2008. First, NSF's Workforce for the 21 st Century initiative aims to deepen understanding of the pathways to scientifi c and engineering (S&E) careers and to ensure both a broad talent pool and excellence in S&E education. A key element of this NSF effort is to prepare a workforce to meet the demands of a technologically and scientifi cally advanced society. Second, NSF has designated Human and Social Dynamics as a key topic for scientifi c attention to address the profound and rapid changes affecting every aspect of daily life. This initiative addresses signifi cant arenas of change-from the demands placed on the human mind to the functioning of complex multi-national organizations that constitute the bedrock of the world economy.

The Directorate decided to pursue planning on this issue concurrent with the launch of the HSD initiative. The Education and Human Resources Directorate, concerned also with improving and broadening human capacity in all fi elds of science, indicated a commitment to work with the SBE Directorate on this challenge. In joining this activity, the EHR Directorate hoped to identify signifi cant opportunities for EHR and SBE collaboration, given the growing recognition of the centrality of the SBE sciences to addressing some of the most pressing issues facing society. As is often the practice within the National Science Foundation, the SBE Directorate took several steps to engage the wider scientifi c community in developing a strategic plan for improving education in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. On January 16, 2003, representatives from approximately 20 social and behavioral science societies attended a Planning Meeting at NSF to discuss the state of education and human resource development in their fi elds and to lay the groundwork for a National Workshop on building scientifi c capacity and increasing public literacy in the SBE sciences. The National Workshop, held on June 12-13, 2003 in Washington, DC, generated the ideas and recommendations that form the basis of this report. To help with the development of a strategic plan, the NSF sought the widest possible guidance. SBE disciplines (e.g., anthropology, economics, psychology, sociology) and interdisciplinary fi elds (e.g., child development, communications, demography, education research) were included whether or not they had identifi able, separate programs in the SBE Directorate. Also, the education community was included at all levels from kindergarten to continuing career development. In addition, NSF determined that it would not itself lead this activity. Accordingly, NSF turned to the authors of this report, through a grant to the American Educational Research Association (AERA), to assist in planning the National Workshop, to direct the Workshop, and to prepare this report."}, {"section_title": "Planning Meeting of Scientifi c Societies", "text": "The January 2003 Planning Meeting convened by the SBE Directorate brought together representatives of scientifi c societies to examine education and training needs in the disciplines and specialties they represent.

All of the participants contributed materials for a briefi ng book that provided useful background for the meeting. This one-day meeting yielded substantive ideas and information and revealed widespread enthusiasm for convening a National Workshop to identify and address systematically needs, opportunities, strategies, and recommendations for building human capacity. Participants agreed that intentional consideration of education and training in the SBE sciences was critical to ensuring an adequate talent pool of researchers. They also agreed on the need for increasing public literacy about the social and behavioral sciences. Meeting participants identifi ed specifi c needs of the social and behavioral sciences at various levels of the education process and highlighted key topics for further attention. Discussion focused on the need to reform curricula from pre-college through higher education, develop innovative approaches and employ new technologies in teaching, emphasize research-based experience and mentoring, enhance teacher training and instruction from K-12 through graduate education, and focus much more on professional development throughout the education process, including at the postdoctoral level and beyond."}, {"section_title": "The National Workshop", "text": "The June 2003 National Workshop on \"Improving Education in the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences: A National Dialogue\" was a fi rst-ever event focused on capacity building in the SBE sciences (see Appendix A). Approximately 120 leading social scientists and educators participated in this \"working\" meeting (see Appendix B). As set forth in the agenda, the fi rst day was designed as a series of plenary sessions with brief presentations and open discussion of the major themes and issues to be addressed in the action plan. The second day consisted of four breakout sessions in which participants engaged in intensive discussions about ongoing programs, innovations, and opportunities at the different stages of education: K-12, two-year and undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral and career development (see Appendix C). From the outset, attendees understood that the meeting was aimed at providing advice and counsel that could form the basis of a plan of action for education and training in the SBE sciences. To prepare for the meeting, participants were provided with readings and data on the topical issues to be considered at the Workshop (including the materials prepared by the scientifi c societies for the January Planning Meeting). The plenary sessions were intended as catalysts for the more focused work that would take place in the breakout sessions. The breakout sessions were structured around the core issues to be addressed in this report. From the vantage of an educational level, each group examined key needs in SBE education and training, best practices that could make a difference, impediments to overcome, extant NSF programs especially ripe for the fuller integration of the social and behavioral sciences, and new initiatives or strategies that should be considered over the short-and long-term. In addition, all groups were asked to address diversity in students, faculty, and the scientifi c workforce. Participants were also encouraged to record their ideas on any issues they thought merited additional consideration. This approach to the Workshop was quite helpful in the preparation of this report. Attendees came from many different disciplines and fi elds, from diverse backgrounds and institutional settings, and with different levels and types of experience. Those assembled were anchored on the task and discussed, debated, and distilled what they knew and thought with remarkable candor and agility. While the Planning Meeting and all of the background materials were very useful, the deliberations at the National Workshop provided the basis for this report.

REU site awards are excellent vehicles for enhancing the participation of students of color in the SBE sciences and in research groups. 3. The Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) Program in the EHR Division of Undergraduate Education offers a key opportunity for expanded support of the SBE sciences. This program area has funded creative work in these sciences. Whether the emphasis is on instructional innovation (e.g., use of Just-in-Time teaching methods in economics), curriculum development (e.g., a two-course sequence building upon active learning in GIS-science education), or materials development (e.g., using DVD technology for samples of real behavior for classroom use), much can be gained from greater investment in improving SBE undergraduate education. Currently, funding in SBE undergraduate education is very limited in the CCLI tracks, depending on the area, with no or few awards directed to the assessment of student achievement. Expanded funding through EHR could add projects in SBE areas where almost nothing currently exists and be directed to working with investigators to scale up projects, institutionalize change, and help map better strategies for SBE education reforms. Especially important would be major and sustained allocations for projects that have considerable potential for transportability and implementation within or across SBE disciplines and fi elds. For example, the current three-year award on Renewing the Undergraduate Curriculum to the Society for American Archaeology, a fi ve-year award for Workshops and Seminars to Improve the Teaching and Learning of Geography in Higher Education, or the previously mentioned three-year award to work with cohorts of sociology departments to integrate data analysis throughout the curriculum all aim to reach large numbers of departments, faculties, and students and to work at national as well as institutional levels. Initiatives of this scope, ambition, and duration can profoundly enhance undergraduate education within and across the SBE sciences."}, {"section_title": "The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Expansion (STEP) Program", "text": "is well suited to meet the challenges of SBE science education. To date, this initiative has not funded projects in the SBE sciences. STEP, however, has considerable potential for expanding the talent pool of individuals (including of persons of color) exposed to scientifi c work in SBE fi elds. The SBE sciences face the problem of late declaring majors. The STEP program offers a solution. High school transition projects (e.g., summer bridge projects), programs that establish undergraduate science community centers with developmental experiences for undergraduates (making the transition from Peer Leader to Pathway Scholar), partnership programs with high schools (especially those with at-risk students), partnership programs between two-and fouryear institutions, mentor-intensive projects, and peer instruction initiatives that increase student engagement as teachers and learners are all promising avenues to better education in the SBE sciences.

With a focus on the integration of research and education, this program seeks to invest in junior faculty with high potential for a lifetime of contributions to both domains. There are far fewer CAREER awards in SBE and EHR than in other NSF Directorates, suggesting that these two Directorates should seek applications and request the additional funds that would need to go with it. (In 2001, there were 397 CAREER awards NSFwide, with 20 in SBE and 8 in EHR; in 2002, there were 392 CAREER awards with 10 in SBE and 11 in EHR; and in 2003, there were 406 CAREER awards with 18 in SBE and 9 in EHR.) These fi ve-year awards are directed to junior faculty or their equivalents in tenure track positions who have the dual ambition of contributing to research and to education.

The Research Opportunity Awards (ROAs) for faculty members at predominately undergraduate institutions is an extant mechanism of NSF support that could enhance the research skills and capacities of SBE scientists. Usually put in place as supplements to NSF research grants at host institutions, ROAs permit eligible applicants to pursue work as visiting scientists for periods ranging from a summer to a year in order to increase their research capabilities and effectiveness and to improve research and teaching at their home institutions. Expanded use of ROAs would ensure that early career SBE scientists at primarily teachingintensive institutions continue to build their research skills, research networks, and programs of research. To widen the opportunities to do this in the SBE sciences, NSF might consider making direct awards to host institutions for applicants with strong rationales for being at a site and with direct awards to host institutions for applicants with strong rationales for being at a site and with direct strong developmental plans involving host scientists, without the requirement that these awards need to supplement extant NSF awards."}, {"section_title": "SBE Vertical Integration of Research and Education (VIGRE) Awards.", "text": "As noted earlier, the SBE sciences still tend to be conducted more by independent individuals than by researchers operating as members of large collaboratories or work groups.

The Program envisions partnerships that could capitalize on the experience of professional associations in the SBE sciences and draw on research and non-profi t organizations as well as majority and minority serving academic institutions. With LSAMP emphasizing the progression of baccalaureate students through graduate careers, SBE proposals that create academic partnerships with other SBE organizations and institutions (including government agencies) could be extremely helpful in attracting students to SBE doctoral training. \u2022 Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) that focus on or explicitly include the SBE sciences should be nurtured and promoted by the Directorate for Education and Human Resources and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences. CREST provides substantial resources to upgrade the capabilities of the most research-productive institutions that serve minorities. Awards that establish or improve SBE research centers at minority serving institutions (through, for example, laboratories, state of the art software and hardware, access to and training at such research or data centers as the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research) should enhance research by scholars, encourage retention of strong scholar-teachers, and advance teaching and training at these institutions. \u2022 The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) seeks to enhance the quality of undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education at HBCUs. With an emphasis on instruction and curriculum, HBCU-UP aims to improve access to and retention in science. Similarly, the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is designed to enhance the quality of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education with emphasis on the leveraged use of information technologies at tribal colleges and universities, and at institutions that serve Alaskan Natives and Hawaiian Natives. Pathways to graduate training in the SBE sciences and the quality of SBE education at HBCUs and TCUs could be advanced if the SBE sciences were more fully integrated into these funding initiatives. As with other fi elds of science, SBE students and faculty in minority-serving institutions are an untapped talent pool for research and teaching. \u2022 The Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professorate (AGEP) Program could also contribute to increasing the participation of underrepresented minorities in the SBE sciences. While there are some exemplary programs that emphasize quality mentoring and training, in the main, the SBE sciences would benefi t from AGEP support, with its emphasis on innovative models of recruiting, mentoring, and retaining doctoral students and its innovative strategies for identifying and supporting underrepresented minorities. Such strategies could include coordination with LSAMP alliances and long-term collaboration on research and research training between doctoral programs and institutions that serve predominantly minority undergraduates. Explicit encouragement to institutions to include the SBE sciences in AGEP proposals and encouragement to the SBE science community to prepare AGEP proposals would strengthen the SBE sciences. Expanded SBE participation in programs of the Human Resources Division in EHR is critical to widening and diversifying outreach in the SBE sciences. The rarity of the SBE sciences supported by these funding initiatives suggests the need for explicit language in solicitations that alerts applicants to the fact that the STEM sciences include the SBE sciences. It also suggests a need for dedicated or supplemental funding for competitive projects that develop SBE components as part of institution-wide initiatives. Program Directors in EHR and SBE are at the fore of communication with applicants and can exert effective leadership in making these possibilities known. 2. Programs Directed to Women and Girls need to include SBE Sciences. The larger proportion of women in the SBE sciences than in the STEM sciences generally does not diminish the need for initiatives to attract, train, and enable the career paths of SBE women scientists. As pointed out previously, there is considerable variation across SBE disciplines and within fi elds in the number of women scientists and in their roles. The HRD Program in Gender Diversity in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education is ripe for projects, information dissemination, and research that focus on or include the SBE sciences. Such initiatives as MentorNet could usefully be extended to the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. More initiatives would be desirable like the University of Michigan's demonstration project on Girls Exploring Mathematics through Social Science, which strengthens middle school girls' interest in the social and behavioral sciences while simultaneously enhancing their mathematical skills. Also, NSF-wide programs such as the Advance Program should more intentionally include SBE women scientists in competitions for Fellows Awards, Leadership Awards, and Institutional Transformation Awards.

The National Science Foundation and in particular the leadership of the SBE Directorate determined that the need for a scientifi cally literate public and a robust talent pool of SBE scientists warrants engaging in this task. At one level, the action plan is ambitious in setting forth substantial ideas meriting resources within existing programs and new initiatives. There is a great deal that NSF can and should do in terms of SBE science education and training. At another level, the report is realistic in so far as it systematically examines needs and analyzes what can be done in the shortand longer-term to enhance support for the SBE sciences within the contours of extant programs and new initiatives. What does this mean for NSF in terms of priority setting? In education and training programs within EHR or NSF-wide, where initiatives exist but have not been suffi ciently inclusive of the SBE sciences, intentional steps to realign priorities are urgent and necessary. The plan also provides the SBE and EHR Directorates with analysis and recommendations that should form the basis for enhanced funding of existing initiatives and support of new programs. In moving from report and action plan to priority setting, there are a number of implementation issues that require attention. These include: how the language of extant programs and outreach needs to be changed; how funds need to be committed, dedicated, or reallocated to stimulate and support SBE education enhancements; which programs at each level are most ripe for immediate transformation and likely to produce the highest immediate return on investment; which new initiatives have the highest potential for adoption; what indicators of performance (for enhanced attention to SBE science education and training) can be specifi ed and in what timeframe; and what structural arrangements need to be put in place to manage and monitor this strategic commitment. In 2003, the National Science Foundation challenged itself to examine how best to invest in education and training in the SBE sciences. Embedded in this ambition was recognition that \"business as usual\" practices in NSF's levels and forms of support would need to change. While institutional transformation is not easy (as this report makes clear), the momentum initiated by NSF in 2003 augurs well for how the Foundation can effectively use this report and action plan."}, {"section_title": "Cross-Cutting Themes", "text": "Beyond the specifi c plan of action set forth in this report, the meetings and deliberations identifi ed a number of salient cross-cutting themes:"}, {"section_title": "The Need for Improved SBE Science Education at All Levels of Education", "text": "Improved SBE science education is urgently needed at all education levels in the United States. Globalization; the complex leadership role that the United States plays; and the increasing awareness that behavioral, economic, political, and social relationships are central to sound policy and societal well-being have led to greater appreciation and demand for knowledge from the SBE sciences. Public offi cials need social and behavioral science insights if they are to chart a wise course, whether with respect to the education of our citizenry or the strategic decisions involved in dealing with the international community. Private entrepreneurs need social and behavioral science insights if they are to succeed or even survive in the fi ercely competitive global marketplace. Citizens need social and behavioral science insights if they are to understand domestic and international policy choices, be effective consumers of public information, and make personal and professional decisions based on what is known about human interactions and organizations.

The SBE sciences can point to genuine progress at the National Science Foundation and in other institutions central to understanding the texture and scope of this scientifi c enterprise. Nevertheless, the NSF has a continuing opportunity to foster a more complete acceptance of the SBE sciences in the \"family of science.\" No place is more ripe for building this awareness than in science education itself and, in particular, in K-12 education, where the SBE sciences are conspicuously absent from introductory materials on the nature of science and the identifi cation of phenomena that are amenable to scientifi c analysis. Public comprehension of the SBE sciences would be greatly advanced by inclusion of the SBE sciences at early stages of science learning. 52 52 Full inclusion of the SBE sciences will take sustained leadership and rethinking from the science and education communities.

Therefore, the Foundation's commitment to identifying and taking strategic steps to advance education in the SBE sciences is of major signifi cance. Beyond its own programs, NSF is particularly well situated to support and encourage systemic improvement in SBE science education at all levels of education. An expanded presence in the secondary school curricula, for example, is critical to making students aware of the existence and fascination of SBE science. Students can hardly be expected to select career options when they are unaware that they exist.

The new NSF-wide competition on Human and Social Dynamics-the fi rst ever where the entire scientifi c enterprise is studying phenomena grounded in social processes-is another. The initiation of this exercise on SBE science education, with the active participation of the EHR Directorate, is a further indicator that the culture of science at NSF is amenable to change. Joint support from the SBE and EHR Directorates for a strategic plan for education and training in the SBE sciences will further affi rm NSF's commitment to improving SBE science education in the short-and long-term. It will send a loud and clear signal that the integration of science and education should be a priority and not an afterthought. It will also signal that education in the SBE sciences requires the same level of intentional programming and support as in other fi elds of science. In the past, the SBE sciences were not eligible for support from some NSF education and training programs. Because ambiguities regarding eligibility pervade the SBE research community and were explicitly (and frequently) expressed at the National Workshop, clarifi cation is necessary to ensure that SBE proposals are welcome independently or as components of institution-wide projects. Long-term patterns and practices can be hard to transcend without affi rmative messages; full participation of the SBE sciences in all relevant NSF programs will require explicit encouragement."}, {"section_title": "Strengthening Collaborative Ties Between the SBE and EHR Directorates", "text": "The gains made over the last several years in communication, coordination, and rapport between the SBE and EHR Directorates are laudable. The full participation in and commitment of the EHR Directorate to this SBE-initiated activity are visible and welcome signs of the potential for further collaboration between these two Directorates. Because Assistant Directors (ADs) currently serve fi xed terms, institutional mechanisms should be devised independent of the rapport that exists between particular incumbents. One step would be to institute a joint staff implementation committee that reports directly to the ADs; another is to institute cross appointments between the EHR and SBE Advisory Committees. Appointing an expert or experts in science education to the SBE Advisory Committee and SBE scientists to the EHR Advisory Committee, with perhaps at least one individual serving on both advisory committees, would help to ensure that educational implications are kept in mind during SBE Directorate policy discussions, and that the SBE sciences are not overlooked during the formulation and review of EHR policies and programs. In contexts where it would be productive to do so, cross appointments between EHR and SBE proposal review panels might also be considered."}, {"section_title": "Strengthening Communication with the SBE Science Community", "text": "The importance of communication was a theme that emerged during the Planning Meeting and the National Workshop. The research community would benefi t from knowing more about funding mechanisms available through NSF and about the results of projects that have been funded. Participants also thought that NSF would benefi t from continued interaction with SBE scientists. A number of the recommendations speak to recognizing and publicizing best practices in SBE science education at all levels. NSF could use its website or other media to highlight model initiatives that might be adopted or modifi ed for use by others."}, {"section_title": "Working with Scientifi c Societies and Organizations", "text": "Tremendous advantages would result from collaboration between NSF and scientifi c societies in promoting education and training at all levels in the SBE sciences. High priority should be given to working with other organizations, especially the relevant scholarly societies, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The elected offi cers and the professional staffs of social, behavioral, and economic science societies can offer useful expertise and deep commitment to education and training. They can also provide powerful links between NSF and relevant research communities. Many associations have effective, long-standing programs devoted to producing curriculum materials, enhancing the teaching of their subjects, and training students. The American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Academy of Sciences have fi elded multiple committees, commissions, and programs focused on science education. Unfortunately, the social and behavioral sciences are far more conspicuous by their absence than by their participation in AAAS and NAS efforts to improve science education. Given the number of other areas of successful integration of the SBE sciences in the work and programs of the AAAS and the NAS, this pattern of under-inclusion on issues of science education should, with the right points of contact and encouragement, be amenable to transformation and change."}, {"section_title": "Bringing Research and Evaluation To Bear", "text": "As might be expected in a national workshop of participants with research backgrounds, commitment ran high for better data and greater knowledge about education, training, career trajectories, and the processes that sort and select persons into, through, or out of scientifi c careers. More investment in scientifi c research on these and other issues was considered to be important to understanding scientifi c careers and professions and the role of educational processes and systems in that regard. In addition to a general call for more research, which itself is of merit, there was a parallel call for systematic study and evaluation of education and training programs. There was pervasive agreement that, whatever programs NSF alters or establishes in response to the need to improve SBE science education, they should contain mechanisms for evaluation. The funds earmarked for evaluation within each project should be appropriate to the individual goals, methods, and expected outcomes from that effort. But no project intended to yield specifi c and measurable improvements in SBE science education should miss the benefi ts that derives from built-in evaluation for both project improvement and for helping to shape and refi ne future investments for the fi eld."}, {"section_title": "Elevating the Social Science of Science Education", "text": "The call for research noted above raises more fundamentally the need to encourage greater investment in the social science of science, including on issues of education and professional development. This important arena of scholarship could benefi t from more resources and a broader mandate to widen its scope to explicitly include the SBE sciences. While charting a research agenda is beyond the scope of this report, just as education needs to be connected to science, so too does science need to be a central part of sound science education. This theme was emphasized at the National Workshop. In refl ecting on the need for research and data, workshop participants saw the concept of a center dedicated to the study of academic and scientifi c systems and institutions to be very promising. An NSF Center for Research on Innovation and Organizational Change in Academic and Scientifi c Settings could be appropriately supported within the scope of the Human and Social Dynamics Initiative. Widespread systemic change in SBE science education at all levels would benefi t from a deeper understanding of how change has been and can be accomplished in academic and scientifi c settings. Funding a National Center for Research on Innovation and Organization Change in schools, colleges, and universities and in research contexts would signal the Foundation's long-term and continuing commitment to understanding the functioning and role of academic systems and building knowledge-based recommendations for change. Such a center could command the interest and support of all NSF disciplines and directorates, the education community, scholarly societies, and such major institutions as AAAS and NAS. Establishing such a center and coordinating its efforts should yield the knowledge, strategies, and tactics needed to improve education and training in all science."}, {"section_title": "Final Thought", "text": "This report concludes with a note of optimism for what the National Science Foundation has achieved by mandating this exercise and by seeking to devise a strategic plan for the improvement of education and training in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. NSF's next steps can have a major impact on SBE science and training, as we have known it. In fi ve, ten, and twenty years from now, the public's capacity to understand the SBE sciences and the capacity of the SBE scientifi c community to contribute new and important discoveries will, we believe, be traced to NSF's seizing the opportunity to commit itself to this important educational mission and goal. June 12-13, 2003"}, {"section_title": "Breakout Session Strategy and Work Plan", "text": "The purpose of the breakout sessions is to generate ideas and recommendations that can be incorporated into a report to the National Science Foundation on a plan of action to improve education and training in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Thursday's plenary sessions will put numerous ideas and proposals on the table. The Friday breakout sessions are intended to draw upon the expertise of all participants in developing substantive recommendations and plans for NSF. Come prepared to share ideas, work hard, and write effectively on Friday! Participants will be divided into four groups at the end of the plenary sessions on Thursday and will meet from 5:15 to 6:00 p.m. to get acquainted and lay out strategies. Most of Friday will be devoted to breakout group deliberations. At the end of the day on Friday, each breakout group will present a fi fteen-minute report in a plenary session. The groups will be organized around the four educational levels that structure the workshop: All breakout groups should address ways to increase diversity at all levels of the educational process. Also, each group is encouraged to address issues of alignment across educational levels. Each breakout group will have a designated leader to moderate and guide discussion. We have provided a set of questions to structure each group's deliberations and report (see attached). This outline captures what we believe to be the key components of a plan of action and recommendations to be prepared for NSF. We ask that each group address the seven topics included in the attached generic outline. Each of these topics can be addressed from the vantage of initiatives directed to students, curricula, faculty, and organizational units (e.g., departments). We encourage consideration of these different vantages. Each group will have a designated reporter who will be provided with a laptop. He or she should capture the group's discussion of the seven outline topics in the form of narrative text and recommendations. This material will be the basis for the reporter's brief comments Friday afternoon. More important, these documents are vital to the preparation of the fi nal report to the NSF."}]
