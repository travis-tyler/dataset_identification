Global cognition was higher in MA carriers, which was found to be mediated by A\u03b2.\nDemographics and general information of the ADNI and Rush-ROS/MAP cohorts are presented in table 1. After imaging and genetic quality control, a total of 338 ADNI participants were studied, including 186 CN, 105 single-or multiple-domain amnestic MCI, and 47 AD. A total of 738 Rush-ROS/MAP participants were analyzed, including 301 CN, 179 amnestic MCI, and 258 AD. As expected, in both cohorts, CN individuals had higher MMSE scores and fewer were APOE-e4 carriers as compared to both MCI and AD. There was no difference in sex or years of formal education between diagnostic groups in both cohorts (details are provided in table e-2, http://links.lww.com/NXG/A19). Findings with brain imaging are corroborated by CSF data in the ADNI cohort Because of the well-known relationship between brain and CSF levels of A\u03b2, we tested the association between rs4388808 and CSF A\u03b2. Because not all participants in the ADNI sample had CSF data, we performed the analysis in a subset of 260 individuals. As expected, MA carriers presented more CSF A\u03b2 than noncarriers (t = 2.94; p = 0.003) (figure 2B). The CYP2C19 polymorphism was associated with the A\u03b2/p-tau ratio (t = 2.29; p = 0.02), and higher ratios were found in carriers of rs4388808 G ( figure 2C ). No association was found using p-tau as a single outcome measure (t = \u22121.24; p = 0.21).\nAssociation between the CYP2C19 polymorphism and A\u03b2 is exclusive to the A\u03b2 brain levels in the ADNI cohort To examine whether the CYP2C19 polymorphism is also associated with A\u03b2 levels outside the brain, we tested the association of rs4388808 with plasmatic levels of A\u03b2 in a subsample of 113 participants. We did not find an association between the SNP and free (t = \u22120.60; p = 0.54) or total (t = 0.49; p = 0.62) plasmatic A\u03b2 1-42 levels ( figure 2D ), indicating that the findings reported above are specific to the CNS.\nResults from the ADNI cohort were generalized to the Rush-ROS/MAP cohort We next generalized the findings to postmortem indices of the A\u03b2 load and to neurofibrillary tangles in Rush-ROS/MAP cohorts. From the 8 brain regions where the A\u03b2 load was measured, we selected 6 regions (angular gyrus, anterior cingulate, entorhinal cortex, and mesial and inferior temporal cortices) and calculated an average per subject. These 6 regions were chosen to match with the brain areas where we detected differences between genotype groups in the voxel-wise analysis. When testing the association between the average of the A\u03b2 load and the CYP2C19 polymorphism, we found that rs4388808 G (MAF = 0.15) carriers had a lower A\u03b2 load than noncarriers (t = \u22122.15; p = 0.03) (figure 2E), consistent with findings from the ADNI cohort. The difference between rs4388808 G carriers and noncarriers in PHF tau tangle density did not reach statistical significance (t = \u22121.65; p = 0.09).\nMA carriers of the CYP2C19 polymorphism had better cognitive performance than noncarriers in both cohorts To examine whether the CYP2C19 polymorphism affects the cognitive performance, we used composite measures of global cognition as the outcome in linear regression models. In the ADNI cohort, there was a clear tendency to an association with the CYP2C19 polymorphism (t = 1.92; p = 0.05) (figure 2F), while in Rush-ROS/MAP cohorts, the association was such that rs4388808 G carriers had a higher cognition than noncarriers (t = 2.08; p = 0.03) ( figure 2G ).\nThe effect of the CYP2C19 polymorphism on cognition is mediated by A\u03b2 A mediation analysis was used to determine whether the CYP2C19 polymorphism was directly or indirectly associated with cognitive performance. We retested the association between the CYP2C19 polymorphism and cognition, but now adding the measures of [ Association between rs4388808 and gene expression of CYP2C19 suggests that the SNP is functional To check whether the polymorphism has an effect in the gene expression, we tested the association between rs4388808 and CYP2C19 RNA levels. In the ADNI cohort, with 304 participants for this analysis, we found a cis eQTL such that MA carriers displayed higher RNA levels in the blood (t = 2.38; p = 0.01) (figure 2H). In Rush-ROS/MAP cohorts, very low levels of CYP2C19 expression were detected in postmortem brains, and the data did not provide consistent results (data not shown) as found in the blood expression data from the ADNI."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Together, these findings point to an association between CYP2C19 polymorphism and A\u03b2 pathology, suggesting a protective effect of the MA of rs4388808.

Besides metabolizing drugs, brain CYPs are also involved in the modulation of blood flow, metabolism of fatty acids, cholesterol, and neurotransmitters, and mobilization of intracellular calcium, [1] [2] [3] all pathways that have been somehow linked to AD and/or amyloid metabolism. In addition, studies have shown that CYP proteins and their genetic variants are associated with the brain immune response 2 and neurodegenerative diseases. 2, 4, 5 Although previous evidence shows CYP expression in areas affected by AD such as the amygdala, frontal and temporal cortices, and the hippocampus, 6, 7 there are only a few reports documenting a link between CYPs and AD pathophysiology. In one study, the overexpression of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) on the Tg2576 mice model was associated with elevated CYP hepatic function, while their renal counterparts were depressed. 8 In addition, another study presented evidence that A\u03b2 stimulates NADPHcytochrome P450 reductase (POR), a CYP inducer, in APP transgenic mice and human AD brains, which may affect the redox status. 9 In line with the evidence that A\u03b2 can stimulate metabolic cascades in a similar fashion as foreign compounds, 9, 10 and knowing that brain CYP could potentially affect amyloid metabolism also through other mechanisms, we tested the hypothesis that variants in CYP genes could be associated with A\u03b2 and, consequently, have an impact in cognitive performance. We examined the association of CYP variants with biomarkers of A\u03b2 load in vivo and postmortem, as further specified."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study participants", "text": "Discovery analysis data were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). For this study, cognitively normal (CN) individuals had a Mini-Mental State examination (MMSE) score of 24 or higher and a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0. The operational criteria adopted for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were participants who had an MMSE score equal to or greater than 24, a CDR of 0.5, subjective memory concern, objective memory loss measured by educationadjusted scores on delayed recall of 1 paragraph from Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II (\u226516 years: \u22648; 8-15 years: \u22644; and 0-7 years: \u22642), and essentially normal activities of daily living. Participants with AD were individuals with an MMSE score lower or equal to 26, CDR higher than 0.5, who met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD. All individuals had absence of any other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ADNI inclusion/exclusion criteria are described in detail at adni-info.org.\nOur report also used data from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), 2 longitudinal clinical pathologic cohort studies of aging and dementia. 11, 12 All participants enrolled without known dementia and agreed to annual clinical and neuropsychological assessments and brain donations after death. The clinical diagnosis of dementia and AD followed the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association recommendations. The MCI diagnosis is given to participants who were rated as impaired based on MMSE and on the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropsychological measures but who were not found to have dementia by the examining neurologist. Our study includes only MCI participants with 1 impaired domain and no other cause of cognitive impairment. Notably, the studies are conducted by the same team of investigators and share a large common core of testing batteries, which allow for combined analyses.\nThe discovery sample consisted of a subset of ADNI participants who had [ 18 F]florbetapir PET, genetic data, and CSF data available. The findings obtained with the discovery sample were then generalized to the Rush-ROS/MAP participants who died at age 90 years or younger.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents This secondary analysis study followed all institutional review board regulations, which are detailed in the supplementary methods.\nGlossary AA = arachidonic acid; A\u03b2 = amyloid-\u03b2; AD = Alzheimer disease; ADNI = AD Neuroimaging Initiative; APP = amyloid precursor protein; CDR = clinical dementia rating; CN = cognitively normal; CYP = cytochrome P450; EET = epoxyeicosatrienoic acid; LD = linkage disequilibrium; MA = minor allele; MAF = minor allele frequency; MAP = Memory and Aging Project; MCI = mild cognitive impairment; MMSE = Mini-Mental State Examination; PHF = paired helical filament; ptau = phosphorylated tau; ROS = Religious Orders Study; SNP = single nucleotide polymorphism; SUVR = standardized uptake value ratio.\nPhenotypes From the ADNI, we obtained demographics, neurocognitive scores, CSF, and plasmatic data available after passing rigorous quality control. The preprocessed imaging and genetic data underwent additional processing and quality control before the statistical analysis in our study as described below. From Rush, all the data used in this project to perform statistical analyses were already processed and quality controlled with very rigorous criteria.\nIn the ADNI cohort, the brain A\u03b2 load was estimated using the [ 18 F]florbetapir PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR, details are provided in figure 1 and e-methods) . Separately, A\u03b2 and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) levels were measured in the CSF and plasma. These data were obtained by the Biomarkers Consortium CSF, and the description of the methodology regarding the sample acquisition, processing, and analysis is available at the ADNI website (adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/biospecimen-data/).\nIn the Rush-ROS/MAP cohort, postmortem data of the A\u03b2 load and paired helical filament (PHF) tau tangle density were obtained from 8 brain regions using immunohistochemistry. 13 Cognitive function was evaluated in both the ADNI and Rush-ROS/MAP. For the ADNI, the global cognition scores were developed by making a z-score of the sum of the memory and the executive function composite scores. In the Rush-ROS/ MAP, the global cognitive scores were based on 17 cognitive performance tests, and we included only participants who underwent autopsies; thus, the last valid cognitive score proximate to death was used for this analysis (for further details, see e-Methods, http://links.lww.com/NXG/A20).\nWe used gene expression data to examine cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). For the ADNI, total RNA was obtained from the peripheral blood-at the same visit when the imaging data were obtained-and, after quality control, was hybridized to the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 array plate as described. 14 The normalized and quality-controlled expression data 14 were used. For the Rush-ROS/MAP, RNA was extracted from the gray matter of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex blocks using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) and the RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen). These samples were quantified and qualified as described 15 and then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq with 101 bp paired-end reads. The normalized and quality-controlled expression data were used. In both analyses, the RNA integrity measurement was used as a covariate. Genotyping, imputation, and gene selection We interrogated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the CYP genes of the 5-probably-most important metabolizers: CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP1A2, and CYP2C19. 3, [16] [17] [18] Methods involved in DNA processing are detailed in the supplementary methods section (http://links. lww.com/NXG/A20). Using PLINK, 19 the SNPs within these genes were recoded based on the dominant model with respect to the MAs, and the ones in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r 2 > 0.8) were removed from the analysis to avoid unnecessary testing. A total of 28 SNPs were used in the initial step of the association analysis.\nFor Rush-ROS/MAP cohorts, DNA was extracted, genotyped, imputed, and quality controlled according to the procedures described in e-Methods (http://links.lww.com/NXG/A20)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "The statistical tests were performed in R statistical software, 20 where linear regression models were used to test the association between the genotypes and the phenotypes in both cohorts, separately. All statistical models included the covariates of age, sex, and APOE-e4 carriage status, except for the models in which global cognition was the outcome measure, where the APOE-e4 status was replaced by years of education. The initial analysis-using the global [ 18 F]florbetapir SUVR as a phenotype-was performed to interrogate a total of 28 SNPs (table e-1, http://links.lww.com/NXG/A19). To correct for multiple testing, the statistical significance of the SNP discovery was set at p < 0.0017 using a Bonferroni correction for 28 tests and a type I error \u03b1 = 0.05. The significant SNPs were further tested for associations with other phenotypes in ADNI and Rush-ROS/MAP cohorts. To test for group differences in the diagnostic status, we added diagnosis as a covariate in the regression models and also tested the interaction between the diagnostic status and desired independent variable. Effect size calculations (Cohen d) were also used.\nA voxel-based analysis was performed using the RMINC imaging tool, 21 where parametric images were obtained contrasting the [ 18 F]florbetapir SUVR between the genotype groups of the SNP found in the discovery analysis.

To test this hypothesis, first, the association of CYP SNPs with global cognitive performance was evaluated using linear regression models. Then, if the association was significant, the measure of A\u03b2 was added to this model to check whether the SNP associations with cognition were attenuated because of A\u03b2."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In the present study, we found an association between the CYP2C19 polymorphism and A\u03b2 burden across the spectrum of AD, in which carriers of rs4388808 G presented a less A\u03b2 load and downstream cognitive impairment. This association was initially detected using the [ (10) 17 (5) 87 (11) 52 (7) 63 ( analysis suggests that the benefic effects of the polymorphism are larger in APOE-e4 carriers, as compared to noncarriers or the whole sample, in which the effect is similar to what has been described for a BCHE gene polymorphism. 22 Subsequently, this association was generalized to postmortem data from the Rush-ROS/MAP cohort. Finally, both cohorts showed a protective association between the MA of CYP2C19 and cognition. It is important that subsequent mediation analysis suggested that the effects of CYP2C19 on cognition were mediated by A\u03b2.\nOverall, these results support the notion that the MA of CYP2C19 (rs4388808) is a protective variant against A\u03b2 and downstream cognitive impairment. Of interest, voxel-wise analysis in in vivo participants revealed that the MA was associated with reduced A\u03b2 burden in AD-related regions in the frontal, inferior temporal, and posterior cingulate cortices. 23 In addition, the CYP2C19 SNP was associated with the CSF A\u03b2/p-tau ratio but not with plasmatic A\u03b2. Beyond the fact that the A\u03b2/p-tau ratio is postulated to better represent neuritic plaques than the single CSF A\u03b2 information, 24 these results Figure 2 Comparison between noncarriers (\u2212) and carriers (+) of the minor allele of rs4388808 (CYP2C19)\nIn the ADNI cohort, a difference was observed in the brain A\u03b2 load (A), CSF A\u03b2 levels (B), and CSF A\u03b2/p-tau ratio (C), but no difference was detected in plasmatic levels of A\u03b2 (D). Results were generalized to postmortem data of Rush-ROS/MAP cohorts, where a concordant pattern was observed in the A\u03b2 load (percentage area occupied by amyloid) (E). A tendency toward significance in global cognitive performance (F) was found in the ADNI cohort, while in the Rush-ROS/MAP, it was significant (G). CYP2C19 expression levels were also different between noncarriers (\u2212) and carriers (+) of the minor allele of rs4388808 (H) in the ADNI cohort. All linear models were adjusted for age, sex, and APOE-e4 carriage status, with the exception of the models using global cognition and gene expression, which were adjusted for age, sex, and years of education or RNA integrity, respectively.

Indeed, we found a similar association showing that MA carriers expressed higher levels of CYP2C19 when compared with noncarriers, suggesting that the SNP affects the expression of its gene. To corroborate this finding, we retrieved the SNPs that were previously excluded because of high LD and verified that none was associated with CYP2C19 expression in the blood (data not shown), reinforcing the idea that rs4388808 is functional. This association could not be detected in postmortem data probably because of the low CYP expression or because of its limited detection by the method used. 7 Despite the SNP not being widely studied to provide information about the association with other phenotypes, other polymorphisms in the gene have been correlated with metabolic variability, atherosclerosis, and behavioral traits. [27] [28] [29] CYP2C19 expression has been detected in several brain regions 6, 7 ; however, its function in the CNS has not been fully elucidated. Some reports have suggested that, besides its role at metabolizing exogenous substrates, CYP2C19 also participates in other important biological cascades, such as the metabolism of serotonin and sexual hormones 1 and the metabolism of the arachidonic acid (AA), where it functions as an epoxygenase. 30 The biochemical mechanism underlying the association of CYP2C19 with A\u03b2 remains speculative. A study has shown that A\u03b2 is able to act as a foreign body and trigger POR, activating CYPs to initiate catabolic reactions. 9 In turn, CYP2C19 is involved in the catalysis of estradiol. 31 Because several studies have reported the beneficial effects of estrogens on AD-demonstrating that these steroids are able to act as anti-inflammatory compounds 32 and even inhibit A\u03b2 production 33 -one could think that MA carriers of rs4388808 have a reduced expression of this CYP in the brain or that they have an increased structural incompatibility between CYP2C19 and estradiol. Consequently, MA carriers could present a reduction in the catabolism of estrogen and a reduction in the A\u03b2 load. Alternatively, the A\u03b2 load would be affected by the levels of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) produced via the metabolism of AA by CYP epoxygenases. In the brain, studies have shown that EETs have beneficial effects at regulating blood flow, cortical angiogenesis, and at promoting anti-inflammatory reactions (for review, see reference 2). By contrast, when AA is metabolized via other cascades, the protective effect of EETs is lost, and there is a possibility of induction of A\u03b2 production and/or accumulation. 34 In addition, it was demonstrated that A\u03b2 is able to reduce epoxygenase activity and consequently decrease EET production, 35 probably leading to more susceptibility to neuronal damage (for review, see reference 36). In this scenario, it would be possible that the MA of rs4388808 increases the expression of CYP2C19, leading to an \"A\u03b2-resistant\" epoxygenase metabolism of AA, with a maintained production of EETs and a more protective phenotype against amyloidosis.\nIt is also plausible to think, however, that the association described here between the CYP2C19 polymorphism and A\u03b2 is indirect, being mediated by the effect of a drug. CYP2C19 is known to metabolize several drugs, 37 including medications to treat depression, which has been mentioned as a risk factor for AD (for review, see reference 38). Citalopram, for example, is an antidepressant metabolized by CYP2C19 that has been shown to decrease A\u03b2 production. 39 Thus, one may think that the polymorphism rs4388808 is then associated with an improved action of citalopram, leading to the decreased brain A\u03b2 burden, rather than associated with A\u03b2 metabolism itself. Because it is difficult to track all the medications the study participants have taken before been enrolled, it is unfeasible at the moment to check whether this association holds true. The interpretation of the results should take into consideration a few limitations. The use of the 2 cohorts does not allow us to detect and measure A\u03b2 pathology with the same methodology, inserting in the analysis some variability specific to the method used. However, despite being measured with different techniques, both the imaging radiotracer and the antibody used in the brain tissue are expected to bind to the fibrillar form of A\u03b2. 13 Similarly, the cognitive composite scores from the 2 cohorts have some differences that should be considered. There are also some intrinsic characteristics of the samples that have to be taken into account: (1) the inclusion criteria of each study, (2) the average age difference between the studies, and (3) and the disease stage in which A\u03b2 measures were performed-at the end or during the disease process. Sample size restrictions impose some degree of caution when interpreting findings, including, for example, the lack of association between the genotype and plasmatic levels of A\u03b2, or cognition, in the ADNI cohort. In addition, both cohorts are mostly composed of non-Latino Caucasians, limiting the extrapolation of the present findings to other population groups. Longitudinal analysis together with functional genomics and biochemistry experiments, not performed here, would also be necessary to determine the effect of the SNP in the protein function as well as to support any theoretical framework proposed in the Discussion section.\nResults obtained from the 2 independent cohorts provide compelling evidences linking the CYP2C19 polymorphism and A\u03b2 pathology, suggesting that the MA of rs4388808 confers protective effects against A\u03b2 accumulation in the brain and its downstream cognitive consequences. These results could have implication for antiamyloid clinical trial designs, as preclinical rs4388808 G would present a protective factor against the amyloid load. Therefore, the biological mechanism by which the genetic variation would alter A\u03b2 build up and clearance merits further investigation.\nAuthor contributions Andr\u00e9a L.
