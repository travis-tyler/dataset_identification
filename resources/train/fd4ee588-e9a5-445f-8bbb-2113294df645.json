A\u03b2 imaging with PET provides an important tool for the assessment of early and differential diagnosis of AD with the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) criteria (Ng et al 2007 , McKhann et al 2011 and also used for screening of subjects and evaluation of responses to therapy in clinical trials of AD therapeutics (Doody et al 2014 , Salloway et al 2014 .\nQuantification of amyloid deposition with standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) has been generally performed to improve diagnosis and to monitor AD therapy, particularly in clinical research and trial (Lopresti et al 2005 , Rinne et al 2010 . Amyloid PET quantification typically requires an individual high-resolution MRI for spatial normalization into standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (Evans et al 2012) and to generate a probability map of gray matter (Lundqvist et al 2013 . Although MRI is often used for normalization into MNI space where region-of-interest (ROI) template is defined, a highresolution 3D-MRI is not always available in clinical practice (Lundqvist et al 2013 , Bourgeat et al 2015 . On the other hand, when MRI-based quantification is performed, the errors potentially occur in the process of gray matter segmentation and co-registration between MRI and PET images. Furthermore, geometric distortion and motion artifact of MRI might influence the accuracy of ROI definition (Imabayashi et al 2013) . Therefore, a PET-only quantification method is desirable that does not rely on the availability of MRI.\nSeveral previous studies have attempted to quantify amyloid deposition based on spatial normalization using PET image alone (Edison et al 2013 , Zhou et al 2014 . However, amyloid positive images and negative images have strikingly different activity distribution patterns, which hamper use of a single template image for all cases. Lundqvist et al and Bourgeat et al each has suggested an automated PET-only adaptive template method (Lundqvist et al 2013 , Bourgeat et al 2015 . These methods have reported accurate and robust quantification without the use of MRI. However, these previous studies have adopted manually defined ROI template or automatic-anatomical-labeling (AAL) ROI or FreeSurfer-based ROI (Lundqvist et al 2013 , Su et al 2013 , Schain et al 2014 , Zhou et al 2014 . These anatomical ROIs were not necessarily suitable for amyloid quantification because they were not generated voxel-wise over the regions that are apt to accumulate amyloid PET drugs in pathological conditions. On the other hand, the ROI defined manually on the co-registered MRI were also used to calculate SUVR mainly for clinical research (Lopresti et al 2005 , Becker et al 2013 , Lundqvist et al 2013 . However, the manual ROI is less reproducible and requires a strenuous work. A ROI template characterizing voxel-wise amyloid specific regions may provide higher sensitivity and specificity.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of PET-only amyloid quantification with adaptive template and empirically determined amyloid-characteristic ROI."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Brain MRI and PiB PET scans", "text": "This study was retrospective and handled MRI and PET images acquired in various clinical research projects on either AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitively normal subjects. All research projects had been approved by the ethics committee, and all subjects had signed an informed consent form for the respective research and the retrospective data analysis of this kind. The results of present data analysis did not influence clinical decision making.\nTwo sets of subject data were studied: the 1st set was for ROI generation and for compariso n with conventional method, and the 2nd set was for testing the new method.\nThe first set consists of 34 subjects (6 AD subjects; 22 MCI subjects; 6 normal control subjects) who underwent 3D-MRI and 11 C-PiB PET. T1-weighted 3D-SPGR transaxial images were acquired using a 1.5 Tesla SIGNA EXCITE (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) with the following parameters: TE 5 ms, TR 23 ms, slice thickness 2.0 mm, FOV 22.0 cm, flip angle 30\u00b0. For the PET study, the subjects had an intravenous injection of 571.6 \u00b1 19.0 MBq of 11 C-PiB and underwent PET emission scans for 20 min starting at 50 min post injection using a Discovery-690 PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) (Bettinardi et al 2011) . The PET data were reconstructed using ordered-subset expectation-maximization (OSEM) algorithm with 4 iterations and 16 subsets. Gaussian filter with 5 mm FWHM was applied into reconstructed PET images, which is a 128 \u00d7 128 matrix with 2.0 mm pixels and 3.27 mm slice thickness. These parameters were determined based on phantom studies (Akamatsu et al 2016) . The CT component of the Discovery-690 PET/CT scanner was a 16-multidetector CT scanner. The technical parameters of the CT scan were 120 kV, 200 mA, 0.5 s tube rotation, 18.75 mm/rot and 3.75 mm slice collimation. The CT images were used for attenuation correction.\nThe second set consists of 34 subjects (13 AD subjects, 8 MCI subjects, 13 normal control subjects), of which 10 underwent a PiB-PET/CT scan (566.9 \u00b1 32.7 MBq) in the same way as the first set of subjects written above, and 24 underwent PiB-PET with a SET-3000 G/X PET scanner (Shimadzu Medical Systems, Kyoto, Japan) (Matsumoto et al 2006) . For the latter 24 subjects, the PET data of 20 min duration between 50 and 70 min after injection were reconstructed using dynamic row-action maximum-likelihood algorithm (DRAMA) with 4 iterations and 0 filter cycles. Attenuation correction was performed using the 137 Cs transmission data (Matsumoto et al 2006) .

Cases with at least one positive area in any of the above 4 cortical areas are classified as positive. Otherwise, cases with at least one equivocal area in any of the above 4 cortical areas are classified as equivocal. Cases without positive or equivocal area in any of the above 4 cortical areas are classified as negative. In this study, equivocal scans were combined into positive scans.

The AAL-ROI template was applied into normalized images on MNI space.\nAll voxel values were normalized by the mean value of cerebellar cortex (AAL-ROI labeled as 'Cerebellum_Crus') to generate the SUVR-scaled images. Eleven typical positive images (4 AD and 7 MCI subjects with high PiB accumulation in all 4 cortical areas and striatum mentioned above) and eight typical negative images were averaged to generate positive and negative templates, respectively (figure 1). Figure 2 shows the process of making an empirically PiB-prone ROI template (EPP-ROI). Voxels, in which PiB accumulation was higher than 1.7 in SUVR, were extracted from the positive template. Non-specific PiB accumulative voxels, which actually covers the white matter, were also extracted from the negative template based on the SUVR cutoff value of 1.7. We adopted the SUVR cutoff value of 1.7 to make non-specific PiB accumulations of the negative template fit the white matter of average MRI (figure 3) by discussions among nuclear medicine physicians and technologists.

The PET-only amyloid quantification method provided comparable SUVR values to the MRI-based SUVR and categorized 11 C-PiB scans exactly the same as visual assessment. We generated empirically PiB-prone ROI based on actual human PiB images. The results showed high correlation between SUVR obtained with MRI-based AAL-ROI and EPP-ROI (R = 0.99). The EPP-ROI provided higher SUVR than the AAL-ROI irrespective of positive or negative images, especially in positive images. This difference is considered to arise from exclusion of the voxels adjacent to the contour of the cortical area that are included in AAL-ROI, making EPP-ROI less sensitive to partial volume effect and normalization error. In a case with an error in the MRI-based gray matter segmentation as shown in figure 6 , AAL-ROI extends beyond the cortical surface, leading to underestimation of SUVR. On the other hand, the EPP-ROI template is considered to provide more accurate and reproducible SUVR . MRI and PET superimposed with three types of ROI for a representative 'positive' subject. MRI-based AAL-ROI protruded from cortical surface due to gray matter segmentation error. On the other hand, the EPP-ROI was localized within the cortical areas.\nbecause it was derived from the cortical accumulation pattern of actual PiB images and does not contain voxels on the brain surface or gray-white border. Therefore the EPP-ROI has a potential to improve quantitative accuracy of amyloid quantification.\nIn this study, we adopted the SUVR cutoff value of 1.7 to make the EPP-ROI cover only amyloid-specific areas. We preliminarily generated the ROI template based on the SUVR cutoff value of 2.0 and calculated the SUVR for the 20 subjects of the 1st set as a pilot experiment. Average SUVR computed with the ROI template (made from the cutoff value of 2.0) were 2.23 for the positive subjects and 1.36 for the negative subjects. On the other hand, those computed with the EPP-ROI (cutoff value of 1.7) were 2.18 and 1.30, respectively. Since the difference between these two was relatively small (<5%), SUVR may not be so sensitive to selection of the cutoff level. Conversely, if we choose a smaller cutoff value, the ROI template may become smaller and may be more localized in cortical areas. However, this may potentially trim important amyloid-specific regions, particularly if a PET camera with poor spatial resolution is used. Individual SUVR values for the first set subjects in relation to clinical diagnosis that were computed with three quantification methods. The EPP-ROI provided higher SUVR than the AAL-ROI especially for the positive subjects. Furthermore, the EPP-ROI made a clearer differentiation between positive and negative subjects.\nWhen the EPP-ROI was used, the PET-based spatial normalization method with adaptive template provided almost the same SUVR as the MRI-based method. This result indicates that PET-based normalization with adaptive template method exhibited equivalent performance as the MRI-based normalization. Lundqvist et al and Bourgeat et al have also evaluated the PET-based normalization using adaptive template in order to quantify amyloid deposition (Lundqvist et al 2013 , Bourgeat et al 2015 . While they used more than two types of templates, we adopted only two templates. We believe that two types of templates provided a sufficient accuracy for amyloid PET image normalization because our PETbased normalization was comparable to the MRI-based normalization results (table 2) . Furthermore, our PET-only quantification method is simple and robust because it does not rely on MRI segmentation and that it applies the EPP-ROI to original PET images without interpolation. ROI analysis in the original PET space can minimize the risk of reducing quantitative accuracy and reproducibility (Lundqvist et al 2013) . Edison et al and SaintAubert et al have suggested that PET-only quantification method is adequate for clinical use (Edison et al 2013 , Saint-Aubert et al 2014 . Our method is considered to be useful especially for clinical practice.\nWe tested the PET-only quantification method by applying it to a 11 C-PiB image set acquired with two different PET cameras. As a result, all subjects were correctly categorized into positive and negative based on the cutoff value of 1.7. Categorization of 11 C-PiB scans by the PET-only quantification method showed exact concordance with the visual read results. Therefore, the PET-only quantification method could help interpretation of amyloid images based on these results. This PET-only quantification method could be generalized to any other amyloid tracers if their specific templates are created, and the idea of standardizing the scaling of quantitative values may also be applicable (Klunk et al 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The PET-only amyloid quantification with adaptive template and EPP-ROI provides accurate, robust, simple and automated amyloid quantification without MRI.
