[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Tau is one of the two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, and bears a much closer relationship to local neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment than the other hallmark, \u03b2-amyloid. Cell and rodent models have shown evidence that tau spreads from cell to cell through anatomical neuronal connections, and that this process is facilitated by the presence of \u03b2amyloid. We test this hypothesis in humans by using an epidemic spreading model (ESM) to simulate the spread of tau over human neuronal connections, and we compare the simulated pattern of progression to the observed pattern measured in the brains of 295 individuals on the Alzheimer's disease spectrum, using PET. Fitting our model, we found that the majority of variance in the overall pattern of tau progression could be explained by diffusion of an agent through the human connectome, measured using either functional connectivity or diffusion tractograpy. These models far exceeded chance, and outperformed models testing the extracellular spread of tau over Euclidian space. Surprisingly, the ESM predicted the spatial patterns of sub-threshold * Corresponding authors: jacob.vogel@mail.mcgill.ca, alan.evans@mcgill.ca * * These authors contributed equally to the work Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: tau in cognitively normal elderly without significant amyloid burden with impressive accuracy. In addition, in amyloid-positive subjects only, regions with greater amyloid burden showed greater tau than predicted by connectivity patterns, suggesting a role of amyloid in accelerating the spread of tau in certain isocortical regions. Altogether, our results provide strong evidence that tau spreads through neuronal communication pathways even in normal aging, and that this process is accelerated by the presence of brain \u03b2-amyloid."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "disease other dementias [38, 39] . Our analysis also improves upon these and Figure 1 : Methodological approaches. A) Summary of the mixture model procedure, using the left inferior temporal lobe as an example. The distribution of all SUVR values in this ROI are shown. Two Gaussian mixture models are fit to the data. When a one-component model first the data better, the ROI is discarded. When a two-component model fits better, the probability that each values falls upon the second distribution is calculated. B) Summary of ESM model. An artificial system based on a pairwise relationship (e.g. functional connectivity) matrix is created, where the relationship between regions i and j is represented by weight ij. For each subject, a seed is placed at the model epicenter, and the diffusion of this signal over time is simulated through the system, where the interregional relationships determine the pattern of spread, and subject-level free parameters determine the velocity of diffusion, until an optimal fit is reached. At this point, the simulated tau signal is compared to the observed tau-PET signal to evaluate the model. C) One advantage of the ESM over traditional approaches lies in the initiation of secondary seeding events as the diffusion process reaches new regions (top). Another advantage lies in the fitting of subject-level production (/beta) and clearance (/delta) parameters. A balance in these parameters will lead to little to no spreading over time, while increasing imbalance leads to increasing speed of spread. erated by finding the correlation between timeseries' of each pair of regionsof-interest from the Desikan-Killiany atlas, and all available confounds were 167 regressed from the correlation matrices.
