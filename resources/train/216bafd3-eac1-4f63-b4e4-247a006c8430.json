Roughly 90 percent of postnatal-infant participants retained eligibility after the child turned 1 year old. The following types of households were more likely than others to exit WIC after their child turns 1 year old: \u2022 Households with higher income. \u2022 Households in which mothers are more educated and were employed after the child's birth. \u2022 Mothers who did not breastfeed and those who breastfed for less than 6 months. By contrast, households with income below the poverty line and those that participated in prenatal Medicaid were less likely to exit WIC after their child turned 1 year old. Approximately 33 percent of households that left the WIC program reported that they believed they were no longer eligible once the child turned 1 year old, and 27.8 percent reported that they no longer needed food benefi ts. When a child turns 1 year old, the eligible WIC household no longer receives the infant food package, which contains infant formula for those who are not being breastfed exclusively, and transitions to the child food package, which has a signifi cantly lower retail value. This change in WIC food benefi ts may play a role in a household's decision to exit WIC. Although WIC is not an entitlement program, few households reported that they were denied benefi ts due to lack of program funds. Some households reported, however, that the program requires too much effort and the benefi ts are not worth the time (26.2 percent of those exiting) or that they have scheduling and transportation problems (almost 10 percent of those exiting), suggesting that such transaction costs of participation may be a barrier to continued participation in WIC."}, {"section_title": "How Was the Study Conducted?", "text": "Researchers used data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), a nationally representative longitudinal dataset of children born in 2001.

The ECLS-B collects extensive information about the WIC participation of the mother and children in the household, and the timing of that participation. In addition, a subset of mothers who left the WIC program was asked to report why they stopped receiving WIC benefi ts for their child. The researchers used probit regression analysis to examine the factors that infl uence postnatal, rather than prenatal, enrollment in WIC and the factors that infl uence a household's exit from WIC once the child turns 1 year old. The researchers' analysis focused on the factors that infl uence a household's participation: perceived benefi ts, the stigma or transaction costs associated with participation, and the availability of information on the program and its eligibility requirements. The researchers also used multinomial logit regression to examine WIC household characteristics that may have infl uenced WIC participants' self-reported explanation for leaving the program."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides nutritious foods, nutrition counseling, and referrals to health and other social services for low-income pregnant and postpartum women and their infants and children up to age 5. WIC has grown from serving 88,000 participants in fi scal year 1974 to approximately 8.7 million in fi scal year 2008 (U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 2010a). In fi scal year 2006, approximately a quarter of participants were women (categorized as either pregnant, breastfeeding, or nonbreastfeeding post-partum), approximately a quarter were infants, and approximately half were children 1-5 years of age (Oliveira and Fraz\u00e3o, 2009). To be eligible for WIC, in addition to belonging to 1 of the 5 demographically targeted groups discussed above, an individual must have low income and be at nutritional risk. Not everyone who is eligible for WIC chooses to participate. The percent of the eligible population receiving WIC benefi ts is referred to as the \"coverage rate.\" The offi cial WIC coverage rate is calculated as the number of WIC participants (derived from administrative data) divided by the number of individuals eligible for WIC (estimated using survey data). WIC's offi cial coverage rate in 2007 was 55.9 percent (USDA, 2009). Participation in WIC varies across categories. As shown in fi gure 1, coverage rates for 2007 were higher among women in the year after giving birth (77.8 percent) than for pregnant women (65.7 percent). 1 The coverage rate for infants (81.3 percent) was higher than that for children 1-5 years old (47.3 percent) (USDA, 2009). Among the fi ve participant categories, infants had the highest coverage rate. Arranging coverage rates in time sequence shows a hump-shaped pattern, with a peak in WIC coverage during the year after a woman gives birth. This pattern is also evident in the offi cial coverage rates from 1994 to 2007 reported by USDA (2009). 1 Women who participate in WIC after giving birth are divided into two groups: those who breastfeed (participation rate of 68.1 percent) and those who do not breastfeed (participation rate of 78.8 percent).  While pregnant women and children 1-5 years old have relatively low participation rates, previous research suggests that participation in WIC does confer health benefi ts to these groups. In addition, studies demonstrate that eligible pregnant women and children who do not participate exhibit need across a variety of dimensions (Bitler, Gundersen, and Marquis, 2005;Gundersen, 2005;Tiehen and Jacknowitz, 2008). For example, Bitler, Gundersen, and Marquis (2005) found that among eligible children who did not participate in WIC, 5.5 percent lived in households that are food insuffi cient (sometimes or often do not get enough to eat) and 19.5 percent lived in households that could not afford to eat balanced meals. Focusing on pregnant women, Tiehen and Jacknowitz (2008) found that 32.7 percent of eligible nonparticipants had household income below the poverty line. In this study, we examined why eligible participant households are less likely to participate during the prenatal period and after a child turns 1 year old than in the year after birth. 2 Specifi cally, we examined factors associated with the decision of households that participate in WIC during the year after the birth of a child (the postnatal-infant period) to (1) delay their entry into the WIC program until after the child's birth and (2) exit the program when a child turns 1 year old. We considered three sets of factors: 1. Household demographic and socio-economic characteristics; 2. WIC policies; and 3. Self-reported reasons for exiting the program after the child turns 1 year old. We used the fi rst two waves of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) data to document and analyze the participation patterns of mother-child pairs from the time of the mother's pregnancy until the child's second birthday. While the relatively low coverage rates for children pertain to children up to their fi fth birthday, the ECLS-B data used for this study provided information up to the child's second birthday. We were able to estimate WIC participation in each of three periods for the same set of households. In contrast to the cross-sectional program data and survey data on which most analysis of WIC is based, the longitudinal nature of the ECLS-B permits analysis of the dynamic participation patterns of WIC-eligible mother-child pairs. From a program perspective, if those who delay entry into WIC or those who exit early are more advantaged economically and less in need of program benefi ts, then the program is well-targeted. If eligible nonparticipants exhibit need, research results can be used to facilitate outreach efforts and to guide program reforms to prolong the participation of underserved groups. Given that households that participated during the year after the birth of a child demonstrated program awareness and the willingness to participate, outreach activities and program changes could be effective for these groups. Program awareness, however, may be delayed for those who enroll after giving birth."}, {"section_title": "How WIC Works Program Administration and Outcomes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Services Provided by WIC", "text": "The overarching objective of the WIC program is to counteract the negative effects of poverty on prenatal and child health. WIC participants typically receive vouchers to purchase specifi c supplemental foods from authorized retailers. These foods are good sources of nutrients, such as protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins A and C. WIC food packages do not vary by household income, but they do vary by low-income target group. The contents of WIC food packages were revised in 2009 to refl ect changes in dietary recommendations. 3 During the period of this study, WIC food packages for most participant categories, other than infants, included milk, eggs, cheese, dried beans, peanut butter, and breakfast cereals that are high in iron and low in sugar. Infants who were not exclusively breastfed received iron-fortifi ed infant formula from 0-12 months of age as well as infant cereal and fruit or vegetable juice from 4-12 months of age. The price of infant formula creates most of the variation in the value of food packages across participant categories. In fi scal year 2005, the average retail value of the WIC food package for infants was $97.86 per month, while the average retail value of the child package was $39.97 per month (USDA, 2007). 4 In addition, while Federal guidelines limit the maximum amount of food in each food package, States have some discretion over the content of food packages. For example, some States allow WIC agencies to tailor the food packages of some participants for sucrose content or the type of milk. 5 In addition to the supplemental foods, WIC also provides nutrition education to its participants. Nutrition education includes lessons on recommended food patterns, but can also cover topics like breastfeeding and health behaviors, such as avoiding alcohol, smoking, and drugs. States must offer participants two nutritional education sessions every 6 months, though participants are not required to attend them. WIC also provides referrals to health and social services, such as preventative medicine and other assistance programs, particularly Medicaid (Oliveira and Fraz\u00e3o, 2009)."}, {"section_title": "WIC Eligibility Requirements", "text": "In addition to being categorically eligible (i.e., belonging to 1 of the 5 groups discussed earlier), an individual must meet two other criteria to be WIC eligible. 1. The individual must reside in a household with income at or below 185 percent of the Federal poverty threshold (i.e., income eligible) or be enrolled in another assistance program, such as the Food Stamp Program, 6 Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), or Medicaid (i.e., adjunctively eligible). Some States allow participants in the National School Lunch Program or the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Program to be adjunctively eligible for WIC. 2. The individual must be assessed as nutritionally at risk: 7 \u2022 Medically based risks, such as anemia, underweight, overweight, or history of pregnancy complications or poor outcomes; and \u2022 Diet-based risks, such as failure to meet dietary guidelines. During the period of our study, States varied on how they collected information about nutritional risk. For example, some States required individuals to recall food intake over a 24-hour period and others just required that individuals complete a food frequency checklist (USDA, 2002). 8 Participants are certifi ed as WIC eligible for a specifi ed period of time, which varies by participant category. A pregnant participant is certifi ed for the duration of her pregnancy and does not have to recertify her eligibility until 6 weeks after the birth of her infant. Postpartum women who do not breastfeed are eligible for WIC for up to 6 months after delivery, while mothers who breastfeed are certifi ed for 6 months at a time up to 1 year after delivery as long as they continue to breastfeed. Infants are generally certifi ed until they turn 1 year old, while children 1-5 years old are certifi ed for a 6-month period. WIC is not an entitlement program, which means that eligible applicants are not guaranteed to receive services. When an agency does not have suffi cient funds to serve all eligible applicants, it creates a waiting list and allocates available resources based on a system that ensures that those with the greatest nutritional needs are served fi rst. 9 As noted by Oliveira and Fraz\u00e3o (2009), anecdotal evidence suggests that in recent years States have received suffi cient funding to provide benefi ts to all eligible WIC applicants."}, {"section_title": "Research on WIC Participation and the Outcomes Associated With Participation", "text": "Most national-level studies of WIC participation have used a cross-sectional design to examine factors associated with participation (Ku, 1989;Brien and Swann, 1997;Kowaleski-Jones and Duncan, 2000;Chatterji et al., 2002;Bitler et al., 2003;Bitler and Currie, 2005a), while others used a dynamic design (Burstein et al., 2000;Gundersen, 2005;Swann, 2007;Tiehen and Jacknowitz, 2008). Most studies examined prenatal participation, while relatively few examined children's participation (Burstein et al., 2000;Gundersen, 2005;Castner et al., 2009). Two studies examined the correlates of WIC participation around the birth of a child, though they did not distinguish prenatal from postnatal participation (Bitler et al., 2003;Chatterji et al., 2002). 10 Among the studies that focused on prenatal participation, some concentrated on what factors infl uenced prenatal participation (Ku, 1989;Swann, 2007;Tiehen and Jacknowitz, 2008), while others focused on understanding prenatal participation to estimate the effect of WIC on birth outcomes (Bitler and Currie, 2005a;Brien and Swann, 1997;Kowaleski-Jones and Duncan, 2000). The primary interest of Ku (1989), Swann (2007), and Tiehen and Jacknowitz (2008) was to understand factors associated with the timing of prenatal participation. Three studies focused on the dynamics of WIC participation among infants and children, using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) (Burstein et al., 2000;Gundersen, 2005;Castner et al., 2009). Gundersen (2005) used the 1996 SIPP to compare the economic health of three groups of infants and children who were found to be eligible during a single month in late 1996 or early 1997. The three groups were based on their WIC participation patterns over a 48-month period: nonparticipants, participants who left WIC at any time during the 48-month period, and participants who remained in the program for the entire 48-month period. Gundersen (2005) found that infants and children who never participated were, on average, more economically advantaged than infants and children who did participate. In addition, those who participated for only a portion of the 48-month period were generally more economically advantaged than those who remained in the program for the 48-month period. Burstein et al. (2000) and Castner et al. (2009) both used the SIPP to track the participation patterns of infant participants as they aged and examined the factors associated with their exit from the program. Both studies found that exits were strongly associated with increases in household income and exits from other public assistance programs. Recent reviews of the literature by Currie (2003); Fox, Hamilton, and Lin (2004); and Oliveira and Fraz\u00e3o (2009) concluded that the research, taken as a whole, suggests that WIC has a benefi cial impact on the intake of food energy and nutrients during pregnancy and on birth outcomes, such as mean birthweight, gestational age, and the likelihood of low birthweight. While some recent studies (e.g., Bitler and Currie, 2005a;Figlio et al., 2009) found that WIC participation was associated with improved birth outcomes, debate has emerged over the role that WIC participation plays in the improvement of birth outcomes (Besharov and Germanis, 2001;Bitler and Currie, 2005b;Joyce et al., 2005;Joyce et al., 2008;Ludwig and Miller, 2005). One of the underlying issues in this debate is whether WIC participants would be more likely to have better birth outcomes than eligible nonparticipants, regardless of whether they participated in WIC. 11 A more thorough understanding of the factors associated with WIC participation, as well as the timing of participation, can contribute to the debate over WIC effectiveness. Evidence also shows that children benefi t from participation in WIC, though it was not as strong or consistent as the evidence relating to prenatal WIC participation. Many studies of WIC's effect on children were not consistent with current methods for assessing dietary intake (Oliveira and Fraz\u00e3o, 2009). Fox, Hamilton, and Lin (2004), however, noted that there was credible evidence that WIC reduces the prevalence of iron-defi ciency anemia. Some evidence also indicated that WIC participation may improve children's growth, health care use, immunization status, and overall health (Fox, Hamilton, and Lin, 2004). This report advances the literature on WIC participation in several ways: \u2022 We examined the dynamics of mother-child pair WIC participation from the time of a woman's pregnancy until her child reaches 2 years old. Previous studies focused on either pregnant women participants (Swann, 2007;Tiehen and Jacknowitz, 2008) or infant and/or child participants (Burstein et al., 2000;Gundersen, 2005;Castner et al., 2009). While Burstein et al. (2000) and Castner et al. (2009) tracked WIC participation 11 Another underlying issue in this debate, less relevant for this study, is the role of gestational age bias in assessing the effectiveness of WIC. Gestational age bias can lead to a spurious positive association between prenatal WIC participation and birth outcomes that depends on length of gestation, since women whose pregnancies last longer have more opportunity to enroll in WIC. of infants as they aged, no previous study identifi ed mother-child pairs and tracked the dynamics of their participation over this timeframe. \u2022 We examined why women who enter WIC in the postnatal-infant period did not enter the program earlier. To our knowledge, this issue has not been examined. \u2022 We examined the characteristics associated with the decision to leave WIC when an infant turns 1 year old, and the mother's reasons for exiting the program at that time. Such information has not previously been available in a nationally representative survey. \u2022 Our dataset captured the period after recent policy changes, which standardized WIC eligibility requirements and expanded Medicaid eligibility."}, {"section_title": "Data The ECLS-B Provides Unique Data", "text": "The primary data source for this study was the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort. The ECLS-B is a longitudinal dataset collected by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The sample of 10,700 children was designed to be nationally representative of children born in 2001 and oversampled children who are American Indian, Chinese, a member of another Asian and Pacifi c Islander group, a twin, or low and very low birthweight children. 12 The ECLS-B follows these children from birth through kindergarten, collecting data when the child is approximately 9 months, 2 years, 4 years old (at pre-school), and at kindergarten entry. 13 This study used data from the fi rst two waves (sample at 9 months and at 2 years old). Of the 10,700 children with a parent who participated in the fi rst wave of the survey, 9,850 of their parents participated in the second wave. 14 In the fi rst two waves of the data, information was collected from children and both parents, including nonresidential fathers, birth certifi cates, and child care providers. The ECLS-B contains information on the timing of WIC participation, explanations for exiting the WIC program, demographic characteristics, income and assets, participation in other assistance programs, and health status and behaviors. While program administrative data are often utilized for studies of entry into and exit out of participation in many programs, the ECLS-B was a more appropriate dataset for this analysis than available WIC administrative data. The national-level WIC administrative data come from a biennial census of WIC participants in the month of April collected since 1992. WIC administrative data provide valuable information on WIC participation and program characteristics, which are published in a series of USDA reports (see, for example, USDA (2010b)). Although administrative data provide the most accurate count of program participants, there is not suffi cient information to link members of a single household that receives WIC or to follow changes in a household's WIC participation over time."}, {"section_title": "Additional Data Sources", "text": "Because some WIC policies vary at the State level, we used a variety of State-level data: \u2022 2000 data on State policies from WIC Participants and Program Characteristics 2000, including the benefi ts of WIC food packages (e.g., the value of the food package) and the transaction costs of enrolling in WIC and receiving the food packages (e.g., whether WIC vouchers are issued monthly or less frequently).

We relied on 2000 data, the most recent information available on WIC State policies and the year during which many mothers in the sample were pregnant. It is unlikely that WIC State policies changed between 2000 and 2002 (the period of our study), as Bitler and Currie (2005a) and USDA (2002) noted that these policies changed little during the 90s. Therefore, households that were deciding whether to enter WIC in the postnatal period or exit WIC in the child period most likely faced the same policies that were in place in 2000."}, {"section_title": "Coding WIC Eligibility and Participation", "text": "To be eligible to receive WIC services, an individual must meet categorical, income, and nutritional risk requirements. To meet the income requirement, a household must have income at or below 185 percent of the poverty line or participate in the Food Stamp Program, TANF, or Medicaid. We calculated the household income-to-poverty ratio using household income over the year before the 9-month survey, household size from the 9-month survey, and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services poverty guidelines. Because income information is bracketed in the ECLS-B, the midpoint of each bracket was used to calculate the income-to-poverty ratio. Because Medicaid participants are deemed adjunctively eligible for WIC, we considered all women who reported prenatal Medicaid participation as eligible for WIC. In addition, the income threshold for Medicaid eligibility varies by State and can be higher than the income threshold for WIC eligibility. If the State's income threshold for Medicaid eligibility was higher than 185 percent of the income-to-poverty ratio, we used the Medicaid threshold to estimate eligibility. 15 There were some notable limitations to using the ECLS-B for coding WIC eligibility that may infl uence our results. First, adequate information was not available to precisely model changes in eligibility over the three periods of our study. Household incomes vary over time, affecting whether any one household would be determined to be eligible at an actual WIC offi ce at a given time. Ideally, adequate information would be available to estimate eligibility for the prenatal, postnatal-infant, and child periods separately. Instead, we focused on a fi xed sample of households where the mother was eligible based on her annual income during the year before the 9-month survey and based on her receipt of prenatal Medicaid. Therefore, the income measure used to estimate WIC eligibility captured income during the prenatal and postnatal period. 16 We examined the role of estimated changes in eligibility status in our analysis of WIC exits when the survey child reached 1 year old. Another issue related to the use of annual household income to estimate eligibility was that WIC agencies do not necessarily use annual income to determine eligibility, since they have wide discretion over the period used to determine a household's income (Ver Ploeg and Betson, 2003). Ver Ploeg and Betson (2003) noted that, given WIC certifi cation periods, a researcher's use of annual income to estimate eligibility will underestimate the number 15 This is an upper bound estimate of the number of WIC-eligible households, since a number of States have Medicaid income eligibility thresholds above 185 percent of the poverty line. We created a lower bound estimate of WIC-eligible households that included those with income above 185 percent of the poverty line only if the mother participated in Medicaid in the prenatal period, and the estimation results were quite similar. 16 There was variation in the age of the survey child at the time of the 9-month survey, so the period of the annual income measure will also vary. For example, 9 percent of the analysis sample was between 12 and 17 months old at the time of the 9-month survey. of eligible households, because households with annual income above 185 percent of the poverty guideline but with at least 1 month of income eligibility will be misclassifi ed as ineligible. We found that 250 households in the sample reported prenatal WIC participation, but were coded as ineligible. 17 Based on the midpoint of the income brackets, a household whose income falls within an income bracket that contains the relevant eligibility threshold may be assigned the wrong eligibility status. We tested other methods of coding eligibility, including a more restrictive measure that considered only households with income below the bracket that contained the WIC eligibility threshold. We found that the primary regression results were not sensitive to our eligibility defi nition. The ECLS-B does not include data to determine whether a woman is at nutritional risk. However, research that used nationally representative data with information on medical and dietary risk characteristics estimated that at least 97 percent of women, infants, and children ages 2-5 years who are incomeeligible for WIC also met the program's criteria for nutritional risk (Ver Ploeg and Betson, 2003). The study also concluded that the prevalence of nutritional risk among children ages 1-2 years was likely as high as for the other groups of WIC participants (Ver Ploeg and Betson, 2003). Finally, the ECLS-B does not have information on prenatal participation in the Food Stamp Program or TANF, so we cannot account for households who would be income-eligible for WIC through participation in these programs. This will lead us to misclassify as ineligible households with annual income above 185 percent of the poverty line, but that participated in either the Food Stamp Program or TANF in the prenatal period. Given the stricter eligibility criteria for these two programs, however, this type of misclassifi cation was likely minimal. WIC participation was estimated for three distinct periods: a prenatal period, a postnatal-infant period from birth until the child's fi rst birthday, and a child period. In this study, the child period extends from the child's fi rst to second birthday. While children may participate in WIC until their fi fth birthday, the ECLS-B data used for this study did not extend for that length of time. We estimated WIC participation based on responses to a series of questions about WIC participation in the fi rst two waves of the survey. We tracked only the WIC participation of the mother-child survey pair and did not account for the participation of older children in the household. A household was coded as a prenatal participant if the mother indicated that she participated in WIC prior to giving birth. Due to the timeframe and wording of the WIC questions, it was diffi cult to fully capture the WIC participation of each individual in the household during the postnatal-infant period (i.e., the year after the child's birth). Therefore, we coded WIC participation in the postnatal-infant period at the household level, capturing participation by the mother, the infant, or both. A household was considered a participant in the postnatal-infant period if the mother responded that she used WIC vouchers to buy food for herself during the 6 months after giving birth, or if the mother used WIC vouchers to buy food for herself, the survey child, or twin during the 30 days before the 9-month survey and the child or twin was less than 12 months old at the time. Finally, a household was 17 There are other explanations for the presence of 250 ineligible WIC participants in the ECLS-B (approximately 5.3 percent of the analysis sample), such as misreporting income to the WIC agency or misreporting income or WIC participation in the ECLS-B. considered a participant in the child period if the mother responded that the survey child or the twin of the survey child received WIC benefi ts in the last 30 days and the survey child was over 12 months old at the time. Our measures of participation did not capture the duration of participation in a given period. It was easier to discuss transitions into and out of the prenatal, postnatal-infant, and child periods as if the transitions all occurred at the thresholds of \"birth\" and \"fi rst birthday.\" Strictly speaking, not all transitions occurred at those thresholds. Nevertheless, our measures of participation still provided an informative analysis sample to examine the factors that infl uenced whether a household delays entry into WIC or exits from the program."}, {"section_title": "Constructing the Analysis Sample", "text": "We constructed a sample of 8,250 mother-child pairs from the 10,700 children in the ECLS-B, of which 4,650 were estimated to be eligible for WIC based on information from the 9-month dataset. We used the following criteria to restrict the sample (the number of observations excluded for each criterion in parentheses) to: \u2022 Observations with State identifi ers (100); \u2022 Households with parents who participated in the second wave of data collection (850); 18 \u2022 Households with the biological mother of the survey child (150); \u2022 One mother-child pair per household, even if the woman had a multiple birth (750); 19 \u2022 Households with a survey child 18 months of age or younger in the fi rst wave of data (50). We excluded mothers of infants older than 18 months at the 9-month data collection because, due to the structure of the survey, we cannot ascertain their prenatal WIC participation status; \u2022 Households that provided information on WIC participation in all periods (100); and 20 \u2022 Observations with complete information for all relevant variables, with the exception of maternal welfare use as a child (500). 21 Due to the relatively high number of missing values on the mother's use of welfare as a child, we assigned the mode to each of the approximately 100 missing value data points, and included a variable in the regression analysis that indicated whether the observation was missing data on mother's use of welfare as a child. Table 1 compares the analysis sample of postnatal-infant participants with eligible nonparticipants. Among eligible households, those that chose to participate in WIC during at least the postnatal-infant period were more disadvantaged than those who never participated. For example, postnatalinfant participants were more likely to have less than a high school education, to be younger, to be unmarried, to have income that falls below the poverty line, and to participate in other assistance programs than their nonparticipant counterparts. 18 We estimated equations that explained panel attrition among all households as a function of WIC eligibility and among WIC-eligibles as a function of WIC participation (results available from authors). Controlling for a number of demographic variables, we found that households eligible for WIC were slightly more likely (1.4 percentage points) to exit between the fi rst and second waves of the survey. WIC participation was not associated with the probability of attrition between the fi rst and second waves of the survey. 19 In less than 1 percent of households with twins, the household reported that only one of the twins participated in WIC. In those cases, we counted the mother-child pair as a participant if either the child or the twin participated. 20 Households that participated in WIC during the prenatal period, but were coded as ineligible, were excluded from the analysis sample (250). Because these ineligible participants were signifi cantly more advantaged, on average, than eligible households, and we could not determine why they were misclassifi ed, we excluded them from the analysis. We found that our results were largely robust to the inclusion of the ineligibles in the analysis sample. 21 The observations excluded for missing data had very similar socioeconomic characteristics to those included in the analysis sample. Probit regression analysis indicated that Hispanics (relative to non-Hispanic Whites), high school and college graduates (relative to high school dropouts), mothers age 20 and older (relative to teens), those in the Midwest or South (relative to the West), and those in areas with a population of 2,500 to 49,999 (relative to those in cities with a population of 50,000 or more) were slightly less likely to be excluded from the analysis sample due to missing data (results available from authors).  "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A Conceptual Model of Household Program Participation", "text": "Individuals who are eligible for benefi ts from means-tested transfer programs do not always receive them, prompting research on nonparticipation among potentially needy households. Most economic research uses a cost-benefi t framework to explain the participation decision of eligible individuals. A utility-maximizing individual will participate if the benefi ts outweigh the costs associated with participation. This model may also explain the timing of participation, with an individual re-evaluating her decision to participate in the program at certain intervals. As described by Currie (2006), economic research has focused on two primary costs of participation-stigma and transaction costs-to explain nonparticipation among eligible individuals. Stigma was fi rst incorporated into the costbenefi t framework by Moffi tt (1983), who describes stigma as the \"disutility arising from participation in a welfare program per se\" (p. 1023). A utilitymaximizing individual may feel embarrassed or ashamed of receiving assistance from the Government, particularly if others know about this assistance. Transaction costs are the costs (both money and time) associated with applying for a program, documenting eligibility, complying with program rules, and redeeming benefi ts. The cost-benefi t framework assumes that participants have complete information about the costs and benefi ts of participation. Currie (2006) noted that research also considered whether a lack of information about the program and its eligibility criteria infl uenced program participation. 22"}, {"section_title": "Regression Analysis", "text": "We used probit regression analysis to estimate equations explaining: 1. Delayed entry into the WIC program in the postnatal-infant period; and 2. Exit from the program when a child reaches 1 year old. In the delayed entry equation, the dependent variable is a binary variable with a value of 1 if the household entered the WIC program in the postnatal-infant period, and 0 if the household participated in both the prenatal and postnatal-infant periods. In the early exit equation, the dependent variable is a binary variable with the value of 1 if the household exited the program after the child turns 1 year old, and 0 if the household participated in both the postnatal-infant and the child periods. As noted previously, the unit of analysis was the mother-child survey pair, which we also refer to as the household. This empirical strategy allowed us to focus on the factors that explain delayed entry and early exit among participants. This sample restriction means, however, that our regression results must be interpreted as conditional on WIC participation during the postnatal-infant period. Thus, it should be noted that the study results cannot be generalized to explain the behavior of those who do not participate in the postnatal-infant period and, in particular, households that never participate in WIC during any of the three study periods. The equations include independent variables that may infl uence the transition into and out of WIC through their infl uence on the size of the benefi ts, the transaction costs associated with participation, stigma, or the availability of program information. Many of the included variables could be attributable to more than one of these explanations; therefore, we did not assign each variable to a specifi c factor. We focused on households that participated in the program in an attempt to reduce the role of stigma as a possible explanation for periods of nonparticipation. In addition, we eliminated lack of program awareness as an explanation for households exiting after the child turned 1 year old since they had participated previously in WIC. 23 The equations also included independent variables to control for socio-economic characteristics. 24 The characteristics displayed in table 1 are included as explanatory variables in at least one of the regression equations. We included variables for the mother's race and ethnicity (with non-Hispanic White as the basis), the mother's education (with did not graduate from high school as the basis), the mother's age (with age younger than 20 years as the basis), the mother's citizenship status, the mother's marital status, the presence of a child (other than the interview child or twin) under age 5 in the household, the presence of a child between the ages of 5 and 17 in the household, and whether the survey child is a twin or higher-order birth. We included an indicator variable for household income below the poverty line and an indicator for household income between the poverty line and 185 percent of the poverty line (with household income above 185 percent of the poverty line as the basis). In the early exit equation, we also included a variable that indicates whether household income increased between the 9-month and the 2-year survey. The income variables were included to refl ect varying degrees of need for WIC benefi ts within the WIC-eligible population. We characterized the household's assets with an indicator variable for home ownership. We included an indicator variable for being employed any time during the 12 months prior to the child's birth and, in the early exit equation, a variable to capture the mother's return to work after giving birth. We captured the mother's experience with other assistance programs in the early exit equation with an indicator variable for participation in TANF, the Food Stamp Program, or Medicaid since the birth of the child. We also included variables to capture the mother's use of welfare as a child (with no cash welfare receipt as the basis). We included variables to describe characteristics related to a woman's prenatal care and her smoking history. The equations included variables that indicated whether the woman had prenatal care other than her WIC visits and how she paid for it (with payment through private insurance as the basis) and a variable that indicated whether the mother had smoked at least 100 cigarettes during her lifetime. Two variables in the early exit equation captured the initiation and duration of breastfeeding. One variable indicated that the child was never breastfed and the other variable indicated that the child was breastfed for less than 6 months (with the child breastfed 6 months or more as the basis). An additional variable in the early exit equation indicated whether the child was low birthweight. We included indicator variables for the region of residence (with residence in the West as the basis) and for the population size of the locality for the household (with population of 50,000 and above as the basis). We included variables to capture State-level WIC policies that may affect WIC participation. Understanding the relationship between State-level WIC policies and WIC participation can help inform decisions regarding policy design. However, these policies are likely to be correlated with other unobserved characteristics of the State, and therefore the coeffi cient estimates on these variables should be interpreted with caution. A number of these policies are expected to decrease the transaction costs of WIC participation, thus decreasing the likelihood of delayed entry or early exit. In some States, household receipt of Supplemental Security Income or certifi cation for free or reduced-price meals in the National School Lunch Program confers income eligibility for WIC, so participants in these programs do not have to document income to establish income eligibility for WIC. The number of WIC offi ces per 1,000 people living in poverty per State is included as a measure of access to the program. WIC-only stores are designed to facilitate the redemption of WIC vouchers and reduce the stigma of doing so. Therefore, we also included the number of WIC-only stores per 1,000 people living in poverty in the State. Another set of State policy variables may increase the transaction costs of WIC participation, thus increasing the likelihood that households will delay entry or exit early. One variable indicated whether States require prenatal WIC participants to pick up WIC vouchers every month, rather than every 2 or 3 months. A variable was included to indicate that the State documents all identifi ed nutritional risks of participants, rather than just the primary nutritional risks. We included an indicator variable for whether WIC offi ces in the State collected dietary intake information from all, rather than just high-risk, participants and an indicator variable for whether dietary intake information was collected through 24-hour recall, which is estimated to be more time consuming than a food frequency checklist, the other primary method for collecting dietary intake information (Institute of Medicine, 2002). Finally, three variables were included to represent State-level differences in WIC benefi t packages. As mentioned earlier, larger perceived benefi ts were expected to increase the likelihood of entering early or exiting late. Two of the variables indicated whether a certifi ed WIC staff person was allowed by the State to tailor an individual's food package according to their nutritional needs or preferences. One variable indicated whether the State allowed caseworkers to specify the type of milk to reduce fat, lactose, or calories, while another variable indicated whether the State allowed the sucrose content of cereal to be reduced. It is not clear how these tailoring practices will infl uence WIC participation. The average retail value of the WIC food package, which can vary across States as a result of food package tailoring practices and differences in food prices, was also included. All descriptive and regression analyses were weighted using a weight constructed to refl ect population totals and to adjust for survey nonresponse. 25 The standard errors of all regression models were adjusted to account for heteroskedasticity and for clustering at the State level since all mothers in a State face the same WIC policies. The results from the probit analyses are presented as marginal effects evaluated at the means of the independent variables. The results from the multinomial logit regression analysis are presented as odds ratios.

"}, {"section_title": "Comparability of ECLS-B Coverage Rates and Offi cial Coverage Rates", "text": "The information in table 2 can be used to estimate WIC coverage rates within the longitudinal framework of the ECLS-B, which we refer to as ECLS-B coverage rates. As noted previously, the ECLS-B does not have adequate information to estimate eligibility separately for the prenatal, postnatal-infant, and child periods. We created an eligible sample using data from the 9-month survey, which most closely matched the prenatal and postnatal-infant periods. Therefore, our ECLS-B coverage rates were derived by dividing the number of eligible households that participated in WIC in each period by a fi xed number of eligible households. In contrast, the offi cial WIC coverage rates were calculated using cross-sectional data on the number of WIC participants (either in total or by category) relative to the estimated number of eligible individuals in that category. The ECLS-B coverage rates are not intended to replace the offi cial methodology for computing coverage rates. Instead, we estimated the ECLS-B coverage rates to assess their comparability with offi cial coverage rates. We found that the ECLS-B coverage rates, created by tracking the same set of eligible mother-child pairs over time, followed the same hump-shaped pattern observed in the offi cial 2007 WIC coverage rates in fi gure 1. The ECLS-B coverage rate among prenatal households was 68.3 percent (the sum of rates for participation patterns 1, 2, 3, and 4 in table 2). The ECLS-B coverage rate increased to 79.1 percent in the postnatal-infant period (the sum of rates for participation patterns 1, 2, 5, and 6), and fell to 65.0 percent in the child period (the sum of rates for participation patterns 1, 3, 5, and 7). The most notable disparity was seen in the child period, where the ECLS-B coverage rate of 65.0 was higher than the offi cial WIC coverage rate for children, which has ranged from 45.0 to 47.3 percent in recent years (USDA, 2009). This disparity is likely a result of two major differences in the measures. First, the ECLS-B coverage rate used data only up to the child's second birthday, while the offi cial WIC coverage rates for children used data on children up to their fi fth birthday. Second, the ECLS-B coverage rate calculation relied on a fi xed sample of eligible households, while the offi cial coverage rate used estimates of concurrent numbers of eligible households. In addition to producing comparable patterns of WIC coverage over time, the ECLS-B produced similar demographic statistics on WIC participants as those generated using administrative data. Tiehen and Jacknowitz (2008) demonstrated that the demographic characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, and age, of prenatal WIC participants in the ECLS-B were quite similar to those of participants in administrative data. The comparability of coverage rates and the demographic characteristics of WIC participants is evidence that the ECLS-B data are appropriate for our analysis of WIC participation dynamics."}, {"section_title": "Dynamic WIC Participation Rates", "text": "In table 3, we arranged the eight possible WIC dynamic participation patterns into groups that display the dynamic transitions in participation that are the focus of our study. Panel A of table 3 shows the percentage of WIC participants who remained in the program from one study period to the next, as well as the percentage who exited the program between study periods. As shown in panel A, almost all prenatal participants (95.4 percent) stayed in the program during the postnatal-infant period; only 4.6 percent left the program between the prenatal and postnatal-infant periods. While it is unusual for a prenatal WIC participant to leave WIC during the postnatal-infant period, the rate of exit between the postnatal-infant period and the child period was much higher. Almost a fourth (22.9 percent) of postnatal-infant participants left WIC when the survey child turned 1 year old. 26 Panel B of table 3 displays the percentage of WIC participants in the later two study periods who had participated in a previous period, and the percentage that entered the program between study periods. About a fi fth (17.6 percent) of postnatal-infant participants entered WIC after the survey child's birth. 27 In contrast, it was unusual for a participating household to enter WIC between the survey child's fi rst and second birthdays. Almost all (96.5 percent) participants in the child period had received WIC in a previous period. In summary, among households that participated in WIC at some point during the study periods, the two most common transitions in participation were: 1. From nonparticipation in the prenatal period to participation in the postnatal-infant period (delayed entrance); and 2. From participation in the postnatal-infant period to nonparticipation in the child period (early exit). Given the importance of these two transitions, we focused on postnatal-infant participants, examining the factors associated with a delay in their WIC enrollment until after an eligible woman gives birth and the exit from WIC after a child turns 1 year old."}, {"section_title": "Results for Postnatal-Infant WIC Entrants", "text": "As shown in table 4, delayed entrants appear to be more advantaged than households that participated in both the prenatal and postnatal-infant periods 26 It is important to note that we only observed households up to the second wave of the survey, when the child was approximately 2 years old. 27 The fi nding that 17.6 percent of postnatal-infant participants entered WIC after the survey child's birth is consistent with evidence from Cole et al.

The estimated marginal effects from the probit regression of postnatal WIC entry are displayed in table 5. It is important to note that, because the analysis compared those who entered in the postnatal period with those who entered in the prenatal period, it did not provide information on the factors that prevent WIC receipt altogether. The regression results supported the fact that WIC participants in better economic circumstances were more likely to delay WIC participation until the postnatal-infant period. WIC participants with better maternal education and higher household income relative to the poverty line were more likely to delay entrance until the postnatal-infant period. For example, a household with a mother holding a college degree was 8.6 percentage points more likely to delay entry than a household with a mother without a high school degree. These factors suggest that households that delay entry into the program may not have been eligible in the prenatal period. The regression results also indicated a strong relationship between prenatal Medicaid coverage and prenatal receipt of WIC. Compared with those covered by private health insurance, WIC participants with Medicaid coverage during the prenatal period were 15.0 percentage points less likely to delay WIC participation until the postnatal period. Given that participation in Medicaid provides adjunctive eligibility for WIC, these fi ndings were not surprising. Those with neither private insurance nor Medicaid were also less likely to delay receipt of WIC until the postnatal period, although the estimated marginal effect was relatively small. There was also evidence that geographic location may be a factor in the timing of WIC participation; women who reside in the Northeast and those who reside in urban areas with a population of at least 50,000 (the omitted category) were more likely to delay participation until after having a child. State policies also infl uence the decision to delay participation. WIC participants residing in States where participation in SSI confers WIC eligibility were less likely to delay, while those living in States that allow the food package to be tailored to reduce sucrose content were more likely to delay. Counter to expectations, participants in States with a greater number of WIC offi ces per 1,000 individuals living below the poverty level were more likely to delay. As noted previously, it was diffi cult to identify the effect of Statelevel policies in a cross-sectional analysis, given that they may be correlated with other unobserved State characteristics. To test the sensitivity of our regression results to the inclusion of the State policy variables, we examined two other specifi cations of both the delayed entry and early exit equations. The two other specifi cations were identical to our full specifi cation, except that the fi rst excludes the WIC State policy variables and the second includes State fi xed effects (results available from authors). The results were generally not sensitive to these two alternative specifi cations."}, {"section_title": "Results for Participants Exiting WIC", "text": "As shown in table 4, households that exited the program after a child turned 1 year old were more economically advantaged than those that remained on WIC Participation Patterns: An Investigation of Delayed Entry and Early Exit / ERR-109 Economic Research Service/USDA the program along a variety of outcomes, including their household income relative to the poverty line, maternal employment before and after birth, and participation in other assistance programs. Interestingly, households that exited were less likely to have breastfed their child for 6 months or more. Table 6 shows the estimated marginal effects from the probit regression of early exit from the WIC program. The estimation results in columns 1 and 2 of table 6 provide further evidence that households exiting the WIC program after the child turns 1 year old were more advantaged than those that remained in the program. Households in which the mother has a college degree were more likely to exit, and those in which the mother had not been employed since the birth of her child were less likely to exit. In addition, there was a negative association between a participating household's income relative to the poverty level and the likelihood that the household exits WIC. As noted previously, our analysis sample consists of households that were estimated to be eligible in the year before the 9-month survey. Therefore, it is possible that more advantaged households leave the WIC program because they lose their eligibility, which we did not capture in our primary analysis sample. Table 6 demonstrates that postnatal-infant WIC participants who experienced an increase in household income between the two waves of the survey were 6.0 percentage points more likely to leave WIC than those whose incomes remained constant or decreased. In order to address the possible loss of program eligibility, we used data from the second wave of the ECLS-B to estimate eligibility for WIC after the child turned 1 year old. Unfortunately, the timing and structure of the survey questions in the second wave did not allow us to estimate WIC eligibility as precisely in the child period as in the year before the 9-month survey. 28 Using a rough estimate of WIC eligibility, however, can shed some light on the role of loss of program eligibility on program exits. We estimated that 8.9 percent of all postnatal-infant WIC participants and 19.2 percent of exiting households lost WIC eligibility in the year prior to the second wave of the ECLS-B. Columns 3 and 4 of table 6 display the results of the probit regression of child exits from WIC among the sample of roughly 90 percent of postnatal-infant WIC participants that were estimated to have remained WIC eligible after the survey child turned 1 year old (the restricted sample). Even among the sample that retained eligibility, the regression results indicated that WIC exits were more likely among more advantaged households, although the estimated marginal effects were not as large. Among both the primary analysis sample and the restricted sample, WIC households in which the mother never breastfed or breastfed for less than 6 months were more likely to exit than WIC households in which the mother breastfed for 6 months or more. This fi nding suggests that the transition from receipt of the infant food package, which contains infant formula, to receipt of the child food package may play a role in the decision to exit WIC."}, {"section_title": "Self-Reported Explanations for Early Exits", "text": "The ECLS-B contains information from a subset of mothers on why they stopped receiving WIC benefi ts for their child. 29 Mothers were asked: \"Why are you no longer using WIC vouchers to buy food or formula for [CHILD] or [TWIN]?\" Possible responses included: \"Not eligible anymore,\" \"Eligible but denied benefi t due to lack of program funds,\" \"No longer need food benefi t,\" \"Program is too much effort (benefi ts are not worth the time and effort to get them),\" \"Lack of transportation and/or scheduling problems,\" and \"Temporary administration issues prevent child from participating (plan to reapply to program).\" Mothers were allowed to choose only one response. Table 7 shows that approximately a third of exiting households reported that they no longer participated because they believed they were no longer eligible. Over a fourth (27.8 percent) of mothers reported that their children exited the program because they no longer needed the food benefi ts. For exiting households that reported a lack of eligibility or a lack of need, the program appears to be operating as intended. However, of exiting households that reported lack of eligibility, we estimated only a third lost eligibility in the year prior to the second wave of the ECLS-B. This discrepancy may be due to the limitations 28 There are two primary limitations to estimating WIC eligibility in the child period. The fi rst limitation is that, for over half of the primary analysis sample, the second wave of data collection occurred after the survey child turned 2 years old. For these households, the data collected on income during the previous 12 months did not cover the point at which they exited WIC. The second limitation is that the structure of the questions on program participation (used to determine adjunctive eligibility) between the two surveys made it diffi cult to ascertain the time period for program participation. 29 Not all mothers were asked about the reasons for their children exiting the WIC program when the child turned 1 year old. Mothers of children who exited during the fi rst wave of data were not asked about the reason for their exit. Households where only the mother participated in the postnatal-infant period and then exited were not asked the survey question. of our estimate of WIC eligibility in the child period, or it may indicate that these households were not clear about WIC eligibility rules. In addition, other explanations cited by mothers, including that the program requires too much effort or that they have scheduling and/or transportation problems, suggest that the costs of participation may be a barrier to continued WIC participation for some children. Interestingly, very few households (less than 1 percent) reported that they were eligible for the program, but were denied benefi ts due to the lack of program funds. This fi nding offers important evidence that, although WIC is not an entitlement program, very few WIC households exit the program when a child turns 1 year old due to funding shortfalls. Marginal effects from probit regressions: Early exit from WIC among postnatal-infant WIC participants-continued To gain further insight into these exits from WIC, we used multinomial logit regression to examine the factors associated with the four most common explanations for WIC exits. The regression results, presented in table 8, compare each of the four groups leaving WIC with those who stayed in the program. The estimates are presented as odds ratios, which indicate how the ratio of the probability of exiting WIC for a specifi c reason to the probability of remaining on the program changes with a 1 unit change in the independent variable. Therefore, an odds ratio greater than 1 implies that the characteristic was associated with an increased probability of leaving WIC for the specifi ed reason. Households that were more economically advantaged had a greater chance of leaving WIC because they were no longer eligible or because they no longer needed the food benefi ts. WIC participants with more education and those who had an increase in income between the two surveys were more likely to exit the program due to reported ineligibility. Those with low income relative to the poverty line and those who participated in other assistance programs in the 9 months after the birth of the survey child were less likely to exit the program due to reported ineligibility. In addition, if the mother did not work after the birth of the survey child, there was a lower likelihood that the household would exit WIC due to a lack of need for food benefi ts. No breastfeeding and a shorter duration of breastfeeding by the mother were associated with a greater chance that the household would leave WIC because the household no longer needed the benefi ts. This result corroborates the evidence from the probit regression on early exit that infant feeding practices play a role in the decision to exit the program and suggests that some nonbreastfeeding mothers who stop receiving infant formula when their child turns 1 year old may not see a need for the lowervalue WIC benefi ts available in the child package. It is important to note that the relationship between breastfeeding and WIC exits may differ in the context of the revised WIC food packages, which have been available since 2009, after the period of this study. The other two explanations for WIC exits indicated that the household was challenged by the effort required to participate in WIC. Living in the South or the Northeast was associated with a higher likelihood of exiting WIC because the program required too much effort and the benefi ts were not worth the time. 30 Residing in a State that allows WIC food packages to be tailored to reduce sucrose was associated with a greater likelihood of exiting WIC for three of the four reasons discussed, but the policy was more strongly associated with WIC exits due to the program requiring too much effort and/or scheduling or transportation problems than to exits due to lack of perceived eligibility. 30 It should be noted that when we make a Bonferroni adjustment to the signifi cance level cut-offs to account for the multiple hypotheses tested with the multinomial logit, the estimated effect of the region variables becomes insignifi cant.

We also found that prenatal Medicaid coverage was strongly correlated with earlier receipt of WIC, suggesting that each program may serve as a gateway for the other, especially since Medicaid recipients are adjunctively eligible for WIC. Results suggest that WIC's provision of infant formula and participants' breastfeeding decisions played a role in the early exit from the program. Households in which the mother breastfed for a longer time were less likely to exit WIC. Other explanations that play a role in the early exit from the WIC program included loss of eligibility, reduced need, and diffi culties accessing benefi ts. There were almost no reports from participants exiting WIC that they were denied benefi ts due to lack of program funds, which supports anecdotal evidence that States have received suffi cient funds in recent years to provide benefi ts to all eligible people. The regression results, indicating that economically advantaged households were more likely to delay entry into the program and to exit early, and the maternal self-reports on exit reasons suggest that loss of eligibility played a role in nonparticipation. Results also suggest that nonparticipants had a reduced need for benefi ts, indicating that the program was operating effectively for many households. We found evidence, however, that late entrants and early leavers still exhibit need and may be confused about their WIC eligibility, suggesting that increased outreach or program changes could increase the duration of these participants' exposure to WIC services. For example, mothers in participant households who did not breastfeed or breastfed for less than 6 months were more likely to exit, and therefore may warrant special attention by WIC agencies."}]
