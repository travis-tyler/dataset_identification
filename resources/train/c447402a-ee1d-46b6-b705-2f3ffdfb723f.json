[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: Recently, the field of gene-gene or gene-environment interaction research appears to have gained growing interest, although it is seldom investigated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, the current study aims to investigate interaction effects of the key genetic and environmental risks-the apolipoprotein \u03b54 allele (APOE4) and family history of late-onset AD (FH)-on AD-related brain changes in cognitively normal (CN) middle-aged and older adults. Composite standardized uptake value ratios were obtained from PiB-PET and FDG-PET images in the AD signature regions of interests (ROIs) and analyzed. Voxel-wise analyses were also performed to examine detailed regional changes not captured by the ROI analyses. Results: A significant synergistic interaction effect was found between the APOE4 and FH on amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deposition in the AD signature ROIs as well as other regions. Synergistic interaction effects on cerebral glucose metabolism were observed in the regions not captured by the AD signature ROIs, particularly in the medial temporal regions. Conclusions: Strong synergistic effects of APOE4 and FH on A\u03b2 deposition and cerebral glucose metabolism in CN adults indicate possible gene-to-gene or gene-to-environment interactions that are crucial for pathogenesis of AD involving A\u03b2. Other unspecified risk factors-genes and/or environmental-that are captured by the positive FH status might either coexpress or interact with APOE4 to alter AD-related brain changes in CN. Healthy people with both FH and APOE4 need more attention for AD prevention."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "Decades of research on sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, the most common form of dementia, have shown that AD dementia is a multifactorial disease with a wide variety of genetic and environmental factors playing a role in the age of onset, risk, and etiology [1] . Numerous heritable and inheritable risk factors have been linked with AD pathogenesis. Nevertheless, to date, only a limited number of studies have investigated the interaction effect between the major risks on in-vivo AD-related brain changes which can reflect the pathogenesis of AD. Information about whether the major risks of AD dementia can synergistically increase AD-specific brain changes before the onset of dementia symptoms will likely help identification of a more urgent target population for the preventive efforts against AD dementia.\nThe apolipoprotein \u03b54 allele (APOE4) is a major risk factor for AD dementia and is associated with a decade or more mean age at onset decrease in AD symptoms [2] . Numerous studies have reported a relationship between APOE4 and AD-related brain changes such as increased amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) deposition and decreased glucose metabolism even in cognitively normal (CN) elderly individuals, although with some inconsistencies in the degree of effects [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Notably, functional brain abnormalities associated with APOE4 as identified by decreased cerebral glucose metabolism in the AD-related brain regions were found in healthy volunteers even as young as 20-39 years old [10] . Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis has shown strong effects of APOE4 on not only the prevalence of amyloid pathology but also the age of onset of AD dementia [11] . Despite some inconsistencies, the presence of strong effects of APOE4 on A\u03b2 deposition and cerebral glucose metabolism has been repeatedly and undeniably shown.\nIn recent years, evidence has accumulated for other genetic and environmental factors that influence AD-related brain changes [1] . Having a first-degree family history of AD dementia (FH) is another well-known risk factor for developing AD dementia and is considered to encapsulate both genetic and environmental risk loads [12] as it not only captures heritable genetic susceptibility but also other shared dietary, psychosocial, and somatic factors that are shown to be associated with an individual's risk for developing AD dementia [13] [14] [15] . Similar to APOE4, the effects of FH on AD-related brain changes including A\u03b2 deposition and glucose metabolism are present even in CN individuals, although less consistently [16] [17] [18] .\nPrevious research shows that FH and APOE4 highly co-occur [19, 20] and, conceivably, their effects on developing AD dementia may overlap. However, given that they reflect different hereditary factors (i.e., genetic only or both genetic and environmental), it is likely that an interaction of the effects of FH and APOE4 exists for AD-related brain changes such that having both FH and APOE4 will lead to synergistic influences on AD-related brain changes compared to when an individual has only one of the two risk factors. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the synergistic interaction effects of FH and APOE4 on AD-related brain changes, specifically A\u03b2 deposition and glucose metabolism, in cognitively intact adults. In this context, the purpose of the current study was to test the hypothesis that APOE4 and FH have synergistic interaction effects on cerebral A\u03b2 deposition and glucose metabolism in healthy middle-aged and older adults."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "This study is a part of the Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early Diagnosis and Prediction of AD (KBASE), an ongoing prospective cohort study that began in 2014 designed to identify novel biomarkers for AD and to explore various lifetime experiences contributing to AD-related brain changes.

The most notable finding was a significant increase in A\u03b2 deposition if an individual was an APOE4 carrier with a positive family history for AD. While the synergistic interaction effect of FH and APOE4 on cerebral glucose metabolism was not found in the ROI analyses, voxel-wise analyses revealed that the synergistic interaction effect on glucose metabolism was in fact present in the temporal regions, including (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 1 the hippocampi. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study examining the interaction effects of APOE4 and FH on both A\u03b2 deposition and rCMglc. A body of literature devoted to investigating the genetic risks of AD has largely focused on either APOE4 or FH. The current findings on the interaction effects of FH and APOE4 on A\u03b2 deposition and rCMglc further delineate the nature of the relationship between the two risk factors on signature AD brain changes. As can be inferred from the interaction effects, differences in the proportions of FH + individuals included in the study samples may account, at least in part, for varied magnitudes of the effects of APOE4 reported in the literature. Conceivably, the commonly reported effects of APOE4 on AD brain biomarkers in the literature may actually be the effects seen in FH + APOE4\n+ compared with other groups. A similar argument can be made regarding the investigations of the effects of FH on AD brain biomarkers since the effects of FH were only seen in APOE4 carriers. Given the significant synergistic interaction effect, a simple application of statistical adjustment to achieve independency of the effects of either one of the risk factors may be misrepresenting.\nA question arises as to the role played by a family history of AD in APOE4 carriers. The results from the current study strongly suggest that the APOE4 carriers with a family history of AD are more susceptible to alterations of the signature AD brain biomarkers before the onset of any cognitive symptoms. A positive family history status may represent other susceptibility genes that are either coexpressed or interacting with APOE4. It has been posited that gene-gene interactions account for much of the unexplained variances in AD status [31] and that these interactions are widespread and common [32] . For example, clusterin (CLU; involved in AD pathogenesis directly by influencing A\u03b2 aggregation and clearance [33, 34] ) is found to interact with APOE4 [35, 36] . Bridging integrator 1, whose role is implicated in tauopathy [37] , is thought to interact with the CLU [38] . In addition to the known genetic risks for AD possibly interacting with each other, there is a possibility that FH + is capturing additional genetics that are considered unrelated to AD but interact with the AD genetic risks. Delineation of the role of genetics in the diagnosis and risk prediction in late-onset AD is complicated since up to 75% of APOE4 carriers do not develop AD and up to 50% of individuals with AD are APOE4 noncarriers [39, 40] . A twin study that examined genetic and environmental influences on AD reported that additive genetic influences explain 79% of the variance in the AD phenotype as opposed to 21% explained by nonshared environmental influences; when shared environmental influences were added to the analysis model, however, the variance in the AD phenotype explained by additive genetic influences changed to 58%, and 42% of the variance was explained by environmental influences (both shared (19%) and nonshared (23%)) [12] . Furthermore, a more recent study using the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium data and Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis method reported that 53.24% of phenotypic variance was explained by genetics [41] . Given that (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 2 Regions showing significant differences in A\u03b2 deposition from voxel-wise analyses. ) needs to be considered carefully as they may interact with APOE4 and other genetic risks. Shared environmental factors, which are seldom reported in association with A\u03b2, include a family's socioeconomic status, place of living (e.g., urban versus rural), lifestyle or dietary habits, parents' educational attainment and intellectual environment, and exposure to pollution [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Cognitive activity during the early life stage, for example, has been found to be associated with reduced neurodegeneration in AD signature regions in later life [47] . Although the abovementioned environmental factors may not individually show strong effects on AD, a combination of the environmental factors with APOE4 or other genetic risks may exhibit meaningful influences on AD neuropathology.\nWhile independent main effects of APOE4 and FH were observed on A\u03b2 deposition, there were no differences in cerebral glucose metabolism between the FH groups or the APOE4 groups in the brain regions typically affected in clinical AD patients in the current sample of cognitively normal elderly whose degree of degeneration is not yet progressed enough to be detected. In line with the findings by Lowe et al. [5] who showed that most of the APOE4-related differences in hypometabolism are mediated by amyloid accumulation, hypometabolism associated with APOE4 or FH in the AD signature regions in the current sample was only observed in individuals with high A\u03b2 deposition (Additional file 1: Figure S1 , Table S5 ), suggesting that the effects of APOE4 or FH on cerebral glucose metabolism only begin to show when the disease is progressed. Moreover, the hypometabolic pattern observed, particularly in the medial temporal regions, in association with FH + and APOE4 + status (Fig. 3) is noteworthy given that these regions are where phosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology is first to develop prior to accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles [8] . Taken together, the current cross-sectional observation in the CN likely reflects early observation of abnormal A\u03b2 biomarkers prior to the onset of changes in glucose metabolism in the AD signature regions, which supports the amyloid pathological cascade model [48] .\nA strength of the current study is that the study participants were recruited from the community and that the sample includes a large number of APOE4 + and FH + individuals despite relatively lower proportions (18% and 19%, respectively) compared with previous studies (24-43% and up to 66%, respectively) [5, 6, 8, 9, 16, 18] . The studies based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, for instance, frequently recruited from family members of AD patients such that the samples included a large proportion of FH + individuals, and these samples included a large proportion of A\u03b2-positive CN individuals (e.g., 47%) [1, 5, 49] , which is considerably higher than the current sample (13%). The current findings on the independent effects of APOE4 and FH on A\u03b2 deposition and glucose metabolism are therefore relatively robust from differences in the proportions of APOE4 + or the number of FH + individuals included in the total sample. Similar to previous studies on FH, steps were taken to ensure that AD diagnosis in the subjects' parents was accurate, such as including only the subjects whose parent's AD diagnosis was made by a clinician according to the established criteria. Also, in a few cases where parents were deceased before formal diagnosis was available in clinics (i.e., parents of our old-old participants), a thorough interview was conducted with family members by a psychiatrist with expertise in dementia research to sufficiently address the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the AD diagnosis. Nonetheless, our cohort may have included a few participants whose parents did not have AD but instead had other types of dementia since the information obtained regarding those parents without a formal diagnosis is subject to recall bias. In the future, an investigation into possible protective effects of the APOE \u03b52 allele will allow further understanding of its role in the interaction effect of APOE and FH."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The current study was the first attempt to elucidate the interaction effects between FH and APOE4 on cerebral A\u03b2 deposition and glucose metabolism in cognitively healthy adults. The strong synergistic effects of APOE4 and FH on brain A\u03b2 deposition and hypometabolism that were found indicate possible gene-to-gene or gene-to-environment interactions that are important for the pathogenesis of AD. Such a synergistic effect also indicates that individuals with both FH and APOE4 are the population that needs more attention with regard to preventive interventions. "}]
