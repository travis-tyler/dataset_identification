[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The explosion of digital healthcare data has led to a surge of data-driven medical research based on machine learning. In recent years, as a powerful technique for big data, deep learning has gained a central position in machine learning circles for its great advantages in feature representation and pattern recognition. This article presents a comprehensive overview of studies that employ deep learning methods to deal with clinical data. Firstly, based on the analysis of the characteristics of clinical data, various types of clinical data (e.g., medical images, clinical notes, lab results, vital signs, and demographic informatics) are discussed and details provided of some public clinical datasets. Secondly, a brief review of common deep learning models and their characteristics is conducted. Then, considering the wide range of clinical research and the diversity of data types, several deep learning applications for clinical data are illustrated: auxiliary diagnosis, prognosis, early warning, and other tasks.\nAlthough there are challenges involved in applying deep learning techniques to clinical data, it is still worthwhile to look forward to a promising future for deep learning applications in clinical big data in the direction of precision medicine."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "(PACS), Laboratory Information Systems (LIS), and Radiology Information Systems (RIS). Digital clinical data has increased rapidly over recent decades, with the massive amounts of clinical records being accumulated in medical institution. It brings tremendous opportunities for healthcare research. More specifically, reliable systems based on clinical big data and data-driven approaches are critical to study the relationship between diseases and clinical symptoms, to observe diseases development trends, and to explore risk factors related to various diseases.\nOver the last few decades, most analyses of clinical data have used traditional statistical machine learning methods, such as Logistic Regression (LR) [1] , Support Vector Machines (SVM) [2, 3] , Decision Trees (DT) [4] , Random Forests (RF) [5] , Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [6] , Bayesian Networks (BN) [7] , Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [8, 9] , and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [8, 10] . Those methods have achieved some reliable results across many subfields of clinical studies. In recent years, deep learning [11] has been under vigorous development and has achieved great success in many competitions [12] [13] [14] [15] , due to its superior performance in learning the feature representation from raw data in an end-to-end way. Adding more hidden layers to a neural network allows a deep architecture to express more complex hypotheses, because the hidden layers can capture the nonlinear relationships [16] . In combination with the large volume of data and Graphical Processing Units (GPU), deep learning makes it possible to explore clinical data in the direction of precision medicine.\nThe motivation of our review is to provide a valuable overview for researchers concerned with the application of deep learning methods to clinical studies. First, the characteristics of clinical data and the diverse types of clinical data are discussed. Second, after a brief introduction to the deep learning models which have been most commonly used in clinical data analysis, we divide the applications into several categories and summarize the applications of deep learning models to different types of clinical data. Finally, we discuss the challenge of applying deep learning to clinical analysis and propose future research directions. This paper is different from other recent surveys, some of which are devoted to review deep learning applications in the context of biomedical informatics [16, 17] , ranging from genomic analysis to biomedical image analysis, and some others of which are only concerned about deep learning applications for a specific data type, such as medical images [18, 19] . In general, this paper pays close attention to the variety of different types of clinical data and the application of deep learning methods to them."}, {"section_title": "Clinical Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of clinical data", "text": "An Electronic Health Record (EHR) of a patient includes many kinds of clinical data and plays an important role in medical research. It is reported that the world's electronic health data has reached 500 petabytes in 2012 and the total is expected to reach 25 exabytes by 2020 [20] . In recent years, intelligent wearable devices have arisen to collect personal daily health data (such as blood sugar, blood pressure, and heart rate), which further accelerates data growth. We are witnessing clinical data growing at an unprecedented rate, accompanied by a growing variety of data sources (structured relational forms, unstructured images or text, semi-structured records). At the same time, some real-time data is produced in the moment and needs to be retrieved and analyzed immediately for timely decision making. It is obvious that clinical data has the \"4Vs\" characteristics of big data: big volume, large data variety, high velocity of data generation/update, and high veracity leading to big value [21] . Moreover, privacy is an important and specific characteristic of clinical data. Medical records include Protected Health Information (PHI) of patients, e.g., real name, gender, age, location, phone number, and birth date. This makes it different from user information in social networks, which can include a nickname or fake identification. Some of these PHIs (such as gender and age) are meaningful for clinical analysis. However, it is prohibited to release data arbitrarily for research, considering the protection of patient privacy. This presents as an obstacle to organizing and sharing public clinical databases."}, {"section_title": "Different types of clinical data", "text": "Clinical data is quite heterogeneous. During a medical treatment process, a large amount of information relating to a patient's health status is generated and presented in various forms. In what follows, clinical data is discussed by dividing it into three main categories (medical images, clinical notes, and all others)."}, {"section_title": "Medical images", "text": "With the development of medical imaging techniques, there is much medical image data being generated by X-rays, Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), microscopy image, and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) [22] . Due to the great successes that deep learning has achieved in computer vision, researchers have been quick to apply deep learning methods to the processing of medical image data.\nMedical images are direct raw data or first-hand information reflecting a patient's status. Different clinical imaging techniques have their own advantages in detecting pathological changes in different organs. Ophthalmic imaging is specific for the eyes [23] [24] [25] , MRI is good at the detection of pathologies of the brain [26] [27] [28] , cardiac system [29] [30] [31] , and bone and joints [32] [33] [34] , CT is better on the abdominal organs [35] [36] [37] and chest [38] [39] [40] , while X-ray performs well on the chest [41] [42] [43] and breast [44] [45] [46] . However, the labeled samples of medical images that can be used for training are far lower in number than social network image samples. The input of medical images can be categorized as vector format, 2D pixel or 3D voxel values, which are suitable for typical multilayer neural networks and convolutional networks, respectively. Deep learning methods have been applied to medical images for computer-aided pathology detection, image segmentation, and disease classification."}, {"section_title": "Clinical notes", "text": "Besides images, text is one of the most important categories of EHRs, in the form of discharge summaries [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] , various kinds of measurement reports [53] [54] [55] , and death certificates [56] . Several studies based on clinical text have been carried out on discharge summaries. Because a discharge summary usually records the whole procedure of medical treatment. It contains rich information, including descriptions of lab test results, physician diagnoses, drugs, and treatments.\nIn addition, some further information is indirectly recorded in discharge summaries, for example, chief complaint, family history, medical history, and allergies are attained from patients. Measurement reports usually summarize the examination results, which are clues to diseases inference.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) technology and machine learning methods have been applied to various clinical notes. The free text of clinical notes is usually turned into a sequence of vectors by one-hot or distributed representation. The clinical free text has been used for some significant tasks, such as medical concept extraction, named entity recognition, disease classification, drug-allergy reactions, and phenotype extraction and de-identification. Furthermore, clinical notes are combined with medical images in some studies to improve system performance."}, {"section_title": "Other types", "text": "Outside of medical images and clinical notes, there are other types of clinical data that are rarely used for independent analysis. To name a few, the results of physiological measurements (lab results, vital signs), demographic information, payment and insurance information, and so forth. Most of this data is stored in two-dimensional relational tables.\nThe results of laboratory tests are also part of EHR. Generally, those results are presented as numeric values, which can provide objective evidence for physicians to observe the status of a patient. Nevertheless, diverse lab items have different units and different reference ranges of normal values (considering age and gender). For that reason, normalization is necessary before analyzing lab test results. Lab results are usually combined with clinical notes or demographic information to predict the risk of disease [57] or mortality [58] , to model patient trajectory [59] , and to recommend medication dosing [60] .\nA large volume of real-time data is generated by monitoring devices, i.e., electrocardiogram and multi-parameter monitors. These are essential devices for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and postoperative monitoring [61, 62] . Smart wearable devices can also provide real-time healthcare data in the conditions of everyday life [63] . These vital signs can be collected to construct retrospective temporal datasets, which are useful for trajectory analyses of disease development [64] and can improve the effectiveness of clinical decision making [65] .\nIn general, demographic information, such as gender, location, age, and marital status, is recorded in a structured table. Although demographic information involves issues of patient privacy, it is a good data resource for statistical analysis in order to observe distribution characteristics of diseases. For example, Cheng et al. [66] used the in-house data from the national disease surveillance for a population-based longitudinal analysis of trends in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) mortality from 2006 through 2013 in China that reported differences based on location (urban/rural), sex, age group, and external cause of TBI.\nIn addition to the aforementioned data types, there are some data indirectly related to disease, such as payment, charge, and insurance information. These data are yielded to and stored in healthcare systems each day, and usually utilized to perform statistical analysis for commercial purposes.\nAlthough masses of clinical data are generated every second in hospitals, researchers can have very limited access to even a small amount of it. Many clinical studies that have declared their experimental data are drawing on private datasets collected from specific hospitals or research institutions. Some high-quality datasets supported by specific projects are available for purchase, such as some nationwide databases provided by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) [67] . Those datasets collect data beginning in 1988 and contain encounter-level information on basic health care [68] .\nFortunately, there are still some datasets available for public access after receiving approval. Here, we list six public datasets that are used commonly in clinical studies and contain different types of clinical data (see Table 1 ). Some of them focus on specific diseases such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) [69, 70] , Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) [71] , and Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) [72] . Some of them collectd specific data type. For example, the ADNI and the Grand-Challenges datasets [73] mainly consist of medical images, while the i2b2 challenge datasets [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] are made up of clinical free texts. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) [79] [80] [81] is a large, public, and freelyavailable de-identified database from ICU, containing comprehensive data which is widely used in clinical studies. Overall, the data of the first four datasets in Table 1 is more systematic, while the last two datasets are released to meet some pecific challenge. Recently, several researchers are interested in pursuing studies based on the fusion of data. Multiple data sources can bring a more comprehensive understanding of patients and improve the accuracy of disease prediction [82, 83] ."}, {"section_title": "Deep Learning Models", "text": "In recent years, deep learning methods have shown high effective for a broad range of big data analyses and consequently have become a center of research attention. Deep learning involves a wide variety of approaches and has achieved promising early successes in medical research. In this paper, we briefly introduce the most common deep learning models that have been used to analyze clinical data. The details and architecture of each model are not mentioned here, since they have been discussed at length in the existing literature."}, {"section_title": "Deep neural networks", "text": "A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with multiple hidden layers between the input and output layers. Each hidden layer can be seen as a process of feature extraction. The higher layers can composite the features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network. This enables a DNN to model complex non-linear relationships using training data. To solve different problems, multiple variants and extensions have been developed. Thus far, several extended models have been introduced in the literature, as follows."}, {"section_title": "Convolutional neural networks", "text": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known as shift invariant and space invariant ANNs, which are based on their shared-weights convolutional kernels and translation invariance characteristics [84] . CNNs are widely used in computer vision and NLP, and have achieved promising results on many tasks in both of these fields. It is also the first and most widely used deep learning model in clinical fields. CNNs have greatly promoted medical image research for imaging diagnosis, image segmentation, and Electrocardiograph (ECG) monitoring [85] . CNNs and their variants can capture overall structural features from feature-rich images. The most recent well-known CNN architecture is U-net, proposed by Fu et al. [86] , which can derive the full context of an image by combining an equal amount of upsampling and downsampling layers [87] . ResNet [88] is another popular variant of CNN utilized for medical images, which can ease gradient backpropagation flow and improve optimization convergence speed [89] .\nRecently, dense CNNs [90] have alleviated the vanishinggradient problem, strengthened feature propagation, encouraged feature reuse, and substantially reduced the number of parameters [91] . For medical texts, CNN can be used to predict diagnosis codes from clinical notes [48] . Much research has shown that CNNs are better at extract medical terminology information than traditional methods like SVM [47, 50] . In addition, there are some basic tasks of NLP on biomedical texts that have been explored with CNNs, for example, named entity recognition in biomedical texts [92] and Mesh indexing [93, 94] ."}, {"section_title": "Recurrent neural networks", "text": "A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a kind of deep feed-forward ANN. The connections between the units of an RNN form a directed graph along a sequence. RNNs have taken a central place in sequence data processing despite the gradient vanishing problem generated by long input sequences. A variant of RNN called a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been proposed to solve the problem by introducing gate mechanism and memory cell [95] . In addition, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a simplified version of LSTM. These two varieties can achieve a better performance than the plain model for long sequence processing. RNN is mainly used to solve sequence related problems, such as sentence classification, speech recognition, and machine translation. It has been used for the retrospective analysis of clinical temporal sequence data, and Choi et al. [96] applied the LSTM model to address clinical decision support problems by predicting future disease diagnosis along with corresponding timely medication interventions. The feature extraction of clinical text is another important application of RNN. In particular, it has been used to predict diagnosis codes based on medical text [49, 50] and has been applied to clinical name entity recognition [97, 98] ."}, {"section_title": "Restricted Boltzmann machines", "text": "A Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a generative stochastic ANN that can learn the probability distribution over a set of inputs. It is an unsupervised learning model and designed for feature extraction in unlabeled training data. Feature extraction by an RBM is helpful for the original classification problem. For example, Khatami et al. [99] proposed a robust RBM-based classification model for X-ray images. Hua et al. [100] introduced a model for a Deep Belief Network (DBN), which is a hierarchical stack of RBM, to address the nodule classification for supervised learning tasks, especially with CT images."}, {"section_title": "Deep autoencoders", "text": "Deep autoencoders have the same purpose as RBMs. Proposed by Hinton and Salakhutdinov [101] , they are mainly designed for feature extraction or dimensionality reduction. The purpose is to reconstruct the inputs. In order to improve the capability of mastering important information and learning richer representations from training data, a number of variants have been introduced over recent years, such as the Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE) [24] , Stacked AutoEncoder (SAE) [102] , and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). In relation to clinical data, Sharma et al. [103] presented a feature extraction technique for medical images using SAEs and found the method helpful for improving the performance of medical image retrieval.\nIn summary, the intention of deep learning is representation, which means representing the features of input data effectively by multilayer neural network training. The deep learning methods mentioned above have made great progress in the study of clinical data. Moreover, the combination of models has brought more opportunities for effective analysis. For instance, Kong et al. [30] detected the end-diastole and end-systole frames in cine-MRI of the heart based on a combination of LSTM and CNN. The combinational model was extensively validated on thousands of cardiac sequences in which the average difference is merely 0.4 frames. Chen et al. [104] combined a bi-directional LSTM with 2D U-net-like-architectures to improve the structure segmentation of anisotropic 3D electron microscopy images. The combination model achieved promising results compared to the known deep learning 3D segmentation approaches."}, {"section_title": "Applications", "text": "Mass clinical data is crucial for carrying out clinical studies. It contains the complete information associated with a patient's health status, clinical features, clinical therapies, and treatment effects [105] . Recently, deep learning models have been successfully applied in the secondary use of clinical informatics to improve knowledge discovery in healthcare. According to the clinical studies literature, multimodal clinical data (i.e., images, text, test results) have been utilized separately or in fusion in different clinical tasks. According to the target of application, we discuss four domains of application of deep learning models on all kinds of clinical data: auxiliary diagnosis, prognosis, early warning, and other tasks."}, {"section_title": "Deep learning for auxiliary diagnosis", "text": "Most studies in this domain look to capture patterns of patients from clinical data, aiming to support clinical decisions by inferring the risk of a specific disease or identifying the characteristics of a certain disease from a control cohort.

Medical imaging classifications typically use one or multiple images as inputs for a training model with a single diagnostic variable as output (e.g., disease onset or not). Transfer learning is popular in this task, because plenty of natural image resources in computer vision can be used to pre-train deep networks. Gulshan et al. [24] applied CNN to automatically detect diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema in retinal fundus photographs. The model had been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. An impressive work was published by Esteva et al. [12] , who fine-tuned a pre-trained version of Google's Inception v3 architecture on medical data and performed classification of skin lesions using a single CNN. The model achieved near-human-expert performance by training in an end-to-end manner based directly on images (using only pixels and disease labels as inputs). Diverse deep models have been used for classification based on clinical exam images. Brosch et al. [27] and Plis et al. [28] applied DBNs to classify patients of nervous system diseases. Suk and Shen [102] used SAEs to classify Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). However, CNN and its variants are playing leading roles in the most recent papers on disease classification based on medical images. For example, Guerrero et al. [89] proposed a CNN model which can classify white matter hyperintensities and stroke lesions. Prediction [96, 106] or inference [107] , according to EHRs or clinical notes, usually concerns the future onset of diseases. RNNs are more commonly employed for this [108] . Choi et al.

They inferred the cause of death (ICD code) by analyzing death certificates together with the association of autopsy reports and clinical bulletins. Shi et al. [49] proposed a hierarchical RNN model with an attention mechanism that can automatically assign ICD diagnostic codes according to a given written diagnosis description. Li et al. [48] combined Doc2vec and CNN for ICD-9 automatic coding based on MIMIC datasets. Recently, Guo et al. [110] proposed a disease inference model based on bidirectional LSTM considering the symptom-disease associations. Yu et al. [111] performed automatic coding experiments on Chinese clinical notes.

Although we are witnessing an explosion of healthcare data, very little is available in open access datasets for clinical studies. One aforementioned major reason for this is the protection of patient privacy. Most of the valuable datasets are held by specific hospitals or research institutions. In addition, the real data gathered first-hand from hospital information systems has some deficiencies, such as errors, noise, and missing values. These two reasons make it difficult to gather useful big data sets. However, the main challenge is the acquisition of relevant annotations or labels for data, which requires extensive manual labor supported by medical staff. The lack of large labeled data sets is often mentioned as an obstacle, and is particularly noticeable for clinical image data. A clinical image dataset usually consists of dozens or hundreds of labeled samples. Moreover, the scarcity of samples of some rare diseases makes it hard to use deep learning approaches.\nClinical data comes in various formats (image, text, waveform, numeric, Boolean type), and combining data from different sources is not easy. For example, medical images are seldom used together with the other types of clinical data. The representation of differently formatted data and the mechanism for fusing them are both vital issues.\nOn the other hand, raw data from hospitals cannot be directly used as input for deep learning models. The consistency and normalization of data is another tough problem. For instance, the same diagnosis description may be labeled with different ICD code versions by two different institutions. Preprocessing or normalization of data is necessary before training. There are several classification schemes and ontologies that are used for recording relevant medical information and events, for example, the ICD code for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury; Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) for procedure; Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) for laboratory measurements; and RxNorm for medication codes. However, those schemes are inconsistent between institutions. Partial mappings are maintained in terminology databases such as the United Medical Language System (UMLS) and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). In order to use multi-source clinical data effectively, analyzing and harmonizing data across ontologies and among institutions is an ongoing area of research.\nMoreover, deep learning theories have not yet provided complete solutions. For that reason, some researchers remain skeptical about the utilization of deep learning for clinical analysis. The main criticism of deep learning is the interpretability of models, which is essential for clinical application. Researchers always describe their models as an \"end-to-end\" way or a \"black box\". There are sets of hyperparameters in a deep learning model, such as the size and the number of filters in a CNN, the depth of a model, the learning rate, and the value of dropout. The setting of these hyperparameters that control the architecture of a model remains a blind exploration process that usually requires accurate validation.\nTraditional machine learning methods, such as LR, SVM, DT, RF, CRF, and BN, have also been used effectively to analyze clinical data [71, 146] . Putting aside their performance, they have better interpretability and are less time-consuming than multilayer deep learning models in most cases. In fact, an interpretable model that can analyze data quickly enough and provide decision support efficiently is what we are seeking in clinical research."}, {"section_title": "Outlook", "text": "With the development of deep learning techniques in the big data era, there are opportunities for future deep clinical research. The fusion of heterogeneous data and the reasonable combination of different approaches have come to the foreground as promising ways forward. The integration of clinical data, genomics data, and social behavior data may make precision medicine reality just as we expected, realizing the goal is \"to provide the right treatment to the right patient at the right time\" [147] . Furthermore, various combinations of deep learning models can be expected to achieve better performance. In order to model an interpretable human-like computation system, it can be helpful to join deep learning methods with medical ontologies, rule-based systems, and traditional machine learning solutions. Moreover, developing systems which can perform real-time analysis on continuous vital signs would help medical staff observe life-threatening pathological changes in a timely fashion and provide appropriate treatment as early as possible.\nIn conclusion, this paper provided a brief overview of deep learning applications on clinical data. It presented the categories of clinical data and their characteristics, an introduction to the common deep learning models used in clinical studies, a summary of the various applications, and a discussion of challenges and the further outlook. The paper's aim was to provide valuable insights for researchers concerning clinical data studies. The characteristics of clinical data and the variety of types of data bring both opportunities and challenges. It is encouraging that deep learning methodologies have improved predictive models in many cases. However, the interpretability of such models remains an elusive goal. With a further understanding of deep learning architecture, there is the hope of better understanding the predictions and recommendations given by deep learning models. Collaboration with other approaches can result in greater achievements in clinical analysis and provide effective assistance to clinical decision making in the foreseeable future. "}]
