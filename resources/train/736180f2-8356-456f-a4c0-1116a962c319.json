During and after the storm, compounding with heavy precipitation and upland drainage, inundation can be caused by the combination of storm surge and river-induced inland flooding in various locations throughout the coastal plain. Thus, coastal inundation can be expanded from the open coast upstream into the tributaries of the New York Bay including the Hudson and East River systems. Given the cross-disciplinary nature of the dynamics (encompassing hydraulics, oceanography, and hydrology), and the complexity of the atmospheric forcing, a numerical model is the optimal approach for a comprehensive study of the hydrodynamics of coastal inundation. This study will utilize the large-scale parallel SELFE model to simulate the storm surge and inundation caused by 2012 Hurricane Sandy utilizing different forecast wind and pressure fields. The large-scale numerical model made use of multiple inputs for atmospheric forcing and spatially covered a large domain area to account for large-scale oceanographic processes and output accurate model simulation of water levels. In a simultaneous effort, a street-level sub-grid inundation model coupled with Lidar-derived topography (UnTRIM 2 ) was employed to simulate localized flooding events in the New York Harbor. Sub-grid modeling is a novel method by which water level elevations are efficiently calculated on a coarse computational grid, with discretized bathymetric depths and topographic heights stored on a sub-grid nested within each base grid cell, capable of addressing local friction parameters without resorting to solve the full set of equations. Sub-grid technology essentially allows velocity to be rationally and efficiently determined at the sub-grid level. This salient feature enables coastal flooding to be addressed in a single cross-scale model from the ocean to the upstream river channel without overly refining the grid resolution. To this end, high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) were developed utilizing GIS from Lidar-derived topography for incorporation into a sub-grid model, for research into the plethora of practical research applications related to urban inundation in New York City. SELFE large-scale storm tide simulations were successfully conducted for 2012 Hurricane Sandy using both the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), and the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) atmospheric hindcast model results as atmospheric inputs. Overall statistics using the 24km resolution NARR inputs observed an average R 2 value of 0.8994, a relative error of 11.77%, and a root-mean-squared error of 32.69cm for 10 NOAA observation stations. The 4km RAMS inputs performed noticeably better at all 10 stations with aggregate statistics yielding an average R 2 value of 0.9402, a relative error of 4.08%, and a root-mean-squared error of 19.22 cm. Since the RAMS atmospheric inputs possessed a higher spatial and temporal resolution than the NARR inputs for air pressure and wind speed, it was concluded that generally superior storm tide predictions could be expected from utilizing more reliable or better resolution atmospheric forecast products. xix UnTRIM 2 results were obtained via sub-grid simulation of 2012 Hurricane Sandy in the New York Harbor with high-resolution topography and building heights embedded in the model sub-grid for New York City. Model performance was assessed via comparison with various verified field measurements: (1) Temporal comparison of NOAA and USGS permanent water level gauges, (2) USGS rapid deployment water level gauges, along with a spatial inundation comparison using (3) USGS-collected high water marks, (4) FEMA-collected data regarding inundated schools, (5) calculated area and distance differentials using FEMA's maximum extent of inundation map, and (6) known locations of inundated subway entrances. Temporal results verified the effectiveness of the sub-grid model's wetting and drying scheme via seven over land rapid deployment gauges installed and collected by the USGS with a mean R 2 of 0.9568, a relative error of 3.83%, and a root-mean-squared error of 18.15cm. Spatial verification of the inundation depths predicted by the UnTRIM 2 model were addressed by comparison with 73 high water mark measurements collected by the USGS and by 80 FEMA-reported water level thicknesses at inundated schools throughout the sub-grid domain separated by state. Average statistics for the 73 USGS-recorded high water marks for New York and New Jersey were: 0.120\u00b10.085m and 0.347\u00b10.256m for root-mean-squared error \u00b1 standard deviation, respectively. The larger differences and errors reported in the point to point comparisons for New Jersey relative to New York were largely due to the lack building representation in the sub-grid DEM for the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, and was a significant indication that the representation of buildings as a physical impediment to fluid flow is critical to urban inundation modeling. A maximum difference threshold was imposed for distance and area comparisons with FEMA's Hurricane Sandy flood map using the average distance differential rounded to 40m. This was done to minimize the impact of missing or added infrastructure such as highway overpasses along with Lidar-derived data limitations of physical impediments to fluid flow not accounted for in the model's DEM. The difference in the absolute mean distance between the maximum extent predicted by the street-level sub-grid model and the FEMA maximum inundation observation was 21.207m or 4 sub-grid pixels at 5m resolution for the entire sub-grid domain. The final area comparison resulted in an 85.17% area (49,253,687m 2 ) spatial match, with 7.57% area (4,376,726m 2 ) representing model over-prediction, and under-prediction area accounting for 7.27% (4,202,376m 2 ), with differences being attributed to lack of building representation in the FEMA maximum inundation map. Additionally, the implementation of the FEMA's spatial flood map data as a \"bathtub\" model derivative product of USGS interpolated high water marks and elevation data without regard for strong water current velocities or estuarine circulation can also account for regions with significant discrepancies. 1 CHAPTER 1: Introduction"}, {"section_title": "Literature Review", "text": "A storm surge is an aperiodically anomalous rise of sea level accompanied by a tropical or extratropical storm system, wherein surge height is the distinction between the observed sea level and the forecasted water level (NWS, 2009). Several distinct processes can potentially alter the water level in tidal regions; the pressure effect, the wind effect, the Coriolis Effect, the wave effect, and the rainfall effect (Harris, 1963). Coastal inundation initiated via storm surge along the U.S. East Coast is a substantial threat to residential properties, community infrastructure, and human life. Furthermore, prolonged inundation from heavy precipitation and upland drainage during and after a storm has passed can significantly increase coastal flood damage. There are additional implications for inundated coastal habitats, as a major flood event can dramatically alter the regular function of an ecosystem. In order to mitigate loss of human life and damage to coastal properties, several numerical models have been developed to provide an early warning system for storm surge and inundation events in various coastal study areas (Blumberg and Mellor, 1987;Flather et al., 1991;Leuttich et al., 1992;Jelesnianski et al., 1992;Westerink et al., 1994;Casulli and Stelling, 2011;Arumala, 2012). The storm surge model currently employed in forecast and hindcast efforts by the U.S. government is the Seas, Lakes, and Overland Surge from Hurricane (SLOSH) model. SLOSH was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Jelesnianski et al., 1992), and effectively separates the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts into 30+ overlapping basins with polar, elliptical, or hyperbolic shapes to produce 2 grids for modeling overland flooding (Glahn et al., 2009). Furthermore, for a structured grid model like SLOSH to provide adequate coverage over a large domain area and maintain fine-resolution near the coast without sacrificing computational efficiency, a polar, elliptical, or hyperbolic grid with gradually spatially varying cell size is typically utilized to represent an expansive model domain with some limitations (Zhang, K. et al., 2008). This permits the model grid to cover a sizable basin extending from inland areas potentially inundated via storm surge events, to the deeper waters of the open ocean hundreds of kilometers from the shore. Due to geometric shape limitations of structured grid cells, structured grid models typically prove to be inadequate in their representation of complex shoreline geometry and deep shipping channels present in major waterways (especially in the Chesapeake Bay). Likewise, the intransigent size limitations associated with structured grids usually hampers their capability to cover a satisfactorily large enough model domain to account for the remote wind effect (Blain et al., 1994;Shen and Gong, 2009). The Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) model is a second-generation storm surge model that makes use of a continuous Galerkin finite element numerical scheme, and a generalized wave continuity equation to provide a dampened solution free of noise (Westerink et al., 1994). ADCIRC uses an unstructured grid to resolve complex shoreline geometry and accurately represent the bathymetry of shallow water, and currently uses a large domain grid complete with an offshore boundary at approximately 1800 km from the Chesapeake Bay entrance at 60\u00baW longitude. This large domain grid has been utilized by ADCIRC, the Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM), and the Semi-Implicit Eulerian-Lagrangian Finite Element model (SELFE) as part of the Southeastern Universities Research Association coastal inundation modeling initiative as a testbed for modeling success (Luettich, 2011). This grid covers the entire the U.S. Atlantic Coast and Gulf of Mexico to surmount some of the shortcomings of most structured grid models like the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and SLOSH. With this perceived advantage over structured grid models, ADCIRC has helped established successes for unstructured grid models on varying topics relevant in the field of physical oceanography, ranging from large-scale tide and storm surge modeling to inundation simulation (Blain et al., 1994;Westerink et al., 1994;Shen and Gong, 2009). This study will make use of a robust semi-implicit finite difference/finite volume model for three dimensional flows, UnTRIM 2 (Unstructured Tidal Residual Intertidal Mudflat Model, Version 2). UnTRIM 2 has been formulated and proven on unstructured orthogonal grids (Casulli and Zanolli, 1998Casulli, 1999;Casulli and Walters, 2000), and in recent years, the model has been shown to tremendously improve its formulation to inherently account for infinitesimally detailed sub-grid elevation features without substantially increasing computational effort. These advancements in UnTRIM 2 make it ideal for modeling inundation, which involves virtual representation of water flooding beyond complex geometric shorelines with many unique spatial features that can be greatly enhanced with improved resolution without the detriment of increased computing time (Casulli and Stelling, 2011). Modeling in the mid-Atlantic Bight has been successfully performed previously with the serial version of SELFE (Cho, 2009). To expand upon this success, this study will make use of the MPI parallel version 3.1 of SELFE to capitalize on the additional computing power provided to process a large domain cast on a spherical coordinate system. These features being of paramount importance for a large-scale super-regional model, the entire model domain covers the U.S. Atlantic coastline from 23\u00b0N to 47\u00b0N (Figure 1.1). This expansive curvilinear large domain grid covers from the Florida Keys to Nova Scotia out into the Atlantic Ocean to 62\u00b0W, and increases the likelihood of properly modeling the effects of an approaching tropical storm system. Cho's (2009) dissertation focused upon 2003Hurricane Isabel and 1999 Hurricane Floyd and baroclinic responses in the Chesapeake Bay as a result of these two tropical storm systems. Recently, 2011 Hurricane Irene followed a path similar to 1999 Hurricane Floyd across the Chesapeake Bay from the Southwest to Northeast across the Virginia Eastern Shore with congruent strength and intensity (Masters, 2011). The similarities in the two storm systems are scientifically important, as 2011 Hurricane Irene did substantially more flood damage than did 1999 Hurricane Floyd, making 2011 Hurricane Irene important for study within the scope of a large-scale storm surge model (Rugaber and Wagner, 2011;Walsh, 2011). Recently, there has been a renewed interest for improving accuracy and reliability of storm surge and inundation models. This is attributed primarily to the severe damage left in the wake of 2012 Hurricane Sandy on the U.S. East Coast. In the dissertation by Teng (2012), considerable focus was placed on the incorporation of a Wind Wave Model into the 3-D hydrodynamic model, SELFE, to accurately model the forerunner of 2008 Hurricane Ike in the Gulf of Mexico. Additional focus on storm surge in scientific studies is also due in part to the potential increase in the strength and frequency of hurricanes associated with sea level rise concomitant with global climate change. This effort will provide physical oceanographers, government decision makers, and the general public 5 alike, with a better understanding of physical processes while advancing the operational capabilities for improving real-time prediction systems (Blain et al., 1994;Wang et al., 2005;Bernier and Thompson, 2006;Li et al., 2006;Kohut et al., 2006;Gong et al., 2007Gong et al., , 2009Shen, 2009;Cho, 2009;Xu et al., 2010).  A successful method for improving the accuracy and reliability of storm surge inundation models has been to augment the resolution of the model domain using Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR or Lidar). This technology is a quick and effective method to collect topographic data accurate to within a couple of centimeters in vertical resolution to populate a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) (Cobby et al., 2001). The use of Lidar data to prepare a high-resolution DEM to interpolate onto a model grid is of paramount importance in the interest of increasing model resolution for improved accuracy and reliability of hydrodynamic model results. The use of Lidar in unstructured model grids has already seen some successes in modeling inundation with close to 30m resolution using the Eulerian-Lagrangian CIRCulation (ELCIRC) model, the predecessor to the SELFE model (Shen, 2009;Gao, 2011). In the thesis by Shen (2009), ELCIRC was used to research the induced wave effect in association with 2006 Hurricane Ernesto. Gao's thesis (2011) utilized a similar unstructured ELCIRC model grid with incorporated Lidar topography in the Hampton Roads region of Virginia in the central U.S. East Coast, to investigate the important roles played by the remote wind versus local wind effects on water level fluctuations in relation to efficient operational forecast modeling during Nor'easter Nor'Ida in November 2009. It was demonstrated in this study that Ekman transport is a key mechanism affecting the magnitude of storm surge inside the Chesapeake Bay during a long duration of continuous wind forcing (Gao, 2011). Taking this process a step further, inundation modeling using Lidar data could be further improved using a sub-grid modeling technique for improved resolution down to 5m grid resolution with nominal cost to computation time. Thus, the sub-grid modeling method using Lidar data is potentially ideal for improving real-time prediction in finite regions. When water from Hurricane Sandy's storm surge floods into New York City, it will encounter complicated and unique developed land surfaces characterized by a wide range of features ranging from waterfront berms, streets, railroads, parks, highways, subway stations, bridges, to a variety building types. High-resolution hydrodynamic models can be used as a tool to evaluate the impact of these local features into the prediction of maximum storm surge extents in an ultra-urban environment. Even with ample computing resources available today, it is still insufficient to model all complex topographic features at the individual building scale or at street-level resolution. Recent research demonstrates that, provided Lidar data of topographic heights and sufficient bathymetric water depths, both of which can be collected with very high resolution, it has been recognized that the availability of detailed bathymetric data within a coarse grid model can be used to further improve model accuracy (Casulli, 2009;Loftis et al., 2013). Currently, the highest-resolution DEM freely available along the U.S. East Coast is located within the region of the New York Harbor, comprised of a 1m resolution DEM derived from Lidar data with an average point spacing of 0.5m. This study aims to improve upon previous storm surge studies by incorporating Lidar topographic data into a sub-grid model capable of 5m resolution to resolve complicated geometry neglected by grid size limitations of the previous storm surge modeling efforts. As the highest grid resolution recorded from the previously discussed modeling efforts was 1 arc sec (\u224830m resolution), sub-grid scalability (down to 5m resolution) is critical for correctly modeling the maximum extent of inundation in storm surge scenarios. Visualization of inundation results is a valuable asset in illustrating the potential devastation associated with modeled or forecasted events, and has proven to be an accurate method of both representing and assessing damages in hindcast models. Moreover, flood warnings issued by various government authorities can sometimes be confusing or misinterpreted by the general public. An accurate inundation extent map superposed on orthophotographs and satellite imagery is proposed to draw attention to key societal and economic outcomes from flooding. In the interest of successfully conveying inundation model results to both scientific audiences and the general public most effectively, a Google Earth/Maps visualization using Keyhole Markup Language (KML) will be produced."}, {"section_title": "The Impact of 2012 Hurricane Sandy", "text": "Hurricane Sandy was the second-costliest hurricane on record (after 2005 Hurricane Katrina) to make landfall in the United States. While only a Category 1 storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale when it made landfall in Atlantic City, NJ, Hurricane Sandy was directly responsible for 73 deaths, and amounted to more than $65 billion dollars in assessed damages in the United States (NOAA NCDC, 2013;Smith and Katz, 2013). Hurricane Sandy reached peak strength on October 25 th as a Category 3 storm offshore of Cuba in the Caribbean Sea. On October 28 th , while it was a Category 2 hurricane east of the Atlantic shelf break, the storm measured a wind swath of 1,100 miles (1,800 km) in diameter, making it (spatially) the largest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history (Gutner, 2012). Along the path of the storm across seven countries, a total of 286 people died with total international damage estimates surpassing $68 billion dollars (Smith and Katz, 2013 Sandy would be pushed back out to sea by the advancing front (Blake et al., 2013). However, the front weakened as it crossed the Appalachian Mountain Range, and the farreaching effects of Sandy's winds could be felt more than 900km from the eye of the storm (Gutner, 2012 "}, {"section_title": "Scope of Study", "text": "Numerous storm surge models have been developed and applied along the U.S. East Coast, and they vary upon grid type (structured/unstructured) or upon the numerical schemes used (implicit, semi-implicit, explicit), with examples including SLOSH, ADCIRC, FVCOM, and others noted in the literature review (Jelesnianski, et al., 1992;Westerink et al., 1994;. This study will use SELFE, a semi-implicit finite element model using an Eulerian-Lagrangian scheme which is not restricted by the Courant Friedrichs-Lewy stability criterion, and thus permits the use of larger model time steps and robust computations (Zhang and Baptista, 2008). The Global 2-D mode of SELFE uses a spherical coordinate system, which will be applied for the simulation of 2012 Hurricane Sandy in a large-scale simulation covering entire U.S. Eastern Seaboard using hindcast atmospheric inputs. The goal of the large-scale approach is to ensure that storm tide driven by the hurricane from the ocean is accurately simulated in the major estuaries and waterways near the coast, with model results being evaluated for accuracy by verified NOAA tidal gauge observations. In a simultaneous effort, a highly-resolved, sub-grid inundation model (Casulli and Stelling, 2011), will make use of Lidar-derived DEMs specifically produced for the where timing, depth, and extent of the inundation will be validated via USGScollected field-verified measurements."}, {"section_title": "3.", "text": "Evaluating the capability of sub-grid modeling, which uses a non-linear solver and the conveyance formula to improve model accuracy down to the street-level scale without the high computational costs of simulation on a fully-fledged highresolution grid.\nThe Lidar topography data with QA/QC can be imported into the sub-grid mesh to resolve buildings and the streets in the ultra-urban environment of metropolitan New York City.

The model will serve as a broad scalingresolution storm surge model with the application of being a practical choice for use in simulating large-scale to small-scale phenomena."}, {"section_title": "Governing Equations", "text": "The SELFE model is governed by the 3-Dimensional shallow-water equations with the Boussinesq approximation, along with associated transport equations for salinity and temperature. The equations are solved for free surface elevation, water velocities, salinity, and temperature of the water, in a Cartesian coordinate system as specified in Zhang and Baptista's model description (2008): The differential equation system for Equations (2-1) to (2-5) is closed with respect to: the hydrostatic approximation (2-6), the equation of state, describing water density as a function of salinity and temperature, and definition of the tidal potential and the Coriolis Effect (Zhang et al., 2004). Furthermore, the system is closed via parameterizations for both horizontal and vertical mixing through the turbulence closure equations, and applicable initial and boundary conditions. The numerical algorithm utilized in SELFE is explained at length in Zhang and Baptista (2008) is built into the model code as a smoothing function to suppress the static measurements (Shapiro, 1970). A finite-volume approach is applied to a typical prism, to solve for vertical velocity, as depicted in Figure 2.1, because it serves as a diagnostic variable for local volume conservation when a steep slope is present in the model grid bathymetry (Zhang et al., 2004). In this case, vertical velocity is solved from the bottom to the surface, in conjunction with the bottom boundary condition. The closure error between the calculated w at the free surface and the surface kinematic boundary condition is an indication of the local volume conservation error (Luettich et al., 2002). Since the primitive formulation of the continuity equation is solved in the model, infinitesimal error is associated with this closure methodology. Recently, newer versions of SELFE (> v3.1) have a spherical coordinate option which is based on the work by Comblen et al. (2009). Various 3-D Cartesian frames are used to solve the equations in their original form. Since the distances are all measured in the physical space, a very fine-resolution grid is achievable with these coordinates, and thus can be utilized to optimally simulate the entire East Coast by using this coordinate system for storm surge inundation research. Also, the new Global SELFE model has a barotropic two-dimensional mode which solves the depth-integrated barotropic shallowwater equations in spherical coordinates utilizing a finite-element solution: where U is the depth-integrated current in the x-direction, and V is the depth-integrated current in the y-direction, \u03c4 s,winds is surface stress due to winds, and \u03c4 s,waves is surface stress due to waves, with \u03c4 b representing bottom stress. The formulations in the 2-D version utilize the 2-D shallow water equations for momentum in the x-(Equation 2-7) and y-(Equation 2-8) directions, and continuity (Equation 2-9). The X and Y represent additional terms not included, such as horizontal viscosity and wave-induced radiation stress. These terms can be treated explicitly, thus do not influence the stability condition.  when tidal potential forcing is specified to be used.

A frequently used method for addressing the surface boundary condition involves utilizing a bulk aerodynamic algorithm to account for ocean surface fluxes under variable conditions of stability of the atmosphere (Zeng et al., 1998). This method is used when forcing SELFE using outputs obtained from an atmospheric model to drive storm surge simulations (Equation 2-11).

As such, the SELFE model, building upon the successes of its predecessors, has been documented to appropriately simulate flooding and drying in tidal flats and near-shore areas (Cho, 2009;Gong et al., 2009;Cho et al., 2012;Teng, 2012 (Manning, 1891;Blumberg et al., 1999).

The DEM was primarily configured in GIS ArcInfo v.10.1. The multiple topography datasets collected from the USGS National Elevation Dataset were mosaicked as rasters (1/3 arc sec or 10m resolution or better). The mosaic map operation made use of 32-bit float pixel type to preserve a significant number of digits (at least down to mm scale) for both positive and negative value elevations to produce a single geotiff of all USGS data called 'DEM_Hudsonb.tif'. According to the metadata, the primary data source for the USGS data were derived from final return Lidar point cloud data and preprocessed by the USGS to remove objects of the built environment such as city infrastructure and buildings. Once the regular quadrilateral grid cells have been built, the topography, bathymetry, and building ASCII DEMs were imported into the grid editor. Boundary polygons were subsequently generated for the grid using the previously imported polygon in the polygon mask layer. To complete creation of the land boundary, the system editor was used to edit the boundary markers to set the grid boundary marking the edges completely outside of all mask polygons, and then manually unselecting water boundaries along the south, west, and east as open boundaries, and setting the north boundary along the Hudson River as a flux boundary condition. The bathymetry layer 'B_DEM_bathy_2HarRvr2_5m2.asc' was then merged with the topography layer 'A_DEM_HarRvr2_5m.asc', to fill in a complete grid with topography and bathymetry. The buildings in layer: 'C_DEM_HarRvr2_5m_bldg.asc', which had been preprocessed out from the original Lidar point cloud data prior to being uploaded as geotiffs to the USGS Seamless Map Server were overwritten back on top of the merged topography and bathymetry DEM to account for the natural impediment to inundation posed by buildings in the final DEM. Given that the building density is extremely high in New York City, with many of the buildings being exceedingly tall or skyscrapers, using raw Lidar point cloud data would fail to sufficiently resolve streets. Finally, the sub-grid was generated with the specification of 40 divisions along each base grid cell edge to produce a 5m resolution sub-grid.

The Global SELFE 2-D model was run without salinity and surface wind forcing, using only tidal sinusoidal motion at the curvilinear open boundary. Eight harmonic tidal constituents were utilized along the 134 nodes at the open boundary to force the astronomical tide in the Atlantic Ocean. Four semidiurnal constituents (M 2 , N 2 , S 2 , and K 2 ) and four diurnal constituents (O 1 , P 1 , K 1 , and Q 1 ) were obtained via SMS 8.0 via the FES95.2 global model formulation for harmonic tides (LeProvost, et al., 1998), and were specified to calculate the water level at each element of the open boundary based upon the following tidal formulation (Equation 3-1): where the amplitude (of constituent i) is , the frequency is , and the tidal phase is . The nodal factor is provided by and the equilibrium argument via . Between these terms, only the tidal frequency is an absolute constant for a given constituent, as the amplitudes and phases are spatially variable, yet temporally constant values. Conversely, nodal factors and equilibrium arguments are spatially constant, but temporally variable values, and are critically important to synchronize the SELFE model outputs with NOAA observation data (Equation 3-1). The tidal simulation spanned 90 days and commenced on 09/01/2012 at 00:00 GMT through 11/30/2012 at 00:00 GMT. The tidal calibration made use of a 3-day spin up prior to the recording of numerical results via a hyperbolic tangent ramp-up function. The standard Manning coefficient of n=0.025 was used to calculate the bottom friction for most of the areas within the domain with the following exceptions: 1n=0.010 was used in the Hudson River, New York Harbor, and Raritan Bay, and 2n=0.045 in the East River up to its junction with the Hudson River. These values were consistent with Blumberg et al.'s 1999 study in the New York Bight using the ECOM model. Additionally, factors which may reduce the tidal potential forcing due to the Earth's tide were also accounted for via nodal factor and equilibrium arguments in the 'bctides.in' input file. Locations of the selected NOAA tidal gauge stations used for tidal verification of the model are displayed on the map in Figure 2.4, with time series results for the month of September shown in Figures 3.1A-E and related statistics in Table 3.1.       A harmonic analysis was conducted in MATLAB using the public domain software package 'T-Tide' (Pawlowicz et al., 2002), on tidal results from the last 90 days of hourly model outputs at 10 selected NOAA tide gauges along the U.S. East Coast near areas where Hurricane Sandy's impact was most evident. These stations were: Montauk, NY, New Haven, CT, Bridgeport, CT, Kings Point, NY, The Battery, NY, Bergen Point, NY, Sandy Hook, NJ, Atlantic City, NJ, Lewes, DE, and Duck, NC (Figure 2.4). Tidal prediction data were obtained from these NOAA gauges for the same time period for evaluation at each station, and analyzed for 4 major tidal constituents (Table 3.2). The overall statistical comparison yields excellent results upon application of the friction parameter adjustments noted in the previous paragraph, with an R 2 of 0.9787, a relative error of 2.00%, and a root-mean-squared error of 9.72cm (Table 3.2). Data tables of tidal amplitude and tidal phase between modeled tide and NOAA observed tide for the 8 major harmonic constituents that the model is driven by at the open boundary are presented in Table 3.2A and Table 3.2B. The SELFE model accurately predicts tidal propagation along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard and embayments within the model grid with good accuracy. In the tidal amplitude comparison, the SELFE model simulates the amplitude of the dominant M 2 tidal constituent very well at all of the 10 stations with a mean difference of -0.012\u00b10.058m (Table 3. to observe larger discrepancies in tidal amplitude. Small waterways and tributaries necessitate the use of higher grid resolution to resolve complex shoreline geometry and stark differences in bathymetry over diminutive distances, which is a particular challenge for very accurate water level modeling using gradually scaling resolution grids. The remaining principal semidiurnal constituents at the top of Table 3.2A had average harmonic differences of -0.002\u00b10.013m for the N 2 and -0.033\u00b1 0.019m for the K 2 tidal constituent. As for the diurnal tidal amplitudes, the mean differences for the 10 stations of interest were -0.008\u00b10.011m, 0.011\u00b10.007m, 0.005\u00b10.016m, and 0.000\u00b10.002m, for K 1 , O 1 , P 1 , and Q 1 , respectively (Table 3.2A). In the tidal phase comparison, Table 3.2B displays the mean difference of tidal phase between modeled tide and NOAA observed tide for the principal lunar and solar semidiurnal constituents, M 2 and S 2 , was 0.571\u00b11.980\u00b0 and -0.799\u00b12.614\u00b0, respectively. Sandy Hook, NJ, observed a shift in M 2 tide by 6.013\u00b0 and in the S 2 tide by -5.707\u00b0, accounting for much of the deviation (Figure 3.1D). The N 2 constituent yielded an average phase difference of -0.165\u00b10.087\u00b0, and the average difference for the K 2 constituent was -0.387\u00b10.442\u00b0.

While both forecast wind 50 fields compare reasonably well with the buoy observations (NOAA NBDC, 2012), the RAMS wind product has a higher temporal resolution of one hour, while the NAM wind field is updated every three hours. Regardless of the update frequency of the atmospheric forcings, the SELFE model will temporally interpolate the input data to synchronize with the model's time step. However, coarser temporal resolution will be interpolated over longer periods of time, potentially missing high frequency shifts in wind and pressure. The wind velocities for the NARR and RAMS inputs were amplified by 10% to account for potential wave-induced mechanisms influencing water levels. Research related to the influence of currents and wave interaction is being worked on, but is beyond the scope of this dissertation. Since a wind-wave model was not utilized in these storm tide simulations, wind velocities were increased by 10%, which translates to an increase in wind stress of approximately 20% throughout the domain. The upcoming sections address two different atmospheric models using unique wind and pressure fields to drive the SELFE model in order to simulate the influence of 2012 Hurricane Sandy.

Wind and pressure data were retrieved for the entire region covering the large scale SELFE model grid from 10/15/2012 at 00:00 GMT through 11/01/2012 at 00:00 GMT. Several 30-hour forecast series updating every 6 hours were combined to prepare the model input wind and pressure fields. Uncertainty in forecast accuracy increases the further into the future a model attempts to predict. Thus, a hindcast simulation using NARR forcings is conducted for comparison to yield the greatest potential for accuracy. The storm tide results generated by the NARR wind, shown by the red lines in capacity of the SELFE hydrodynamic model is consistent with the relative quality of the NARR wind product being employed. Thus, a superior storm tide prediction would be anticipated if a more reliable or better resolution forecast wind were utilized. The duration of the wind and pressure field data provided ranged from 10/24/2012 at 00:00 GMT through 10/31/2012 at 00:00 GMT, with a 1-hour temporal resolution. These atmospheric data products are a continuous hindcast simulation, being assembled in a similar fashion to the continuous NARR atmospheric data inputs. These are in contrast with the typical 30-hour forecast products updated every 3 or 6 hours. The product assimilates atmospheric observations from various sources, including Weatherflow's extensive network of meteorological stations. The SELFE model's atmospheric forcing field requires a fully expanded longitude-latitude grid, specific variable names, time units measured in days, and a time origin in a specific format to be read by the model's 'sflux' atmospheric input. The atmospheric data provided by Weatherflow were released as an interoperable NetCDF format, which can be adapted to the SELFE model input with minimal preprocessing effort. A short script utilizing NetCDF operators (such as 'ncap2', 'ncrename', and 'ncatted' from http://nco.sourceforge.net/ ) can augment and adjust the metadata of the Weatherflow product in less than 10 seconds of run time to support the SELFE model setup. To account for the shorter data range and partial grid coverage extent of the hindcast RAMS model outputs as effective atmospheric inputs, the storm tide simulation utilized the model's hotstart option using the NARR atmospheric inputs to \"spin-up\" the storm tide simulation from 10/15/2012 at 00:00GMT for 9 days until 10/24/2012 at 00:00GMT. At this time, the rapid deployment 4km RAMS model inputs were utilized throughout the extent of the region covered, with the NARR atmospheric data being used at grid nodes outside the extent of the RAMS atmospheric data coverage along the periphery of the grid. Combination of the two wind products is handled via the 'sflux9c.f90' file to blend the two data sources and provide a complete atmospheric input for the entire simulation period when two atmospheric inputs are simultaneously specified. It is evident that there were two storm surges converging upon New York City during Hurricane Sandy; one from the New Jersey coast, and the other from the Long Island Sound propagating westward. Figure 3.5E combines two coastal stations in Delaware and North Carolina, which are positioned within the 3rd and 4th quadrants of the Hurricane track where the counterclockwise wind motion has been weakened after passing over land. As the stations just north of Atlantic City, NJ (Figure 3.5A-D), were experiencing the maximum storm surge setup, these stations simultaneously experienced a water level set down, elucidated by the model results' response to the offshore wind field. It is also worth noting that the forerunner of the storm was so pronounced that it water levels were observed to consistently exceed the station's mean high water in Montauk, NY, for several days before storm made landfall through several days after. SELFE model performance with the RAMS atmospheric inputs were better than the storm tide resulting from the NARR atmospheric forcing (Table 3.3) with a mean R 2 value of 0.9402, a mean relative error of 4.08%, and an overall root-mean-squared error of 19.22cm. The relative error was observed to be less than 7.0% for the 10 NOAA observation stations, except for Lewes, DE, for which there is an observation error noted in the previous section. Therefore, the model dependably represented the hydrodynamics correctly using the RAMS atmospheric inputs (Table 3.4). are both robust, and relatively general (Casulli and Walters, 2000;Casulli and Zanolli, 2002;Casulli, 2009;Casulli and Stelling, 2011) (4-1) Coefficients for eddy viscosity can be derived from an appropriate turbulence closure model. Integrating the continuity equation over depth and using a kinematic condition at the free surface of the water yields the following free surface equation (4-4): where h(x, y) is the water depth measured from the undisturbed water surface such that , t) represents the total water depth. When wetting or drying is expected, the differential equations (4-1 through 4-4) are defined on a time-dependent horizontal domain \u03a9(t) defined as \u03a9(t) = {(x, y): H(x, y, t)>0} (Casulli, 2009). The boundary conditions at the free surface (4-5) are specified via prescribed wind stresses: where u a and \u03c5 a are the respective wind velocity components in the x-and y-directions, and \u03b3 T is a non-negative wind stress coefficient dependent upon wind speed. At the sediment-water interface, the bottom friction (4-6) is specified via: where \u03b3 B is a non-negative bottom friction coefficient; \u03b3 B can be given by the Manning-Chezy formulation, or via fitting to a turbulent boundary layer. In the UnTRIM 2 numerical scheme, local volume conservation is assured via the finite volume formulation. Simultaneously, a finite volume method is utilized to discretize the free-surface two-dimensional equation at each polygon to guarantee local and global volume conservation. Transport equations are solved using the sub-cycle upwind scheme, or by using the higher-resolution flux-limiter method (Casulli and Zanolli, 2005). Upon solving the transport equations, mass is also conserved locally and globally due to the finite-difference formulation. The Eulerian-Lagrangian method is applied in the UnTRIM 2 numerical scheme to solve the momentum equations, since this method facilitates high-accuracy discretization of the non-linear advection terms. The advection term is solved via the Lagrangian method, which is computed independently with each time step by the method of characteristics applied to a fixed grid domain. This combined method is especially efficient when applied to unstructured Cartesian grids (Casulli and Walters, 2000;Casulli and Zanolli, 2002). When the momentum equations are solved, this method combines the advantages of the Eulerian method with the Lagrangian method, via merging the ease of a fixed Eulerian grid with the computational strength of the Lagrangian method. The advantage of the Eulerian-Lagrangian method is that a sharp front of velocity (like a storm surge or large river discharge) is easier to trace because the system matrix becomes diagonal and symmetrical (Casulli and Zanolli, 2002). Additionally, this method enables the use of larger time steps than without the scheme, since small grid size no longer places as great of a constraint on the Courant number (Casulli, 1999;Casulli and Walters, 2000;Casulli and Zanolli, 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Model Setup and Configuration for 2012 Hurricane Sandy", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model Domain and Grid", "text": "UnTRIM 2 is an unstructured orthogonal grid model and differs from structured orthogonal grids (like those used with ROMS), in that orthogonal structured grids exclusively consist of four-sided structured polygons.

Sub-grid technology essentially allows velocity to be determined efficiently at the sub-grid scale. This salient feature enables coastal flooding to be addressed in a single cross-scale model from the ocean to upstream river channels without overly refining the grid resolution.

In Casulli's (2009) paper, the UnTRIM 2 sub-grid solution algorithm is referred to as a mildly nonlinear system for the free surface wherein the formulation for finite volume leads to a mildly nonlinear system for finite volume with respect to the free surface elevation. This nonlinear solver operates on the base grid cell sides, and is nonlinear because as volume increases the slopes of the river banks are not uniform (Aldrighetti and Zanolli, 2005). Since the \"container\" holding the fluid is a complex shape, and not idealized flat walls perpendicular to a flat river bottom as depicted in Figure 4.5A, the fluid volume increases and decreases nonlinearly with the rise and fall of the free surface of the water with the tide as shown in Figure 4.5B (Casulli and Zanolli, 2012). Given the anomalous rise in the free surface of 3.5m observed at The Battery, NY, the storm surge causes a nonlinear increase in volume transport as the flood waters are not constrained by the riverbanks and freely flood into Jersey City and New York City as observed during Hurricane Sandy (Figure 4.5C). Since cross section area is not calculated using only one average value for the base grid edge, as in the conventional modeling approach (Figure 4.3), but using multiple sections to estimate cross-sectional area using the divisions specified in the sub-grid; the wet volume (first term of the continuity equation times area) may be more accurately approximated (Figure 4.4), leading to more accurate non-linear volume transport calculations (Figure 4.5) (Casulli, 2009;Casulli and Stelling, 2011). A likewise-comparison of a base grid against a sub-grid mesh of identical resolution illustrates the classical modeling trade-off of favoring minimal computing time over accuracy (Casulli and Zanolli, 2012). Ideally, the traditional modeling approach would utilize a base grid only, at 5m resolution, and thus would involve minimal approximation but become extremely computationally expensive. For example, the subgrid for New York City includes 4,496,833 sub-grid cells, which would need to be resolved within the core computational grid in a conventional hydrodynamic model with a 5m grid resolution. Furthermore, the same size domain at 1m resolution would require a grid containing >110 million cells, thus requiring enormous computing power to simulate. Therefore, attempting to resolve these unique topographic and bathymetric differences in the conventional modeling sense is impractical. The sub-grid modeling approach affords substantial computational savings via solving the shallow water equations presented in Section 4.1 at the base computational grid while storing the discretized bathymetric depths and Lidar-derived topographic heights within the sub-grid (Casulli, 2009). Using the formulation presented in the next section, this study will perform sensitivity tests using various resolution base grids to verify that there is minimal decline in the computational accuracy in the New York Harbor during 2012 Hurricane Sandy when utilizing the sub-grid non-linear solver (Casulli, 2009;Stelling, 2011, Casulli andZanolli, 2012). Sensitivity tests will be presented in the next chapter regarding resolution of the core computational base grid that will be utilized to verify the robustness of the partial wetting and drying scheme using over land gauges to compare with street-level inundation model results with and without sub-grid refinement.

Using the imbedded sub-grid within the coarse grid, it is possible to accurately determine the wet volume and cross-sectional area of a coarse grid cell, which is required using the continuity equation (4-3). The water levels and velocities are then computed on the coarse grid level to ensure the efficiency of the model in each time step (Casulli and Zanolli, 2012). The sub-grid is then utilized as an intermediate step to update volumes and cross-sectional areas, without the high computational costs of simulation on a traditional complete high-resolution grid. The subgrid approach can generate velocities at the sub-grid level, and thus improve calculation of the bottom stress (Stelling and Kerncamp, 2010). Assuming in the coarse grid model, that the 2-D flow is dominated by friction, this results in the pressure gradient term being balanced by the friction term in the momentum equation for each time step: where g is gravity, \u03b6 is water surface elevation, and cf is the friction parameter (4-7). This leads to: and \u2126 is defined as conveyance velocity in (4-8). If we assume that the pressure gradient within a time step is constant, the traditional approach leads to the velocity being constant within a computation cell.

If we assume that every sub-grid has the same surface size, then each sub-grid velocity will obey: where j is the index for each sub-grid cell (4-9), and the sub-grid velocities can be determined by the coarse grid velocity, \u2016 \u2016, with cf j , and h j , according to (4-10 & 4-11): where: Therefore, when the sub-grid approach is adopted, it enables the model to determine bottom friction more accurately from the sub-grid level, which can then be integrated to the entire cell instead of using the average velocity to obtain the average bottom friction."}, {"section_title": "Flow Resistance", "text": "Determining overland friction for flow resistance in urban areas is critical to accurately modeling inundation for high-resolution sub-grid applications. The calculation of friction is important in the interest of characterizing the resistance to fluid flow. In typical hydrodynamic studies, the effect of friction within the river channel must be calibrated and parameterized in order to accurately assess fluid movement (Henderson, 1966;Dyer, 1986;Nitsche et al., 2012). When a storm surge brings fluid up on to land, the resistance to fluid movement at the bottom is significantly heightened due to skin friction, as the bottom boundary layer comprises a large portion of the water column, as the flood water depth may be only a meter or more (Christensen and Walton, 1980). When not utilizing a high-resolution model grid in an urban setting, a very large friction parameter must be specified in the model in order to account for the insurmountable barrier to fluid flow posed by the presence of tall buildings in New York City as a form of macro-roughness. Any bottom roughness on a scale much greater than the wavelength of the approaching wave is characterized as macro-roughness, and such building features lead to turbulence and scattering of the wave, which is largely independent of wavelength and angle of incidence (K\u00f6kpinar, 2004;Nitsche et al., 2012). Flow and friction around buildings in a built-environment varies by two fundamental measurements: the width of the buildings, and the width of the street channels to accommodate fluid flow between them (Wang, 1983;Wang and Christensen, 1986). Given that buildings vary by shape and dimension, there is a nearly infinite variety of building shapes observed in a coastal ultra-urban environment such as New York City; each with its own flow resistance regime (Figure 4.6). Laboratory experiments have been previously performed to determine friction specifications to account for the effect of form drag as fluid detours around buildings of various shapes and dimensions (Wang, 1983;Wang and Christensen, 1986). Additionally, laboratory prototypes of building configurations were constructed to determine that the width of the horizontal building face (facing the initial surge) divided by the diagonal measurement between adjacent building corners correlates well with form drag of the fluid around the building (Wang, 1983). If one does not wish to resolve the streets between buildings, then form drag must be addressed as part of the overland bottom friction specification. This effort will reasonably address the substantial difference between the relatively small impact of bottom friction in a river channel, which is carved by regular fluid flow over vast time scales, and the comparatively larger friction over rough surfaces of a metropolitan city's infrastructure within the context of a numerical model (Christensen, 1972;Wang, 1983;Wang and Christensen, 1986). errors when the apparent bottom roughness is not sufficiently small compared to the depth (as is the case with macro-roughness) as indicated in Christensen and Walton (1980). The influence of the friction factor may be determined for storm surges in unobstructed regions, which may apply to areas that are perennially wet such as the ocean floor and river bottoms, in addition to ephemerally wet land areas like grassy fields and flat, developed regions, which may become entirely inundated in storm surge scenarios. Given that virtually all hurricane-induced surges are within the range of hydraulically rough flow, a velocity profile based upon a modified version of Prandtl's mixing length theory suggested by Christensen (1972) was employed in a laboratory study using: where \u0305 is defined as the time-averaged velocity in the direction of flow at distance from the bottom, is the friction velocity, and is Nikuradse's equivalent sand roughness (Equation 4-13). The modified version of Prandtl's mixing length theory affords a profile of velocities which satisfies the no-slip condition at the bottom, while the classic velocity profile leads to impossible negative velocities approaching - (Christensen, 1972). Additionally, use in practical applications of 2-D storm surge models dictates that the time-averaged velocity profile be transformed to a depth-averaged velocity profile. This transformation assumes that the depth-averaged velocity ideally occurs at a distance of z = 0.368 from the bottom for the modified logarithmic vertical velocity profile, where d/k is >1. Using this assumption, the previous equation becomes: The velocity profile in Equation (4-14) relates to the friction factor through substitution of the Darcy-Weisbach formula into the definition of the friction velocity via Equation (4-15): Solving the above equation for and introducing Equation (4-14), yields a general expression for friction factor for surges in unobstructed regions (Equation 4-16): (4-16) Bottom friction factor for storm surge applications in areas including buildings and other obstructions is technically complex, especially in areas of high building density. In terms of friction, buildings may be defined as roughness elements with significant heights that may protrude through the water layer as a form of macroroughness, or simply be comprised of rigid elements of considerable height capable of creating a form drag that is significantly larger than surface friction within the same area. In the scenario of a current that flows over an obstructed area where the density is M per unit area, the mean diameter of the obstruction in the projected plane (normal to the flow) is D, and the mean drag coefficient is C D . The equation below assumes steady or partially-steady flow within the range of rough flow to represent head loss (\u0394H) per unit weight of fluid over a bed length of L: where R is the hydraulic radius, and \u03b5 is the fraction of total area occupied by obstructions. An equivalent friction factor, may be defined to consider the effects of form drag and skin friction simultaneously in the determination of flow resistance. A version of the Darcy-Weisbach equation is introduced from Equation (4-17) to yield: where is given in Equation (4-16) and may be validated via experimentation. The law of conservation of energy dictates that the total energy head at an upstream location (1) must be equal to the total energy head at an analogous downstream location (2) plus the head loss between the two locations in the following form of the Bernoulli equation: (4-20) In Equation (4-20), ; the equivalent friction factor may be determined for the roughness elements of interest (Wang and Christensen, 1986)."}, {"section_title": "Review of Laboratory Flume Experiment for Flow around Buildings", "text": "This review of a laboratory flume experiment entitled \"Friction in Hurricane-Induced Flooding,\" conducted at the University of Florida in 1983, serves to provide some insight regarding appropriate bottom friction specification for overland flooding around buildings like those observed in the ultra-urban environment of New York City (Wang, 1983). Based upon the need for a more accurate prediction of hurricane-induced inundation in coastal regions to address applications that help govern land use planning, flood insurance rate determination, and proper positioning of the construction set-back line, Wang (1983) developed a methodology for describing the overland friction factor for flow resistance in urban areas for improved parameterization of over land friction specification for improved numerical model results. The study utilized a laboratory flume to place special emphasis on the friction characteristics of buildings, which is the single greatest source of flow resistance in developed areas (Wang, 1983)."}, {"section_title": "Setup and Results of Laboratory Flume Experiment", "text": "The presence of buildings in developed areas introduces a form of macroroughness, which is insurmountable for shallow water movement to flow over, and constitutes the principal roughness elements which would significantly affect the apparent bottom shear stress as well as the wind shear stress during flooding caused by a substantial storm front or hurricane. Typically, buildings are not arranged in uniform patterns, but as building density increases, surface area for necessary infrastructure to service vehicular and foot traffic to those buildings decreases (Figure 4.6). Incidentally, these areas are also the path of least resistance in terms of fluid flow during storm surge scenarios, as roadways and sidewalks are lower elevations than the buildings surrounding them, and provide ideal alternate pathways for a propagating surge blocked by buildings. Buildings may be classified into three categories defined in Wang (1983) (Table 4.1): 1) High-rise buildings are those which have a surface area of > 10,000ft. 2 . 2) Medium-rise buildings are between 2,500 ft. 2 and 10,000ft. 2 . 3) Residential buildings are considered to be < 2,500ft. 2 .

Building shape A, shown in Figure 4.6, was observed to be the shape of the majority of buildings observed (>50% of all buildings surveyed) in their study, as well as in each of the boroughs of New York City. The laboratory experiment made use of standard concrete cinderblocks with dimensions of 19.1 x 39.4cm, with a height of 19.1cm, to represent buildings and placed them into a shallow flume using the scaling outlined in Table 4.1. The experiments are conducted in a flume 2.44m wide x 36.6m long, with a height of 0.81m (Wang, 1983). Buildings were arranged in staggered and aligned configurations to represent the common building arrangements observed in coastal zones. New York City has almost entirely aligned buildings arranged in city blocks due to its extremely high population density. Configurations 1-13 correspond to building densities and spacing observed with high-rise buildings, configurations 14-21 were used for both medium-rise and residential experimental scenarios (Figure 4.7A-B). Greater than 10 experiments were conducted for each of the 21 patterns shown in Figure 4.7A to calculate the average C D in varied conditions ranging from Reynolds numbers of 20,000 to 70,000 and Froude numbers of 0.1 to 0.5 regulated via pump and sluice gate. Results obtained for medium rise building areas can be converted using appropriate scaling factors to use in residential areas, given that the two areas are presumed to possess the same relative building distributions with only dimensional differences. The average values of the experimental results for each of the 21 configurations are given in Table 4.2 and shown in Figure 4.8.  (Wang, 1983). Diagonal distance (S d ), measured between the buildings in adjacent transverse rows (from multiple row building configurations 6 -21), was shown to be positively correlated with bottom friction, , for both aligned and staggered building arrangements, as seen in Figure 4.7A-B. The good correlation is a result of the diagonal spacing, wherein magnitude affords a difference of disposition for the evenly distributed buildings or roughness elements. Additionally, the diagonal spacing also provides a relative measure of building density as determined in Table 4.1. Thus, the higher the density of buildings in a region, the smaller the disposition parameter, S d /D, will be, resulting in greater values for drag coefficient, . The disposition parameter of the staggered pattern is observed to be smaller than the aligned pattern, resulting in a larger drag coefficient when considering buildings with like dimensions and density (Wang, 1983).

These results were then scaled to average building spacing using dimensional analysis and through proper scaling of building disposition parameters from the laboratory experiment to average building spacing within the city blocks in each New York City borough. Detailed description of the principles of dynamic similarity relating the laboratory experimental results to that of the prototype scale can be found in Appendix B. Separate drag coefficient equations similar to those given in Figure 4.8, may be calculated for each of the three building classifications in New York City comparable to those measured from orthophotographs in Broward County and Dade County, Florida, from Wang, 1983 (Figure 4.6). Application of these equations requires knowledge of building density and building classification. This information may be calculated for New York City utilizing GIS tools on the building layer embedded within the sub-grid model. Considering that most of the buildings in New York City are aligned in configuration to maximize transportation efficiency, and that virtually all of the buildings along the water or within the flood risk area fall into the classification of high-rise buildings in the ultra-urban metropolis; the following method was utilized to calculate building density for each of the boroughs in New York City in the interest of applying a spatially-varying over land friction coefficient, ,. This will be specified in the sub-grid model's 2-D formulation using Manning's formula with a spatially varying bottom roughness, n (Table 4.3) by way of a similarity solution described in Appendix B.  (Henderson, 1966). In review, provided the use of high-resolution Lidar-derived topography data and extremely accurate vector building data, streets between buildings may be sufficiently resolved within the model sub-grid to intrinsically account for the form drag posed by the storm surge flow around building obstacles. The arrangement and configuration of buildings along with the disposition between rows of buildings along the water's edge vary greatly by shape and size, as noted in Figure 4.6 (Wang, 1983). Each of these building shapes would need to be uniquely accounted for in the model's friction specification if their shape is not resolved within the model grid. This is a task that is either impossible or highly impractical due to computational demand when using the conventional modeling approach. While the inland metropolitan area surrounding New York City is generally structured in a block system to maximize utility for the urban population, buildings adjacent to the water's edge often have unique shapes, being designed to maximize the number of rooms with a view of the adjacent body of water (Figure 4.6). Each of the buildings varies by shape and dimension, and thus has their own unique form drag. This unique form drag is in addition to the friction posed by the ground surface, both of which must be accounted for in the model's friction parameterization if the model grid does not sufficiently resolve buildings. Thus, the sub-grid model effectively resolves the streets using high-resolution topography to utilize a more universal friction specification."}, {"section_title": "External Model Forcings", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Atmospheric Forcing", "text": "Atmospheric data for the observation simulation of 2012 Hurricane Sandy in the New York Harbor region were collected in units of m/s from NOAA atmospheric observation data at Bergen Point, New York (NOAA Station # 8519483).

Seven of these rapid deployment gauges were identified within the extent of the sub-grid domain and were subsequently used for assessment of the model's accuracy for predicting storm surge over land.

Most of the high water marks were measured on Manhattan Island (or New York County, abbreviated as NEW in Table 6.3A), with a range in difference between the observed high water mark and maximum water level height reported at that same location by the model ranging from 0.0168 to 0. ranging from 0.2271 to 0.2971m, with larger differences than the other areas likely due to the proximally close position to the mouth of the New York Bay with some small wave effect noted at these stations (Table 6.3A). A few high water marks in this area of Staten Island and its analogous position across the Bay on Coney Island near the wave-affected rapid deployment gauges plotted in Figure 6.2 were noted by in the USGS report to be heavily affected by waves. These high water marks were not included in the statistical comparison due to the model not 136 addressing wind-wave interaction, and due to the relative uncertainty of water mark measurements accurately representing the average flood height for prolonged periods in areas frequently buffeted by waves. In the state of New Jersey, a majority of the 12 high water marks were recorded in Hudson County (abbreviated as HUD in Table 6.3B). The 10 high water marks had a large range in difference from 0.1261 to 0.5290m. The differences in the remaining 2 measurements collected from Bergen County (abbreviated as BER) were also large, with values of 0.5406 and 0.5577m. The large differences were anticipated due to the lack of freely available building height data for the New Jersey side of the Hudson River being represented in the model's DEM. Subsequently, without the building presence in the grid, the modeled flooding extent was greatly exaggerated in places beyond which would have been buffered by high building densities such as in Jersey City, Hoboken, and areas of Bayonne (Table 6.3B). Aggregated statistics for New York presented in Table 6.3C suggest a very favorable comparison with a \u0305 of -0.0004m indicating no strong leaning towards overprediction or under-prediction of high water marks by the model. The \u0305 of 0.2150m reported for New Jersey suggests that the model tended to over-predict recorded high water marks by 21.5cm on average. The | \u0305 was 0.112m for New York and greater than 3x that calculated for New Jersey at 0.364m. The smaller ranges described previously in the high water marks for the different boroughs of New York City logically led to a relatively small \u03c3 of 0.085m and an RMSE of 0.120m when compared to \u03c3 in New Jersey at 0.256m and an RMSE of 0.347m. The difference of 0.227m is a significant indication that the inclusion of buildings in the model DEM is critical to urban inundation modeling.  Within the study area of the sub-grid domain surrounding the New York Harbor, 80 schools were flooded with recorded water heights reported by FEMA in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. The assessments provide general information regarding flood height relative to the ground surface at each school location. These flood heights were compared with the model's output for maximum water thickness (calculated as the difference between the free surface of the flood waters and the topographic ground surface), and assembled as an additional method for spatial point-to-point comparison for New York in Table 6.4A and New Jersey in Table 6.4B. Within New York City, most of the inundated schools were located in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The worst flooding was observed at schools neighboring Coney Island Creek along the more coastal areas of New York City. Statistical measures for New York City are reasonably favorable with a \u0305 of 0.0332m, implying no leaning towards overprediction or under-prediction of inundated schools by the model (Table 6.4C). The \u0305 of 0.3483m reported for New Jersey suggests that the model tended to over-predict recorded high water marks by 34.8cm on average. The | \u0305 was 0.2769m for New York, compared to 0.4227m calculated for New Jersey. The standard deviations in the two data sets were about equal with 0.3304m for schools in New York and 0.3328m in the model comparison against flood heights at schools in New Jersey (Table 6.4C). The impact of waves impacted FEMA's inundated schools dataset due to its relation to the USGS high water marks, while the sub-grid model results do not. Thus, regions with higher wave influence may have exaggerated water levels in the FEMA dataset, around the Southern New York Bay and Staten Island, extending the range of the calculated differences between the sub-grid model and the inundated schools for New York (Table 6.4A). The RMSE for the 60 schools in New York City within the sub-grid domain was 0.3293m. Upon comparison with the RMSE of 0.4760m for the 20 schools in New Jersey, the point-to-point evaluation with the New Jersey schools led to 0.1467m more RMSE. As with the other point-to-point comparisons using the USGS high water marks, the RMSE difference of 0.1467m more error in New Jersey is likely attributed to the lack of freely available building data for inclusion in the model's DEM.   layer and a 0m contour for the maximum extent of inundation. These products are comprised of an inundation grid at 1m resolution for New York City and 3m resolution for New Jersey, along with a clipped surge boundary (FEMA MOTF, 2013). The database and GIS products produced by the USGS and FEMA were enormously valuable as a standard for spatial comparison with the sub-grid model results. These data were collected to calculate distances between the model's predicted maximum flood extent and FEMA's reported maximums (Table 6.5 and Table 6.6), and to compute inundation percent area match statistics for additional spatial verification of the model (Table 6.7). Additionally, 12 MTA subway stations with 41 subway entrances recorded as flooding from the street in inundated areas directly impacted by Sandy's storm surge were utilized as an additional verification method (Table 6.9)."}, {"section_title": "Distance Differential Assessment", "text": "Maximum       "}, {"section_title": "Area Difference Map Evaluation", "text": "The spatial comparison shown in Figure 6.8 resulted in an overall 75.15% spatial match with 11.41% area model over-prediction and 13.44% model under-prediction ( for the East River and 15.17% (961,151m 2 ) for the Harlem River (Table 6.7). The inundation area of the Harlem River was the smallest due to the smaller and narrower size of the river, and the higher frequency of over-prediction along the East River is attributed to the aforementioned convergence of the two storm surges from the south by Atlantic Coast via the Raritan Bay, and from the east through the Long Island Sound. Discrepancies between the model predictions and the FEMA flood map are attributed to DEM differences, and possibly the lack of building representation in the FEMA maximum inundation map ( Figure 6.9). Additionally, the implementation of the spatial flooding observation data as a derivative \"bathtub model\" product of USGSinterpolated high water marks and elevation data without regard for strong water current velocities or estuarine circulation could account for regions with significant discrepancies. Such discrepancies can be addressed in both the area and distance spatial comparisons to minimize the impact of DEM incongruities that are outside of control for the model to address. Two examples of these discrepancies are shown in Figure 6.9A-B. Drive by 338.35m (Table 6.6), and this discrepancy adversely affected the distance and area comparisons (Table 6.5 and Table 6.7). Similar roadway infrastructure issues with the DEM cause inundation along Kent Avenue in Figure 6.9B to be blocked by an overpass for I-278. This caused the model to under-predict flooding east of the overpass by 169.4m, and over-predict flooding west of the overpass. Thus, also affecting distance and area measurements as these infrastructures artificially obstructed fluid movement (Table 6.5 and Table 6.7).  If we account for the average distance differential of 38.43m between the FEMAreported maximum flooding extents and the model-predicted maximum inundation extents, the impact of physical impediments for fluid flow not accounted for in the model's DEM may be minimized. A new methodology could be employed to impose a maximum difference threshold using the average distance differential rounded to 40m. An adjustment of over-predicted and under-predicted flood areas would likely limit the impact of missing or added infrastructure along with Lidar-derived data limitations similar to those noted in Figure 6.9. Utilization of a statistical threshold to minimize the influence of physical impediments for fluid flow not accounted for in the model's DEM using the average distance differential of 38.43m between the predicted and observed maximum flooding extents will be addressed in the next chapter.

Due to the lack of subgrid, buildings were unable to be resolved, and subsequently a threshold building height of 5m was imposed prior to using a low-pass filter to smooth the high-frequency building heights. This was done to allow for free movement of the water so inundation could be measured with these broadly interpolated grids without sub-grid refinement (Figure 6.10). When the previous simulations were repeated without 5m sub-grid refinement, the resulting water surface elevations were observed to be significantly more sensitive to grid resolution ( Figure 6.13 and Figure 6.14). This is a consequence of the grid coarsening without sub-grid refinement, as the grid elevations are averaged over a greater area with lower resolutions. The coarser grid meshes give way to tidal decay as the fluid propagates from the grid boundaries to remote shallow reaches of the New York Harbor. The impact of coarsened bathymetry in narrow shallow regions coupled with complex topography yields an unfavorable comparison without sub-grid refinement to resolve these complicated features as observed at rapid deployment gauges located in Brooklyn (Figure 6.13) and in Queens (Figure 6.14). All runs were conducted on a Dell T3500 PC Workstation with Windows 7 Professional (64-bit edition); an Intel Xeon Quad Core X5570 Processor (2.93GHz); with 24GB RAM running UnTRIM 2 with grid size and run times for a ten-day simulation with global output of water levels and velocities summarized in Table 6.8. As indicated, measurable savings in computational effort can be realized by coarsening the base grid while maintaining detailed sub-grid resolution. As such, the 200m base grid mesh with nested sub-grid will be the grid utilized for the comparisons conducted in New York City. Without sub-grid specifications, accurate bathymetric and topographic fitting can only be achieved via extremely fine meshes or through the use of heavily distorted unstructured grids. These concessions often have the consequence of having stringent conditions typical of nonlinear systems that must be solved at every time interval. Since overly refined discretization demands a proportionally smaller time step, furthermore contributing to the decreased computational efficiency, it stands to reason that the subgrid formulation is a useful tool for geophysical fluid dynamics with promising future applications in high-resolution forecast modeling.      "}, {"section_title": "MTA Inundated Subway Entrances Map", "text": "The UnTRIM 2 model is utilized in this study to simulate storm surge and inundation caused by 2012 Hurricane Sandy. While a majority of reported flooding during a storm is due to the hurricane's storm surge, smaller portions of the observed inundation may be attributed to precipitation and diverted water to reservoirs or retention ponds by way of storm drains and runoff. Precipitation and percolation through the ground surface as additional model sources and sinks have been previously addressed in in sub-grid modeling efforts at VIMS for more rural settings (Loftis et al., 2013). These sources and sinks were not included in the modeling effort for Hurricane Sandy due to the minimal impact of rainfall relative to the substantial storm surge height in the Harbor, and the complex drainage infrastructure present in the City. Additionally, New York City is home to one of the most complex subterranean mass transit systems in the world. Many areas of the subway system throughout New York City were heavily impacted by the effect of the storm surge bottlenecking up the Hudson and East Rivers (Figure 6.15). Table 6.9 lists 38 known subway entrances flooded by Sandy's storm surge.  The SELFE model accurately predicts tidal propagation along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard and embayments within the model grid with good accuracy. SELFE tidal calibration results spanned 91 days and commenced on 09/01/2012 at 00:00 GMT through 11/30/2012 at 00:00 GMT. The tidal calibration resulted in an excellent overall statistical comparison upon application of the friction parameter adjustments noted in Chapter 3 in accordance with Blumberg et al. (1999). The aggregated statistics comparing the tidal calibration results to the predicted tide values across 10 NOAA tide gauges yielded an average R 2 of 0.9787, a relative error of 2.00%, and a root-mean-squared error of 9.72cm (Table 3.2). Harmonic analysis decomposed the tidal signal into the relative tidal amplitude and tidal phase between modeled tide and NOAA observed tide for the 8 major harmonic constituents at each NOAA station along the U.S. East Coast. In the tidal amplitude comparison, the SELFE model simulates the amplitude of the dominant M 2 tidal constituent very well at all of the 10 stations with a mean difference of -0.012\u00b10.058m (Table 3. 2A). Nearly all of the 10 selected tide gauge stations showed a mean amplitude difference of less than 10% except for Bergen Point, NY (Figure 3.1C), where a 15.6% difference in M 2 tidal amplitude was observed (Table 3.2A). The principal solar diurnal constituent, S 2 , had a mean difference of -0.005\u00b10.020m between the modeled tide and NOAA observed tide (Table 3.2A). Differences in tidal phase for the principal lunar and solar semidiurnal constituents, M 2 and S 2 , were 0.571\u00b11.980\u00b0 and -0.799\u00b12.614\u00b0, respectively (Table 3.2B). Therefore, the SELFE grid developed for simulating 2012 Hurricane Sandy was deemed capable of modeling the characteristics of long-period wave propagation along the open coast and the New York Harbor, and thus was prepared to effectively simulate the complex dynamics involved with a hurricane storm surge. Storm tide simulations were successfully conducted for 2012 Hurricane Sandy using the NARR and RAMS model results as atmospheric inputs. Overall statistics using the 24km resolution NARR inputs observed an average R 2 value of 0.8994, a relative error of 11.77%, and a root-mean-squared error of 32.69cm for 10 NOAA gauges (Table   3.3). The 4km RAMS inputs performed noticeably better than the SELFE model simulations driven with the NARR atmospheric inputs at all 10 stations with aggregate statistics yielding an average R 2 value of 0.9402, a relative error of 4.08%, and a rootmean-squared error of 19.22 cm (Table 3.4). Since the RAMS atmospheric inputs possessed a higher spatial and temporal resolution than the NARR inputs for air pressure and wind speed, it was concluded that generally superior storm tide predictions could be expected from utilizing more reliable or better resolution atmospheric forecast products.

The larger differences and errors reported in the point-to-point comparisons for New Jersey relative to New York were largely due to the lack of building representation in the sub-grid DEM for the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, and were a significant indication that the representation of buildings as a physical impediment to fluid flow is critical to urban inundation modeling. In addition to the previous sensitivity tests,  (Table 6.5), wherein the sub-grid model had an absolute mean distance difference of nearly 40m (38.430m) or eight 5m-resolution sub-grid pixels. A second distance comparison calculated differences relative to the shoreline for the FEMA flood coverage map ( Figure 6.6), and the sub-grid model results and shoreline to sub-grid model prediction ( Figure 6.7), along roadways perpendicular to the water's edge. This alternate assessment of distance revealed a mean distance difference of 27.67m, trending toward model under-prediction along 26 sampled roadways throughout the sub-grid domain (Table 6.6). Figures 5.11 and 5.12 indicate that the greatest inundation (>1km from the shoreline) within the sub-grid domain coverage area was observed along the New Jersey Bank of the Hudson River, where elevation is geologically lower than the New York bank. The final spatial verification calculated a difference map using the key in Table 5.3 for a complete area comparison, which resulted in a 75.15% spatial match with 11.41% area model over-prediction and 13.44% model under-prediction ( Figure 6.8 and Table 6.7)."}, {"section_title": "Discrepancies between Model Results and Spatial Observation Data", "text": "A considerable number of the differences or errors calculated in the spatial comparisons was attributed to large, but consolidated, areas of over-prediction or underprediction resulting from misrepresentation of roadway overpass infrastructure due to the primary method for topographic data collection being final-return Lidar measurements ( Figure 6.9). Also, DEM differences between the model sub-grid and the one used to build the FEMA flood map account for other discrepancies noted in the spatial comparison and are subsequently addressed utilizing an augmented spatial comparison methodology introduced with updated spatial results and statistics in the next section. Discrepancies between the model predictions and the FEMA flood map are attributed to DEM differences, and possibly the lack of building representation in the FEMA maximum inundation map ( Figure 6.9). Additionally, the implementation of the spatial flooding observation data as a derivative \"bathtub model\" product of interpolated USGS high water mark measurements and elevation data without regard for strong water current velocities or estuarine circulation could account for regions with significant discrepancies. Such discrepancies can be addressed in both the area and distance spatial comparisons to minimize the impact of DEM incongruities that are outside of control for the model to address. To provide a representative comparison, in the original distance comparison shown in Figure 6.5A-D, there were 36 total peaks representing differences greater than 100m for the horizontal absolute mean distance evaluation. Throughout the 4 assessment regions covered in the distance comparison, there were 17 locations adjacent to the East River, comprised of 4 of these in Brooklyn, 7 in Queens, 5 in the Bronx, and 1 in Manhattan (Figure 6.5A). There were only 2 places along the Harlem River with distance dissimilarities of greater than 100m between the sub-grid model and the FEMA maximum extent flood map ( Figure 6.5B); both of which were located near Randall's Island where the Harlem River joins the East River near the rapid deployment gauge, USGS 404810735538063, shown in Figure 4.1. There were 8 such discrepancies in the Hudson River along the New York banks of the river, with 3 locations along the west bank bordering Staten Island, with the east banks accounting for 2 locations in Brooklyn, and 3 places in Manhattan (Figure 6.5C). Finally, there were 9 locations along the New Jersey banks of the Hudson River ( Figure   6.5D), with one notably large discrepancy covering more than 7500m of differences greater than 100m between the FEMA maximum flooding extent map and the flooding extent predicted by the sub-grid model shown in Figure 6.9A. Two examples of these discrepancies are shown in Figure 6.9A-B. Along the New Jersey bank of the Hudson River ( Figure 6.9A), two overpasses for I-78 are accounted for in the model's Lidar-derived DEM, but do not allow for flow of water through the underpass. Thus, the model under-predicts flooding along Thomas McGovern Drive by 338.35m (Table 6.6), and this discrepancy adversely affected the distance and area comparisons (Table 6.5 and Table 6.7). Similar roadway infrastructure issues with the DEM cause inundation along Kent Avenue in Figure 6.9B to be blocked by an overpass for I-278. This caused the model to under-predict flooding east of the overpass by 169.4m, and over-predict flooding west of the overpass.

Formulations for the two-dimensional long-wave equation (with hydrostatic assumption) for both the SELFE and UnTRIM 2 models were exceptionally capable of accurately calculating the complex hydrodynamics indicative of the unsteady ocean conditions observed during a tropical storm event like 2012 Hurricane Sandy (Wang et al., 2014). As anticipated, the inclusion of Lidar-derived topography into the UnTRIM 2 model's sub-grid via GIS significantly increased the effective resolution of the model grid, and was quite capable of effectively resolving buildings in New York City along with narrow creeks and streams classified as 2nd order and above according to Strahler's definition of rivers and mathematical tree structures. Additionally, the inclusion of Lidarderived topographic measurements was also previously verified in a more rural setting to effectively resolve the dendritic small creeks of the Back River estuary at NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA (Loftis et al., 2013). An additional implication of this hypothesis was addressed as vector building data were included in the DEM development process to best represent the flooding around buildings observed in the New York City ultra-urban metropolis. The lack of freely available building data for the New Jersey regions of the New York Harbor demonstrated that accurate representation of buildings should be resolved within the model grid for superior spatial flooding projections, as the New Jersey side of the Hudson River observed more pronounced deviations from the FEMA flood map derived from the USGS-surveyed high water marks used to spatially validate the model (Wang et al., 2014). The partial wetting and drying scheme utilized in the sub-grid model's inundation algorithm was successfully verified as both accurate and robust during sensitivity tests and throughout the spatial comparison results for the maximum extent of flooding. Sensitivity tests revealed that there was minimal degradation in model results calculated with the benefit of sub-grid refinement as the base grid resolution increased from 200m to 100m to 50m, while the same model base grids without sub-grid refinement proved to be significantly more sensitive to grid resolution due to the grid elevations being averaged over a greater area with lower resolutions, inciting tidal decay. It was also revealed in a previous modeling effort that sub-grid modeling can replicate the results of a likewise-resolution true grid model in the Capital Mall area of Washington, DC, indicating that there is minimal loss of quantitative accuracy in the sub-grid approach and that it can appropriately match inundation observations (Loftis and Wang, 2012). To summarize, the primary objectives successfully addressed in this dissertation were: 1. The capabilities of a large-scale storm tide model and a high-resolution sub-grid inundation model were effectively demonstrated in the New York City area during Hurricane Sandy in 2012."}, {"section_title": "7.", "text": "Finally, there are potential forecast applications for large-scale SELFE model domains to be jointly developed and applied to model storm tide scenarios, in the 183 interest of generating an operational forecast modeling system with predictive capabilities for street-level inundation. This could be accomplished by exporting water level elevation results from SELFE simulations using forecast results automatically retrieved from atmospheric forecast data repositories. These water level elevations could be automated via script handling to autocombine and format the SELFE binary model results saved at key locations to be utilized as elevation boundary conditions to force the high-resolution street-level sub-grid model to produce spatial coverage maps shown in this dissertation, in less than 2 hours after 30-hour atmospheric forecast data are updated and retrieved. It is typically impossible to achieve exact dynamic similitude when scaling a laboratory experiment to reality, and thus it is essential to examine the modeled flow dynamics to ascertain which forces are inconsequential to the hydrodynamics of interest. The purpose of reducing the fluid flow to a couple of dominant forces makes the system easier to characterize, and helps to define the most important criteria for dynamic similarity between the model and the prototype. In the case of a model researching the impacts of hurricane storm surge on coastal inundation, elasticity and surface tension are virtually non-present when compared to the other forces acting on the system. Conditions for dynamic similarity are simplified by equating the ratio of the inertial forces to the ratio of gravitational or viscous forces. In the case of models measuring form drag in turbulent flow with high Reynolds numbers (i.e. inertial forces/viscous forces), viscous forces are of small consequence to the major forces driving the system due to turbulent fluctuations. Thus, viscous forces may be safely neglected in this scenario. The vertical dimension scale and horizontal dimension scale cannot be equal in the case of the prototype and the model ratios, since the flow depth would be insufficient for accurate measurements to be made. Additionally, the viscous forces would become critical to include in such small depths, and could no longer be neglected in shallow flow depths if the same fluid is used for the prototype and model. thus, a model with a different vertical dimension scale than horizontal dimension scale is used to keep the Reynolds numbers in the turbulent flow range. To simplify the problem of similarity, distorted models are often utilized for applications, since 187 undistorted models may simply be classified as a special case of distorted models. The model scale ratio is defined for the case of dynamic similarity in terms of horizontal length (Equation A-2), vertical depth (Equation A-3), time (Equation A-4), and force (Equation A-5): where L is the horizontal length, the horizontal width is B, vertical depth is D, time is T, and all forces are labeled as F, with a subscript pertaining to their respective forcing. The force scale for gravity in the horizontal direction of the main flow is described via (Equation A-6): where K gravitational is the gravity force scale, fluid density is \u03c1, gravitational acceleration is g, and bottom slope is D/L. in a the case of a unidirectional flow, the inertial force may 188 be expressed as a horizontal or virtually horizontal area which may be multiplied by Reynolds shear stress. Reynolds shear stress is proportional to the fluid density and the time-averaged value of the product of fluctuation in vertical velocity and the corresponding velocity fluctuation in the direction of the time-averaged flow resulting in an inertial force characterized by (Equation A-7): with a scale for the inertial force (K inertial ) of (Equation A-8): where L x B is length x width to yield calculations for area. To maintain dynamic similarity between the model and prototype, K gravitational should be equivalent to K inertial in equation (A-6), conditionally represented in the following equation (Equation A-9): where g flume is presumed to be equal to g model . Froude number is commonly utilized to describe the ratio between gravitational and inertial forces in a system. The time scale given in equation (A-9) is the similarity requirement for the Froude law in the scenario of distorted models. The scale ratios of the drag coefficient and friction factor in distorted and K shear must be equal to K gravitational to maintain dynamic similarity. If the time scale is substituted from (A-9) into the necessitated inequality described in Equation (A-15): The scale ratio expression for friction factor is: (A-16) A cursory comparison of equation (A-12) and (A-16) demonstrates that the drag coefficient is identical in the model and the prototype. However, the friction factor of the flume experiment should be modified by an inverse distortion ratio, N depth /N length (instead of the typical N length /N depth ) in the case of a Froude-distorted model (Wang, 1983). As indicated in Table 4.1, the values for both N depth (N d ) and N length (N l ) are given, and this distortion ratio is applied to the final values given for C Db , bottom friction, and Manning's n given in Table 4.3."}]
