[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract Co-authorship has become common practice in most science and engineering disciplines and, with the growth of co-authoring, has come a fragmentation of norms and practices, some of them discipline-based, some institution-based. It becomes increasingly important to understand these practices, in part to reduce the likelihood of misunderstanding in collaborations among authors from different disciplines and fields. Moreover, there is also evidence of widespread satisfaction with collaborative and co-authoring experiences. In some cases the dissatisfactions are more in the realm of bruised feelings and miscommunication but in others there is clear exploitation and even legal disputes about, for example, intellectual property. Our paper is part of a multiyear study funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and draws its data from a representative national survey of scientists working in 108 Carnegie Doctoral/Research UniversitiesVery High Research Activity (n = 641). The paper tests hypotheses about the determinants of collaboration effectiveness. Results indicate that having an explicit discussion about co-authorship reduces the odds of a bad collaboration on a recent scholarly article. Having co-authors from different universities also reduces the odds of a bad collaboration, while large numbers of co-authors have the reverse effect. The results shed some systematic, empirical light on research collaboration practices, including not only norms and business-as-usual, but also routinely bad collaborations."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Of late there has been a growing concern about ''bad practices'' in academic research collaborations (e.g., Rennie 1998; Shrum et al. 2001; Levsky et al. 2007 ) and such concerns are validated in studies based on interviews or questionnaires (e.g., Shrum et al. 2001; Bozeman et al. 2012) . At the conceptual level, we define ''bad practices'' as consisting of routine problems owing to the sort of human failings one finds in any realm or group work, including poor communication, late or incomplete delivery of work, and personality issues such as self-aggrandizement and boorish behaviour. Our definition also recognizes that, in some cases, bad collaborations turn into ''nightmare collaborations'' (Bozeman et al. 2012) in which professional reputations and careers are destroyed, unethical behaviour comes to light or disputes about intellectual property must be resolved in court. One can imagine that any number of specific instances could fall under this definition; this paper focuses on three particular bad practices: (1) persons not being credited who are perceived as deserving credit, (2) persons being credited who were perceived as not deserving, and (3) gender-based conflict.\nOne bad collaboration practice that has received considerable attention is the problem of ''guest'' or ''gift'' authors, persons who are included as co-authors in research in which they had no research role and, worse, may not even understand (Rennie and Flanagin 1994) . One response has been a focus on ''contributorship,'' defined as authors declaring in detail, in advance of publication, their individual contributions to scholarly papers (Rennie et al. 2000 (Rennie et al. , p. 1274 . Several journal and a few professional associations have adopted contributorship standards, particularly in fields related to medical research (Rennie 1998) . Contributorship policies and norms are viewed as increasing transparency and fairness. However, many fields in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) have not yet adopted contributorship policies or, for that matter, any policies or guidelines to deter bad practices in research collaboration.\nWith few exceptions, most concern about bad collaboration outcomes is based on conjecture, anecdotes and a few highly publicized and presumably unrepresentative cases of particularly egregious behaviour. Few, if any, studies have been able to document the more routine experiences researchers face with either bad or, for that matter, especially effective collaborations (Bozeman and Boardman 2013) .\nOur purpose in the present study is to shed some systematic, empirical light on research collaboration practices, including not only norms and business-as-usual, but also bad and even ''nightmare'' collaborations (Bozeman et al. 2012) . Whereas previous studies have focused on such issues as collaboration motivation strategies and incentives (e.g., Bozeman and Corley 2004) ; effects of collaboration on productivity (e.g. Lee and Bozeman 2005) ; differences in collaboration patterns between men and women (Bozeman and Gaughan 2007) and effects of institutional affiliations on collaboration (e.g., Youtie et al. 2006) , most studies treat collaborations as homogenous or, if they focus on particular attributes of collaboration, the data are generally based on interviews and are difficult to aggregate or to generalize. In this study, based on survey responses from 641 academic researchers from 108 U.S. researchfocused universities, we develop hypotheses about collaboration norms and practices and we focus especially on factors associated with bad collaboration experiences and outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Related studies of research collaboration dynamics", "text": "During the past decade or so, researchers, especially those in the biomedical sciences (e.g., Rennie et al. 2000; Cohen 2004) , have begun to focus on ethical issues and the ''dark side'' of collaboration. Lagnado (2003) argues that trust in the meaning of co-authorship has eroded. Levsky et al. (2007) describe potentially troubling trends in authorship in medical journals between 1995 and 2005, including honorary authorship, ghost authorship, duplicate and redundant publications and most important, authors' refusal to accept responsibility for their articles despite their readiness to accept credit for professional purposes. In a similar vein, Cronin (2001) points out the problems associated with hyperauthorship, which he defines as ''massive co-authorship levels'' (p. 558), in two fields where such quantities of co-authors are more apt to be present: high energy physics and biomedical research. Cronin observes that the situations in biomedical research have received much more attention than in high energy physics for reasons such as that latter's having more extensive levels of review which Cronin attributes to differences in organizational structure and socialization and communication.\nOutside of biomedical fields, research on the ethics and socio-political dynamics of scientific collaboration (Shrum et al. 2001 (Shrum et al. , 2007 remains scarce. Perhaps this scarcity is owing to the view (we think mistaken) that such problems are neither as pervasive nor as troublesome in other STEM fields. To be sure, biomedical research is different. In most STEM fields there is little potential for unethical behavior to affect clinical trials (Devine et al. 2005; Klingensmith and Anderson 2006) and there are no pharmaceutical industry representatives, or writers receiving compensation from the pharmaceutical industry, providing services as ''phantom'' or ''ghost'' co-authors that could result in a tilting of the interpretation of findings in a direction favourable to the industry (Lagnado 2003; Singer 2009 ). Nonetheless, more recent studies (e.g., Bozeman et al. 2012) show that many of the same ethical threats and problems documented in biomedical fields occur in other STEM fields, albeit with somewhat different causes and impacts.\nFar from being restricted to biomedical fields, problems in scientific collaboration are ubiquitous. Some of these problems are ethical (Shrum et al. 2001) , others practical (Bozeman and Corley 2004; Lee and Bozeman 2005) , some pertain to collaboration among individuals (Katz and Martin 1997; Bozeman and Corley 2004) , and some to collaboration among institutions (Chompalov and Shrum 1999) . The literature on scientific collaboration not only identifies problems in collaboration but also possible solutions. For example, Marusic et al. (2004) and Pichini et al. 2005 ) describe the many international Uniform Requirements for coauthorship information and the complex but poorly understood relationship between contributorship and grants, promotion, and admittance to professional associations. Most work is case-based or anecdotal and, as a result, neither the scientific community nor policy-makers have much systematic, empirically based evidence of the possible pitfalls of collaboration and contributorship.\nThe foundation of STEM research-based knowledge is peer-reviewed publication of research findings. Due to increasingly interdisciplinary and large-scale work, the assignment of authorship for publication is complex and sometimes confusing. Allocation of credit and responsibility for authorship is an important issue and it must be resolved if STEM research results are to be managed effectively (Devine et al. 2005) .\nWhile anyone whose research work spans disciplines knows that disciplines, fields and even sub-fields differ in their collaboration crediting practices, systematic evidence about these differences remains scarce (Baerlocher et al. 2007 ) We do know, though, that in some cases, first authorship means that the individual made the most significant scientific and intellectual contributions, but in other cases it means that the individual was the lab director or principal investigator and may have had little or no direct involvement in the research (Mowatt et al. 2002) . In some STEM fields, the most coveted position in a coauthorship is the last named author (Bozeman et al. 2012) . The practice of alphabetizing authorship order would appear to reflect more ''fairness'' but also lacks explicit information as to which author is primarily responsible for the work. Given the tendency to cite papers having a string of authors as, for example, ''Aaron and colleagues,'' and given the likelihood that readers will remember Aaron and not the others buried in the references section, alphabetic approaches may put too high a premium on the fortune of birth name. Likewise, random author order, while sensible in many ways, provides no assurance of fairness. If the person who does the least work on a project just happens to win the ''author order lottery,'' then the wrong person may receive the lion's share of credit. Having a random process moderate one's life work may not be a satisfactory outcome, especially when one has not yet established a scientific reputation (Brown et al. 2006 ). This may explain results showing that the practice of alphabetic author ordering is disappearing (Peffers and Hui 2003) .\nThe decision about assigning credit is highly varied and often provides only an oblique signal as to who has done what. As decision analysts have known for years, often the process is the primary determinant of outcome (Brockner and Wiesenfeld 1996) . While there is remarkably little evidence about collaboration and co-authorship decision processes and norms, most agree that these vital processes affect not only scientific career trajectories and advancement, but also the very course of science (Katz and Martin 1997; Melin 2000) . The choice of scientific topics and configuration of research teams depend in part on collaborative and co-authorship norms. Researchers have considerable autonomy in their collaboration choices and collaboration strategies are based in part on judgments about the conferring of co-authorship and status (Heffner 1981; Bozeman and Corley 2004) . The issue is who decides.\nSome attribute problems with sorting out contributorship to the explosion in research and the funding imperatives driving collaboration among investigators from multiple sites and disciplines (Devine et al. 2005; Drenth 1998 ). Ultimately the system of scientific authorship is built on trust that the published work reflects the data and analysis of the authors (Lagnado 2003) . We contend that co-authorship choices and perceptions relate closely to the integrity of the research in (at least) the following ways. In cases where authors, especially lead or corresponding authors, make no substantial contribution to the research, authorship claims are essentially scientific fraud. Control of authorship award and credit can in some instances be a ''weapon'' that the powerful use to obtain resources, knowledge or obedience from the less powerful. Since grants and contracts and other important research-related resources are provided in part on the basis of scientific reputation and apparent productivity, measured in terms of quantitative and quality of publication, misattribution of co-author credit undermines the effective allocation of science resources. In cases where ''legitimate'' collaborators are not included as co-authors and not provided their due, there is a possibility that data privileges and other resource controls can act as, essentially, a restraint of trade (McCrary et al. 2000) . While our study cannot deal with the full range of ethical problems and implications flowing from co-authorship and collaboration issues, we can begin to prepare the empirical basis for understanding these problems. Absent more detailed knowledge of norms, practices and perceptions about collaboration, it is difficult to even begin to understand the extent of ethical hazard. According to Rennie et al. (2000, p. 91) , ''the general consensus appears to be that identifying and publishing specific contributions of authors is a venture that shows promise. But its utility must be demonstrated.'' Our study seeks to assess the processes, dynamics, and utility of various approaches to contributorship decision-making."}, {"section_title": "The research focus and hypotheses", "text": "Our study draws from the abundant literature on scientific collaboration (see Katz and Martin 1997; for overviews), especially scholarly manuscript authorship, (Tulandi et al. 2008; Chompalov et al. 2002) to analyze ethical challenges for participants, particularly in the assigning of credit. By developing from the authors themselves information about collaboration dynamics, norms and social and ethical dilemmas, this work provides insights into the potential of new policies and designs to promote effective collaboration. Using a web-based survey, we seek to develop strong empirical knowledge of STEM researchers' norms, behaviours, and perceptions about collaboration and co-authoring.\nThe focus of this work is on data from a web survey. This paper examines determinants of predictors of collaboration experiences in the ''most recent co-authored research publication.'' We used this wording approach in the survey to prevent the respondents from having to provide a specific citation, thereby threatening their anonymity. But, at the same time, this approach has the advantage of providing a valuable cognitive anchor for the responses (Bradburn et al. 1987; Tourangeau and Rasinski 1988) .\nHere we examine difficulties related to (1) persons not being credited who are perceived as deserving credit, (2) persons being credited who were perceived as not deserving, and (3) gender-based conflict. Our central hypothesis is that undesirable collaboration outcomes are associated with collaborations in which co-authorship credit is never discussed explicitly. Other hypotheses associate undesirable collaboration outcomes with: large collaborations, author collaboration motivations, negative past experiences, mixed gender co-author groups, and collaborator geographic distance. Controls for author's PhD award year and gender are included."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The analysis is based on a web survey of 641 non-medical academic researchers in STEM disciplines in 108 US universities (Carnegie Doctoral/Research Universities-Very High Research Activity). A sampling frame of science and technology fields was developed using NSF's categories in its Survey of Earned Doctorates. Health sciences was excluded (because of its medical orientation) while economics was added to incorporate social science practices into the survey. The resulting frame was based on 14 disciplines in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, engineering, and economics. The sampling frame called for one male and one female faculty member from each randomly selected department at a given university because qualitative interviews suggested that gender would be a significant factor; in the event that no female faculty members were affiliated with the department, two male researchers were selected. The target sampling frame, which assumed a 50 % response rate, resulted in 2,996 faculty and another 216 postdocs. We were able to collect contact information for 2,574 individuals in the sampling frame; of these 2,189 were of sufficient quality as indicated by an electronic mail verification software program. Pilot surveys performed in April and May of 2012 used 400 of these, leaving 1,789 for the final survey. Six waves of survey invitations and reminders were sent in October and November of 2012. One percent were not at their office location, while another 5 % explicitly opted-out of participation. In all, we received 641 completed or mostly completed online questionnaires, for a 36 % response rate. Respondents were very similar to the population in terms of gender, rank and departmental discipline. Given that we oversampled females and certain departments, we re-weighted results to reflect the population distribution as indicated in the NSF Survey of Doctorate Recipients 2006 (most recently available survey)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Undesirable collaboration outcomes are measured with respect to the most recent coauthored research publication. Respondents were asked to rate the most recent co-authored publication on 10-point scale, ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree, in response to statements describing undesirable collaborations due to receipt of undeserved coauthorship, denial of deserved co-authorship, and gender-based conflict. Because most respondents appeared reluctant to assign ratings below 10 (roughly 80 % gave a 10 or strongly disagree rating to the former statement, and roughly 90 % to the latter two statements), we define a rating in the one-to-six range as being problematic. Under this definition, 20 % reported an undesirable collaboration outcome, which is represented as ''problems2'' (Table 1) . Whether this publication involved explicit discussions about coauthoring credit (''creditdis_yesno'') addresses the main hypothesis; 40 % of respondents had an explicit discussion about co-authorship at some point in their collaboration. The mean paper had 77 % of authors being male (''permale'') and 37 % from another university than that of the respondent (''perothuniv''). The number of co-authors in the recent paper is logged (''lnrecent_numcoauth''). Importance of motivations for collaborations to increase research productivity and help a co-author's career (''mov_productivity'' and ''mov_helpcoauthor'') are represented in responses to a 10-point scale ranging from not important at all to extremely important. The existence of past negative behaviors in terms of a co-author having made no contribution to the research is included as well (''careerbad_undeservedcoaur''). Controls for the year of the author's PhD (''yearphdr'') and whether or not the author is male or female (male2) are included. The mean year of PhD is 1991 (ranging from 1958 to 2012) and 80 % of respondents are male, 20 % female.\nA logit model (Table 2) portrays the likelihood of a problem with the recent paper as a function of explicit discussion of co-authorship, characteristics of co-authors of the article (e.g., co-author size, gender mix, geographic distance of co-authors), and respondent characteristics (e.g., gender, field, year of receipt of doctorate). The model is statistically significant and 80 % of responses are correctly classified. Explicit discussion of co-authorship credit is negatively associated with the likelihood of problems. It is not clear from our data whether the explicit discussion has a palliative effect or whether explicit discussion is related to having a more open and inclusive demeanour, which could reduce problems. In all likelihood the two alterative explanations are not mutually exclusive but rather interactive.\nThe number of co-authors increases the likelihood of problems, which is in the expected direction. However, there is an inverse relationship between the percentage of authors at another university and the likelihood of problems, which is counter to our geographic hypothesis, suggesting that geographic proximity provides more opportunity for disagreement (Katz 1994) . There are at least three reasons why having more co-authors would be related to increased problems. First, it is possible that one ''bad apple'' is all that is needed to produce a bad collaboration and, ceteris paribus, having more people involved provides a greater likelihood of including that bad apple. Second, a larger collaboration may require more monitoring and entail greater transactions costs, straining a social dynamic that often works best when informal and norm based. Third, if we assume that many conflicts often originate in interpersonal relations among mismatched dyads, then having more people involved has a multiplicative effect on the possible dyadic relations contained in the collaboration.\nWe find that authors with a bad undeserved co-authorship experience in their past are more apt to report problems in their recent research publication, although motivations to collaborate are not significant. It is difficult to determine whether individuals who have bad experiences tend to have other bad experiences or whether some individuals simply are more sensitive to possible bad experiences. The year a PhD was granted is positively associated with problems, indicating that younger academics are more likely to experience problems than are their older counterparts. This finding may indicate that experience generates coping strategies or perhaps a better benchmark for interpreting and assessing behaviour.\nGender overall is not significant. However, interacting the share of co-authors that are male with broad fields (e.g., biology, physics/chemistry, mathematics/computer science, engineering) indicates that co-authors involving a large share of males in mathematics/ computer science and in engineering reduced the likelihood of problems. "}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "There are many conceptual studies and case studies of the social and organizational processes by which researchers make decisions about contributions, credit sharing and authorship shared credit (see for example Fine and Kurdek 1993) . However, systematic, large sample studies remain scarce (e.g., Vinkler 1993; Floyd et al. 1994) , hence this work's contribution. The present study sheds some light on the determinants of collaboration problems. We find that the likelihood of co-authorship problems are reduced through explicit discussion about co-authorship credit, with factors such as the number, location, and past experience of co-authors also playing a role. Still, this study also underscores the need for attention to a variety of issues. In the first place, our study has the same problem with self-reports found in so much research based on questionnaires and interview data. Since much bad behaviour in collaborations seem very much related to the ''eye of the beholder'' it is extremely difficult to sort out the magnitude of problems as opposed to individuals' sensitivity to problems. However, each is important. Since individuals likely make future collaboration decisions based on perceptions of previous experience, then the perceptions remain an important concern. Second, our study does not consider the role of assigning someone to the acknowledgements rather than the co-author section of a paper and the role of cross-sectoral collaborations in problematic outcomes. Elsewhere, we find (as a result of conducting personal interviews) that these issues can lead to problems in collaborations (Bozeman et al. 2012 ), but almost none of the recent papers referenced in our survey (fewer than 4 %) involved a private-sector co-author. A third problem warranting attention is the issue of selection. If we understand the formation of collaborations as a complex mixture of opportunity, proximity, personal attraction, skills and human capital Log likelihood = -254.84898, Wald (Chi square) significant at 1 %, Pseudo R 2 = .13 * Significant at 10 %; ** Significant at 5 %; *** Significant at 1 % complementarity and status-seeking (among other factors), then it is important to know much more than we can express here about the relation of these collaboration formation dynamics to outcomes. While we feel (and our data support) that processes, such as the degree of open discussion of crediting, explain much about outcomes, the antecedent factors related to collaboration formation may explain even more."}]
