The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 required all school districts participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) to develop wellness policies that include nutrition guidelines for all foods available at schools by the 2006---2007 school year. 19 However, the legislation did not require districts to implement specific competitive food policies. 5 A review of a nationally representative sample of wellness policies and related regulations from 2006---2007 up to 2008---2009 found that, although some districts have implemented strong policies, in general, rules governing competitive food sales were weak or nonexistent. 20 In response to concerns about the role of both the school meal programs and competitive foods in addressing the obesity epidemic, Congress passed The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010. 21 The act required the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to update the nutrition standards for the NSLP and the School Breakfast Program while providing a performance-based increase in reimbursement rate for lunches. The bill also for the first time gave the USDA authority to set nutrition standards for competitive foods sold throughout the school day. 21 Congress instructed the USDA to develop nutrition standards for competitive foods that align with the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans 22 while giving consideration to practical application of the standards. The USDA is currently developing competitive food standards with the goal of releasing final regulations in 2013.\nReactions to the USDA's revised nutrition standards for the school meal program suggest that the USDA may face strong opposition to nutritionally rigorous competitive food standards. 23, 24 In addition to objections raised by food industry associations, the School Nutrition Objectives. We analyzed the impact of Connecticut legislation incentivizing voluntary school district-level elimination of unhealthy competitive foods on National School Lunch Program (NSLP) participation.\nMethods. We analyzed data on free, reduced, and paid participation in the NSLP from 904 schools within 154 Connecticut school districts from the 2004-2005 to the 2009-2010 school year, resulting in 5064 observations of annual school-level meal participation. We used multilevel regression modeling techniques to estimate the impact of the state competitive food legislation on the count of NSLP lunches served per student in each school.\nResults. Overall, the state statute was associated with an increase in school lunch participation. We observed increases between 7% and 23% for middle-and high-school meal programs, and a slight decrease of 2.5% for the elementary school free meal eligibility category, leading to an estimated revenue increase of roughly $30 000 for an average school district per school year.\nConclusions. This study provides support for national implementation of proposed rigorous competitive food standards that can improve the health of students while supporting local school district finances.

We excluded private schools, vocational or magnet schools, and Residential Child Care Institution sponsors because of lack of demographic information and geographic representation (n = 30). After we excluded 92 schools because of missing outcome or covariate data, the analysis included 904 schools within 154 school districts with an average of 5.

The CSDE classifies districts into 9 district reference groups (DRGs) from low-need (A) to high-need (I) districts. The DRG classification incorporates a broad range of data inputs, including median family income, parental educational attainment and occupation, percentage of children in single-parent households, percentage of children whose parents speak a language other than English at home, percentage of children eligible for free and reduced-price meals, and district size. 31 The CSDE provided school-level data on the percentage of students eligible for free and reduced-price meals. We obtained valid data for 904 out of 1026 Connecticut schools. Missing schools did not differ with respect to DRG (the proportion of missing schools was slightly higher in A, C, and I districts compared with the remaining DRG categories)."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "We used multilevel regression modeling techniques to estimate the impact of HFC participation on the count of NSLP lunches served per student in each school. We used separate generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) from the Poisson family with a logarithmic link function to model annual lunch counts for each meal-eligibility category (i.e., free, reduced-price, and paid), with the number of potential lunches sold per year (number of students multiplied by number of school days) used as an offset. We used a multilevel approach to account for clustering of observations within schools over the study period and for the clustering of schools within school districts. Moreover, withinsubjects as well as between-subjects effects are directly modeled when one is using a multilevel modeling framework. We included school grade level (i.e., elementary, middle, high school) and year dummies as fixed effects. We allowed intercepts and the HFC participation effect to vary across both schools and districts. In addition, models included a grade level by HFC cross-level interaction term to estimate separate effects for each grade level. The full model with a description of each term is available in the Technical Appendix, Equation 1 (available as a supplement to the online version of http://www.ajph.org). In a second model, we included district-level DRG and school-level free and reduced-price lunch eligibility to account for potential confounding by sociodemographic factors. However, including these variables did not affect our main effects of interest-HFC-related changes in meal countsthus, the more parsimonious model is presented here.\nWe fitted the Poisson GLMMs by using the GLMER function from the LME4 package version 0.999375---42 32 in R version 2.14.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). We computed marginal effects of HFC participation on lunch counts by using Monte Carlo simulations to average over the random effects included in the model. Details on the regression modeling, prediction approach, and comparison of alternative estimation methods are included in the Technical Appendix.\nWe calculated the effect of HFC participation on school-level food service annual meal program revenue by multiplying predicted marginal lunch counts by total per-lunch federal revenue reported by the USDA for the 2011---2012 school year and estimates of average revenue from student payments for reduced-price and paid lunches. Estimates were derived as follows. In 2011---2012, schools received federal cash reimbursement of $2.77 for each free lunch served, $2.37 for each reduced-price lunch, and $0.26 for each paid lunch sold. In addition, schools received 22.25 cents per lunch served in commodity food products. 1 (Table 1) . Although Connecticut is a relatively wealthy state on average, schools and districts included in the sample represent a wide range of sociodemographic experiences, with the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals ranging from 0% to 100% at the school level.\nBased on the GLMM model results, HFC participation was significantly associated with decreased free lunch participation rates (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.976; P < .05) in elementary school, increased middle-school paid lunch participation (IRR = 1.115; P < .001), and increased high-school free (IRR = 1.072; P < .001), reduced-price (IRR = 1.120; P < .001), and paid (IRR = 1.228; P < .001) lunch participation (Tables 2 and 3 Table 3 ). Overall, HFC participation was associated with increased meal program revenue because of significantly higher participation across all meal eligibility categories in high school and more limited changes in middle school and elementary school (Tables 3 and 4 ). For the average high school, HFC was associated with an approximately $21 000 increase in revenue for paid lunches, an approximately $1700 increase for reduced-price lunches, and an approximately $4000 increase for free lunches. For middle schools, we observed a significant increase in revenue for paid lunches with an expected average revenue gain of approximately $12 000 per school year. For elementary schools, the negative effect on free lunch participation corresponded to a small expected loss in revenue of approximately $1300 per school year on average. These results do not incorporate the additional 10 cents per lunch paid by the state to incentivize participation in HFC.\nAssuming an average district with 4 elementary schools, 1 middle school, and 1 high school with average meal counts across the 3 meal eligibility categories as shown in Table 3 , operating 180 days, HFC participation would lead to a total expected revenue increase of around $30 000 for this district per year based on the difference in the 2009---2010 predicted annual lunch counts between schools participating in HFC and those not participating in HFC (Tables 3 and 4) ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "On the basis of 6 years of statewide data from more than 900 schools and 150 school districts, we found that incentivizing school districts to implement rigorous competitive food standards resulted in widespread districtlevel program adoption and increased student school lunch participation. This analysis builds on previous reports showing that Connecticut's efforts to improve the school food environment have resulted in reduced availability of unhealthy food in schools and improved dietary outcomes for children. 15, 29 Confirming these findings, a recent report analyzing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's School Health Note.

Overweight and obesity during adolescence are much stronger predictors of future adult obesity and related comorbidities than overweight and obesity during childhood. 36 However, at the same time that the stakes for maintaining a healthy weight increase, schools and other organizations charged with supporting a healthy transition from adolescence to adulthood frequently increase access to and promotion of obesogenic foods. 37, 38 National data and results from this study show a precipitous decline in participation in school meal programs beginning during middle school and accelerating in high school. In part, students choose not to participate in the meal program because schools are offering unhealthy snack alternatives high in fat, added sugars, and sodium. 39 The effect of Connecticut's HFC highlights the potential to bring middle-and high-school students back to the meal program by removing unhealthy alternatives from the school environment. This study's finding that HFC was associated with a slight decrease in elementary-school meal participation rates cannot easily be explained with the available data. One possibility that would need to be investigated further is that elementary schools have increased availability and sales of competitive foods that are now more likely to be viewed as healthy snack options under the new nutrition standards, although elementary schools generally have far fewer competitive food choices than do middle and high schools. The significant overall increase in participation in the reduced-price and free-meal eligibility categories observed in this study deserves particular attention. Low-income families struggling to maintain food security received additional benefits for which their children were eligible but were not previously utilizing. Researchers have hypothesized that stigmatization of students participating in the meal program may reduce program participation. 40---42 By increasing participation in the paid meal program, Connecticut's HFC may have contributed to reduction of this stigma."}, {"section_title": "Impact on Local School District Finances", "text": "This study adds to a growing body of research showing that reducing the availability of unhealthy competitive foods in schools results in either positive or neutral effects on food service finances, in part by increasing revenue from the school meal programs.\n26,27,43 One major limitation to the current study is that it does not incorporate reported changes in competitive food sales into the calculation of the impact of HFC on school revenues. However, it is likely that the results presented here underestimate the positive impact of removing unhealthy competitive foods on school finances. In a USDA report based on a national sample of school districts surveyed during the 2005---2006 school year, researchers found that revenue from competitive food sales fell short of the reported cost of competitive food production by 29%. 44 By contrast, revenue from reimbursable meal sales exceeded reported costs by 15%. The USDA reported that many schools do not properly attribute overhead and labor costs to competitive food sales as should be done in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. When these costs are allocated correctly, the USDA found that on average schools were selling competitive foods at a loss. Because of this widespread but rarely recognized practice, school districts have been subsidizing the sale of unhealthy competitive foods with money intended for students participating in school meal programs."}, {"section_title": "Implications for National School Food Policy", "text": "Although further improvements should be made, the positive impact of changes to USDA school meal regulations following the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act should not be understated. Beginning in the 2012---2013 school year, school meals included a greater quantity and variety of fruits and vegetables and more whole grains, and for the first time specified minimum and maximum calorie ranges for each meal appropriate for each age group. 45 In compliance with the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012, 24 substantial reductions in sodium levels will be phased in slowly over a period of 10 years. However, food service professionals have correctly warned that students may reduce participation in healthier meal programs in favor of unhealthy competitive food offerings. 25 Results of the current study suggest that a new rigorous national competitive food policy could support continued participation in the meal programs. In addition, the USDA recently released an interim rule requiring districts to stop subsidizing competitive food sales with revenue from the meal programs, which will cause districts to increase competitive food prices. 46 As a result, the USDA estimated that in the 2012---2013 school year, 871 000 children will join meal programs. The combined effect of the changes to competitive food regulations will create a broader constituency for school meal programs as children in higher-income families begin to participate in the paid meal program. The overall increase in participation, and especially from children in higher-income families, may create new political pressure to continue to improve the quality of school meal programs. Given the success of Connecticut's minimal monetary incentive at achieving voluntary participation in HFC, legislators and regulators should consider whether implementation of rigorous national competitive food standards could follow a similar model."}, {"section_title": "Methodological Considerations", "text": "Although the current study is limited by the lack of data on competitive food sales and evaluation of HFC's impact on students' actual diet quality, the study provides timely input to deliberation over the implementation of the first national competitive food standards.\nOne of the study's core strengths is its use of appropriate statistical techniques and existing administrative data to conduct a natural experiment of innovative state legislation for nutrition standards. Because we used data before and after implementation of state nutrition standards and because implementation Predicted revenue calculated on the basis of multiplication of revenue per meal and the marginal predicted lunch counts per year for each meal eligibility category and school level reported in Table 3 ."}]
