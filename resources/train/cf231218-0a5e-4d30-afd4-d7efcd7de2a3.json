The estimated mean willingness to accept risk for the full population is 4.81 with 95% CI (4.71, 4.90). This estimate is very similar to the population estimate from Roe (2015) 1 . On average, 32% of farmers are risk averse, and 8.9% maximally risk averse (willingness to accept risk = 0). Risk seeking farmers make up 28% of the population, with 5.3% of farmers maximally risk seeking (willingness to accept risk = 10). Willingness to accept risk is dispersed around the country (see Figure 2). There is no clear spatial pattern for estimate of county average willingness to accept risk. Each state has both counties with high densities of risk averse farmers and counties with high densities of risk seeking farmers.  Table 1 shows the results of an ordered probit regression of farmer characteristics on willingness to accept risk. Age and gender both have significant negative correlations with farmers' risk preferences. Older farmers are more likely to be risk averse than younger farmers, and women are more likely to be risk averse than men. These findings agree with previous studies on farmers (Roe, 2015) and also with other populations (Dohmen et al, 2011). Education, farming experience and being retired are all positively correlated with risk attitudes. Race and ethnicity as a category, however, is not correlated with risk attitudes after controlling for other factors. "}, {"section_title": "Risk Aversion as a Predictor of Farm Characteristics and Decision-making", "text": "As shown in Table 2, willingness to accept risk is correlated with land tenure and rental decisions. Risk averse farmers are more likely to be full owners than more risk tolerant types. 80% of highly risk averse farmers are full owners of their operations, as compared to 53-56% of highly risk seeking operators. Likewise, only 4% of highly risk averse farmers are purely tenant farmers, compared to 9% of highly risk seeking producers. Risk seeking farmers are also more likely to rent in land for their operations than risk averse farmers, although all types are about equally likely to rent out land to another operator. The relationship between tenancy and risk attitudes may be related to beginning farmers. Table 1 shows that younger farmers are more likely to be risk seeking than older farmers, and younger farmers are more likely to rent a larger portion of their operation than older farmers (Bigelow et al, 2016). Bigelow et al also note that small family farms are less likely to rent in land than larger scale operations, and larger operations tend to be organized most often as part-owner operations. If access to land is a major barrier for beginning farmers (Ahearn and Newton, 2009) and younger farmers are more risk seeking, then we would expect to see risk seeking farmers engaging in more tenancy and partial ownership operations than risk averse producers. Table 3 displays the correlations between willingness to accept risk and different types of farm management decisions. Risk averse farmers are likely to have fewer co-operators and smaller size operations than risk seeking farmers. These findings are consistent with the results on land tenancy shown in Table 2. Risk attitudes also correlate with the use of different risk management strategies, however the effect may be counter-intuitive for some strategies. As shown in Table 4, risk averse operators grow a smaller number of crops and engage less in forward contracting than risk seeking farmers. Typically, crop diversification and forward contracting as assumed to be risk-reducing, and should therefore be more appealing to risk averse individuals. Overall, risk averse farmers maintain a higher share of working capital than risk seeking farmers, although aggregate differences between risk averse, risk neutral, and risk seeking farmers are not statistically significant. However, risk seeking operators have higher levels of retirement and non-retirement savings and total financial assets. Risk attitudes are uncorrelated with enrollment in ARC or PLC commodity support programs, and also uncorrelated with participation in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). However, risk seeking operators also spend more on crop insurance in aggregate and as a share of the value of production. Federal crop insurance is heavily subsidized to make the program more attractive to producers (Glauber, 2013). Our findings suggest that those subsidies are accruing more to risk seeking producers than to risk averse farmers. However, our analysis does not control for household-level risk exposure which has been shown to impact farmers' purchases of Federal Crop Insurance (Sherrick et al, 2004). To summarize, we find that compared to risk seeking farmers, risk averse farmers are more likely to be full owners, less likely to rent-in land, farm smaller operations, share responsibilities with fewer cooperators, and have lower farm and household incomes. Risk averse farmers are also less likely to diversify production, use contract production, invest in crop insurance, or invest in savings. Risk averse producers do, however, maintain higher levels of working capital. We find no difference in propensity to rent out land, participation in commodity support programs or CRP, expenditure on capital or variable inputs, or ratio of farm income to household income across risk types. These results suggest that US farmers may not be using crop diversification, contracted production, crop insurance, or commodity support programs specifically as a means to mitigate risk exposure."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "These results raise a few interesting questions. First, are the correlations measured in this study indicative of differences in risk aversion or some other factors correlated with both risk aversion and farm outcomes? Our results show that risk seeking farmers have significantly more co-operators on average than risk averse farmers. Several experimental studies have shown that teams tend to make decisions that reflect more risk aversion than decisions made by individuals alone (Rockenbach et. al, 2007;Sutter, 2007;Shupp and Williams, 2008). If risk averse producers are making farm and investment decisions individually on average and risk seeking producers making the same decisions within teams on average, then both sets of decisions should reflect risk averse attitudes. That would suggest that the correlations we measure reflect differences across farmers beyond their attitudes towards risk. Second, are relationships between farmers' risk attitudes and outcomes stable over time? Using the 2014 ARMS sample, we observe that risk seeking and risk averse farmers tend to have similar shares of total income from farm income. That indicates a positive correlation between on-farm revenues and off-farm household income within in this sample. However, research using the 2004 ARMS sample found that operators of smaller farms had higher off-farm incomes than larger-scale operators (Fernandez-Cornejo et al, 2007). The 2004 ARMS questionnaire did not include any measures of attitudes towards risk, so it is not possible to verify if smaller farms in 2004 were more likely to have risk averse operators. It is possible that either the correlation between risk attitude and farm size or risk attitude and dependency on off-farm income has shifted over time. On the other hand, the decade between 2004 and 2014 saw significant changes in commodity prices and farm incomes (Key et al. 2017). Larger scale producers have been shown to have higher income volatility than retiree and lifestyle farms (Poon and Weersink, 2011;Key et al. 2017), and farm households tend to have more offfarm income in response to farm income volatility (Mishra and Goodwin, 1997). It is also plausible that large scale producers adjusted to the changes in farm income volatility during 2004-2014 by shifting to have more off-farm household income independently of their willingness to accept risk, again suggesting that observed correlation patterns stem from something besides risk attitudes. Third, is this metric of willingness to accept risk a good construct for measuring farmers' risk preferences? Experimental risk elicitation instruments are considered to be the gold standard for measuring risk preferences (Charness et al, 2013). This survey metric has been shown to be correlated with real-world outcomes including investment in stock markets, tendency toward self-employment over salaried labor, and smoking (Dohmen et al, 2011). It has also been shown to have better test-retest stability and correlation with within-experiment decision-making than one of the most commonly used experimental approaches (L\u00f6nnqvist et al, 2015). However, it was not well correlated with actual crop insurance purchases for a non-representative sample of Italian farmers (Menapace et al, 2016). Our results show risk seeking farmers are more likely to purchase crop insurance, which agrees with the findings of Hellerstein et al (2013) who measured risk attitudes for a small sample of US farmers using standard experimental elicitation techniques. Previous research has suggested that farmers treat crop insurance less as a risk management strategy and more as a stand-alone risky investment (Babcock, 2015), which would therefore be more attractive to risk seeking individuals. We also observe in the sample that risk seeking individuals are more likely to invest in retirement and non-retirement savings. Therefore from the vantage point of risky investments, the survey question yields consistent results. The survey question also capture correlations with land tenure and rental decisions, and these correlations have signs which match with our a priori expectations. Einav et al. (2012) demonstrate that risk attitudes can vary substantially within the same individual across different types of financial risks. If farmers do assess risk differently for land tenure, farm management, and risk management decisions, then it is plausible that this survey metric is suitable to capture at least some of those aspects of riskydecision making. Lastly, assuming our metric captures true correlations between risk attitudes and decision-making, do risk attitudes matter for policy, and if so, for which policies? Our results show no aggregate differences in enrollment in commodity support programs or CRP for different risk types. Risk attitudes are correlated with participation in Federal Crop Insurance programs, and participation patterns suggest that crop insurance is less attractive for risk averse types. Therefore policymakers who want to increase participation in the crop insurance program may want to target changes in existing crop insurance programs to better suit the preferences of risk averse types."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "We characterize risk attitudes among US farmers, and show how these attitudes correlate with use of risk management options including insurance and savings; farm management decisions including crop specialization, capital investment, and land tenure arrangements; and participation in USDA programs. Our data on risk attitudes and farm and household characteristics comes from the 2014 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) survey, a nationally-representative survey of nearly 30,000 farmers. Thus our study provides the most detailed and comprehensive view of US farmers' risk attitudes to date. We find that compared to risk seeking farmers, risk averse farmers are more likely to be full owners, less likely to rent-in land, farm smaller operations, share responsibilities with fewer co-operators, and have lower farm and household incomes. Risk averse farmers are also less likely to diversify production, use contract production, invest in crop insurance, or invest in savings. Risk averse producers do, however, maintain higher levels of working capital. We find no difference in propensity to rent out land, participation in commodity support programs or CRP, expenditure on capital or variable inputs, or ratio of farm income to household income across risk types. These results suggest that US farmers may not be using crop diversification, contracted production, crop insurance, or commodity support programs specifically as a means to mitigate risk exposure. Our findings may be useful in understanding how changes in Federal risk management programs may impact farmers' participation decisions."}]
