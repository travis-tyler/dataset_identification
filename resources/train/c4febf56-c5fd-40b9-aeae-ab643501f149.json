Longitudinal studies indicate that functionally impairing symptoms continue into adolescence and adulthood in approximately 60-80% of cases diagnosed during childhood (2, 3) . Extant morphometry studies on ADHD have implicated a number of anatomically related brain areas; however, findings have been somewhat inconsistent, with no common structural abnormality emerging across studies. In adults and youths, structural abnormalities have been reported in the basal ganglia (4-10), prefrontal cortex (10) (11) (12) , cerebellum (5, 10, 13, 14) , anterior cingulate cortex (15) , and less frequently reported in the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus (16, 17) . Several factors, however, may serve to obscure underlying brain-behavior relations in the study of ADHD symptomatology, including the use of categorical diagnoses, the lack of multiinformant behavioral ratings, and small sample sizes. In order to aptly characterize the neuroanatomical substrates of ADHD symptomatology, it is critical to demonstrate convergence across dimensional, multi-informant behavioral data using large populationbased samples. If possible, findings should also demonstrate convergence with other established features of ADHD symptomatology across different domains-including measures of cognition, as well as neurochemistry.\nOver the last few decades, empirically based assessment of psychopathology has revealed aspects of dimensionality with regard to many psychiatric conditions, including ADHD (18) . Such findings have been somewhat difficult to reconcile with the categorical taxonomy espoused by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) . Although numerous studies have tested for brain differences between ADHD patients and typically developing controls, few studies have investigated brain correlates of attention problems in the general population. Following from a dimensional conceptualization of psychopathology, it is reasonable to postulate that both clinical and normative levels of a given psychiatric syndrome will be underpinned by overlapping neural substrates. Mous et al. (2014) recently reported that cortical thickness in bilateral postcentral gyri was negatively associated with parent-reported attention problems in a population-based sample of 444 6-to 8-year-old children (19) . Ducharme et al. (2012) found that subclinical attention problems in typically developing youths, ranging from 6 to 18 years of age, were associated with a decreased rate of cerebral cortical thinning within prefrontal and parietal cortical regions-brain areas that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of clinically significant attention problems (i.e., ADHD) (20) (21) (22) .\nSimilarly, Shaw et al. (2011) reported an association between subclinical symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity in typically developing youths and delayed cortical thickness maturation (23) . Such evidence supports the use of dimensional measures of psychopathology, as emphasized by the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria program (24) . Taken together, there is compelling evidence that subclinical variation in ADHD symptomatology is tied to brain structure and development-and that these associations may be obfuscated by a strict categorical DSM approach.\nIn the assessment of developmental psychopathology, informants represent an important source of variance (18) . The current DSM taxonomy does not offer clear, standardized methods for synthesizing reports from multiple informants. Martel et al. (2015) recently reported that information from multiple informants increases the validity of assessing ADHD, and that averaging ratings is the optimal method for integrating multi-informant data (25) . Dimensional ratings from multiple informants also allow for more sophisticated methods of integrating data, such as latent variable approaches.\nUnfortunately, few neuroimaging studies have utilized dimensional assessments of ADHD symptomatology from multiple informants.\nIn addition to using quantitative, multi-informant behavioral ratings, we aimed to demonstrate convergence across different domains with measures previously associated with ADHD symptomatology. Reaction time variability refers to the degree of intra-individual variation in responding to a target stimulus, and increased reaction time variability on attention tasks has been commonly reported in ADHD youths (26, 27) .\nLesion studies indicate that frontal lobe damage is accompanied by increased reaction time variability (28) . There is also evidence that individual differences in reaction time variability predict inhibitory success (29) . Further, subjects with increased reaction time variability exhibit greater activation within inhibitory regions of the brain during tasks of response inhibition (29) . Thus, reaction time variability may serve as an objective neurocognitive marker for ADHD symptomatology. It remains unclear, however, the extent to which such cognitive measures are related to parent and self-report ratings of ADHD symptomatology, as well as brain structure, in the general population.\nFinally, patterns of gene expression may provide additional support in identifying potential brain-based markers for ADHD symptomatology. The brai 's dopami ergic system has been strongly implicated in a wide variety of cognitive functions including attention, and repeatedly linked to the pathophysiology of ADHD symptomatology.\nIndeed, a number of medications that have proven efficacious in the treatment of ADHD work by blocking dopamine reuptake and/or stimulating dopamine release, increasing extracellular dopamine levels. It is reasonable to postulate that regions of the brain that are volumetrically related to ADHD symptomatology will be tied the expression of genes encoding for dopaminergic receptors.\nHerein, we investigate the relationship between dimensional measures of ADHD symptomatology and brain structure in a large population-based sample of adolescents, utilizing multi-informant behavioral ratings. In a subset of participants, we also investigate relations between reaction time variability, measures of ADHD symptomatology, and brain structure. Finally, utilizing publicly available gene expression data collected as part of the Allen Human Brain Atlas (30), we test the extent to which the relationship between brain structure and ADHD symptomatology is correlated with patterns of dopaminergic gene expression.

In order to test for associations between gene expression and brain structural correlates of ADHD symptoms, we used a brain map derived from regressions between GMV and the mean composite of multi-informant behavioral ratings.

The unthresholded t-statistic map, resulting from regressing regional gray matter volume against the mean composite of multi-informant ratings, was subsequently tested for associations with patterns of gene expression. Using the alleninf toolbox (39) and gene expression data collected for the Allen Human Brain Atlas (30), we tested for an association with several dopaminergic genes that have been previously implicated in ADHD symptomatology: DRD1, DRD2, and DRD4. In brief, the toolbox extracts the MNI coordinates of each gene expression sampling site, draws a spherical ROI (r = 4 mm) and averages values of the statistical map within each spherical ROI. Average ROI values are then correlated with normalized gene expression values.

Parent and youth ratings of ADHD symptomatology were all negatively associated with gray matter volume in an overlapping portion of the vmPFC. Critically, our findings were not changed when measures of mood and anxiety symptomatology were controlled for in analyses. When analyzing Hyperactivity/Impulsivity and Inattention symptom counts separately, we found that Inattention symptoms were associated with reduced volume in bilateral vmPFC, whereas Hyperactive/Impulsive symptoms were related to reduced gray matter volume in the left superior temporal gyrus, parietal operculum, and posterior insula. Thus, reduced gray matter volume in ventromedial prefrontal cortices appears to be particularly tied to aspects of inattentive symptomatology in adolescents. In line with this interpretation, we found that reaction time variability-posited to reflect lapses in attention as opposed to hyperactivity-was negatively associated with gray matter volume in an overlapping region of the vmPFC. Given convergence across dimensional, multi-informant behavioral ratings, and a measure of neurocognitive functioning that has been previously tied to ADHD, our findings indicate that vmPFC structure is a brain-based marker for attention problems in adolescents.\nIn the largest VBM study to date on adult ADHD, a significant negative correlation was revealed between vmPFC gray matter volume and dimensional measures of ADHD symptomatology (41) . Specifically, when analyzing patients and controls together, the authors found an inverse relationship between dimensional measures of ADHD symptomatology and vmPFC gray matter volume. Inattentive symptoms, in particular, were negatively correlated with gray matter volume in the vmPFC (41) . Strikingly, the findings of Maier et al. (2015) largely overlap with the results of the present study.\nTaken together, reduced gray matter in the vmPFC may serve as a marker for attention problems in both adolescent and adult populations."}, {"section_title": "Increased reaction time variability on tasks of vigilant attention has been a common", "text": "finding when comparing children with ADHD versus typically developing controls (26, 27) . This finding has led others to hypothesize that increased reaction time variability is tied to aberrant default mode network (DMN) activity (42). In particular, the defaultmode interference hypothesis posits that activity in the DMN, which is typically attenuated during goal-directed tasks, can persist into periods of task-related processing and, as a result, compete with task-specific neural processing (42). The vmPFC represe ts a primary hub i the brai 's default mode etwork (D N)-a network posited to play a central role in mind-wandering and task-unrelated thought. Although speculative, it is possible that the volumetric reductions in the vmPFC may be linked to DMN dysfunction. In a recent study by Salavert et al. (2015) , ADHD participants exhibited reduced deactivation of the medial prefrontal cortex during a working memory task. The authors suggest that failure to deactivate the medial prefrontal cortex is tied to lapses of attention, and that this may be a central feature of ADHD symptomatology. It is possible that findings in the present study are tied to DMN dysfunction, and, more specifically, reduced vmPFC gray matter volume may be related to an impaired ability to deactivate portions of the DMN. Future studies are needed to test this possibility.\nIt is noteworthy that, despite modest correlations between multi-informant behavioral ratings (r = 0.36-0.66), we observed striking convergence with regard to brain structural correlates. Similarly, reaction time variability was modestly correlated with behavioral ratings of ADHD symptomatology (r = 0.11-0.14), and, again, we observed considerable overlap with regard to anatomical correlates. These findings suggest that the vmPFC is tied to both parental and youth self-reports of ADHD symptomatology, as well as an objective behavioral measure of ADHD symptomatology (i.e., reaction time variability).\nIn the present study, two different methods were used to analyze multi-informant ratings of adolescent attention problems. First, a composite ADHD symptom score was created by averaging multi-informant behavioral ratings. Averaging multi-informant ratings of ADHD symptomatology has been found by others to be the optimal method for integrating multi-informant data (25) . Second, confirmatory factor analysis was used to derive a latent ADHD symptom variable based on multi-informant DAWBA and SDQ data. To our knowledge, this is the first neuroimaging study to directly compare these two methods of handling multiple-informant behavioral data. In short, we found that these two methods yielded very similar results when relating to regional gray matter volume, producing statistical maps with a high degree of spatial overlap.\nWe found that the statistical map representing the relationship between GMV and ADHD symptomatology was significantly correlated with patterns of dopaminergic gene expression. More specifically, areas of the brain in which ADHD symptomatology was inversely associated with GMV tended to be regions that expressed the gene that encodes for the D1 dopamine receptor, DRD1. This finding is particularly intriguing given that D1 receptor density in the cortex has been recently linked to the functional decoupling of DMN and task-positive networks in humans (43) . Thus, D1 receptor density in the vmPFC-a major hub of the DMN-may be particularly relevant with regard to ADHD symptomatology, affecting the dynamic interplay between task-negative and task-positive networks. Candidate gene studies have also tied DRD1 to symptoms of inattention (44) . Brain areas showing reduced volume at higher levels of ADHD symptomatology were characterized by relatively low DRD2 expression. It is unclear why DRD1 and DRD2 expression patterns were differentially associated with our VBM results. It is possible that these findings can be explained, in part, by the differential distribution of D1 and D2 receptors in the human brain (45) . Previous research indicates a dorsolateral-ventromedial gradient with regard to the respective distribution of D1 and D2 receptors, with D1 receptors being more prevalent in ventromedial regions of the striatum and cortex (45, 46) . This differential distribution of D1 and D2 receptors is also believed to reflect a disti ctio betwee \"direct\" a d \"i direct\" cortico-striatal-thalamiccortical circuits-with D1 receptors playi g a more importa t role i \"direct\" circuits that serve to disinhibit thalamic activity and initiate behavior, and D2 receptors playing a greater role i \"i direct\" circuits that serve to i hibit neuronal activity (46) (47) (48) . Although speculative, the results of our follow-up gene expression analyses may reflect a relative imbalance between D1 and D2 systems. However, it is important to emphasize that these gene expression analyses are meant to be hypothesis-generating in nature. It is critical that future studies more directly test these possibilities.\nBefore concluding, it is important to address limitations of the present study. First, given that we have focused on regional gray matter volume in our analyses, we are unable to definitively comment on the neurophysiological underpinnings of our VBM findings.\nSimilarly, we are unable to comment on possible ties to aberrant structural and/or functional connectivity. Second, patterns of gene expression are related to age and developmental stage, and our gene expression analyses do not capture these agerelated influences. Third, it is worth noting that, across all analyses, observed effect sizes were small. This may reflect that the vmPFC findings in the present study co stitute o e part i the full elucidatio of ADHD's brai -based correlates. Fourth, we observed an apparent dissociation with regard to the neuroanatomical correlates of hyperactive/impulsive and inattentive symptomatology. It is possible, however, that differences in statistical power may have influenced these results-in particular, more variance was observed in inattentive symptoms (M = 2.64, SD = 3.86) relative to hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (M = 1.42, SD = 2.65).\nTaken together, reduced volume in the vmPFC may serve as a relatively stable biomarker for inattention. The present study lays the foundation for informing early intervention and prevention efforts. One exciting future direction will be to examine the extent to which vmPFC structure during adolescence predicts subsequent symptom trajectories into adulthood. This work has the exciting potential to identify brain-based markers for future outcomes, helping to target youths at greatest risk for poor outcomes. Results from whole brain voxel-wise analyses.
