As required by the Global Change Research Act of 1990, this report has collected, evaluated, and integrated observations and research on climate change in the United States. It focuses both on changes that are happening now and further changes that we can expect to see throughout this century.\n\nThis report is the result of a three-year analytical effort by a team of over 300 experts, overseen by a broadly constituted Federal Advisory Committee of 60 members. It was developed from information and analyses gathered in over 70 workshops and listening sessions held across the country. It was subjected to extensive review by the public and by scientific experts in and out of government, including a special panel of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. This process of unprecedented rigor and transparency was undertaken so that the findings of the National Climate Assessment would rest on the firmest possible base of expert judgment.\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the authors, reviewers, and staff who have helped prepare this Third National Climate Assessment. Their work in assessing the rapid advances in our knowledge of climate science over the past several years has been outstanding. Their findings and key messages not only describe the current state of that science but also the current and future impacts of climate change on major U.S. regions and key sectors of the U.S. economy. This information establishes a strong base that government at all levels of U.S. society can use in responding to the twin challenges of changing our policies to mitigate further climate change and preparing for the consequences of the climate changes that can no longer be avoided. It is also an important scientific resource to empower communities, businesses, citizens, and decision makers with information they need to prepare for and build resilience to the impacts of climate change.\n\nWhen President Obama launched his Climate Action Plan last year, he made clear that the essential information contained\n\nin this report would be used by the Executive Branch to underpin future policies and decisions to better understand and\n\nmanage the risks of climate change. We strongly and respectfully urge others to do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. John P.

It documents climate change related impacts and responses for various sectors and regions, with the goal of better informing public and private decision-making at all levels.\nA team of more than 300 experts (see page 98), guided by a 60-member National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee (listed on page vi) produced the full report \u00ad the largest and most diverse team to produce a U.S. climate assessment. Stakeholders involved in the development of the assessment included decision-makers from the public and private sectors, resource and environmental managers, researchers, representatives from businesses and non-governmental organizations, and the general public. More than 70 workshops and listening sessions were held, and thousands of public and expert comments on the draft report provided additional input to the process.\nThe assessment draws from a large body of scientific peer-reviewed research, technical input reports, and other publicly available sources; all sources meet the standards of the Information Quality Act. The report was extensively reviewed by the public and experts, including a panel of the National Academy of Sciences, the 13 Federal agencies of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, and the Federal Committee on Environment, Natural Resources, and Sustainability.\n\nClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nU.S. National Climate Assessment\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\nOnline at: nca2014.globalchange.gov\n\nAbout the\nHIGHLIGHTS\nThe Highlights presents the major findings and selected highlights from Climate Change Impacts in the United States, the third National Climate Assessment.\nThe Highlights report is organized around the National Climate Assessment's 12 Report Findings, which take an overarching view of the entire report and its 30 chapters.

Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington State, and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience. So, too, are coastal planners in Florida, water managers in the arid Southwest, city dwellers from Phoenix to New York, and Native Peoples on tribal lands from Louisiana to Alaska. This National Climate Assessment concludes that the evidence of human-induced climate change continues to strengthen and that impacts are increasing across the country.\nAmericans are noticing changes all around them. Summers are longer and hotter, and extended periods of unusual heat last longer than any living American has ever experienced. Winters are generally shorter and warmer. Rain comes in heavier downpours. People are seeing changes in the length and severity of seasonal allergies, the plant varieties that thrive in their gardens, and the kinds of birds they see in any particular month in their neighborhoods.\nOther changes are even more dramatic. Residents of some coastal cities see their streets flood more regularly during storms and high tides. Inland cities near large rivers also experience more flooding, especially in the Midwest and Northeast. Insurance rates are rising in some vulnerable locations, and insurance is no longer available in others. Hotter and drier weather and earlier snowmelt mean that wildfires in the West start earlier in the spring, last later into the fall, and burn more acreage. In Arctic Alaska, the summer sea ice that once protected the coasts has receded, and autumn storms now cause more erosion, threatening many communities with relocation.\nScientists who study climate change confirm that these observations are consistent with significant changes in Earth's climatic trends. Long-term, independent records from weather stations, satellites, ocean buoys, tide gauges, and many other data sources all confirm that our nation, like the rest of the world, is warming. Precipitation patterns are changing, sea level is rising, the oceans are becoming more acidic, and the frequency and intensity of some extreme weather events are increasing. Many lines of independent evidence demonstrate that the rapid warming of the past half-century is due primarily to human activities.\nThe observed warming and other climatic changes are triggering wide-ranging impacts in every region of our country and throughout our economy. Some of these changes can be beneficial over the short run, such as a longer growing season in some regions and a longer shipping season on the Great Lakes. But many more are detrimental, largely because our society and its infrastructure were designed for the climate that we have had, not the rapidly changing climate we now have and can expect in the future. In addition, climate change does not occur in isolation. Rather, it is superimposed on other stresses, which combine to create new challenges.\n\n\u00a9Ted Wood Photography\n\n1\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fCLIMATE CHANGE AND THE AMERCIAN PEOPLE\nThis National Climate Assessment collects, integrates, and assesses observations and research from around the country, helping us to see what is actually happening and understand what it means for our lives, our livelihoods, and our future. This report includes analyses of impacts on seven sectors \u00ad human health, water, energy, transportation, agriculture, forests, and ecosystems \u00ad and the interactions among sectors at the national level. This report also assesses key impacts on all U.S. regions: Northeast, Southeast and Caribbean, Midwest, Great Plains, Southwest, Northwest, Alaska, Hawai`i and the Pacific Islands, as well as the country's coastal areas, oceans, and marine resources.\nOver recent decades, climate science has advanced significantly. Increased scrutiny has led to increased certainty that we are now seeing impacts associated with human-induced climate change. With each passing year, the accumulating evidence further expands our understanding and extends the record of observed trends in temperature, precipitation, sea level, ice mass, and many other variables recorded by a variety of measuring systems and analyzed by independent research groups from around the world. It is notable that as these data records have grown longer and climate models have become more comprehensive, earlier predictions have largely been confirmed. The only real surprises have been that some changes, such as sea level rise and Arctic sea ice decline, have outpaced earlier projections.\nWhat is new over the last decade is that we know with increasing certainty that climate change is happening now. While scientists continue to refine projections of the future, observations unequivocally show that climate is changing and that the warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to humaninduced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from burning coal, oil, and gas, with additional contributions from forest clearing and some agricultural practices.\nGlobal climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond, but there is still time to act to limit the amount of change and the extent of damaging impacts.\nThis report documents the changes already observed and those projected for the future. It is important that these findings and response options be shared broadly to inform citizens and communities across our nation. Climate change presents a major challenge for society. This report advances our understanding of that challenge and the need for the American people to prepare for and respond to its far-reaching implications.\n\n2\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nThis report assesses the science of climate change and its im-\npacts across the United States, now and throughout this century.\nIt integrates findings of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP)a with the results of research and observations from\nacross the U.S. and around the world, including reports from the\n\nU.S. National Research Council. This report documents climate change related impacts and responses for various sectors and regions, with the goal of better informing public and private decision-making at all levels.\n\nREPORT REQUIREMENTS, PRODUCTION, AND APPROVAL\nThe Global Change Research Act1 requires that, every four years, visory committee assembled for the purpose of conducting this the USGCRP prepare and submit to the President and Congress assessment. The report was extensively reviewed and revised an assessment of the effects of global change in the United based on comments from the public and experts, including a States. As part of this assessment, more than 70 workshops were panel of the National Academy of Sciences. The report was reheld involving a wide range of stakeholders who identified issues viewed and approved by the USGCRP agencies and the federal and information for inclusion (see Appendix 1: Process).

The Overview synthesizes and summarizes the ideas that the authors consider to be of greatest importance to the American people.\n\u00b7 Our Changing Climate: presents recent advances in climate change science, which includes discussions of extreme weather events, observed and projected changes in temperature and precipitation, and the uncertainties associated with these projections. Substantial additional material related to this chapter can be found in the Appendices.\n\u00b7 Sectors: focuses on climate change impacts for seven societal and environmental sectors: human health, water, energy, transportation, agriculture, forests, and ecosystems and biodiversity; six additional chapters consider the interactions among sectors (such as energy, water, and land use) in the context of a changing climate.\n\u00b7 Regions: assesses key impacts on U.S. regions \u00ad Northeast, Southeast and Caribbean, Midwest, Great Plains, Southwest, Northwest, Alaska, and Hawai`i and the U.S. affiliated Pacific Islands \u00ad as well as coastal areas, oceans, and marine resources.\n\u00b7 Responses: assesses the current state of responses to climate change, including adaptation, mitigation, and decision support activities.\n\u00b7 Research Needs: highlights major gaps in science and research to improve future assessments. New research is called for in climate science in support of assessments, climate impacts in regions and sectors, and adaptation, mitigation, and decision support.\n\u00b7 Sustained Assessment Process: describes an initial vision for and components of an ongoing, long-term assessment process.\n\u00b7 Appendices: Appendix 1 describes key aspects of the report process, with a focus on engagement; Appendix 2 describes the guidelines used in meeting the terms of the Federal Information Quality Act; Appendix 3 supplements the chapter on Our Changing Climate with an extended treatment of selected science issues; Appendix 4 provides answers to Frequently Asked Questions about climate change; Appendix 5 describes scenarios and models used in this assessment; and Appendix 6 describes possible topics for consideration in future assessments.\n\nOVERARCHING PERSPECTIVES\nFour overarching perspectives, derived from decades of ob- abilities, and opportunities in the U.S. are linked to impacts servations, analysis, and experience, have helped to shape and changes outside the United States, and vice versa; and 4) this report: 1) climate change is happening in the context of climate change can lead to dramatic tipping points in natural other ongoing changes across the U.S. and the globe; 2) cli- and social systems.

This perspective has implications for assessments of climate change impacts and the design of research questions at the national, regional, and local scales. This assessment explores some of the consequences of interacting factors by focusing on sets of crosscutting issues in a series of six chap-\n\nters: Energy, Water, and Land Use; Biogeochemical Cycles; Indigenous Peoples, Lands, and Resources; Urban Systems, Infrastructure, and Vulnerability; Land Use and Land Cover Change; and Rural Communities. The assessment also includes discussions of how climate change impacts cascade through different sectors such as water and energy, and affect and are affected by land-use decisions. These and other interconnections greatly stress society's capacity to respond to climate-related crises that occur simultaneously or in rapid sequence.\n\n4\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fABOUT THIS REPORT\n\nSocietal Choices\n\nBecause environmental, cultural, and socioeconomic systems are tightly coupled, climate change impacts can either be amplified or reduced by cultural and socioeconomic decisions. In many arenas, it is clear that societal decisions have substantial influence on the vulnerability of valued resources to climate\n\nchange. For example, rapid population growth and development in coastal areas tends to amplify climate change related impacts. Recognition of these couplings, together with recognition of multiple sources of vulnerability, helps identify what information decision-makers need as they manage risks.\n\nInternational Context\n\nClimate change is a global phenomenon; the causes and the impacts involve energy-use, economic, and risk-management decisions across the globe. Impacts, vulnerabilities, and opportunities in the U.S. are related in complex and interactive ways with changes outside the United States, and vice versa. In order for U.S. concerns related to climate change to be addressed comprehensively, the international context must be\n\nconsidered. Foreign assistance, health, environmental quality objectives, and economic interests are all affected by climate changes experienced in other parts of the world. Although there is significantly more work to be done in this area, this report identifies some initial implications of global and international trends that can be more fully investigated in future assessments.\n\n Thresholds, Tipping Points, and Surprises While some climate changes will occur slowly and relatively the interactions of multiple stresses, incomplete understandgradually, others could be rapid and dramatic, leading to unex- ing of physical climate mechanisms related to tipping points, pected breaking points in natural and social systems.

This report underscores the effects of mitigation measures by comparing impacts resulting from higher versus lower emissions scenarios. This shows that choices made about emissions in the next few decades will have far-reaching consequences for climate change impacts throughout this century. Lower emissions will reduce the rate and lessen the magnitude of climate change and its impacts. Higher emissions will do the opposite.\nWhile the report demonstrates the importance of mitigation as an essential part of the nation's climate change strategy, it does not evaluate mitigation technologies or policies or undertake an analysis of the effectiveness of various approaches. The range of mitigation responses being studied includes, but is not limited to, policies and technologies that lead to more ef-\n\nficient production and use of energy, increased use of non-carbon-emitting energy sources such as wind and solar power, and carbon capture and storage.\nAdaptation actions are complementary to mitigation actions. They are focused on moderating harmful impacts of current and future climate variability and change and taking advantage of possible opportunities. While this report assesses the current state of adaptation actions and planning across the country in a general way, the implementation of adaptive actions is still nascent. A comprehensive assessment of actions taken, and of their effectiveness, is not yet possible. This report documents some of the actions currently being pursued to address impacts such as increased urban heat extremes and air pollution, and describes the challenges decision-makers face in planning for and implementing adaptation responses.\n\nTRACEABLE ACCOUNTS: PROCESS AND CONFIDENCE\nThe \"traceable accounts\" that accompany each chapter: 1) When it is considered scientifically justified to report the document the process the authors used to reach the conclu- likelihood of particular impacts within the range of possible sions in their key messages; 2) provide additional information outcomes, this report takes a plain-language approach to exto reviewers and other readers about the quality of the infor- pressing the expert judgment of the author team based on mation used; 3) allow traceability to resources; and 4) provide the best available evidence.

Certain types of extreme weather events with links to climate change have become more frequent and/or intense, including prolonged periods of heat, heavy downpours, and, in some regions, floods and droughts. In addition, warming is causing sea level to rise and glaciers and Arctic sea ice to melt, and oceans are becoming more acidic as they absorb carbon dioxide. These and other aspects of climate change are disrupting people's lives and damaging some sectors of our economy.\n\n\u00a9 Frans Lanting/Corbis\n\nClimate Change:\n\nPresent and Future\n\nCoal-fired power plants emit heat-trapping carbon dioxide to the\n\natmosphere.

(Figure source: NOAA NCDC, based on data updated from Kennedy et al. 2010a).\n\n7\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f1: OVERVIEW AND REPORT FINDINGS\n\nBecause human-induced warming is superimposed on a background of natural variations in climate, warming is not uniform over time. Short-term fluctuations in the long-term upward trend are thus natural and expected. For example, a recent slowing in the rate of surface air temperature rise appears to be related to cyclic changes in the oceans and in the sun's energy output, as well as a series of small volcanic eruptions and other factors. Nonetheless, global temperatures are still on the rise and are expected to rise further.\n\nSeparating Human and Natural Influences on Climate\n\nU.S. average temperature has increased by 1.3\u00b0F to 1.9\u00b0F since 1895, and most of this increase has occurred since 1970. The most recent decade was the nation's and the world's hottest on record, and 2012 was the hottest year on record in the continental United States. All U.S. regions have experienced warming in recent decades, but the extent of warming has not been uniform. In general, temperatures are rising more quickly in the north. Alaskans have experienced some of the largest increases in temperature between 1970 and the present. People living in the Southeast have experienced some of the smallest temperature increases over this period.\n\nThe green band shows how global average temperature would have changed over the last century due to natural forces alone, as simulated by climate models. The blue band shows model simulations of the effects of human and natural forces (including solar and volcanic activity) combined. The black line shows the actual observed global average temperatures. Only with the inclusion of human influences can models reproduce the observed temperature changes.

For example, large increases in heavy precipitation have occurred in the Northeast, Midwest, and Great Plains, where heavy downpours have frequently led to runoff that exceeded the capacity of storm drains and levees, and caused flooding events and accelerated erosion. Other impacts, such as those associated with the rapid thawing of permafrost in Alaska, are unique to a particular U.S. region. Permafrost thawing is causing extensive damage to infrastructure in our nation's largest state.4\n\nSome impacts that occur in one region ripple beyond that region. For example, the dramatic decline of summer sea ice in the Arctic \u00ad a loss of ice cover roughly equal to half the area of the continental United States \u00ad exacerbates global warming by reducing the reflectivity of Earth's surface and increasing the amount of heat absorbed.

In general, higher emissions scenarios that lead to more warming would be expected to lead to higher amounts of sea level rise. The stakes are high, as nearly five million Americans and hundreds of billions of dollars of property are located in areas that are less than four feet above the local high-tide level.6\n\nShells Dissolve in Acidified Ocean Water\n\nIn addition to causing changes in climate, in-\n\ncreasing levels of carbon dioxide from the\n\nburning of fossil fuels and other human activi-\n\nties have a direct effect on the world's oceans.

For example, current benefits of warming include longer growing seasons for agriculture and longer ice-free periods for shipping on the Great Lakes. At the same time, however, longer growing seasons, along with higher temperatures and carbon dioxide levels, can increase pollen production, intensifying and lengthening the allergy season. Longer ice-free periods on the Great Lakes can result in more lake-effect snowfalls.\n\nSectors affected by climate changes include agriculture, water,\n\nhuman health, energy, transportation, forests, and ecosystems.\n\nClimate change poses a major challenge to U.S. agriculture\n\nbecause of the critical dependence of agricultural systems on\n\nclimate.

For example, increasingly frequent and intense heat events lead to more heat-related illnesses and deaths and, over time, worsen drought and wildfire risks, and intensify air pollution. Increasingly frequent extreme precipitation and associated flooding can lead to injuries and increases in waterborne disease. Rising sea surface temperatures have been linked with increasing levels and ranges of diseases. Rising sea levels intensify coastal flooding and storm surge, and thus exacerbate threats to public safety during storms. Certain groups of people are more vulnerable to the range of climate change related health impacts, including the elderly, children, the poor, and the sick. Others are vulnerable because of where they live, including those in floodplains, coastal zones, and some urban areas. Improving and properly supporting the public health infrastructure will be critical to managing the potential health impacts of climate change.10\n\n12\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f1: OVERVIEW AND REPORT FINDINGS\n\nClimate change also affects the living world, including people, es, reefs, mangrove forests, and barrier islands defend coastal\n\nthrough changes in ecosystems and biodiversity.

Many, if not most an overview of the options and activities being planned or of these programs are motivated by other policy objectives, implemented around the country as local, state, federal, and but some are directed specifically at greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n13\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f1: OVERVIEW AND REPORT FINDINGS\n\nThese U.S. actions and others that might be undertaken in the future are described in the Mitigation chapter of this report. Over the remainder of this century, aggressive and sustained greenhouse gas emission reductions by the United States and by other nations would be needed to reduce global emissions to a level consistent with the lower scenario (B1) analyzed in this assessment.15\nWith regard to adaptation, the pace and magnitude of observed and projected changes emphasize the need to be prepared for a wide variety and intensity of impacts. Because of the growing influence of human activities, the climate of the past is not a good basis for future planning. For example, building codes and landscaping ordinances could be updated to improve energy efficiency, conserve water supplies, protect against insects that spread disease (such as dengue fever), reduce susceptibility to heat stress, and improve protection against extreme events. The fact that climate change impacts are increasing points to the urgent need to develop and refine approaches that enable decision-making and increase flexibility and resilience in the face of ongoing and future impacts. Reducing non-climate-related stresses that contribute to existing vulnerabilities can also be an effective approach to climate change adaptation.16\nAdaptation can involve considering local, state, regional, national, and international jurisdictional objectives. For example, in managing water supplies to adapt to a changing climate, the implications of international treaties should be considered in the context of managing the Great Lakes, the Columbia River, and the Colorado River to deal with increased drought risk. Both \"bottom up\" community planning and \"top down\" national strategies may help regions deal with impacts such as increases in electrical brownouts, heat stress, floods, and wildfires.17\n\nProactively preparing for climate change can reduce impacts while also facilitating a more rapid and efficient response to changes as they happen. Such efforts are beginning at the federal, regional, state, tribal, and local levels, and in the corporate and non-governmental sectors, to build adaptive capacity and resilience to climate change impacts. Using scientific information to prepare for climate changes in advance can provide economic opportunities, and proactively managing the risks can reduce impacts and costs over time.18\nThere are a number of areas where improved scientific information or understanding would enhance the capacity to estimate future climate change impacts. For example, knowledge of the mechanisms controlling the rate of ice loss in Greenland and Antarctica is limited, making it difficult for scientists to narrow the range of expected future sea level rise. Improved understanding of ecological and social responses to climate change is needed, as is understanding of how ecological and social responses will interact.19\nA sustained climate assessment process could more efficiently collect and synthesize the rapidly evolving science and help supply timely and relevant information to decision-makers. Results from all of these efforts could continue to deepen our understanding of the interactions of human and natural systems in the context of a changing climate, enabling society to effectively respond and prepare for our future.20\nThe cumulative weight of the scientific evidence contained in this report confirms that climate change is affecting the American people now, and that choices we make will affect our future and that of future generations.\n\n\u00a9John Sebastian Russo/San Francisco Chronicle/Corbis \u00a9Proehl Studios/Corbis FEMA\n\nCities providing transportation options including bike lanes, buildings designed with energy saving features such as green roofs, and houses elevated to allow storm surges to pass underneath are among the many response options being pursued around the country.\n\n14\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f1: OVERVIEW AND REPORT FINDINGS\nReport Findings\nThese findings distill important results that arise from this National Climate Assessment. They do not represent a full summary of all of the chapters' findings, but rather a synthesis of particularly noteworthy conclusions.\n1. Global climate is changing and this is apparent across the United States in a wide range of observations. The global warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuels.\nMany independent lines of evidence confirm that human activities are affecting climate in unprecedented ways. U.S. average temperature has increased by 1.3\u00b0F to 1.9\u00b0F since record keeping began in 1895; most of this increase has occurred since about 1970. The most recent decade was the warmest on record. Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, rising temperatures are not evenly distributed across the country or over time.21\n2. Some extreme weather and climate events have increased in recent decades, and new and stronger evidence confirms that some of these increases are related to human activities.\nChanges in extreme weather events are the primary way that most people experience climate change. Human-induced climate change has already increased the number and strength of some of these extreme events. Over the last 50 years, much of the United States has seen an increase in prolonged periods of excessively high temperatures, more heavy downpours, and in some regions, more severe droughts.22\n3. Human-induced climate change is projected to continue, and it will accelerate significantly if global emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to increase.\nHeat-trapping gases already in the atmosphere have committed us to a hotter future with more climate-related impacts over the next few decades. The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades depends primarily on the amount of heat-trapping gases that human activities emit globally, now and in the future.23\n4. Impacts related to climate change are already evident in many sectors and are expected to become increasingly disruptive across the nation throughout this century and beyond.\nClimate change is already affecting societies and the natural world. Climate change interacts with other environmental and societal factors in ways that can either moderate or intensify these impacts. The types and magnitudes of impacts vary across the nation and through time. Children, the elderly, the sick, and the poor are especially vulnerable. There is mounting evidence that harm to the nation will increase substantially in the future unless global emissions of heat-trapping gases are greatly reduced.24\n\n15\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f1: OVERVIEW AND REPORT FINDINGS\n5. Climate change threatens human health and well-being in many ways, including through more extreme weather events and wildfire, decreased air quality, and diseases transmitted by insects, food, and water.\nClimate change is increasing the risks of heat stress, respiratory stress from poor air quality, and the spread of waterborne diseases. Extreme weather events often lead to fatalities and a variety of health impacts on vulnerable populations, including impacts on mental health, such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Large-scale changes in the environment due to climate change and extreme weather events are increasing the risk of the emergence or reemergence of health threats that are currently uncommon in the United States, such as dengue fever.25\n\n6. Infrastructure is being damaged by sea level rise, heavy downpours, and extreme heat; damages are projected to increase with continued climate change.\nSea level rise, storm surge, and heavy downpours, in combination with the pattern of continued development in coastal areas, are increasing damage to U.S. infrastructure including roads, buildings, and industrial facilities, and are also increasing risks to ports and coastal military installations. Flooding along rivers, lakes, and in cities following heavy downpours, prolonged rains, and rapid melting of snowpack is exceeding the limits of flood protection infrastructure designed for historical conditions. Extreme heat is damaging transportation infrastructure such as roads, rail lines, and airport runways.26\n\n7. Water quality and water supply reliability are jeopardized by climate change in a variety of ways that affect ecosystems and livelihoods.\nSurface and groundwater supplies in some regions are already stressed by increasing demand for water as well as declining runoff and groundwater recharge. In some regions, particularly the southern part of the country and the Caribbean and Pacific Islands, climate change is increasing the likelihood of water shortages and competition for water among its many uses. Water quality is diminishing in many areas, particularly due to increasing sediment and contaminant concentrations after heavy downpours.27\n\n8. Climate disruptions to agriculture have been increasing and are projected to become more severe over this century.\nSome areas are already experiencing climate-related disruptions, particularly due to extreme weather events. While some U.S. regions and some types of agricultural production will be relatively resilient to climate change over the next 25 years or so, others will increasingly suffer from stresses due to extreme heat, drought, disease, and heavy downpours. From mid-century on, climate change is projected to have more negative impacts on crops and livestock across the country \u00ad a trend that could diminish the security of our food supply.28\n\n16\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f1: OVERVIEW AND REPORT FINDINGS\n9. Climate change poses particular threats to Indigenous Peoples' health, wellbeing, and ways of life.\nChronic stresses such as extreme poverty are being exacerbated by climate change impacts such as reduced access to traditional foods, decreased water quality, and increasing exposure to health and safety hazards. In parts of Alaska, Louisiana, the Pacific Islands, and other coastal locations, climate change impacts (through erosion and inundation) are so severe that some communities are already relocating from historical homelands to which their traditions and cultural identities are tied. Particularly in Alaska, the rapid pace of temperature rise, ice and snow melt, and permafrost thaw are significantly affecting critical infrastructure and traditional livelihoods.29\n\n10. Ecosystems and the benefits they provide to society are being affected by climate change. The capacity of ecosystems to buffer the impacts of extreme events like fires, floods, and severe storms is being overwhelmed.\nClimate change impacts on biodiversity are already being observed in alteration of the timing of critical biological events such as spring bud burst and substantial range shifts of many species. In the longer term, there is an increased risk of species extinction. These changes have social, cultural, and economic effects. Events such as droughts, floods, wildfires, and pest outbreaks associated with climate change (for example, bark beetles in the West) are already disrupting ecosystems. These changes limit the capacity of ecosystems, such as forests, barrier beaches, and wetlands, to continue to play important roles in reducing the impacts of these extreme events on infrastructure, human communities, and other valued resources.30\n\n11. Ocean waters are becoming warmer and more acidic, broadly affecting ocean circulation, chemistry, ecosystems, and marine life.\nMore acidic waters inhibit the formation of shells, skeletons, and coral reefs. Warmer waters harm coral reefs and alter the distribution, abundance, and productivity of many marine species. The rising temperature and changing chemistry of ocean water combine with other stresses, such as overfishing and coastal and marine pollution, to alter marine-based food production and harm fishing communities.31\n12. Planning for adaptation (to address and prepare for impacts) and mitigation (to reduce future climate change, for example by cutting emissions) is becoming more widespread, but current implementation efforts are insufficient to avoid increasingly negative social, environmental, and economic consequences.\nActions to reduce emissions, increase carbon uptake, adapt to a changing climate, and increase resilience to impacts that are unavoidable can improve public health, economic development, ecosystem protection, and quality of life.32\n\n17\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fOVERVIEW AND REPORT FINDINGS\n\nReferences\n\nNumbered references for the Overview indicate the chapters that provide supporting evidence for the reported conclusions.\n1.

Global climate is changing and this change is apparent across a wide range of observations. The global warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities.\n2. Global climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond. The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades depends primarily on the amount of heattrapping gases emitted globally, and how sensitive the Earth's climate is to those emissions.\n3. U.S. average temperature has increased by 1.3\u00b0F to 1.9\u00b0F since record keeping began in 1895; most of this increase has occurred since about 1970. The most recent decade was the nation's warmest on record. Temperatures in the United States are expected to continue to rise. Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time.\n4. The length of the frost-free season (and the corresponding growing season) has been increasing nationally since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States, affecting ecosystems and agriculture. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen.\n5. Average U.S. precipitation has increased since 1900, but some areas have had increases greater than the national average, and some areas have had decreases. More winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century.\n6. Heavy downpours are increasing nationally, especially over the last three to five decades. Largest increases are in the Midwest and Northeast. Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for all U.S. regions.\n7. There have been changes in some types of extreme weather events over the last several decades. Heat waves have become more frequent and intense, especially in the West. Cold waves have become less frequent and intense across the nation. There have been regional trends in floods and droughts. Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves everywhere are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense everywhere.\n8. The intensity, frequency, and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since the early 1980s. The relative contributions of human and natural causes to these increases are still uncertain. Hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates are projected to increase as the climate continues to warm.\n9. Winter storms have increased in frequency and intensity since the 1950s, and their tracks have shifted northward over the United States. Other trends in severe storms, including the intensity and frequency of tornadoes, hail, and damaging thunderstorm winds, are uncertain and are being studied intensively.\nContinued\n\n20\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\nKey Messages (Continued)\n10. Global sea level has risen by about 8 inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880. It is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100.\n11. Rising temperatures are reducing ice volume and surface extent on land, lakes, and sea. This loss of ice is expected to continue. The Arctic Ocean is expected to become essentially ice free in summer before mid-century.\n12. The oceans are currently absorbing about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere annually and are becoming more acidic as a result, leading to concerns about intensifying impacts on marine ecosystems.\n\nThis chapter summarizes how climate is changing, why it is changing, and what is projected for the future. While the focus is on changes in the United States, the need to provide context sometimes requires a broader geographical perspective. Additional geographic detail is presented in the regional chapters of this report. Further details on the topics covered by this chapter are provided in the Climate Science Supplement and Frequently Asked Questions Appendices.\nSince the second National Climate Assessment was published in 2009,1 the climate has continued to change, with resulting\n\neffects on the United States. The trends described in the 2009 report have continued, and our understanding of the data and ability to model the many facets of the climate system have increased substantially. Several noteworthy advances are mentioned in the box below.\nThe 12 key messages presented above are repeated below, together with supporting evidence for those messages. The discussion of each key message begins with a summary of recent variations or trends, followed by projections of the corresponding changes for the future.\n\nWhat's new?\n\u00b7 Continued warming and an increased understanding of the U.S. temperature record, as well as multiple other sources of evidence, have strengthened our confidence in the conclusions that the warming trend is clear and primarily the result of human activities. For the contiguous United States, the last decade was the warmest on record, and 2012 was the warmest year on record.\n\u00b7 Heavy precipitation and extreme heat events are increasing in a manner consistent with model projections; the risks of such extreme events will rise in the future.\n\u00b7 The sharp decline in summer Arctic sea ice has continued, is unprecedented, and is consistent with humaninduced climate change. A new record for minimum area of Arctic sea ice was set in 2012.\n\u00b7 A longer and better-quality history of sea level rise has increased confidence that recent trends are unusual and human-induced. Limited knowledge of ice sheet dynamics leads to a broad range for projected sea level rise over this century.\n\u00b7 New approaches to building scenarios of the future have allowed for investigations of the implications of larger reductions in heat trapping gas emissions than examined previously.\n\n21\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\nReference periods for graphs\nMany of the graphs in this report illustrate historical changes and future trends in climate compared to some reference period, with the choice of this period determined by the purpose of the graph and the availability of data. The great majority of graphs are based on one of two reference periods. The period 1901-1960 is used for graphs that illustrate past changes in climate conditions, whether in observations or in model simulations. The choice of 1960 as the ending date of this period was based on past changes in human influences on the climate system. Human-induced forcing exhibited a slow rise during the early part of the last century but then accelerated after 1960.2 Thus, these graphs highlight observed changes in climate during the period of rapid increase in human-caused forcing and also reveal how well climate models simulate these observed changes. The beginning date of 1901 was chosen because earlier historical observations are less reliable and because many climate model simulations begin in 1900 or 1901. The other commonly used reference period is 1971-2000, which is consistent with the World Meteorological Organization's recommended use of 30-year periods for climate statistics. This is used for graphs that illustrate projected future changes simulated by climate models. The purpose of these graphs is to show projected changes compared to a period that people have recently experienced and can remember; thus, the most recent available 30-year period was chosen (the historical period simulated by the CMIP3 models ends in 1999 or 2000).\n\nKey Message 1: Observed Climate Change\n\nGlobal climate is changing and this change is apparent across a wide range of observations. The global warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities.\n\nClimate is defined as long-term averages and variations in weather measured over a period of several decades. The Earth's climate system includes the land surface, atmosphere, oceans, and ice. Many aspects of the global climate are changing rapidly, and the primary drivers of that change are human in origin. Evidence for changes in the climate system abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans (Figure 2.1).3 Scientists and engineers from around the world have compiled this evidence using satellites, weather balloons, thermometers at surface stations, and many other types of observing systems that monitor the Earth's weather and climate. The sum total of this evidence tells an unambiguous story: the planet is warming.\n\nTen Indicators of a Warming World\nFigure 2.1. These are just some of the indicators measured globally over many decades that show that the Earth's climate is warming. White arrows indicate increasing trends, and black arrows indicate decreasing trends. All the indicators expected to increase in a warming world are, in fact, increasing, and all those expected to decrease in a warming world are decreasing. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC based on data updated from Kennedy et al. 20103).\n\nTemperatures at the surface, in the troposphere (the active weather layer extending up to about 5 to 10 miles above the ground), and in the oceans have all increased over recent decades (Figure 2.2). Consistent with our scientific understanding, the largest increases in temperature are occur-\n\nring closer to the poles, especially in the Arctic. Snow and ice cover have decreased in most areas. Atmospheric water vapor is increasing in the lower atmosphere, because a warmer atmosphere can hold more water. Sea levels are also increasing (see Key Message 10). Changes in other climate-\n\n22\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nrelevant indicators such as growing season length have been observed in many areas. Worldwide, the observed changes in average conditions have been accompanied by increasing trends in extremes of heat and heavy precipitation events, and decreases in extreme cold.4\nNatural drivers of climate cannot explain the recent observed warming. Over the last five decades, natural factors (solar forcing and volcanoes) alone would actually have led to a slight cooling (see Figure 2.3).5\nThe majority of the warming at the global scale over the past 50 years can only be explained by the effects of human influences,5,6,7 especially the emissions from burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and from deforestation. The emissions from human influences that are affecting climate include heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide, and particles such as black carbon (soot), which has a warming influence, and sulfates, which have an overall cooling influence (see Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement for further discussion).8,9 In addition to human-induced global climate change, local climate can also be affected by other human factors (such as crop irrigation) and natural variability (for example, Ashley et al. 2012; DeAngelis et al. 2010; Degu et al. 2011; Lo and Famiglietti 201310).\nThe conclusion that human influences are the primary driver of recent climate change is based on multiple lines of independent evidence. The first line of evidence is our fundamental understanding of how certain gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in these gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. The second line of evidence is from reconstructions of past climates using evidence such as tree rings, ice cores, and corals. These show that global surface temperatures over the last several decades are clearly unusual, with the last decade (2000-2009) warmer than any time in at least the last 1300 years and perhaps much longer.11\n\nGlobal Temperature and Carbon Dioxide\nFigure 2.2. Global annual average temperature (as measured over both land and oceans) has increased by more than 1.5\u00b0F (0.8\u00b0C) since 1880 (through 2012). Red bars show temperatures above the long-term average, and blue bars indicate temperatures below the long-term average. The black line shows atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO ) concentration in parts per million (ppm). While there is a clear long-term global warmin2g trend, some years do not show a temperature increase relative to the previous year, and some years show greater changes than others. These year-to-year fluctuations in temperature are due to natural processes, such as the effects of El Ni\u00f1os, La Ni\u00f1as, and volcanic eruptions. (Figure source: updated from Karl et al. 20091).\nSeparating Human and Natural Influences on Climate\nFigure 2.3. Observed global average changes (black line), model simulations using only changes in natural factors (solar and volcanic) in green, and model simulations with the addition of human-induced emissions (blue). Climate changes since 1950 cannot be explained by natural factors or variability, and can only be explained by human factors. (Figure source: adapted from Huber and Knutti29).\n\n23\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nThe third line of evidence comes from using climate models to simulate the climate of the past century, separating the human and natural factors that influence climate. When the human factors are removed, these models show that solar and volcanic activity would have tended to slightly cool the earth, and other natural variations are too small to explain the amount of warming. Only when the human influences are included do the models reproduce the warming observed over the past 50 years (see Figure 2.3).\nAnother line of evidence involves so-called \"fingerprint\" studies that are able to attribute observed climate changes to particular causes. For example, the fact that the stratosphere (the layer above the troposphere) is cooling while the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere is warming is a fingerprint that the warming is due to increases in heat-trapping gases. In contrast, if the observed warming had been due to increases in solar output, Earth's atmosphere would have warmed throughout its entire extent, including the stratosphere.6\nIn addition to such temperature analyses, scientific attribution of observed changes to human influence extends to many other aspects of climate, such as changing patterns in precipitation,12,13 increasing humidity,14,15 changes in pressure,16 and increasing ocean heat content.17 Further discussion of how we know the recent changes in climate are caused by human activity is provided in Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement.\nNatural variations in climate include the effects of cycles such as El Ni\u00f1o, La Ni\u00f1a and other ocean cycles; the 11-year sunspot cycle and other changes in energy from the sun; and the effects of volcanic eruptions. Globally, natural variations can be\n\nas large as human-induced climate change over timescales of up to a few decades. However, changes in climate at the global scale observed over the past 50 years are far larger than can be accounted for by natural variability. Changes in climate at the local to regional scale can be influenced by natural variability for multiple decades.18 This can affect the interpretation of climate trends observed regionally across the U.S. (see Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement).\nGlobally averaged surface air temperature has slowed its rate of increase since the late 1990s. This is not in conflict with our basic understanding of global warming and its primary cause. The decade of 2000 to 2009 was still the warmest decade on record. In addition, global surface air temperature does not always increase steadily. This time period is too short to signify a change in the warming trend, as climate trends are measured over periods of decades, not years.19,20,21,22 Such decade-long slowdowns or even reversals in trend have occurred before in the global instrumental record (for example, 1900-1910 and 1940-1950; see Figure 2.2), including three decade-long periods since 1970, each followed by a sharp temperature rise.23 Nonetheless, satellite and ocean observations indicate that the Earth-atmosphere climate system has continued to gain heat energy.24\nThere are a number of possible contributions to the lower rate of increase over the last 15 years. First, the solar output during the latest 11-year solar cycle has been lower over the past 15 years than the past 60 years. Second, a series of mildly explosive volcanoes, which increased stratospheric particles, likely had more of a cooling effect than previously recognized.25 Third, the high incidence of La Ni\u00f1a events in the last 15 years\nhas played a role in the observed trends.20,26 Recent analyses27 suggest that more of the increase in heat energy during this period has been transferred to the deep ocean than previously. While this might temporarily slow the rate of increase in surface air temperature, ultimately it will prolong the effects of global warming because the oceans hold heat for longer than the atmosphere does.\n\n\u00a9Tom Mihalek/Reuters/Corbis \u00a9U.S. Geological Survey Department of the Interior\n\nOil used for transportation and coal used for electricity generation are the largest contributors to the rise in carbon dioxide that is the primary driver of observed changes in climate over recent decades.\n\nClimate models are not intended to match the real-world timing of natural climate variations \u00ad instead, models have their own internal timing for such variations. Most modeling studies do not yet account for the observed changes in solar and volcanic forcing mentioned in the previous paragraph. Therefore, it is not surprising that the timing of such a slowdown in the rate of increase in the models would be different than that observed, although it is important to note that such periods have been simulated by climate models, with the deep oceans absorbing the extra heat during those decades.28\n\n24\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\nModels used in the assessment\nThis report uses various projections from models of the physical processes affecting the Earth's climate system, which are discussed further in Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement. Three distinct sets of model simulations for past and projected changes in climate are used:\n\u00b7 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, 3rd phase (CMIP3): global model analyses done for the Fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment. Spatial resolutions typically vary from 125 to 187 miles (at mid-latitudes); approximately 25 representations of different models (not all are used in all studies). CMIP3 findings are the foundation for most of the impact analyses included in this assessment.\n\u00b7 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, 5th phase (CMIP5): newer global model analyses done for the Fifth IPCC assessment generally based on improved formulations of the CMIP3 models. Spatial resolutions typically vary from 62 to 125 miles; about 30 representations of different models (not all are used in all studies); this new information was not available in time to serve as the foundation for the impacts analyses in this assessment, and information from CMIP5 is primarily provided for comparison purposes.\n\u00b7 North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP): six regional climate model analyses (and limited time-slice analyses from two global models) for the continental U.S. run at about 30mile horizontal resolution. The analyses were done for past (1971-2000) and projected (2041-2070) time periods. Coarser resolution results from four of the CMIP3 models were used as the boundary conditions for the NARCCAP regional climate model studies, with each of the regional models doing analyses with boundary conditions from two of the CMIP3 models.\nThe scenarios for future human-related emissions of the relevant gases and particles used in these models are further discussed in Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement. The emissions in these scenarios depend on various assumptions about changes in global population, economic and technological development, and choices in transportation and energy use.\n\nKey Message 2: Future Climate Change\n\nGlobal climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond. The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades depends primarily on the amount of heat-trapping gases emitted globally,\nand how sensitive the Earth's climate is to those emissions.\n\nA certain amount of continued warming of the planet is projected to occur as a result of human-induced emissions to date; another 0.5\u00b0F increase would be expected over the next few decades even if all emissions from human activities suddenly stopped,30 although natural variability could still play an important role over this time period.31 However, choices made now and in the next few decades will determine the amount of additional future warming. Beyond mid-century, lower levels of heat-trapping gases in scenarios with reduced emissions will lead to noticeably less future warming. Higher emissions levels will result in more warming, and thus more severe impacts on human society and the natural world.\nConfidence in projections of future climate change has increased. The wider range of potential changes in global average temperature in the latest generation of climate model simulations32 used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\n\nChange's (IPCC) current assessment \u00ad versus those in the previous assessment8 \u00ad is simply a result of considering more options for future human behavior. For example, one of the scenarios included in the IPCC's latest assessment assumes aggressive emissions reductions designed to limit the global temperature increase to 3.6\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) above pre-industrial levels.33 This path would require rapid emissions reductions (more than 70% reduction in human-related emissions by 2050, and net negative emissions by 2100 \u00ad see the Appendix 3: Climate Science, Supplemental Message 5) sufficient to achieve heat-trapping gas concentrations well below those of any of the scenarios considered by the IPCC in its 2007 assessment. Such scenarios enable the investigation of climate impacts that would be avoided by deliberate, substantial reductions in heat-trapping gas emissions.\n\n25\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nProjections of future changes in precipitation show small increases in the global average but substantial shifts in where and how precipitation falls. Generally, areas closest to the poles are projected to receive more precipitation, while the dry subtropics (the region just outside the tropics, between 23\u00b0 and 35\u00b0 on either side of the equator) expand toward the poles and receive less rain. Increases in tropical precipitation are projected during rainy seasons (such as monsoons), especially over the tropical Pacific. Certain regions, including the western U.S. (especially the Southwest1) and the Mediter-\n\nranean, are presently dry and are expected to become drier. The widespread trend of increasing heavy downpours is expected to continue, with precipitation becoming less frequent but more intense.34 The patterns of the projected changes of precipitation do not contain the spatial details that characterize observed precipitation, especially in mountainous terrain, because the projections are averages from multiple models and because the effective resolution of global climate models is roughly 100-200 miles.\n\nEmissions Levels Determine Temperature Rises\n\nFigure 2.4. Different amounts of heat-trapping gases released into the atmosphere by human activities produce different projected increases in Earth's temperature. In the figure, each line represents a central estimate of global average temperature rise (relative to the 1901-1960 average) for a specific emissions pathway. Shading indicates the range (5th to 95th percentile) of results from a suite of climate models. Projections in 2099 for additional emissions pathways are indicated by the bars to the right of each panel. In all cases, temperatures are expected to rise, although the difference between lower and higher emissions pathways is substantial. (Left) The panel shows the two main scenarios (SRES \u00ad Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) used in this report: A2 assumes continued increases in emissions throughout this century, and B1 assumes much slower increases in emissions beginning now and significant emissions reductions beginning around 2050, though not due explicitly to climate change policies. (Right) The panel shows newer analyses, which are results from the most recent generation of climate models (CMIP5) using the most recent emissions pathways (RCPs \u00ad Representative Concentration Pathways). Some of these new projections explicitly consider climate policies that would result in emissions reductions, which the SRES set did not.35 The newest set includes both lower and higher pathways than did the previous set. The lowest emissions pathway shown here, RCP 2.6, assumes immediate and rapid reductions in emissions and would result in about 2.5\u00b0F of warming in this century. The highest pathway, RCP 8.5, roughly similar to a continuation of the current path of global emissions increases, is projected to lead to more than 8\u00b0F warming by 2100, with a high-end possibility of more than 11\u00b0F. (Data from CMIP3, CMIP5, and NOAA NCDC).\n\n26\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\nProjected Change in Average Annual Temperature\n\nFigure 2.5. Projected change in average annual temperature over the period 2071-2099 (compared to the period 1970-1999) under a low scenario that assumes rapid reductions in emissions and concentrations of heat-trapping gases (RCP 2.6), and a higher scenario that assumes continued increases in emissions (RCP 8.5). (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\nProjected Change in Average Annual Precipitation\n\nFigure 2.6. Projected change in average annual precipitation over the period 2071-2099 (compared to the period 1970-1999) under a low scenario that assumes rapid reductions in emissions and concentrations of heat-trapping gasses (RCP 2.6), and a higher scenario that assumes continued increases in emissions (RCP 8.5). Hatched areas indicate confidence that the projected changes are significant and consistent among models. White areas indicate that the changes are not projected to be larger than could be expected from natural variability. In general, northern parts of the U.S. (especially the Northeast and Alaska) are projected to receive more precipitation, while southern parts (especially the Southwest) are projected to receive less. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n27\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nClimate sensitivity\n\"Climate sensitivity\" is an important concept because it helps us estimate how much warming might be expected for a given increase in the amount of heat-trapping gases. It is defined as the amount of warming expected if carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations doubled from pre-industrial levels and then remained constant until Earth's temperature reached a new equilibrium over timescales of centuries to millennia. Climate sensitivity accounts for feedbacks in the climate system that can either dampen or amplify warming. The feedbacks primarily determining that response are related to water vapor, ice and snow reflectivity, and clouds.8 Cloud feedbacks have the largest uncertainty. The net effect of these feedbacks is expected to amplify warming.8\nClimate sensitivity has long been estimated to be in the range of 2.7\u00b0F to 8.1\u00b0F. As discussed in Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement, recent evidence lends further confidence in this range.\n\nOne important determinant of how much climate will change is the effect of so-called \"feedbacks\" in the climate system, which can either dampen or amplify the initial effect of human influences on temperature. One important climate feedback is the loss of summer Arctic sea ice, allowing absorption of substantially more of the sun's heat in the Arctic, increasing warming, and possibly causing changes in weather patterns over the United States.\nThe observed drastic reduction in sea ice can also lead to a \"tipping point\" \u00ad a point beyond which an abrupt or irreversible transition to a different climatic state occurs. In this case, the dramatic loss of sea ice could tip the Arctic Ocean into a permanent, nearly ice-free state in summer, with repercussions that may extend far beyond the Arctic. Such potential \"tipping points\" have been identified in various components of the Earth's climate system and could have important effects on future climate. The extent and magnitude of these potential effects are still unknown. These are discussed further in the Appendix 4: Frequently Asked Questions, under Question T.\n\nKey Message 3: Recent U.S. Temperature Trends\n\nU.S. average temperature has increased by 1.3\u00b0F to 1.9\u00b0F since record keeping began in 1895; most of this increase has occurred since about 1970. The most recent decade was the nation's warmest on record. Temperatures in the United\nStates are expected to continue to rise. Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not\nbeen, and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time.\n\nThere have been substantial advances in our understanding of the U.S. temperature record since the 2009 assessment (see Appendix 3: Climate Science, Supplemental Message 7 for more information). These advances confirm that the U.S. annually averaged temperature has increased by 1.3\u00b0F to 1.9\u00b0F since 1895.1,36,37,38 However, this increase was not constant over time. In particular, temperatures generally rose until about 1940, declined slightly until about 1970, then increased rapidly thereafter. The year 2012 was the warmest on record for the contiguous United States. Over shorter time scales (one to two decades), natural variability can reduce the rate of warming or even create a temporary cooling (see Appendix 3: Climate Science, Supplemental Message 3). The cooling in mid-century that was especially prevalent over the eastern half of the U.S. may have stemmed partly from such natural variations and partly from human influences, in particular the cooling effects of sulfate particles from coal-burning power plants,39 before these sulfur emissions were regulated to address health and acid rain concerns.\n\nQuantifying u.s. temperature rise\nQuantifying long-term increases of temperature in the U.S. in a single number is challenging because the increase has not been constant over time. The increase can be quantified in a number of ways, but all of them show significant warming over the U.S. since the instrumental record began in 1895. For example, fitting a linear trend over the period 1895 to 2012 yields an increase in the range of 1.3 to 1.9\u00b0F. Another approach, comparing the average temperature during the first decade of record with the average during the last decade of record, yields a 1.9\u00b0F increase. A third approach, calculating the difference between the 1901-1960 average and the past decade average yields a change of 1.5\u00b0F. Thus, the temperature increase cited in this assessment is described as 1.3\u00b0F to 1.9\u00b0F since 1895. Notably, however, the rate of rise in temperature over the past 4 to 5 decades has been greater than the rate over earlier decades.\n\n28\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\nObserved U.S. Temperature Change\n\nFigure 2.7. The colors on the map show temperature changes over the past 22 years (1991-2012) compared to the 1901-1960 average, and compared to the 1951-1980 average for Alaska and Hawai`i. The bars on the graphs show the average temperature changes by decade for 1901-2012 (relative to the 1901-1960 average) for each region. The far right bar in each graph (2000s decade) includes 2011 and 2012. The period from 2001 to 2012 was warmer than any previous decade in every region. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nSince 1991, temperatures have averaged 1\u00b0F to 1.5\u00b0F higher than 1901-1960 over most of the United States, except for the Southeast, where the warming has been less than 1\u00b0F. On a seasonal basis, long-term warming has been greatest in winter and spring.\nWarming is ultimately projected for all parts of the nation during this century. In the next few decades, this warming will be roughly 2\u00b0F to 4\u00b0F in most areas. By the end of the century, U.S. warming is projected to correspond closely to the level of global emissions: roughly 3\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F under lower emissions scenarios (B1 or RCP 4.5) involving substantial reductions in emissions, and 5\u00b0F to 10\u00b0F for higher emissions scenarios (A2 or RCP 8.5) that assume continued increases in emissions; the largest temperature increases are projected for the upper Midwest and Alaska.\n\nFuture human-induced warming depends on both past and future emissions of heat-trapping gases and changes in the amount of particle pollution. The amount of climate change (aside from natural variability) expected for the next two to three decades is a combination of the warming already built into the climate system by the past history of human emissions of heat-trapping gases, and the expected ongoing increases in emissions of those gases. However, the magnitude of temperature increases over the second half of this century, both in the U.S. and globally, will be primarily determined by the emissions produced now and over the next few decades, and there are substantial differences between higher, fossil-fuel intensive scenarios compared to scenarios in which emissions are reduced. The most recent model projections of climate change due to human activities expand the range of future scenarios considered (particularly at the lower end), but are entirely consistent with the older model results. This consistency increases our confidence in the projections.\n\n29\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\nProjected Temperature Change\n\nFigure 2.8. Maps show projected change in average surface air temperature in the later part of this century (2071-2099) relative to the later part of the last century (1970-1999) under a scenario that assumes substantial reductions in heat trapping gases (B1, left) and a higher emissions scenario that assumes continued increases in global emissions (A2, right). (See Appendix 3: Climate Science, Supplemental Message 5 for a discussion of temperature changes under a wider range of future scenarios for various periods of this century). (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nNewer simulations for projected temperature (cmip5 models)\nFigure 2.9. The largest uncertainty in projecting climate change beyond the next few decades is the level of heattrapping gas emissions. The most recent model projections (CMIP5) take into account a wider range of options with regard to human behavior, including a lower scenario than has been considered before (RCP 2.6). This scenario assumes rapid reductions in emissions \u00ad more than 70% cuts from current levels by 2050 and further large decreases by 2100 \u00ad and the corresponding smaller amount of warming. On the higher end, the scenarios include one that assumes continued increases in emissions (RCP 8.5) and the corresponding greater amount of warming. Also shown are temperature changes for the intermediate scenarios RCP 4.5 (which is most similar to B1) and RCP 6.0 (which is most similar to A1B; see Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement). Projections show change in average temperature in the later part of this century (2071-2099) relative to the late part of last century (1970-1999). (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n30\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nKey Message 4: Lengthening Frost-free Season\n\nThe length of the frost-free season (and the corresponding growing season) has been increasing nationally since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States, affecting ecosystems and agriculture. Across the\nUnited States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen.\n\nThe length of the frost-free season (and the corresponding growing season) is a major determinant of the types of plants\n\nObserved Increase in Frost-Free Season Length\n\nand crops that do well in a particular region. The frost-free season length has been gradually increasing since the 1980s.40 The\n\nlast occurrence of 32\u00b0F in the spring has been occurring earlier\n\nin the year, and the first occurrence of 32\u00b0F in the fall has been\n\nhappening later. During 1991-2011, the average frost-free sea-\n\nson was about 10 days longer than during 1901-1960. These\n\nobserved climate changes have been mirrored by changes in the biosphere, including increases in forest productivity41,42\n\nand satellite-derived estimates of the length of the growing season.43 A longer growing season provides a longer period\n\nfor plant growth and productivity and can slow the increase\n\nin atmospheric CO2 concentrations through increased CO2 uptake by living things and their environment.44 The longer\n\ngrowing season can increase the growth of beneficial plants\n\n(such as crops and forests) as well as undesirable ones (such as ragweed).45 In some cases where moisture is limited, the\ngreater evaporation and loss of moisture through plant tran-\nspiration (release of water from plant leaves) associated with a\nlonger growing season can mean less productivity because of increased drying46 and earlier and longer fire seasons.\n\nFigure 2.10. The frost-free season length, defined as the period between the last occurrence of 32\u00b0F in the spring and the first occurrence of 32\u00b0F in the fall, has increased in each U.S. region during 1991-2012 relative to 1901-1960. Increases in frost-free season length correspond to similar increases in growing season length. (Figure source: NOAA\n\nNCDC / CICS-NC). The lengthening of the frost-free season has been somewhat greater in the western U.S. than the eastern United States,1 1 to 2 weeks in the Midwest, Great Plains, and Northeast, and\n\nincreasing by 2 to 3 weeks in the Northwest and Southwest, slightly less than 1 week in the Southeast. These differences\n\nmirror the overall trend of\n\nProjected Changes in Frost-Free Season Length\n\nmore warming in the north and west and less warming\n\nin the Southeast.\n\nFigure 2.11. The maps show projected increases in frost-free season length for the last three decades of this century (2070-2099 as compared to 1971-2000) under two emissions scenarios, one in which heat-trapping gas emissions continue to grow (A2) and one in which emissions peak in 2050 (B1). Increases in the frost-free season correspond to similar increases in the growing season. White areas are projected to experience no freezes for 2070-2099, and gray areas are projected to experience more than 10 frost-free years during the same period. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nIn a future in which heattrapping gas emissions continue to grow, increases of a month or more in the lengths of the frost-free and growing seasons are projected across most of the U.S. by the end of the century, with slightly smaller increases in the northern Great Plains. The largest increases in the frost-free season (more than 8 weeks) are projected for the western U.S., particularly in high elevation and coastal areas. The increases will be con-\n\n31\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nsiderably smaller if heat-trapping gas emissions are reduced, although still substantial. These increases are projected to be much greater than the normal year-to-year variability experienced today. The projected changes also imply that the south-\n\nern boundary of the seasonal freeze zone will move northward, with increasing frequencies of years without subfreezing temperatures in the most southern parts of the United States.\n\nKey Message 5: U.S. Precipitation Change\n\nAverage U.S. precipitation has increased since 1900, but some areas have had increases greater than the national average, and some areas have had decreases. More winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century.\n\nSince 1900, average annual precipitation over the U.S. has increased by roughly 5%. This increase reflects, in part, the major droughts of the 1930s and 1950s, which made the early half of the record drier. There are important regional differences. For instance, precipitation since 1991 (relative to 1901-1960) increased the most in the Northeast (8%), Midwest (9%), and southern Great Plains (8%), while much of the Southeast and Southwest had a mix of areas of increases and decreases.47,48\n\nWhile significant trends in average precipitation have been detected, the fraction of these trends attributable to human activity is difficult to quantify at regional scales because the range of natural variability in precipitation is large. Projected changes are generally small for central portions of the United States. However, if emissions of heat-trapping gases continue their upward trend, certain global patterns of precipitation change are projected to emerge that will affect northern and\n\nObserved U.S. Precipitation Change\n\nFigure 2.12. The colors on the map show annual total precipitation changes for 1991-2012 compared to the 1901-1960 average, and show wetter conditions in most areas. The bars on the graphs show average precipitation differences by decade for 1901-2012 (relative to the 1901-1960 average) for each region. The far right bar in each graph is for 2001-2012. (Figure source: adapted from Peterson et al. 201348).\n\n32\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nsouthwestern areas of the United States. The northern U.S. is projected to experience more precipitation in the winter and spring (except for the Northwest in the spring), while the Southwest is projected to experience less, particularly in the spring. The contrast between wet and dry areas will increase both in the U.S. and globally \u00ad in other words, the wet areas will get wetter and the dry areas will get drier. As discussed in\n\nthe next section, there has been an increase in the amount of precipitation falling in heavy events49 and this is projected to continue.\nThe projected changes in the northern U.S. are a consequence of both a warmer atmosphere (which can hold more moisture than a colder one) and associated changes in large-scale\n\nUncertainties in regional projections\n\nOn the global scale, climate model simulations show consistent projections of future conditions under a range of emissions scenarios. For temperature, all models show warming by late this century that is much larger than historical variations nearly everywhere. For precipitation, models are in complete agreement in showing decreases in precipitation in the subtropics and increases in precipitation at higher latitudes.\n\nModels unequivocally project large and historically unprecedented future warming in every region of the U.S. under all of the scenarios used in this assessment. The amount of warming varies substantially between higher versus lower scenarios, and moderately from model to model, but the amount of projected warming is larger than the model-to-model range.\n\nThe contiguous U.S. straddles the transition zone between drier conditions in the sub-tropics (south) and wetter conditions at higher latitudes (north). Because the precise location of this zone varies somewhat among models, projected changes in precipitation in central areas of the U.S. range from small increases to small decreases. A clear direction of change only occurs in Alaska and the far north of the contiguous U.S. where increases are projected and in the far Southwest where decreases are projected.\n\nAlthough this means that changes in overall precipitation\n\nare uncertain in many U.S. areas, there is a high degree\n\nof certainty that the heaviest precipitation events will in-\n\ncrease everywhere, and by large amounts (Figure 2.13).\n\nThis consistent model projection is well understood and is\n\na direct outcome of the increase in atmospheric moisture caused by warming. There is also more certainty regarding dry spells. The annual maximum number of consecutive dry days is projected to increase in most areas, especially the southern and northwestern portions of the contiguous United States. Thus, both extreme wetness and extreme dryness are projected to increase in many areas.\nModeling methods that downscale (generate higher spatial resolution) climate projections from coarser global model output can reduce the range of projections to the\n\nFigure 2.13. Top panels show simulated changes in the average amount of precipitation falling on the wettest day of the year for the period 2070-2099 as compared to 1971-2000 under a scenario that assumes rapid reductions in emissions (RCP 2.6) and one that assumes continued emissions increases (RCP 8.5). Bottom panels show simulated changes in the annual maximum number of consecutive dry days (days receiving less than 0.04 inches (1 mm) of precipitation) under the same two scenarios. Simulations are from CMIP5 models. Stippling indicates areas where changes are consistent among at least 80% of the models used in this analysis. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nextent that they incorporate better representation of certain physical processes (such as the influence of topography and\n\nconvection). However, a sizeable portion of the range is a result of the variations in large-scale patterns produced by the\n\nglobal models and so downscaling methods do not change this.\n\n33\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nweather patterns (which affect where precipitation occurs). The projected reduction in Southwest precipitation is a result of changes in large-scale weather patterns, including the northward expansion of the belt of high pressure in the subtropics, which suppresses rainfall. Recent improvements in understanding these mechanisms of change increase confidence in these projections.50 The patterns of the projected changes of precipitation resulting from human alterations of the climate are geographically smoother in these maps than what will actually be observed because: 1) the precise locations of\n\nnatural increases and decreases differ from model to model, and averaging across models smooths these differences; and 2) the resolution of current climate models is too coarse to capture fine topographic details, especially in mountainous terrain. Hence, there is considerably more confidence in the large-scale patterns of change than in local details.\nIn general, a comparison of the various sources of climate model data used in this assessment provides a consistent picture of the large-scale projected precipitation changes\n\nProjected Precipitation Change by Season\n\nFigure 2.14. Projected change in seasonal precipitation for 2071-2099 (compared to 1970-1999) under an emissions scenario that assumes continued increases in emissions (A2). Hatched areas indicate that the projected changes are significant and consistent among models. White areas indicate that the changes are not projected to be larger than could be expected from natural variability. In general, the northern part of the U.S. is projected to see more winter and spring precipitation, while the southwestern U.S. is projected to experience less precipitation in the spring. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n34\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nacross the United States (see \"Models Used in the Assessment\"). Multi-model average changes in all three of these sources show a general pattern of wetter future conditions in the north and drier conditions in the south. The regional suite generally shows conditions that are somewhat wetter overall in the wet areas and not as dry in the dry areas. The general pattern agreement among these three sources, with the wide variations in their spatial resolution, provides confidence that this pattern is robust and not sensitive to the limited spatial resolution of the models. The slightly different conditions in the North American NARCCAP regional analyses for the U.S. appear to arise partially or wholly from the choice of the four CMIP3 global climate models used to drive the regional simulations. These four global models, averaged together, project average changes that are 2% wetter than the average of the suite of global models used in CMIP3.\n\nThe patterns of precipitation change in the newer CMIP5 simulations are essentially the same as in the earlier CMIP3 and NARCCAP simulations used in impact analyses throughout this report, increasing confidence in our scientific understanding. The subtle differences between these two sets of projections are mostly due to the wider range of future scenarios considered in the more recent simulations. Thus, the overall picture remains the same: wetter conditions in the north and drier conditions in the Southwest in winter and spring. Drier conditions are projected for summer in most areas of the contiguous U.S. but, outside of the Northwest and south-central region, there is generally not high confidence that the changes will be large compared to natural variability. In all models and scenarios, a transition zone between drier (to the south) and wetter (to the north) shifts northward from the southern U.S. in winter to southern Canada in summer. Wetter conditions are projected for Alaska and northern Canada in all seasons.\n\nNewer simulations for projected precipitation change (cmip5 models)\n\nFigure 2.15. Seasonal precipitation change for 2071-2099 (compared to 1970-1999) as projected by recent simulations that include a wider range of scenarios. The maps on the left (RCP 2.6) assume rapid reductions in emissions \u00ad more than 70% cuts from current levels by 2050 \u00ad and a corresponding much smaller amount of warming and far less precipitation change. On the right, RCP 8.5 assumes continued increases in emissions, with associated large increases in warming and major precipitation changes. These would include, for example, large reductions in spring precipitation in the Southwest and large increases in the Northeast and Midwest. Rapid emissions reductions would be required for the more modest changes in the maps on the left. Hatched areas indicate that the projected changes are significant and consistent among models. White areas indicate that the changes are not projected to be larger than could be expected from natural variability.

Largest increases are in the Midwest and Northeast. Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for all U.S. regions.\n\nAcross most of the United States, the heaviest rainfall events have become heavier and more frequent. The amount of rain falling on the heaviest rain days has also increased over the past few decades. Since 1991, the amount of rain falling in very heavy precipitation events has been significantly above average. This increase has been greatest in the Northeast, Midwest, and upper Great Plains \u00ad more than 30% above the 1901-1960 average (see Figure 2.18). There has also been an increase in flooding events in the Midwest and Northeast where the largest increases in heavy rain amounts have occurred.\n\nObserved U.S. Trend in Heavy Precipitation\nFigure 2.16: One measure of a heavy precipitation event is a 2-day precipitation total that is exceeded on average only once in a five-year period, also known as a once-in-fiveyear event. As this extreme precipitation index for 19012012 shows, the occurrence of such events has become much more common in recent decades. Changes are compared to the period 19011960, and do not include Alaska or Hawai`i. The 2000s decade (far right bar) includes 2001-2012. (Figure source: adapted from Kunkel et al. 201352).\n\nObserved Change in Very Heavy Precipitation\n\nFigure 2.17. Percent changes in the annual amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events, defined as the heaviest 1% of all daily events from 1901 to 2012 for each region. The far right bar is for 2001-2012. In recent decades there have been increases nationally, with the largest increases in the Northeast, Great Plains, Midwest, and Southeast. Changes are compared to the 1901-1960 average for all regions except Alaska and Hawai`i, which are relative to the 1951-1980 average. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n36\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fWarmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air. Global analyses show that the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere has in fact increased over both land and oceans.14,51 Climate change also alters dynamical characteristics of the atmosphere that in turn affect weather patterns and storms. In the mid-latitudes, where most of the continental U.S. is located, there is an upward trend in extreme precipitation in the vicinity of fronts associated with mid-latitude storms.52 Locally, natural variations can also be important.53\nProjections of future climate over the U.S. suggest that the recent trend towards increased heavy precipitation events will continue. This is projected to occur even in regions where total precipitation is projected to decrease, such as the Southwest.52,54,55\n\n2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\nObserved Change in Very Heavy Precipitation\n\nFigure 2.18. The map shows percent increases in the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events (defined as the heaviest 1% of all daily events) from 1958 to 2012 for each region of the continental United States. These trends are larger than natural variations for the Northeast, Midwest, Puerto Rico, Southeast, Great Plains, and Alaska. The trends are not larger than natural variations for the Southwest, Hawai`i, and the Northwest. The changes shown in this figure are calculated from the beginning and end points of the trends for 1958 to 2012. (Figure source: updated from Karl et al. 20091).\nProjected Change in Heavy Precipitation Events\n\nFigure 2.19. Maps show the increase in frequency of extreme daily precipitation events (a daily amount that now occurs once in 20 years) by the later part of this century (2081-2100) compared to the later part of last century (1981-2000). Such extreme events are projected to occur more frequently everywhere in the United States. Under the rapid emissions reduction scenario (RCP 2.6), these events would occur nearly twice as often. For the scenario assuming continued increases in emissions (RCP 8.5), these events would occur up to five times as often. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n37\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nKey Message 7: Extreme Weather\n\nThere have been changes in some types of extreme weather events over the last several decades. Heat waves have become more frequent and intense, especially in the West. Cold waves have become less frequent and intense across the nation. There have been regional\ntrends in floods and droughts. Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves everywhere are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense everywhere.\n\n\u00a9Bill Ross/Corbis\n\n\u00a9Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nHeat waves are periods of abnormally hot weather lasting days to weeks.48 Heat waves have generally become more frequent across the U.S. in recent decades, with western regions (including Alaska) setting records for numbers of these events in the 2000s. Tree ring data suggests that the drought over the last decade in the western U.S. represents the driest conditions in 800 years.1,56 Most other regions in the country had their highest number of short-duration heat waves in the 1930s, when the multi-year severe drought of the Dust Bowl period, combined with deleterious land-use practices,57 contributed to the intense summer heat through depletion of soil moisture and reduction of the moderating effects of evaporation.58 However, the recent prolonged (multi-month) extreme heat has been unprecedented since the start of reliable instrumental records in 1895. The recent heat waves and droughts in Texas (2011) and the Midwest (2012) set records for highest monthly average temperatures, exceeding in some cases records set in the 1930s, including the highest monthly contiguous U.S. temperature on record (July 2012, breaking the July 1936 record) and the hottest summers on record in several states (New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana in 2011 and Colorado and Wyoming in 2012). For the spring and summer months, 2012 had the second largest area of record-setting monthly average temperatures, including a 26-state area from Wyoming to the East Coast. The summer (June-August) temperatures of 2012 ranked in the hottest 10% of the 118-year period of record in 28 states covering the Rocky Mountain states, the Great Plains, the Upper Midwest, and the Northeast. The new records included both hot daytime maximum temperatures and warm nighttime minimum temperatures.59 Corresponding with this increase in extreme heat, the number of extreme cold waves has reached the lowest levels on record (since 1895).\nMany more high temperature records are being broken as compared to low temperature records over the past three to four decades \u00ad another indicator of a warming climate.60 The number of record low monthly temperatures has declined to the lowest levels since 1911, while the number of record high monthly temperatures has increased to the highest level since the 1930s. During this same period, there has been an increasing trend in persistently high nighttime temperature.1 There are various reasons why low temperatures have increased more than high temperatures.61\nIn some areas, prolonged periods of record high temperatures associated with droughts contribute to dry conditions that are driving wildfires.62 The meteorological situations that cause\n\nheat waves are a natural part of the climate system. Thus\nthe timing and location of individual events may be largely a\nnatural phenomenon, although even these may be affected by human-induced climate change.63 However, there is emerging\nevidence that most of the increases of heat wave severity over the U.S. are likely due to human activity,64 with a detectable\nhuman influence in recent heat waves in the southern Great Plains1,65 as well as in Europe7,62 and Russia.60,66,67 The summer\n2011 heat wave and drought in Texas was primarily driven by\nprecipitation deficits, but the human contribution to climate\nchange approximately doubled the probability that the heat was record-breaking.68 So while an event such as this Texas\nheat wave and drought could be triggered by a naturally oc-\ncurring event such as a deficit in precipitation, the chances for\nrecord-breaking temperature extremes has increased and will\n\n38\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\ncontinue to increase as the global climate warms. Generally, the changes in climate are increasing the likelihood for these types of severe events.\nThe number of extremely hot days is projected to continue to increase over much of the United States, especially by late century. Summer temperatures are projected to continue rising, and a reduction of soil moisture, which exacerbates heat waves, is projected for much of the western and central U.S. in summer. Climate models project that the same summertime\n\ntemperatures that ranked among the hottest 5% in 1950-1979\nwill occur at least 70% of the time by 2035-2064 in the U.S. if\nglobal emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to grow (as in the A2 scenario).67 By the end of this century, what have previ-\nously been once-in-20-year extreme heat days (1-day events)\nare projected to occur every two or three years over most of the nation.69,70 In other words, what now seems like an ex-\ntremely hot day will become commonplace.\n\nProjected Temperature Change of Hottest and Coldest Days\n\nFigure 2.20. Change in surface air temperature at the end of this century (2081-2100) relative to the turn of the last century (1986-2005) on the coldest and hottest days under a scenario that assumes a rapid reduction in heat trapping gases (RCP 2.6) and a scenario that assumes continued increases in these gases (RCP 8.5). This figure shows estimated changes in the average temperature of the hottest and coldest days in each 20-year period. In other words, the hottest days will get even hotter, and the coldest days will be less cold. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n39\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nThere are significant trends in the magnitude of river\n\nTrends in Flood Magnitude\n\nflooding in many parts of the\n\nUnited States. When aver-\n\naged over the entire nation,\n\nhowever, the increases and\n\ndecreases cancel each other\n\nout and show no national level trend.71 River flood\n\nmagnitudes have decreased\n\nin the Southwest and in-\n\ncreased in the eastern Great\n\nPlains, parts of the Midwest,\n\nand from the northern Appalachians into New England.48\n\nFigure 2.21 shows increasing\n\ntrends in floods in green and\n\ndecreasing trends in brown.\n\nThe magnitude of these\n\ntrends is illustrated by the\n\nsize of the triangles.\nThese regional river flood trends are qualitatively consistent with trends in climate\n\nFigure 2.21.

Local areas can be affected by land-use change (such as dams). Most significant are the increasing trend for floods in the Midwest and Northeast and the decreasing trend in the Southwest. (Figure source: Peterson et al. 201348).\n\nconditions associated with\n\nflooding. For example, aver-\n\nage annual precipitation has increased in the Midwest and Research into the effects of human-induced climate change on Northeast and decreased in the Southwest (Figure 2.12).48 Re- flood events is relatively new. There is evidence of a detect-\n\ncent soil moisture trends show general drying in the Southwest and moistening in the Northeast and northern Great Plains and Midwest (Ch 3: Water, Figure 3.2). These trends are in general\n\nable human influence in recent flooding events in England and Wales13 and in other specific events around the globe during 2011.48 In general, heavier rains lead to a larger fraction of\n\nagreement with the flood trends. Although there is a strong rainfall running off and, depending on the surface conditions,\n\nnational upward trend in extreme precipitation and not in river more potential for flooding.\n\nflooding, the regional variations are similar. Extreme precipita-\n\ntion has been increasing strongly in the Great Plains, Midwest, Higher temperatures lead to increased rates of evaporation,\n\nand Northeast, where river flooding increases have been ob- including more loss of moisture through plant leaves. Even in\n\nserved, and there is little trend in the Southwest, where river areas where precipitation does not decrease, these increases\n\nflooding has decreased. An exact correspondence is not nec- in surface evaporation and loss of water from plants lead to\n\nessarily expected since the seasonal timing of precipitation more rapid drying of soils if the effects of higher temperatures\n\nevents makes a difference in whether river flooding occurs.\nThe increase in extreme precipitation events has been concentrated in the summer and fall52 when soil moisture is season-\n\nare not offset by other changes (such as in wind speed or humidity).72 As soil dries out, a larger proportion of the incom-\ning heat from the sun goes into heating the soil and adjacent\n\nally low and soils can absorb a greater fraction of rainfall. By air rather than evaporating its moisture, resulting in hotter contrast, many of the annual flood events occur in the spring summers under drier climatic conditions.73 Under higher emis-\n\nwhen soil moisture is high. Thus, additional extreme rainfall sions scenarios, widespread drought is projected to become\n\nevents in summer and fall may not create sufficient runoff for more common over most of the central and southern United the resulting streamflow to exceed spring flood magnitudes. States.56,74,75,76,77\n\nHowever, these extreme precipitation events are often associ-\n\nated with local flash floods, a leading cause of death due to\n\nweather events (see \"Flood Factors and Flood Types\" in Ch. 3:\n\nWater).\n\n40\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\nProjected Changes in Soil Moisture for the Western U.S.\nFigure 2.22. Average change in soil moisture compared to 19712000, as projected for the middle of this century (2041-2070) and late this century (2071-2100) under two emissions scenarios, a lower scenario (B1) and a higher scenario (A2).75,77 The future drying of soils in most areas simulated by this sophisticated hydrologic model (Variable Infiltration Capacity or VIC model) is consistent with the future drought increases using the simpler Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) metric. Only the western U.S. is displayed because model simulations were only run for this area. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nKey Message 8: Changes in Hurricanes\n\nThe intensity, frequency, and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased\nsince the early 1980s. The relative contributions of human and natural causes to these increases are still uncertain. Hurricane-associated storm intensity and\nrainfall rates are projected to increase as the climate continues to warm.\n\nThere has been a substantial increase in most measures of Atlantic hurricane activity since the early 1980s, the period during which high-quality satellite data are available.78,79 These include measures of intensity, frequency, and duration as well as the number of strongest (Category 4 and 5) storms. The ability to assess longer-term trends in hurricane activity is limited by the quality of available data. The historic record of Atlantic hurricanes dates back to the mid-1800s, and indicates other decades of high activity. However, there is considerable uncertainty in the record prior to the satellite era (early 1970s), and the further back in time one goes, the more uncertain the record becomes.79\nThe recent increases in activity are linked, in part, to higher sea surface temperatures in the region that Atlantic hurricanes form in and move through. Numerous factors have been shown to influence these local sea surface temperatures, including natural variability, human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases, and particulate pollution. Quantifying the relative con-\n\ntributions of natural and human-caused factors is an active focus of research. Some studies suggest that natural variability, which includes the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, is the dominant cause of the warming trend in the Atlantic since the 1970s,80,81 while others argue that human-caused heat-trapping gases and particulate pollution are more important.82\nHurricane development, however, is influenced by more than just sea surface temperature. How hurricanes develop also depends on how the local atmosphere responds to changes in local sea surface temperatures, and this atmospheric response depends critically on the cause of the change.83 For example, the atmosphere responds differently when local sea surface temperatures increase due to a local decrease of particulate pollution that allows more sunlight through to warm the ocean, versus when sea surface temperatures increase more uniformly around the world due to increased amounts of human-caused heat-trapping gases.80,84 So the link between hurricanes and ocean temperatures is complex. Improving our\n\n41\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\nObserved Trends in Hurricane Power Dissipation\n\nFigure 2.23. Recent variations of the Power Dissipation Index (PDI) in the North Atlantic and eastern North Pacific Oceans. PDI is an aggregate of storm intensity, frequency, and duration and provides a measure of total hurricane power over a hurricane season. There is a strong upward trend in Atlantic PDI, and a downward trend in the eastern North Pacific, both of which are well-supported by the reanalysis. Separate analyses (not shown) indicate a significant increase in the strength and in the number of the strongest hurricanes (Category 4 and 5) in the North Atlantic over this same time period. The PDI is calculated from historical data (IBTrACS92) and from reanalyses using satellite data (UW/NCDC & ADT-HURSAT93,94). IBTrACS is the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship, UW/NCDC is the University of Wisconsin/NOAA National Climatic Data Center satellite-derived hurricane intensity dataset, and ADT-HURSAT is the Advanced Dvorak Technique\u00adHurricane Satellite dataset (Figure source: adapted from Kossin et al. 200793).\n\nunderstanding of the relationships between warming tropical oceans and tropical cyclones is another active area of research.\nChanges in the average length and positions of Atlantic storm tracks are also associated with regional climate variability.85 The locations and frequency of storms striking land have been argued to vary in opposing ways than basin-wide frequency. For example, fewer storms have been observed to strike land during warmer years even though overall activity is higher than\n\naverage,86 which may help to explain the lack of any clear trend in landfall frequency along the U.S. eastern and Gulf coasts.87,88 Climate models also project changes in hurricane tracks and where they strike land.89 The specific characteristics of the changes are being actively studied.\nOther measures of Atlantic storm activity are projected to change as well.87,90,91 By late this century, models, on average, project a slight decrease in the annual number of tropi-\ncal cyclones, but an increase in the number of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes. These projected changes are based on an average of projections from a number of individual models, and they represent the most likely outcome. There is some uncertainty in this as the individual models do not always agree on the amount of projected change, and some models may project an increase where others project a decrease. The models are in better agreement when projecting changes in hurricane precipitation \u00ad almost all existing studies project greater rainfall rates in hurricanes in a warmer climate, with projected increases of about 20% averaged near the center of hurricanes.\n\nNOAA Environmental Visualization Lab\n\nNorth Atlantic hurricanes have increased in intensity, frequency, and duration since the early 1980s.\n42\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nKey Message 9: Changes in Storms\n\nWinter storms have increased in frequency and intensity since the 1950s, and their tracks have shifted northward over the United States. Other trends in severe\nstorms, including the intensity and frequency of tornadoes, hail, and damaging thunderstorm winds, are uncertain and are being studied intensively.\n\nTrends in the occurrences of storms, ranging from severe thunderstorms to winter storms to hurricanes, are subject to much greater uncertainties than trends in temperature and variables that are directly related to temperature (such as snow and ice cover, ocean heat content, and sea level). Recognizing that the impacts of changes in the frequency and intensity of these storms can easily exceed the impacts of changes in average\n\ntemperature or precipitation, climate scientists are actively re-\nsearching the connections between climate change and severe\nstorms. There has been a sizeable upward trend in the number of storms causing large financial and other losses.95 However,\nthere are societal contributions to this trend, such as increases in population and wealth.52\n\nSevere Convective Storms\nTornadoes and other severe thunderstorm phenomena fre- thunderstorms (such as atmospheric instability and increases quently cause as much annual property damage in the U.S. as in wind speed with altitude96).

Variation of winter storm frequency and intensity during the cold season (NovemberMarch) for high latitudes (60-90\u00b0N) and mid-latitudes (30-60\u00b0N) of the Northern Hemisphere over the period 1949-2010. The bar for each decade represents the difference from the long-term average. Storm frequencies have increased in middle and high latitudes, and storm intensities have increased in middle latitudes. (Figure source: updated from CCSP 2008109).\n\nKey Message 10: Sea Level Rise\n\nGlobal sea level has risen by about 8 inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880. It is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100.\n\nThe oceans are absorbing over 90% of the increased atmospheric heat associated with emissions from human activity.110\nLike mercury in a thermometer, water expands as it warms up\n(this is referred to as \"thermal expansion\") causing sea levels\nto rise. Melting of glaciers and ice sheets is also contributing to sea level rise at increasing rates.111\n\nSince the late 1800s, tide gauges throughout the world have\nshown that global sea level has risen by about 8 inches. A\nnew data set (Figure 2.25) shows that this recent rise is much greater than at any time in at least the past 2000 years.112 Since\n1992, the rate of global sea level rise measured by satellites has\nbeen roughly twice the rate observed over the last century, providing evidence of additional acceleration.113\n\n44\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nProjecting future rates of sea level rise is challenging. Even the most sophisticated climate models,\n\nNorth Atlantic Sea Level Change\n\nwhich explicitly represent Earth's physical pro-\n\ncesses, cannot simulate rapid changes in ice sheet\n\ndynamics, and thus are likely to underestimate\n\nfuture sea level rise. In recent years, \"semi-em-\n\npirical\" methods have been developed to project\n\nfuture rates of sea level rise based on a simple sta-\n\ntistical relationship between past rates of globally\n\naveraged temperature change and sea level rise.\n\nThese models suggest a range of additional sea\n\nlevel rise from about 2 feet to as much as 6 feet by 2100, depending on emissions scenario.114,115,116,117\n\nIt is not clear, however, whether these statistical relationships will hold in the future, or that they fully explain historical behavior.118 Regardless of the amount of change by 2100, however, sea level rise is expected to continue well beyond this century as a result of both past and future emissions\n\nFigure 2.25.

Estimated, observed, and possible future amounts of global sea level rise from 1800 to 2100, relative to the year 2000. Estimates from proxy data112 (for example, based on sediment records) are shown in red (1800-1890, pink band shows uncertainty), tide gauge data are shown in blue for 1880-2009,113 and satellite observations are shown in green from 1993 to 2012. 128 The future scenarios range from 0.66 feet to 6.6 feet in 2100.123 These scenarios are not based on climate model simulations, but rather reflect the range of possible scenarios based on other scientific studies. The orange line at right shows the currently projected range of sea level rise of 1 to 4 feet by 2100, which falls within the larger risk-based scenario range. The large projected range reflects uncertainty about how glaciers and ice sheets will react to the warming ocean, the warming atmosphere, and changing winds and currents. As seen in the observations, there are year-to-year variations in the trend.

This loss of ice is expected to continue. The Arctic Ocean is\nexpected to become essentially ice free in summer before mid-century.\n\nRising temperatures across the U.S. have reduced lake ice, sea ice, glaciers, and seasonal snow cover over the last few decades.111 In the Great Lakes, for example, total winter ice coverage has decreased by 63% since the early 1970s.172 This includes the entire period since satellite data became available. When the record is extended back to 1963 using presatellite data,129 the overall trend is less negative because the Great Lakes region experienced several extremely cold winters in the 1970s.\nSea ice in the Arctic has also decreased dramatically since the late 1970s, particularly in summer and autumn. Since the satellite record began in 1978, minimum Arctic sea ice extent (which occurs in early to mid-September) has decreased by more than 40%.131 This decline is unprecedented in the historical record, and the reduction of ice volume and thickness is even greater. Ice thickness decreased by more than 50% from 1958-1976 to 2003-2008,132 and the percentage of the March ice cover made up of thicker ice (ice that has survived a summer melt season) decreased from 75% in the mid-1980s to 45% in 2011.133 Recent analyses indicate a decrease of 36% in autumn sea ice volume over the past decade.134 The 2012 sea ice minimum broke the preceding record (set in 2007) by more than 200,000 square miles. Ice loss increases Arctic warming by replacing white, reflective ice with dark water that absorbs more energy from the sun. More open water can also increase snowfall over northern land areas135 and increase the north-south meanders of the jet stream, consistent with the occurrence of unusually cold and snowy winters at mid-latitudes in several recent years.106,135 Significant uncertainties remain at this time in interpreting the effect of Arctic ice changes on mid-latitudes.107\n\nthan in winter. However, the models tend to underestimate the amount of decrease since 2007. Projections by these models indicate that the Arctic Ocean is expected to become essentially ice-free in summer before mid-century under scenarios that assume continued growth in global emissions, although sea ice would still form in winter.136,137 Models that best match historical trends project a nearly sea ice-free Arctic in summer by the 2030s,138 and extrapolation of the present observed trend suggests an even earlier ice-free Arctic in summer.139 However, even during a long-term decrease, occasional temporary increases in Arctic summer sea ice can be expected over timescales of a decade or so because of natural variability.140 The projected reduction of winter sea ice is only about 10% by 2030,141 indicating that the Arctic will shift to a more seasonal sea ice pattern. While this ice will be thinner, it will cover much of the same area now covered by sea ice in winter.\nWhile the Arctic is an ocean surrounded by continents, Antarctica is a continent surrounded by ocean. Nearly all of the sea ice in the Antarctic melts each summer, and changes there are more complicated than in the Arctic. While Arctic sea ice has\nIce Cover in the Great Lakes\n\nThe loss of sea ice has been greater in summer than in winter. The Bering Sea, for example, has sea ice only in the winter-spring portion of the year, and shows no trend in surface area covered by ice over the past 30 years. However, seasonal ice in the Bering Sea and elsewhere in the Arctic is thin and susceptible to rapid melt during the following summer.\nThe seasonal pattern of observed loss of Arctic sea ice is generally consistent with simulations by global climate models, in which the extent of sea ice decreases more rapidly in summer\n\nFigure 2.27. Bars show decade averages of annual maximum Great Lakes ice coverage from the winter of 1962-1963, when reliable coverage of the entire Great Lakes began, to the winter of 2012-2013. Bar labels indicate the end year of the winter; for example, 1963-1972 indicates the winter of 1962-1963 through the winter of 1971-1972. Only the most recent period includes the eleven years from 2003 to 2013. (Data updated from Bai and Wang, 2012130).\n\n46\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\nDecline in Arctic Sea Ice Extent\n\nFigure 2.28. Summer Arctic sea ice has declined dramatically since satellites began measuring it in 1979. The extent of sea ice in September 2012, shown in white in the top figure, was more than 40% below the median for 1979-2000. The graph on the bottom left shows annual variations in September Arctic sea ice extent for 1979-2013. It is also notable that the ice has become much thinner in recent years, so its total volume (bottom right) has declined even more rapidly than the extent.111 (Figure and data from National Snow and Ice Data Center).\n\nbeen strongly decreasing, there has been a slight increase in sea ice in Antarctica.142 Explanations for this include changes in winds that directly affect ice drift as well as the properties of the surrounding ocean,143 and that winds around Antarctica may have been affected by stratospheric ozone depletion.144\nSnow cover on land has decreased over the past several decades,145 especially in late spring.146 Each of five recent years (2008-2012) has set a new record for minimum snow extent in June in Eurasia, as did three of those five years in North America.\n\nThe surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet has been experiencing summer melting over increasingly large areas during the past several decades. In the decade of the 2000s, the daily melt area summed over the warm season was double the corresponding amounts of the 1970s,147 culminating in summer surface melt that was far greater (97% of the Greenland Ice Sheet area) in 2012 than in any year since the satellite record began in 1979. More importantly, the rate of mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet's marine-terminating outlet glaciers has accelerated in recent decades, leading to predictions that the proportion of global sea level rise coming from Greenland will continue to increase.148 Glaciers terminating on ice shelves and on land are also losing mass, but the rate of loss has not accelerated\n\n47\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nover the past decade.149 As discussed in Key Message 10, the dynamics of the Greenland Ice Sheet are generally not included in present global climate models and sea level rise projections.\n\nProjected Arctic Sea Ice Decline\n\nGlaciers are retreating and/or thinning in\n\nAlaska and in the lower 48 states. In addi-\n\ntion, permafrost temperatures are increas-\n\ning over Alaska and much of the Arctic.\n\nRegions of discontinuous permafrost in\n\ninterior Alaska (where annual average soil\n\ntemperatures are already close to 32\u00b0F) are\n\nhighly vulnerable to thaw. Thawing perma-\n\nfrost releases carbon dioxide and methane\n\n\u00ad heat-trapping gases that contribute to\n\neven more warming. Recent estimates sug-\n\ngest that the potential release of carbon\n\nfrom permafrost soils could add as much as 0.4\u00baF to 0.6\u00baF of warming by 2100.150\nMethane emissions have been detected\nfrom Alaskan lakes underlain by permafrost,151 and measurements suggest poten-\ntially even greater releases from thawing\nmethane hydrates in the Arctic continental shelf of the East Siberian Sea.152 However,\nthe response times of Arctic methane hy-\ndrates to climate change are quite long\nrelative to methane's lifetime in the atmosphere (about a decade).153 More generally,\nthe importance of Arctic methane sources\n\nFigure 2.29. Model simulations of Arctic sea ice extent for September (1900-2100) based on observed concentrations of heat-trapping gases and particles (through 2005) and four scenarios. Colored lines for RCP scenarios are model averages (CMIP5) and lighter shades of the line colors denote ranges among models for each scenario. Dotted gray line and gray shading denotes average and range of the historical simulations through 2005. The thick black line shows observed data for 1953-2012. These newer model (CMIP5) simulations project more rapid sea ice loss compared to the previous generation of models (CMIP3) under similar forcing scenarios, although the simulated September ice losses under all scenarios still lag the observed loss of the past decade. Extrapolation of the present observed trend suggests an essentially ice-free Arctic in summer before mid-century.139 The Arctic is considered essentially ice-free when the areal extent of ice is less than one million square kilometers.

Many of these animals form the foundation of the marine food\n\n48\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nweb. Today, more than a billion people worldwide rely on food from the ocean as their primary source of protein. Ocean acidification puts this important resource at risk.\n\nAs Oceans Absorb CO2, They Become More Acidic\n\nObservations have shown that the northeastern Pacific Ocean, including the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas, is particularly susceptible to significant shifts in pH and calcium carbonate saturation levels. Recent analyses show that large areas of the oceans along the U.S. west coast,157,165 the Bering Sea, and the western Arctic Ocean158,166 will become difficult for calcifying animals within the next 50 years. In particular, animals that form calcium carbonate shells, including corals, crabs, clams, oysters, and tiny free-swimming snails called pteropods, could be particularly vulnerable, especially during the larval stage.167,168,169\n\nProjections indicate that in higher emis-\nsions pathways, such as SRES A2 or RCP\n8.5, current pH could be reduced from the\ncurrent level of 8.1 to as low as 7.8 by the end of the century.158 Such large changes\n\nFigure 2.30.

Pteropods, or \"sea butterflies,\" are free-swimming sea snails about the size of a small pea. Pteropods are eaten by marine species ranging in size from tiny krill to whales and are an important source of food for North Pacific juvenile salmon. The photos above show what happens to a pteropod's shell in seawater that is too acidic. The left panel shows a shell collected from a live pteropod from a region in the Southern Ocean where acidity is not too high. The shell on the right is from a pteropod collected in a region where the water is more acidic (Photo credits: (left) Bednarsek et al. 2012;168 (right) Nina Bednarsek).\n\n49\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The authors reviewed 80 technical inputs provided by the public, as well as other published literature, and applied their professional judgment.\nKey message development also involved the findings from four special workshops that related to the latest scientific understanding of climate extremes. Each workshop had a different theme related to climate extremes, had approximately 30 attendees (the CMIP5 meeting had more than 100), and the workshops resulted in a paper.55 The first workshop was held in July 2011, titled Monitoring Changes in Extreme Storm Statistics: State of Knowledge.52 The second was held in November 2011, titled Forum on Trends and Causes of Observed Changes in Heatwaves, Coldwaves, Floods, and Drought.48 The third was held in January 2012, titled Forum on Trends in Extreme Winds, Waves, and Extratropical Storms along the Coasts.98 The fourth, the CMIP5 results workshop, was held in March 2012 in Hawai`i, and resulted in an analysis of CMIP5 results relative to climate extremes in the United States.55\nThe Chapter Author Team's discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts. Professional expertise and judgment led to determining \"key vulnerabilities.\" A consensusbased approach was used for final key message selection.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nGlobal climate is changing and this change is apparent across a wide range of observations. The global warming of the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the climate science literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics were also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nEvidence for changes in global climate arises from multiple analyses of data from in-situ, satellite, and other records undertaken by many groups over several decades.3 Changes in the mean state have been accompanied by changes in the frequency and nature of extreme events.4 A substantial body of analysis comparing the observed changes to a broad range of climate simulations consistently points to the necessity of invoking human-caused changes to adequately explain the observed climate system behavior.5,7 The influence of human impacts on the climate system has also been observed in a number of individual climate variables.6,12,13,14,15,16,17 A discussion of the slowdown in temperature increase with associated references (for example, Balmaseda et al. 2013; Easterling and Wehner 200919,27) is included in the chapter.\nThe Climate Science Supplement Appendix provides further discussion of types of emissions or heat-trapping gases and particles, and future projections of human-related emissions. Supplemental Message 4 of the Appendix provides further details on attribution of observed climate changes to human influence.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Key remaining uncertainties relate to the precise magnitude and nature of changes at global, and particularly regional, scales, and especially for extreme events and our ability to simulate and attribute such changes using climate models. Innovative new approaches to climate data analysis, continued improvements in climate modeling, and instigation and maintenance of reference quality observation networks such as the U.S. Climate Reference Network (http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/crn/) all have the potential to reduce uncertainties.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is very high confidence that global climate is changing and this change is apparent across a wide range of observations, given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties. All observational evidence is consistent with a warming climate since the late 1800s.\nThere is very high confidence that the global climate change of the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities, given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties. Recent changes have\n\n60\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE Traceable Accounts\n\nbeen consistently attributed in large part to human factors across a very broad range of climate system characteristics.\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nGlobal climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond. The magnitude of climate change beyond the next few decades depends primarily on the amount of heat-trapping gases emitted globally, and how sensitive the Earth's climate is to those emissions.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the climate science peer-reviewed literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics were also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nEvidence of continued global warming is based on past observations of climate change and our knowledge of the climate system's response to heat-trapping gases. Models have projected increased temperature under a number of different scenarios.8,32,33\nThat the planet has warmed is \"unequivocal,\"8 and is corroborated though multiple lines of evidence, as is the conclusion that the causes are very likely human in origin (see also Appendices 3 and 4). The evidence for future warming is based on fundamental understanding of the behavior of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. Model simulations provide bounds on the estimates of this warming.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The trends described in the 2009 report1 have continued, and our understanding of the data and ability to model the many facets of the climate system have increased substantially.\nThere are several major sources of uncertainty in making projections of climate change. The relative importance of these changes over time.\nIn the next few decades, the effects of natural variability will be an important source of uncertainty for climate change projections.\nUncertainty in future human emissions becomes the largest source of uncertainty by the end of this century.\nUncertainty in how sensitive the climate is to increased concentrations of heat-trapping gases is especially important beyond the next few decades. Recent evidence lends further confidence about climate sensitivity (see Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement).\n\nConfidence Level\nVery High Strong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus\nHigh Moderate evidence (several sourc-\nes, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited,\netc.), medium consensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow Inconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\nUncertainty in natural climate drivers, for example how much solar output will change over this century, also affects the accuracy of projections.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that the global climate is projected to continue to change over this century and beyond.\nThe statement on the magnitude of the effect also has very high confidence.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nU.S. average temperature has increased by 1.3\u00b0F to 1.9\u00b0F since record keeping began in 1895; most of this increase has occurred since about 1970. The most recent decade was the nation's warmest on record. Temperatures in the United States are expected to continue to rise. Because humaninduced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the climate science peer-reviewed literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics\n\n61\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE Traceable Accounts\n\nwere also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nEvidence for the long-term increase in temperature is based on analysis of daily maximum and minimum temperature observations from the U.S. Cooperative Observer Network (http://www.nws. noaa.gov/om/coop/). With the increasing understanding of U.S. temperature measurements, a temperature increase has been observed, and temperature is projected to continue rising.36,37,38 Observations show that the last decade was the warmest in over a century. A number of climate model simulations were performed to assess past, and to forecast future, changes in climate; temperatures are generally projected to increase across the United States.\nThe section entitled \"Quantifying U.S. Temperature Rise\" explains the rational for using the range 1.3\u00b0F to 1.9\u00b0F in the key message.\nAll peer-reviewed studies to date satisfying the assessment process agree that the U.S. has warmed over the past century and in the past several decades. Climate model simulations consistently project future warming and bracket the range of plausible increases.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Since the 2009 National Climate Assessment,1 there have been substantial advances in our understanding of the U.S. temperature record (Appendix 3: Climate Science, Supplemental Message 7).36,37,38\nA potential uncertainty is the sensitivity of temperature trends to adjustments that account for historical changes in station location, temperature instrumentation, observing practice, and siting conditions. However, quality analyses of these uncertainties have not found any major issues of concern affecting the conclusions made in the key message (Appendix 3: Climate Science, Supplemental Message 7). (for example, Williams et al. 201238).\nWhile numerous studies (for example, Fall et al. 2011; Vose et al. 2012; Williams et al. 201237,38) verify the efficacy of the adjustments, the information base can be improved in the future through continued refinements to the adjustment approach. Model biases are subject to changes in physical effects on climate; for example, model biases can be affected by snow cover and hence are subject to change as a warming climate changes snow cover.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high in the key message. Because human-induced warming is superimposed on a naturally varying climate, the temperature rise has not been, and will not be, uniform or smooth across the country or over time.\n\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nThe length of the frost-free season (and the corresponding growing season) has been increasing nationally since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western United States, affecting ecosystems and agriculture. Across the United States, the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the climate science peer-reviewed literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics were also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nNearly all studies to date published in the peer-reviewed literature (for example, Dragoni et al. 2011; EPA 2012; Jeong et al. 201140,41,43) agree that the frost-free and growing seasons have lengthened. This is most apparent in the western United States. Peer-reviewed studies also indicate that continued lengthening will occur if concentrations of heat-trapping gases continue to rise. The magnitude of future changes based on model simulations is large in the context of historical variations.\nEvidence that the length of the frost-free season is lengthening is based on extensive analysis of daily minimum temperature observations from the U.S. Cooperative Observer Network. The geographic variations in increasing number of frost-free days are similar to the regional variations in mean temperature. Separate analysis of surface data also indicates a trend towards an earlier onset of spring.40,41,43,45\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key issue (uncertainty) is the potential effect on observed trends of climate monitoring station inhomogeneities (differences), particularly those arising from instrumentation changes. A second key issue is the extent to which observed regional variations (more lengthening in the west/less in the east) will persist into the future.\nLocal temperature biases in climate models contribute to the uncertainty in projections.\nViable avenues to improving the information base are to investigate the sensitivity of observed trends to potential biases introduced by station inhomogeneities and to investigate the causes of observed regional variations.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that the length of the frost-free season (also referred to as the growing season) has been increasing nationally since the 1980s, with the largest increases occurring in the western U.S, affecting ecosystems, gardening, and agriculture. Given the\n\n62\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE Traceable Accounts\n\nevidence base, confidence is very high that across the U.S., the growing season is projected to continue to lengthen.\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nAverage U.S. precipitation has increased since 1900, but some areas have had increases greater than the national average, and some areas have had decreases. More winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern United States, and less for the Southwest, over this century.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the climate science peer-reviewed literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics were also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nEvidence of long-term change in precipitation is based on analysis (for example, Kunkel et al. 2013170) of daily observations from the U.S. Cooperative Observer Network. Published work shows the regional differences in precipitation.47,48 Evidence of future change is based on our knowledge of the climate system's response to heattrapping gases and an understanding of the regional mechanisms behind the projected changes (for example, IPCC 20078).\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key issue (uncertainty) is the sensitivity of observed precipitation trends to historical changes in station location, rain gauges, and observing practice. A second key issue is the ability of climate models to simulate precipitation. This is one of the more challenging aspects of modeling of the climate system, because precipitation involves not only large-scale processes that are well-resolved by models but small-scale process, such as convection, that must be parameterized in the current generation of global and regional climate models. However, our understanding of the physical basis for these changes has solidified and the newest set of climate model simulations (CMIP5) continues to show high-latitude increases and subtropical decreases in precipitation. For most of the contiguous U.S., studies171 indicate that the models currently do not detect a robust anthropogenic influence to observed changes, suggesting that observed changes are principally of natural origins. Thus, confident projections of precipitation changes are limited to the northern and southern areas of the contiguous U.S. that are part of the global pattern of observed and robust projected changes that can be related to anthropogenic forcing. Furthermore, for the first time in the U.S. National Climate Assessment, a confidence statement is made that some projected precipitation changes are deemed small. It is incorrect to attempt to validate or invalidate climate model simulations of observed trends in these regions and/or seasons, as such simulations are not designed to forecast the precise timing of natural variations.\n\nShifts in precipitation patterns due to changes in other sources of air pollution, such as sulfate aerosols, are uncertain and are an active research topic.\nViable avenues to improving the information base are to investigate the sensitivity of observed trends to potential biases introduced by station changes, and to investigate the causes of observed regional variations.\nA number of peer-reviewed studies (for example, McRoberts and Nielsen-Gammon 2011; Peterson et al. 201347,48) document precipitation increases at the national scale as well as regionalscale increases and decreases. The variation in magnitude and pattern of future changes from climate model simulations is large relative to observed (and modeled) historical variations.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is high that average U.S. precipitation has increased since 1900, with some areas having had increases greater than the national average, and some areas having had decreases.\nConfidence is high, given the evidence base and uncertainties, that more winter and spring precipitation is projected for the northern U.S., and less for the Southwest, over this century in the higher emissions scenarios. Confidence is medium that humaninduced precipitation changes will be small compared to natural variations in all seasons over large portions of the U.S. in the lower emissions scenarios. Confidence is medium that human-induced precipitation changes will be small compared to natural variations in the summer and fall over large portions of the U.S. in the higher emissions scenarios.\nKey message #6 Traceable Account\nHeavy downpours are increasing nationally, especially over the last three to five decades. Largest increases are in the Midwest and Northeast. Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for all U.S. regions.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the climate science peer-reviewed literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics were also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nEvidence that extreme precipitation is increasing is based primarily on analysis52,55,170 of hourly and daily precipitation observations from the U.S. Cooperative Observer Network, and is supported by observed increases in atmospheric water vapor.75 Recent publications have projected an increase in extreme precipitation\n\n63\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE Traceable Accounts\n\nevents,52,137 with some areas getting larger increases1 and some getting decreases.54,55\nNearly all studies to date published in the peer-reviewed literature agree that extreme precipitation event number and intensity have risen, when averaged over the United States. The pattern of change for the wettest day of the year is projected to roughly follow that of the average precipitation, with both increases and decreases across the U.S. Extreme hydrologic events are projected to increase over most of the U.S.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key issue (uncertainty) is the ability of climate models to simulate precipitation. This is one of the more challenging aspects of modeling of the climate system because precipitation involves not only large-scale processes that are well-resolved by models but also small-scale process, such as convection, that must be parameterized in the current generation of global and regional climate models.\nViable avenues to improving the information base are to perform some long, very high-resolution simulations of this century's climate under different emissions scenarios.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and uncertainties, confidence is high that heavy downpours are increasing in most regions of the U.S., with especially large increases in the Midwest and Northeast.\nConfidence is high that further increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events are projected for most U.S. areas, given the evidence base and uncertainties.\nKey message #7 Traceable Account\nThere have been changes in some types of extreme weather events over the last several decades. Heat waves have become more frequent and intense, especially in the West. Cold waves have become less frequent and intense across the nation. There have been regional trends in floods and droughts. Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves everywhere are projected to become more intense, and cold waves less intense everywhere.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the climate science peer-reviewed literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics were also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nAnalysis of U.S. temperature records indicates that record cold events are becoming progressively less frequent relative to\n\nrecord high events.60,170 There is evidence for the corresponding trends in a global framework.7,66 A number of publications have explored the increasing trend of heat waves.7,62,69 Additionally, heat waves observed in the southern Great Plains,1 Europe,7,62 and Russia60,66,67 have now been shown to have a higher probability of having occurred because of human-induced climate change.\nSome parts of the U.S. have been seeing changing trends for floods and droughts over the last 50 years, with some evidence for human influence.13,48,62 In the areas of increased flooding in parts of the Great Plains, Midwest, and Northeast, increases in both total precipitation and extreme precipitation have been observed and may be contributing to the flooding increases. However, when averaging over the entire contiguous U.S., there is no overall trend in flood magnitudes.71 A number of publications project drought as becoming a more normal condition over much of the southern and central U.S. (most recent references: Dai 2012; Hoerling et al. 2012; Wehner et al. 201175,76).\nAnalyses of U.S. daily temperature records indicate that low records are being broken at a much smaller rate than high records, and at the smallest rate in the historical record.60,170 However, in certain localized regions, natural variations can be as large or larger than the human induced change.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The key uncertainty regarding projections of future drought is how soil moisture responds to precipitation changes and potential evaporation increases. Most studies indicate that many parts of the U.S. will experience drier soil conditions but the amount of that drying is uncertain.\nNatural variability is also an uncertainty affecting projections of extreme event occurrences in shorter timescales (several years to decades), but the changes due to human influence become larger relative to natural variability as the timescale lengthens. Stakeholders should view the occurrence of extreme events in the context of increasing probabilities due to climate change.\nContinuation of long term temperature and precipitation observations is critical to monitoring trends in extreme weather events.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and uncertainties, confidence is high for the entire key message.\nHeat waves have become more frequent and intense, and confidence is high that heat waves everywhere are projected to become more intense in the future.\nConfidence is high that cold waves have become less frequent and intense across the nation.\n\n64\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE Traceable Accounts\n\nConfidence is high that there have been regional trends in floods and droughts.\nConfidence is high that droughts in the Southwest are projected to become more intense.\nKey message #8 Traceable Account\nThe intensity, frequency, and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since the early 1980s. The relative contributions of human and natural causes to these increases are still uncertain. Hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates are projected to increase as the climate continues to warm.\n\nKey message #9 Traceable Account\nWinter storms have increased in frequency and intensity since the 1950s, and their tracks have shifted northward over the United States. Other trends in severe storms, including the intensity and frequency of tornadoes, hail, and damaging thunderstorm winds, are uncertain and are being studied intensively.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the climate science peer-reviewed literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics were also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the climate science peer-reviewed literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics were also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nRecent studies suggest that the most intense Atlantic hurricanes have become stronger since the early 1980s.93 While this is still the subject of active research, this trend is projected to continue.90,91\n\nCurrent work98 has provided evidence of the increase in frequency\nand intensity of winter storms, with the storm tracks shifting poleward,99,100 but some areas have experienced a decrease in winter storm frequency.1 Although there are some indications\nof increased blocking (a large-scale pressure pattern with little\nor no movement) of the wintertime circulation of the Northern Hemisphere,106 the assessment and attribution of trends in blocking remain an active research area.107 Some recent research\nhas provided insight into the connection of global warming to tornadoes and severe thunderstorms.96\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Detecting trends in Atlantic and eastern North Pacific hurricane activity is challenged by a lack of consistent historical data and limited understanding of all of the complex interactions between the atmosphere and ocean that influence hurricanes.87,88\nWhile the best analyses to date87,91 suggest an increase in intensity and in the number of the most intense hurricanes over this century, there remain significant uncertainties.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties:\nHigh confidence that the intensity, frequency, and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have increased substantially since the early 1980s.\nLow confidence in relative contributions of human and natural causes in the increases.\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Winter storms and other types of severe storms have greater uncertainties in their recent trends and projections, compared to hurricanes (Key Message 8). The text for this key message explicitly acknowledges the state of knowledge, pointing out \"what we don't know.\" There has been a sizeable upward trend in the number of storm events causing large financial and other losses.95\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties:\nConfidence is medium that winter storms have increased slightly in frequency and intensity, and that their tracks have shifted northward over the U.S.\nConfidence is low on other trends in severe storms, including the intensity and frequency of tornadoes, hail, and damaging thunderstorm winds.\n\nMedium confidence that hurricane intensity and rainfall rates are projected to increase as the climate continues to warm.\n\n65\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE Traceable Accounts\n\nKey message #10 Traceable Account\nGlobal sea level has risen by about 8 inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880. It is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the climate science peer-reviewed literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics were also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nNearly all studies to date published in the peer-reviewed literature agree that global sea level has risen during the past century, and that it will continue to rise over the next century.\nTide gauges throughout the world have documented rising sea levels during the last 130 years. This rise has been further confirmed over the past 20 years by satellite observations, which are highly accurate and have nearly global coverage. Recent studies have shown current sea level rise rates are increasing112,123 and project that future sea level rise over the rest of this century will be faster than that of the last 100 years (Appendix 3: Climate Science, Supplemental Message 12).123\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The key issue in predicting future rates of global sea level rise is to understand and predict how ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica will react to a warming climate. Current projections of global sea level rise do not account for the complicated behavior of these giant ice slabs as they interact with the atmosphere, the ocean and the land. Lack of knowledge about the ice sheets and their behavior is the primary reason that projections of global sea level rise includes such a wide range of plausible future conditions.\nEarly efforts at semi-empirical models suggested much higher rates of sea level rise (as much as 6 feet by 2100).115,117 More recent work suggests that a high end of 3 to 4 feet is more plausible.115,116,121 It is not clear, however, whether these statistical relationships will hold in the future or that they are appropriate in modeling past behavior, thus calling their reliability into question.118 Some decision-makers may wish to consider a broader range of scenarios such as 8 inches or 6.6 feet by 2100 in the context of risk-based analysis.122,123\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence and uncertainties, confidence is very high that global sea level has risen during the past century, and that it will continue to rise over this century, with medium confidence that global sea level rise will be in the range of 1 to 4 feet by 2100.\n\nKey message #11 Traceable Account\nRising temperatures are reducing ice volume and surface extent on land, lakes, and sea. This loss of ice is expected to continue. The Arctic Ocean is expected to become essentially ice free in summer before mid-century.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the climate science peer-reviewed literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics were also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nThere have been a number of publications reporting decreases in ice on land147 and glacier recession. Evidence that winter lake ice and summer sea ice are rapidly declining is based on satellite data and is incontrovertible.111,172\nNearly all studies to date published in the peer-reviewed literature agree that summer Arctic sea ice extent is rapidly declining,131 with even greater reductions in ice thickness132,133 and volume,134 and that if heat-trapping gas concentrations continue to rise, an essentially ice-free Arctic ocean will be realized sometime during this century (for example, Stroeve et al. 2012136). September 2012 had the lowest levels of Arctic ice in recorded history. Great Lakes ice should follow a similar trajectory. Glaciers will generally retreat, except for a small percentage of glaciers that experience dynamical surging.111 Snow cover on land has decreased over the past several decades.145 The rate of permafrost degradation is complicated by changes in snow cover and vegetation.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The rate of sea ice loss through this century is a key issue (uncertainty), which stems from a combination of large differences in projections between different climate models, natural climate variability and uncertainty about future rates of fossil fuel emissions. This uncertainty is illustrated in Figure 2.29, showing the CMIP5-based projections (adapted from Stroeve et al. 2012136).\nViable avenues to improving the information base are determining the primary causes of the range of different climate model projections and determining which climate models exhibit the best ability to reproduce the observed rate of sea-ice loss.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and uncertainties, confidence is very high that rising temperatures are reducing ice volume and extent on land, lakes, and sea, and that this loss of ice is expected to continue.\n\n66\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fConfidence is very high that the Arctic Ocean is projected to become virtually ice-free in summer by mid-century.\nKey message #12 Traceable Account\nThe oceans are currently absorbing about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere annually and are becoming more acidic as a result, leading to concerns about intensifying impacts on marine ecosystems.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the climate science peer-reviewed literature. Technical Input reports (82) on a wide range of topics were also reviewed; they were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nThe oceans currently absorb a quarter of the CO2 the caused by human activities.155 Publications have shown that this absorption causes the ocean to become more acidic (for example, Doney et al. 2009154). Recent publications demonstrate the adverse effects further acidification will have on marine life.158,165,169\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Absorption of CO2 of human origin, reduced pH, and lower calcium carbonate (CaCO3) saturation in surface waters, where the bulk of oceanic production occurs, are well verified from models, hydrographic surveys, and time series data.158 The key issue (uncertainty) is how future levels of ocean acidity will affect marine ecosystems.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and uncertainties, confidence is very high that oceans are absorbing about a quarter of emitted CO2.\nVery high for trend of ocean acidification; low-to-medium for intensifying impacts on marine ecosystems. Our present understanding of projected ocean acidification impacts on marine organisms stems largely from short-term laboratory and mesocosm experiments, although there are also examples based on actual ocean observations; consequently, the response of individual organisms, populations, and communities of species to more realistic, gradual changes still has large uncertainties.\n\n2: OUR CHANGING CLIMATE Traceable Accounts\n\n67\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fSECTORS\n\nCherry farmers in Michigan, insurance agents in Florida, and water managers in Arizona are among the millions of Americans already living with \u00ad and adapting to \u00ad a range of climate change impacts. Higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and more extreme precipitation events are altering the work of first responders, city planners, engineers, and others, influencing economic sectors from coast to coast. Agriculture, energy, transportation, and more, are all affected by climate change in concrete ways. American communities are contending with these changes now, and will be doing so increasingly in the future.\n\nSectors of our economy do not exist in isolation. Forest management activities, for example, affect and are affected by water supply, changing ecosystems, impacts to biological diversity, and energy availability. Water supply and energy use are completely intertwined, since water is used to generate energy, and energy is required to pump, treat, and deliver water \u00ad which means that irrigation-dependent farmers and urban dwellers are linked as well. Human health is affected by water supply, agricultural practices, transportation systems, energy availability, and land use, among other factors \u00ad touching the lives of patients, nurses, county health administrators, and many others. Human social systems and communities are directly affected by extreme weather events and changes in natural resources such as water availability and quality; they are also affected both directly and indirectly by ecosystem health.\n\nThis report addresses some of these topics individually, focusing on the climaterelated risks and opportunities that occur within individual sectors, while others take a cross-sector approach. Single-sector chapters focus on:\n\n\u00b7 Water resources \u00b7 Energy production and use \u00b7 Transportation \u00b7 Agriculture\n\n\u00b7 Forests \u00b7 Human health \u00b7 Ecosystems and biodiversity\n\nSix crosscutting chapters address how climate change interacts with multiple sectors. These cover the following topics:\n\n\u00b7 Energy, water, and land use \u00b7 Urban infrastructure and vulnerability \u00b7 Indigenous peoples, lands, and resources\n\n\u00b7 Land use and land cover \u00b7 Rural communities \u00b7 Biogeochemical cycles\n\nA common theme is that these sectors are interconnected in many ways. These intricate connections mean that changes in one sector are often amplified or reduced through links to other sectors. Another theme is how decisions can influence a cascade of events that affect individual and national vulnerability and/or resiliency to climate change across multiple sectors. This \"systems approach\" helps to reveal, for example, how adaptation and mitigation strategies are part of dynamic and interrelated systems. In this way, for example, adaptation plans for future coastal infrastructure are connected with the kinds of mitigation strategies that are \u00ad or are not \u00ad put into place today, since the amount of future sea level rise will differ according to various societal decisions about current and future emissions. These chapters also address the importance of underlying vulnerabilities and the ways they may influence risks associated with climate change.\nThe chapters in the following section assess risks in the selected sectors, and include both observations of existing impacts associated with climate change, as well as projected impacts over the next several decades and beyond.\n\n\u00a9 Ted Wood Photography\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 3 WATER RESOURCES\nConvening Lead Authors\nAris Georgakakos, Georgia Institute of Technology Paul Fleming, Seattle Public Utilities\nLead Authors\nMichael Dettinger, U.S. Geological Survey Christa Peters-Lidard, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Terese (T.C.)

Annual precipitation and river-flow increases are observed now in the Midwest and the Northeast regions. Very heavy precipitation events have increased nationally and are projected to increase in all regions. The length of dry spells is projected to increase in most areas, especially the southern and northwestern portions of the contiguous United States.\n2. Short-term (seasonal or shorter) droughts are expected to intensify in most U.S. regions. Longer-term droughts are expected to intensify in large areas of the Southwest, southern Great Plains, and Southeast.\n3. Flooding may intensify in many U.S. regions, even in areas where total precipitation is projected to decline.\n4. Climate change is expected to affect water demand, groundwater withdrawals, and aquifer recharge, reducing groundwater availability in some areas.\n5. Sea level rise, storms and storm surges, and changes in surface and groundwater use patterns are expected to compromise the sustainability of coastal freshwater aquifers and wetlands.\n6. Increasing air and water temperatures, more intense precipitation and runoff, and intensifying droughts can decrease river and lake water quality in many ways, including increases in sediment, nitrogen, and other pollutant loads.\nClimate Change Impacts on Water Resources Use and Managment\n7. Climate change affects water demand and the ways water is used within and across regions and economic sectors. The Southwest, Great Plains, and Southeast are particularly vulnerable to changes in water supply and demand.\n8. Changes in precipitation and runoff, combined with changes in consumption and withdrawal, have reduced surface and groundwater supplies in many areas. These trends are expected to continue, increasing the likelihood of water shortages for many uses.\n9. Increasing flooding risk affects human safety and health, property, infrastructure, economies, and ecology in many basins across the United States.\nAdaptation and Institutional Responses\n10. In most U.S. regions, water resources managers and planners will encounter new risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities that may not be properly managed within existing practices.\n11. Increasing resilience and enhancing adaptive capacity provide opportunities to strengthen water resources management and plan for climate change impacts. Many institutional, scientific, economic, and political barriers present challenges to implementing adaptive strategies.\nThis chapter contains three main sections: climate change impacts on the water cycle, climate change impacts on water resources use and management, and adaptation and institutional responses. Key messages for each section are summarized above.\n\n70\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nThe cycle of life is intricately joined with the cycle of water.\n-- Jacques-Yves Cousteau\n\nClimate Change Impacts on the Water Cycle\nWater cycles constantly from the atmosphere to the land and and ecosystems are accustomed to functioning within this varithe oceans (through precipitation and runoff) and back to the ability. However, climate change is altering the water cycle in atmosphere (through evaporation and the release of water multiple ways over different time scales and geographic areas, from plant leaves), setting the stage for all life to exist. The presenting unfamiliar risks and opportunities. water cycle is dynamic and naturally variable, and societies\nKey Message 1: Changing Rain, Snow, and Runoff\n\nAnnual precipitation and river-flow increases are observed now in the Midwest and the Northeast regions. Very heavy precipitation events have increased nationally and are projected to increase in all regions. The length of dry spells is projected to increase in most areas, especially the southern and northwestern portions of the contiguous United States.\n\nAnnual average precipitation over the continental U.S. as a whole increased by close to two inches (0.16 inches per decade) between 1895 and 2011.1,2 In recent decades, annual average precipitation increases have been observed across the Midwest, Great Plains, the Northeast, and Alaska, while decreases have been observed in Hawai`i and parts of the Southeast and Southwest (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figure 2.12). Average annual precipitation is projected to increase across the northern U.S., and decrease in the southern U.S., especially the Southwest. (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figures 2.14 and 2.15).3\n\nProjected Changes in Snow, Runoff, and Soil Moisture\n\nThe number and intensity of very heavy precipitation events (defined as the heaviest 1% of all daily events from 1901 to 2012) have been increasing significantly across most of the United States. The amount of precipitation falling in the heaviest daily events has also increased in most areas of the United States (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figure 2.17). For example, from 1950 to 2007, daily precipitation totals with 2-, 5-, and 10-year average recurrence periods increased in the Northeast and western Great Lakes.4 Very heavy precipitation events are projected to increase everywhere (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figure 2.19).5 Heavy precipitation events that historically occurred once in 20 years are projected to occur as frequently as every 5 to 15 years by late this century.6 The number and magnitude of the heaviest precipitation events is projected to increase everywhere in the United States (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figure 2.13).\nDry spells are also projected to increase in length in most regions, especially in the southern and northwestern portions of the contiguous United States (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figure 2.13). Projected changes in total average annual precipitation are generally small in many areas, but both wet and dry extremes (heavy precipitation events\n\nFigure 3.1. These projections, assuming continued increases in heat-trapping gas emissions (A2 scenario; Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate), illustrate: a) major losses in the water content of the snowpack that fills western rivers (snow water equivalent, or SWE); b) significant reductions in runoff in California, Arizona, and the central Rocky Mountains; and c) reductions in soil moisture across the Southwest. The changes shown are for mid-century (2041-2070) as percentage changes from 19712000 conditions (Figure source: Cayan et al. 201318).\n\n71\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAnnual Surface Soil Moisture Trends\n\n3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nFigure 3.2. Changes in annual surface soil moisture per year over the period 1988 to 2010 based on multi-\nsatellite datasets. Surface soil moisture exhibits wetting trends in the Northeast, Florida, upper Midwest, and Northwest, and drying trends almost everywhere else. (Images provided by W. Dorigo35).\n\nand length of dry spells) are projected to increase substantially almost everywhere.\nThe timing of peak river levels has changed in response to warming trends. Snowpack and snowmelt-fed rivers in much of the western U.S. have earlier peak flow trends since the middle of the last century, including the past decade (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).7,8 This is related to declines in spring snowpack, earlier snowmelt-fed streamflow, and larger percentages of precipitation falling as rain instead of snow. These changes have taken place in the midst of considerable year-to-year variability and long-term natural fluctuations of the western U.S. climate, as well as other influences, such as the effects of dust and soot on snowpacks.7,9 There are both natural and human influences on the observed trends.10,11 However, in studies specifically designed to differentiate between natural and human-induced causes, up to 60% of these changes have been attributed to human-induced climate warming,10 but only among variables that are more responsive to warming than to precipitation variability, such as the effect of air temperature on snowpack.12\nOther historical changes related to peak river-flow have been observed in the northern Great Plains, Midwest, and Northeast,13,14 along with striking reductions in lake ice cover (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).15,16\n\nPermafrost is thawing in many parts of Alaska, a trend that not only affects habitats and infrastructure but also mobilizes subsurface water and reroutes surface water in ways not previously witnessed.17 Nationally, all of these trends are projected to become even more pronounced as the climate continues to warm (Figure 3.1).\nEvapotranspiration (ET \u00ad the evaporation of moisture from soil, on plants and trees, and from water bodies; and transpiration, the use and release of water from plants), is the second largest component of the water cycle after precipitation. ET responds to temperature, solar energy, winds, atmospheric humidity, and moisture availability at the land surface and regulates amounts of soil moisture, groundwater recharge, and runoff.19 Transpiration comprises between 80% and 90% of total ET on land (Ch. 6: Agriculture).20 In snowy settings, sublimation of snow and ice (loss of snow and ice directly into water vapor without passing through a liquid stage) can increase these returns of water to the atmosphere, sometimes in significant amounts.21 These interactions complicate estimation and projection of regional losses of water from the land surface to the atmosphere.\nGlobally-averaged ET increased between 1982 and 1997 but stopped increasing, or has decreased, since about 1998.22 In North America, the observed ET decreases occurred in waterrich rather than water-limited areas. Factors contributing to these ET decreases are thought to include decreasing wind\n\n72\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fSeasonal Surface Soil Moisture Trends\n\n3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nFigure 3.3. Changes in seasonal surface soil moisture per year over the period 1988 to 2010 based on multi-satellite datasets.35 Seasonal drying is observed in central and lower Midwest and Southeast for most seasons (with the exception\nof the Southeast summer), and in most of the Southwest and West (with the exception of the Northwest) for spring\nand summer. Soil moisture in the upper Midwest, Northwest, and most of the Northeast is increasing in most seasons.\n(Images provided by W. Dorigo).\n\nspeed,23,24 decreasing solar energy at the land surface due to increasing cloud cover and concentration of small particles (aerosols),25 increasing humidity,23 and declining soil moisture (Figure 3.2).26\nEvapotranspiration projections vary by region,27,28,29,30 but the atmospheric potential for ET is expected to increase; actual ET will be affected by regional soil moisture changes. Much more research is needed to confidently identify historical trends, causes, and implications for future ET trends.31 This represents a critical uncertainty in projecting the impacts of climate change on regional water cycles.\nSoil moisture plays a major role in the water cycle, regulating the exchange of water, energy, and carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere,22 the production of runoff, and the recharge of groundwater aquifers. Soil moisture is projected to decline with higher temperatures and attendant increases in the potential for ET in much of the country, especially in the Great Plains,29 Southwest,18,32,33 and Southeast.28,34\n\nRunoff and streamflow at regional scales declined during the last half-century in the Northwest.36 Runoff and streamflow increased in the Mississippi Basin and Northeast, with no clear trends in much of the rest of the continental U.S.,37 although a declining trend is emerging in annual runoff in the Colorado River Basin.38 These changes need to be considered in the context of tree-ring studies in California's Central Valley, the Colorado River and Wind River basins, and the southeastern U.S. that indicate that these regions have experienced prolonged, even drier and wetter conditions at various times in the past two thousand years.8,39,40 Human-caused climate change, when superimposed on past natural variability, may amplify these past extreme conditions. Projected changes in runoff for eight basins in the Northwest, northern Great Plains, and Southwest are illustrated in Figure 3.4.\nBasins in the southwestern U.S. and southern Rockies (for example, the Rio Grande and Colorado River basins) are projected to experience gradual runoff declines during this century. Basins in the Northwest to north-central U.S. (for example, the\n\n73\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\nStreamflow Projections for River Basins in the Western U.S.\n\nFigure 3.4. Annual and seasonal streamflow projections based on the B1 (with substantial emissions reductions), A1B (with gradual reductions from current emission trends beginning around mid-century), and A2 (with continuation of current rising emissions trends)\nCMIP3 scenarios for eight river basins in the western United States. The panels show percentage changes in average runoff, with\nprojected increases above the zero line and decreases below. Projections are for annual, cool, and warm seasons, for three future decades (2020s, 2050s, and 2070s) relative to the 1990s. (Source: U.S. Department of the Interior \u00ad Bureau of Reclamation 2011;41\nData provided by L. Brekke, S. Gangopadhyay, and T. Pruitt)\n\nColumbia and the Missouri River basins) are projected to experience little change through the middle of this century, and increases by late this century.\nProjected changes in runoff differ by season, with cool season runoff increasing over the west coast basins from California to Washington and over the north-central U.S. (for example, the San Joaquin, Sacramento, Klamath, Missouri, and Columbia River basins). Basins in the southwestern U.S. and southern Rockies are projected to see little change to slight decreases in the winter months.\n\nWarm season runoff is projected to decrease substantially over a region spanning southern Oregon, the southwestern U.S., and southern Rockies (for example, the Klamath, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Rio Grande, and the Colorado River basins), and change little or increase slightly north of this region (for example, the Columbia and Missouri River basins).\nIn most of these western basins, these projected streamflow changes are outside the range of historical variability, especially by the 2050s and 2070s. The projected streamflow changes and associated uncertainties have water management implications (discussed below).\n\n74\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nKey Message 2: Droughts Intensify\n\nShort-term (seasonal or shorter) droughts are expected to intensify in most U.S. regions. Longer-term droughts are expected to intensify in large areas of\nthe Southwest, southern Great Plains, and Southeast.\n\nAnnual runoff and related river-flow are projected to decline in the Southwest42,43 and Southeast,34 and to increase in the Northeast, Alaska, Northwest, and upper Midwest regions,42,43,44,45 broadly mirroring projected precipitation patterns.46 Observational studies47 have shown that decadal fluctuations in average temperature (up to 1.5\u00b0F) and precipitation changes of 10% have occurred in most areas of the U.S. during the last century. Fluctuations in river-flow indicate that effects of temperature are dominated by fluctuations in precipitation. Nevertheless, as warming affects water cycle processes, the amount of runoff generated by a given amount of precipitation is generally expected to decline.37\nDroughts occur on time scales ranging from season-to-season to multiple years and even multiple decades. There has been no universal trend in the overall extent of drought across the continental U.S. since 1900. However, in the Southwest, wide-\n\nspread drought in the past decade has reflected both precipitation deficits and higher temperatures8 in ways that resemble projected changes.48 Long-term (multi-seasonal) drought con-\nditions are also projected to increase in parts of the Southeast\nand possibly in Hawai`i and the Pacific Islands (Ch. 23: Hawai`i\nand Pacific Islands). Except in the few areas where increases\nin summer precipitation compensate, summer droughts (Ch.\n2: Our Changing Climate) are expected to intensify almost everywhere in the continental U.S.49 due to longer periods of dry weather and more extreme heat,33 leading to more moisture\nloss from plants and earlier soil moisture depletion in basins where snowmelt shifts to earlier in the year.50,51 Basins watered\nby glacial melt in the Sierra Nevada, Glacier National Park, and\nAlaska may experience increased summer river-flow in the\nnext few decades, until the amounts of glacial ice become too small to contribute to river-flow.52,53\n\nKey Message 3: Increased Risk of Flooding in Many Parts of the U.S.\n\nFlooding may intensify in many U.S. regions, even in areas where total precipitation is projected to decline.\n\nThere are various types of floods (see \"Flood Factors and Flood Types\"), some of which are projected to increase with continued climate change. Floods that are closely tied to heavy precipitation events, such as flash floods and urban floods, as well as coastal floods related to sea level rise and the resulting increase in storm surge height and inland impacts, are expected to increase. Other types of floods result from a more complex set of causes. For example, river floods are basin specific and dependent not only on precipitation but also on pre-existing soil moisture conditions, topography, and other factors, including important human-caused changes to watersheds and river courses across the United States.54,55,56,57\nSignificant changes in annual precipitation (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate) and soil moisture (Figures 3.2 and 3.3), among other factors, are expected to affect annual flood magnitudes (Figure 3.5) in many regions.58 River floods have been increasing in the Northeast and Midwest, and decreasing in the Southwest and Southeast.56,57,58,59 These decreases are not surprising, as short duration very heavy precipitation events often occur during the summer and autumn when rivers are generally low.\n\nHowever, these very heavy precipitation events can and do lead to flash floods, often exacerbated in urban areas by the effect of impervious surfaces on runoff.\nHeavy rainfall events are projected to increase, which is expected to increase the potential for flash flooding. Land cover, flow and water-supply management, soil moisture, and channel conditions are also important influences on flood generation55 and must be considered in projections of future flood risks. Region-specific storm mechanisms and seasonality also affect flood peaks.57 Because of this, and limited capacity to project future very heavy events with confidence, evaluations of the relative changes in various storm mechanisms may be useful.57,60,61 Warming is likely to directly affect flooding in many mountain settings, as catchment areas receive increasingly more precipitation as rain rather than snow, or more rain falling on existing snowpack.62 In some such settings, river flooding may increase as a result \u00ad even where precipitation and overall river flows decline (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).\n\n75\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fTrends in Flood Magnitude\n\n3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nFigure 3.5. Trend magnitude (triangle size) and direction (green = increasing trend, brown = decreasing trend) of annual flood magnitude from the 1920s through 2008. Flooding in local\nareas can be affected by multiple factors, including land-use change, dams, and diversions of\nwater for use. Most significant are increasing trends for floods in Midwest and Northeast, and a decreasing trend in the Southwest. (Figure source: Peterson et al. 201363).\n\nKey Message 4: Groundwater Availability\n\nClimate change is expected to affect water demand, groundwater withdrawals, and aquifer recharge, reducing groundwater availability in some areas.\n\nGroundwater is the only perennial source of fresh water in many regions and provides a buffer against climate extremes. As such, it is essential to water supplies, food security, and ecosystems. Though groundwater occurs in most areas of the U.S., the capacity of aquifers to store water varies depending on the geology of the region. (Figure 3.6b illustrates the importance of groundwater aquifers.) In large regions of the Southwest, Great Plains, Midwest, Florida, and some other coastal areas, groundwater is the primary water supply. Groundwater aquifers in these areas are susceptible to the combined stresses of climate and water-use changes. For example, during the 2006\u00ad2009 California drought, when the source of irrigation shifted from surface water to predominantly groundwater, groundwater storage in California's Central Valley declined by an amount roughly equivalent to the storage capacity of Lake Mead, the largest reservoir in the United States.64\nClimate change impacts on groundwater storage are expected to vary from place to place and aquifer to aquifer. Although precise responses of groundwater storage and flow to climate change are not well understood nor readily generalizable, recent and ongoing studies65,66,67,68 provide insights on various underlying mechanisms:\n\npiration (ET) is the key driver in energy-limited environments (like swamps or marshlands).\n2) Climate change impacts on aquifer recharge depend on several factors, including basin geology, frequency and intensity of high-rainfall periods that drive recharge, seasonal timing of recharge events, and strength of groundwater-surface water interaction.\n3) Changes in recharge rates are amplified relative to changes in total precipitation, with greater amplification for drier areas.\nWith these insights in mind, it is clear that certain groundwater-dependent regions are projected to incur significant climate change related challenges. In some portions of the country, groundwater provides nearly 100% of the water supply (Figure 3.6b). Seasonal soil moisture changes are a key aquifer recharge driver and may provide an early indication of general aquifer recharge trends. Thus, the observed regional reductions in seasonal soil moisture for winter and spring (Figure 3.3) portend adverse recharge impacts for several U.S. regions, especially the Great Plains, Southwest, and Southeast.\n\n1) Precipitation is the key driver of aquifer recharge in water- Despite their critical national importance as water supply limited environments (like arid regions), while evapotrans- sources (see Figure 3.6), aquifers are not generally monitored\n\n76\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\nPrincipal U.S. Groundwater Aquifers and Use\n\nFigure 3.6. (a) Groundwater aquifers are found throughout the U.S., but they vary widely in terms of ability to store and recharge water. The colors on this map illustrate aquifer location and geology: blue colors indicate unconsolidated sand and gravel; yellow is semi-consolidated sand; green is sandstone; blue or purple is sandstone and carbonate-rock; browns are carbonate-rock; red is igneous and metamorphic rock; and white is other aquifer types. (Figure source: USGS). (b) Ratio of groundwater withdrawals to total water withdrawals from all surface and groundwater sources by county. The map illustrates that aquifers are the main (and often exclusive) water supply source for many U.S. regions, especially in the Great Plains, Misssissippi Valley, east central U.S., Great Lakes region, Florida, and other coastal areas. Groundwater aquifers in these regions are prone to impacts due to combined climate and water-use change. (Data from USGS 2005).\n\nin ways that allow for clear identification of climatic influences\non groundwater recharge, storage, flows, and discharge. Near-\nly all monitoring is focused in areas and aquifers where varia-\ntions are dominated by groundwater pumping, which largely masks climatic influences,69 highlighting the need for a national framework for groundwater monitoring.70\n\nGenerally, impacts of changing demands on groundwater systems, whether due directly to climate changes or indirectly through changes in land use or surface-water availability and management, are likely to have the most immediate effects on groundwater availability;67,71 changes in recharge and storage may be more subtle and take longer to emerge. Groundwater models have only recently begun to include detailed represen-\n\n77\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\n\ntations of groundwater recharge and interactions with surface-water and land-surface processes,50 with few projections of groundwater responses to climate change.68,72 However, sur-\nface water declines have already resulted in larger groundwater\nwithdrawals in some areas (for example, in the Central Valley\nof California and in the Southeast) and may be aggravated by climate change challenges.73 In many mountainous areas of the\nU.S., groundwater recharge is disproportionately generated\nfrom snowmelt infiltration, suggesting that the loss of snowpack will affect recharge rates and patterns.50,51,66,74 Models do\nnot yet include dynamic representations of the groundwater\nreservoir and its connections to streams, the soil-vegetation\nsystem, and the atmosphere, limiting the understanding of the\n\npotential climate change impacts on groundwater and groundwater-reliant systems.75\nAs the risk of drought increases, groundwater can play a key role in enabling adaptation to climate variability and change. For example, groundwater can be augmented by surface water during times of high flow through aquifer recharge strategies, such as infiltration basins and injection wells. In addition, management strategies can be implemented that use surface water for irrigation and water supply during wet periods, and groundwater during drought, although these approaches face practical limitations within current management and institutional frameworks.71,76\n\nKey Message 5: Risks to Coastal Aquifers and Wetlands\n\nSea level rise, storms and storm surges, and changes in surface and groundwater use patterns are expected to compromise the sustainability of coastal freshwater aquifers and wetlands.\n\nWith more than 50% of the nation's population concentrated near coasts (Chapter 25: Coasts),77 coastal aquifers and wetlands are precious resources. These aquifers and wetlands, which are extremely important from a biological/biodiversity perspective (see Ch. 8: Ecosystems; Ch. 25: Coasts), may be particularly at risk due to the combined effects of inland droughts and floods, increased surface water impoundments and diversions, increased groundwater withdrawals, and accelerating sea level rise and greater storm surges.78,79 Estuaries are particularly vulnerable to changes in freshwater inflow and sea level rise by changing salinity and habitat of these areas.\n\nSeveral coastal areas, including the Delaware, Susquehanna, and Potomac River deltas on the Northeast seaboard, most of Florida, the Apalachicola and Mobile River deltas and bays, the Mississippi River delta in Louisiana, and the delta of the Sacramento-San Joaquin rivers in northern California, are particularly vulnerable due to the combined effects of climate change and other human-caused stresses. In response, some coastal communities are among the nation's most proactive in adaptation planning (Chapter 25: Coasts).\n\nKey Message 6: Water Quality Risks to Lakes and Rivers\n\nIncreasing air and water temperatures, more intense precipitation and runoff, and intensifying droughts can decrease river and lake water quality in many ways, including increases in sediment, nitrogen, and other pollutant loads.\n\nWater temperature has been increasing in some rivers.80 The\nlength of the season that lakes and reservoirs are thermally\nstratified (with separate density layers) is increasing with increased air and water temperatures.81,82 In some cases, sea-\nsonal mixing may be eliminated in shallow lakes, decreasing\ndissolved oxygen and leading to excess concentrations of\nnutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous), heavy metals (such as mercury), and other toxins in lake waters.81,82\n\ncover, flood frequencies, and flood magnitudes are expected to increase mobilization of sediments in large river basins.87\n\nLower and more persistent low flows under drought conditions\nas well as higher flows during floods can worsen water quality.\nIncreasing precipitation intensity, along with the effects of wild-\nfires and fertilizer use, are increasing sediment, nutrient, and\ncontaminant loads in surface waters used by downstream water users84 and ecosystems. Mineral weathering products, like calcium, magnesium, sodium, and silicon and nitrogen loads85 have been increasing with higher streamflows.86 Changing land\n\nIncreasing air and water temperatures, more intense precipitation and runoff, and intensifying droughts can decrease water quality in many ways. Here, middle school students in Colorado learn about water quality.\n\n\u00a9 Ted Wood\n\n78\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nChanges in sediment transport are expected to vary regionally and by land-use type, with potentially large increases in some areas,88 resulting in alterations to reservoir storage and river channels, affecting flooding, navigation, water supply, and dredging. Increased frequency and duration of droughts, and associated low water levels, increase nutrient concentrations and residence times in streams, potentially increasing the like-\n\nlihood of harmful algal blooms and low oxygen conditions.89\nConcerns over such impacts and their potential link to climate\nchange are rising for many U.S. regions including the Great Lakes,90 Chesapeake Bay,91 and the Gulf of Mexico.85,86 Strat-\negies aiming to reduce sediment, nutrient, and contaminant\nloads at the source remain the most effective management responses.92\n\nObserved Changes in Lake Stratification and Ice Covered Area\n\nFigure 3.7. The length of the season in which differences in lake temperatures with depth cause stratification (separate density layers) is increasing in many lakes. In this case, measurements show stratification has been increasing in Lake Tahoe (top left) since the 1960s and in Lake Superior (top right) since the early 1900s in response to increasing air and surface water temperatures (see also Ch. 18: Midwest). In Lake Tahoe, because of its large size (relative to inflow) and resulting long water-residence times, other influences on stratification have been largely overwhelmed, and warming air and water temperatures have caused progressive declines in near-surface density, leading to longer stratification seasons (by an average of 20 days), decreasing the opportunities for deep lake mixing, reducing oxygen levels, and causing impacts to many species and numerous aspects of aquatic ecosytems.83 Similar effects are observed in Lake Superior,16 where the stratification season is lengthening (top right) and annual ice-covered area is declining (bottom); both observed changes are consistent with increasing air and water temperatures.\nRelationship between Historical and Projected Water Cycle Changes Natural climate variations occur on essentially all time scales have attributed specific observed changes in the water cycle from days to millennia, and the water cycle varies in much the to human-induced climate change (for example, Barnett et al. same way. Observations of changes in the water cycle over 200810). For many other water cycle variables and impacts, the time include responses to natural hydroclimatic variability as observed and projected responses are consistent with those well as other, more local, human influences (like dam build- expected by human-induced climate change and other huing or land-use changes), or combinations of these influences man influences. Research aiming to formally attribute these with human-caused climate change. Some recent studies responses to their underlying causes is ongoing.\n\n79\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nFlood factors and flood types\n\nA flood is defined as any high flow, overflow, or inundation by water that causes or threatens damage.93 Floods are caused or amplified by both weather- and human-related factors. Major weather factors include heavy or prolonged precipitation, snowmelt, thunderstorms, storm surges from hurricanes, and ice or debris jams. Human factors include structural failures of dams and levees, inadequate drainage, and land cover alterations (such as pavement or deforestation) that reduce the capacity of the land surface to absorb water. Increasingly, humanity is also adding to weather-related factors, as human-induced warming increases heavy downpours, causes more extensive storm surges due to sea level rise, and leads to more rapid spring snowmelt.\n\nWorldwide, from 1980 to 2009, floods caused more than 500,000 deaths and affected more than 2.8 billion people.94 In the U.S., floods caused 4,586 deaths from 1959 to 200595 while property and crop damage averaged nearly $8 billion per year (in 2011 dollars) over 1981 through 2011.93 The risks from future floods are significant,\ngiven expanded development in coastal areas and floodplains, unabated urbanization, land-use changes, and humaninduced climate change.94\n\nMajor flood types include flash, urban, riverine, and coastal flooding:\n\nFlash floods occur in small and steep watersheds and waterways and can be caused by short-duration intense precipitation, dam or levee failure, or collapse of debris and ice jams. Snow cover and frozen ground conditions can exacerbate flash flooding during winter and early spring by increasing the fraction of precipitation that runs off. Flash floods develop within minutes or hours of the causative event, and can result in severe damage and loss of life due to high water velocity, heavy debris load, and limited warning. Most flood-related deaths in the U.S. are associated with flash floods.\n\nUrban flooding can be caused by short-duration very heavy precipitation. Urbanization creates large areas of impervious surfaces (such as roads, pavement, parking lots, and buildings) and increases immediate runoff. Stormwater drainage removes excess surface water as quickly as possible, but heavy downpours can exceed the capacity of drains and cause urban flooding.\n\nFlash Flooding: Cave Creek, Arizona (Photo credit: Tom McGuire).\n\nFlash floods and urban flooding are directly linked to heavy precipitation and are expected to increase as a result of projected increases in heavy precipitation events. In mountainous watersheds, such increases may be partially offset in winter and spring due to projected snowpack reduction.\nRiverine flooding occurs when surface water drains from a watershed into a stream or a river exceeds channel capacity, overflows the\n\nRiverine Flooding: In many regions, infrastructure is currently vulnerable to flooding, as demonstrated in these photos.

Clayton sewage treatment plant in Atlanta, Georgia, September 23, 2009, was engulfed by floodwaters forcing it to shut down and resulting in the discharge of raw sewage into the Chattahoochee River (photo credit: Reuters/David Tulis). Flooding also disrupts road and rail transportation, and inland navigation.\n\nContinued\n\n80\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\nFlood factors and flood types (continued)\nbanks, and inundates adjacent low lying areas. Riverine flooding is commonly associated with large watersheds and rivers, while flash and urban flooding occurs in smaller natural or urban watersheds. Because heavy precipitation is often localized, riverine flooding typically results from multiple heavy precipitation events over periods of several days, weeks, or even months. In large basins, existing soil moisture conditions and evapotranspiration rates also influence the onset and severity of flooding, as runoff increases with wetter soil and/or lower evapotranspiration conditions. Snow cover and frozen ground conditions can also exacerbate riverine flooding during winter and spring by increasing runoff associated with rain-on-snow events and by snowmelt, although these effects may diminish in the long term as snow accumulation decreases due to warming. Since riverine flooding depends on precipitation as well as many other factors, projections about changes in frequency or intensity are more uncertain than with flash and urban flooding.\nCoastal flooding is predominantly caused by storm surges that accompany hurricanes and other storms. Low storm pressure creates strong winds that create and push large sea water domes, often many miles across, toward the shore. The approaching domes can raise the water surface above normal tide levels (storm surge) by more than 25 feet, depending on various storm and shoreline factors. Inundation, battering waves, and floating debris associated with storm surge can cause deaths, widespread infrastructure damage (to buildings, roads, bridges, marinas, piers, boardwalks, and sea walls), and severe beach erosion. Stormrelated rainfall can also cause inland flooding (flash, urban, or riverine) if, after landfall, the storm moves slowly or stalls over an area. Inland flooding can occur close to the shore or hundreds of miles away and is responsible for more than half of the deaths associated with tropical storms.93 Climate change affects coastal flooding through sea level rise and storm surge, increases in heavy rainfall during hurricanes and Hurricane Sandy coastal flooding in Mantoloking, N.J. other storms, and related increases in flooding in (Photo credit: New Jersey National Guard/Scott Anema). coastal rivers.\nIn some locations, early warning systems have helped reduce deaths, although property damage remains considerable (Ch. 28: Adaptation). Further improvements can be made by more effective communication strategies and better landuse planning.94\n\nClimate Change Impacts on Water Resource Uses and Management\n\nPeople use water for many different purposes and benefits. Water is supplied for these many uses from two main sources:\n\nOur water use falls into five main categories: 1) municipal use,\n\nwhich includes domestic water for drinking and bathing; 2) ag-\n\n\u00b7 freshwater withdrawals (from streams, rivers, lakes,\n\nricultural use, which includes irrigation and cattle operations;\n\nand aquifers), which supply water for municipal, in-\n\n3) industrial use, which includes electricity production from\n\ndustrial, agricultural, and recirculating thermoelectric\n\ncoal- or gas-fired power plants that require water to keep the\n\nplant cooling water supply;\n\nmachinery cool; 4) providing ecosystem benefits, such as sup-\n\nporting the water needs of plants and animals we depend on;\n\n\u00b7 instream surface water flows, which support hydro-\n\nand 5) recreational uses, such as boating and fishing.\n\npower production, once-through thermoelectric plant\n\ncooling, navigation, recreation, and healthy ecosys-\n\ntems.\n\n81\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nKey Message 7: Changes to Water Demand and Use\n\nClimate change affects water demand and the ways water is used within and across regions and economic sectors. The Southwest, Great Plains, and Southeast are particularly vulnerable to changes in water supply and demand.\n\nClimate change, acting concurrently with demographic, landuse, energy generation and use, and socioeconomic changes, is challenging existing water management practices by affecting water availability and demand and by exacerbating competition among uses and users (see Ch. 4: Energy; Ch. 6: Agriculture; Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land; Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples;\n\nand Ch. 13: Land Use & Land Cover Change). In some regions, these current and expected impacts are hastening efficiency improvements in water withdrawal and use, the deployment of more proactive water management and adaptation approaches, and the reassessment of the water infrastructure and institutional responses.1\n\nWater Withdrawals\n\nTotal freshwater withdrawals (including water that is with- since 1980 at 350 billion gallons of withdrawn water and 100\n\ndrawn and consumed as well as water that returns to the origi- billion gallons of consumptive water per day, despite the adnal source) and consumptive uses have leveled off nationally dition of 68 million people from 1980 to 2005 (Figure 3.8).96\n\nIrrigation and all electric power plant cooling withdrawals ac-\n\nU.S. Freshwater Withdrawal, Consumptive Use, and Population Trends\n\ncount for approximately 77% of total withdrawals, municipal and industrial for 20%, and livestock and aquaculture for 3%. Most thermoelectric withdrawals are returned back to rivers\n\nafter cooling, while most irrigation withdrawals are consumed\n\nby the processes of evapotranspiration and plant growth.\n\nThus, consumptive water use is dominated by irrigation (81%)\n\nfollowed distantly by municipal and industrial (8%) and the re-\n\nmaining water uses (5%). See Figure 3.9.\n\nFigure 3.8. Trends in total freshwater withdrawal (equal to the sum of consumptive use and return flows to rivers) and population in the contiguous United States. This graph illustrates the remarkable change in the relationship between water use and population growth since about 1980. Reductions in per capita water withdrawals are directly related to increases in irrigation efficiency for agriculture, more efficient cooling processes in electrical generation, and, in many areas, price signals, more efficient indoor plumbing fixtures and appliances, and reductions in exterior landscape watering, in addition to shifts in land-use patterns in some areas.97 Efficiency improvements have offset the demands of a growing population and have resulted in more flexibility in meeting water demand. In some cases these improvements have also reduced the flexibility to scale back water use in times of drought because some inefficiencies have already been removed from the system. With drought stress projected to increase in many U.S. regions, drought vulnerability is also expected to rise.1\n\nWater sector withdrawals and uses vary significantly by region. There is a notable east-west water use pattern, with the largest regional withdrawals occurring in western states (where the climate is drier) for agricultural irrigation (Figure 3.10a,d). In the east, water withdrawals mainly serve municipal, industrial, and thermoelectric uses (Figure 3.10a,b,c). Irrigation is also dominant along the Mississippi Valley, in Florida, and in southeastern Texas. Groundwater withdrawals are especially intense in parts of the Southwest, Southeast, Northwest, and\nFreshwater Withdrawals by Sector\nFigure 3.9. Total water withdrawals (groundwater and surface water) in the U.S. are dominated by agriculture and energy production, though the primary use of water for thermoelectric production is for cooling, where water is often returned to lakes and rivers after use (return flows). (Data from Kenny et al. 200996)\n\n82\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fU.S. Water Withdrawal Distribution\n\n3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nFigure 3.10. Based on the most recent USGS water withdrawal data (2005). This figure illustrates water withdrawals at the U.S. county level: (a) total withdrawals (surface and groundwater) in thousands of gallons per day per square mile; (b) municipal and industrial (including golf course irrigation) withdrawals as percent of total; (c) irrigation, livestock, and aquaculture withdrawals as percent of total; (d) thermoelectric plant cooling withdrawals as percent of total; (e) counties with large surface water withdrawals; and (f) counties with large groundwater withdrawals. The largest withdrawals occur in the drier western states for crop irrigation. In the east, water withdrawals mainly serve municipal, industrial, and thermoelectric uses. Groundwater withdrawals are intense in parts of the Southwest and Northwest, the Great Plains, Mississippi Valley, Florida and South Georgia, and near the Great Lakes (Figure source: Georgia Water Resources Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology; Data from Kenny et al. 2009;96 USGS 201398).\n\n83\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nGreat Plains, the Mississippi Valley, Florida and South Georgia, and near the Great Lakes (Figure 3.10f). Surface waters are most intensely used in all other U.S. regions.\nPer capita water withdrawal and use are decreasing due to many factors.99 These include demand management, new plumbing codes, water-efficient appliances, efficiency improvement programs, and pricing strategies, especially in the municipal sector.100 Other factors contributing to decreasing per capita water use include changes from water-intensive manufacturing and other heavy industrial activities to serviceoriented businesses,101 and enhanced water-use efficiencies in response to environmental pollution legislation (in the industrial and commercial sector). In addition, replacement of older once-through-cooling electric power plants by plants that recycle their cooling water, and switching from flood irrigation to more efficient methods in the western United States102 have also contributed to these trends.\nNotwithstanding the overall national trends, regional water withdrawal and use are strongly correlated with climate;103 hotter and drier regions tend to have higher per capita usage, and water demand is affected by both temperature and precipitation on a seasonal basis (see also Ch. 28: Adaptation).\nWater demand is projected to increase as population grows, and will increase substantially more in some regions as a result of climate change. In the absence of climate change but in response to a projected population increase of 80% and a 245% increase in total personal income from 2005 to 2060, simulations under the A1B scenario indicate that total water demand in the U.S. would increase by 3%.99 Under these conditions, approximately half of the U.S. regions would experience an overall decrease in water demand, while the other half would experience an increase (Figure 3.11a). If, however, climate change projections based on the A1B emissions scenario (with gradual reductions from current emission trends beginning around mid-century) and three climate models are also factored in, the total water demand is projected to rise by an average of 26% over the same period (Figure 3.11b).99 Under the population increase scenario that also includes climate change, 90% of the country is projected to experience a total demand increase, with decreases projected only in parts of the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast. Compared to an 8% increase in demand under a scenario without climate change, projections under the A2 emissions scenario (which assumes continued increases in global emissions) and three climate models over the 2005 to 2060 period result in a 34% increase in total water demand. By 2090, total water demand is projected to increase by 42% over 2005 levels under the A1B scenario and 82% under the higher A2 emissions scenario.\n\nCrop irrigation and landscape watering needs are directly affected by climate change, especially by projected changes in temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and soil moisture. Consequently, the projected climate change impacts on water demand are larger in the western states, where irrigation dominates total water withdrawals (see Figure 3.10). Uncertainties in the projections of these climate variables also affect water demand projections.99 However, it is clear that the impacts of projected population, socioeconomic, and climate changes amplify the effects on water demand in the Southwest and Southeast, where the observed and projected drying water cycle trends already make these regions particularly vulnerable.\nThis vulnerability will be exacerbated by physical and operational limitations of water storage and distribution systems. River reservoirs and associated dams are usually designed to handle larger-than-historical streamflow variability ranges. Some operating rules and procedures reflect historical seasonal and interannual streamflow and water release patterns, while others include information about current and near-term conditions, such as snowpack depth and expected snowmelt volume. Climate change threatens to alter both the streamflow variability that these structures must accommodate and their opportunities to recover after doing so (due to permanent changes in average streamflow). Thus, as streamflow and demand patterns change, historically based operating rules and procedures could become less effective in balancing water supply with other uses.104\nSome of the highest water demand increases under climate change are projected in U.S. regions where groundwater aquifers are the main water supply source (Figure 3.11b), including the Great Plains and parts of the Southwest and Southeast. The projected water demand increases combined with potentially declining recharge rates (see water cycle section) further challenge the sustainability of the aquifers in these regions.\nPower plant cooling is a critical national water use, because nearly 90% of the U.S. electrical energy is produced by thermoelectric power plants.105 Freshwater withdrawals per kilowatt hour have been falling in recent years due to the gradual replacement of once-through cooling of power plant towers with plants that recycle cooling water. Thermal plant cooling is principally supported by surface water withdrawals (Figure 3.10e,f) and has already been affected by climate change in areas where temperatures are increasing and surface water supplies are diminishing, such as the southern United States. Higher water temperatures affect the efficiency of electric generation and cooling processes. It also limits the ability of utilities to discharge heated water to streams from once-through cooled power systems due to regulatory requirements and concerns about how the release of warmer water into rivers and streams affects ecosystems and biodiversity (see Ch. 4: Energy).106\n\n84\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fProjected Changes in Water Withdrawals\n\n3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nFigure 3.11. The effects of climate change, primarily associated with increasing temperatures and potential evapotranspiration, are projected to significantly increase water demand across most of the United States. Maps show percent change from 2005 to 2060 in projected demand for water assuming (a) change in population and socioeconomic conditions based on the underlying A1B emissions scenario, but with no change in climate, and (b) combined changes in population, socioeconomic conditions, and climate according to the A1B emissions scenario (gradual reductions from current emission trends beginning around mid-century). (Figure source: Brown et al. 201399).\n\nInstream Water Uses\n\nHydropower contributes 7% of electricity generation nation-\nwide, but provides up to 70% in the Northwest and 20% in California, Alaska, and the Northeast.107 Climate change is expect-\n\nthe river ice cover period has been decreasing53 (extending the inland navigation season), seasonal ice cover changes111,112 could impede lock operations.112 Intensified floods are likely to\n\ned to affect hydropower directly through changes in runoff hinder shipping by causing waterway closures and damaging or\n\n(average, extremes, and seasonality), and indirectly through destroying ports and locks.

Sea level rise and more frequent coastal flooding could damage wastewater utility infrastructure and reduce treatment efficiency (Ch. 25: Coasts).121\nChanges in streamflow temperature and flow regimes can affect aquatic ecosystem structure and function (see Ch. 8: Ecosystems). Water temperature directly regulates the physiology, metabolism, and energy of individual aquatic organisms, as well as entire ecosystems. Streamflow quantity influences the extent of available aquatic habitats, and streamflow variability regulates species abundance and persistence. Flow also influences water temperature, sediment, and nutrient concentrations.122 If the rate of climate change123 outpaces plant and animal species' ability to adjust to temperature change,\n\nadditional biodiversity loss may occur. Furthermore, climate change induced water cycle alterations may exacerbate existing ecosystem vulnerability, especially in the western United States124 where droughts and water shortages are likely to increase. But areas projected to receive additional precipitation, such as the northern Great Plains, may benefit. Lastly, hydrologic alterations due to human interventions have without doubt impaired riverine ecosystems in most U.S. regions and globally.125 The projected escalation of water withdrawals and uses (see Figure 3.11) threatens to deepen and widen ecosystem impairment, especially in southern states where climate change induced water cycle alterations are pointing toward drier conditions (see Ch. 8: Ecosystems). In these regions, balancing socioeconomic and environmental objectives will most likely require more deliberate management and institutional responses.\n\nMajor Water Resource Vulnerabilities and Challenges\nMany U.S. regions are expected to face increased drought and flood vulnerabilities and exacerbated water management challenges. This section highlights regions where such issues are expected to be particularly intense.\n\nKey Message 8: Drought is Affecting Water Supplies\n\nChanges in precipitation and runoff, combined with changes in consumption and withdrawal, have reduced surface and groundwater supplies in many areas. These trends are expected\nto continue, increasing the likelihood of water shortages for many uses.\n\nMany southwestern and western watersheds, including the Colorado, Rio Grande,38,43,126 and Sacramento-San Joaquin,127,128 have recently experienced drier conditions. Even\nlarger runoff reductions (about 10% to 20%) are projected over some of these watersheds in the next 50 years.48,129 In-\ncreasing evaporative losses, declining runoff and groundwater\nrecharge, and changing groundwater pumpage are expected to affect surface and groundwater supplies65,66,67,71 and increase\nthe risk of water shortages for many water uses. Changes in\n\nstreamflow timing will exacerbate a growing mismatch be-\ntween supply and demand (because peak flows are occurring\nearlier in the spring, while demand is highest in mid-summer)\nand will present challenges for the management of reservoirs, aquifers, and other water infrastructure.130 Rising stream\ntemperatures and longer low flow periods may make electric\npower plant cooling water withdrawals unreliable, and may\naffect aquatic and riparian ecosystems by degrading habitats and favoring invasive, non-native species.131\n\nKey Message 9: Flood Effects on People and Communities\n\nIncreasing flooding risk affects human safety and health, property, infrastructure, economies, and ecology in many basins across the U.S.\n\nFlooding affects critical water, wastewater, power, transportation, and communications infrastructure in ways that are difficult to foresee and can result in interconnected and cascading failures (see \"Flood Factors and Flood Types\"). Very heavy precipitation events have intensified in recent decades in most U.S. regions, and this trend is projected to continue (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). Increasing heavy precipitation is an important contributing factor, but flood magnitude changes also depend on specific watershed conditions (including soil moisture, impervious area, and other human-caused alterations).\nProjected changes in flood frequency based on climate projections and hydrologic models have recently begun to emerge\n\n(for example, Das et al. 2012;60 Brekke et al. 2009;132 Raff et al. 2009;133 Shaw and Riha 2011;134 Walker et al. 2011135), and suggest that flood frequency and severity increases may occur in the Northeast and Midwest (Ch. 16: Northeast; Ch. 18: Midwest). Flooding and sea water intrusion from sea level rise and increasing storm surge threaten New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Virginia Beach, Wilmington, Charleston, Miami, Tampa, Naples, Mobile, Houston, New Orleans, and many other cities on U.S. coasts (Chapter 25: Coasts).\nThe devastating toll of large floods (human life, property, environment, and infrastructure) suggests that proactive management measures could minimize changing future flood risks and\n\n86\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nconsequences (Ch. 28: Adaptation). In coastal areas, sea level rise may act in parallel with inland climate changes to intensify water-use impacts and challenges (Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples; Ch. 17: Southeast).136 Increasing flooding risk, both coastal and inland, could also exacerbate human health risks associated with failure of critical infrastructure,137,138 and an increase in both waterborne diseases (Ch. 9: Human Health)139 and airborne diseases.140\nChanges in land use, land cover, development, and population distribution can all affect flood frequency and intensity. The nature and extent of these projected changes results in increased uncertainty and decreased accuracy of flood forecasting in both the short term133 and long term.141 This lack of certainty could hinder effective preparedness (such as evacuation planning) and the effectiveness of structural and non-structural flood risk reduction measures. However, many climate change\n\nprojections are robust (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate), and the long lead time needed for the planning, design, and construction of critical infrastructure that provides resilience to floods means that consideration of long-term changes is needed.\nEffective climate change adaptation planning requires an integrated approach45,118,142 that addresses public health and safety issues (Ch. 28: Adaptation).143 Though numerous flood risk reduction measures are possible, including levees, landuse zoning, flood insurance, and restoration of natural floodplain retention capacity,144 economic and institutional conditions may constrain implementation. The effective use of these measures would require significant investment in many cases,145 as well as updating policies and methods to account for climate change42,146 in the planning, design, operation, and maintenance of flood risk reduction infrastructure.132,147\n\nAdaptation and Institutional Responses\n\nKey Message 10: Water Resources Management\n\nIn most U.S. regions, water resources managers and planners will encounter new risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities that may not be properly managed within existing practices.\n\nWater managers and planners strive to balance water supply and demand across all water uses and users. The management process involves complex tradeoffs among water-use benefits, consequences, and risks. By altering water availability and demand, climate change is likely to present additional management challenges. One example is in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, where flooding, sea water intrusion, and changing needs for environmental, municipal, and agricultural water uses have created significant management challenges. This California Bay-Delta experience suggests that managing risks and sharing benefits requires re-assessment of very complex ecosystems, infrastructure systems, water rights, stakeholder preferences, and reservoir operation strategies \u00ad as well as significant investments. All of these considerations are subject to large uncertainties.54,148 To some extent, all U.S. regions are susceptible, but the Southeast and Southwest are highly vulnerable because climate change is projected to reduce water availability, increase demand, and exacerbate shortages (see \"Water Management\").\nRecent assessments illustrate water management challenges facing California,127,129,149,150 the Southwest,130,151 Southeast (Ch.\n\n17: Southeast),136,152 Northwest,153 Great Plains,154 and Great Lakes.155 A number of these assessments demonstrate that while expanding supplies and storage may still be possible in some regions, effective climate adaptation strategies can benefit from innovative management strategies. These strategies can include domestic water conservation programs that use pricing incentives to curb use; more flexible, risk-based, better-informed, and adaptive operating rules for reservoirs; the integrated use of combined surface and groundwater resources; and better monitoring and assessment of statewide water use.129,149,156,157 Water management and planning would benefit from better coordination among public sectors at the national, state, and local levels (including regional partnerships and agreements), and the private sector, with participation of all relevant stakeholders in well-informed, fair, and equitable decision-making processes. Better coordination among hydrologists and atmospheric scientists, and among these scientists and the professional water management community, is also needed to facilitate more effective translation of knowledge from science to practice (Ch. 26: Decision Support; Ch. 28: Adaptation).158\n\n87\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fWater challenges in a southeast river basin\n\n3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nFigure 3.12. The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River Basin supports many water uses and users, including municipal, industrial, and agricultural water supply; flood management; hydroelectric and thermoelectric energy generation; recreation; navigation; fisheries; and a rich diversity of environmental and ecological resources. In recent decades, water demands have risen rapidly in the Upper Chattahoochee River (due to urban growth) and Lower Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers (due to expansion of irrigated agriculture). At the same time, basin precipitation, soil moisture, and runoff are declining, creating challenging water sharing tradeoffs for the basin stakeholders.159 The historical water demand and supply trends are expected to continue in the coming decades. Climate assessments for 50 historical (1960-2009) and future years (2050-2099) based on a scenario of continued increases in emissions (A2) for the Seminole and all other ACF sub-basins152 show that soil moisture is projected to continue to decline in all months, especially during the crop growing season from April to October (bottom right). Mean monthly runoff decreases (up to 20%, not shown) are also projected throughout the year and especially during the wet season from November to May. The projected soil moisture and runoff shifts are even more significant in the extreme values of the respective distributions. In addition to reduced supplies, these projections imply higher water demands in the agricultural and other sectors, exacerbating management challenges. These challenges are reflected in the projected response of Lake Lanier, the main ACF regulation project, the levels of which are projected (for 2050-2099) to be lower, by as much as 15 feet, than its historical (19602009) levels, particularly during droughts (top right). Recognizing these critical management challenges, the ACF stakeholders are earnestly working to develop a sustainable and equitable management plan that balances economic, ecological, and social values.160 (Figure source: Georgia Water Resources Institute, Georgia Institute of Technology.152).\n\n88\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nKey Message 11: Adaptation Opportunities and Challenges\n\nIncreasing resilience and enhancing adaptive capacity provide opportunities to strengthen water resources management and plan for climate change impacts.\nMany institutional, scientific, economic, and political barriers present challenges to implementing adaptive strategies.\n\nClimate adaptation involves both addressing the risks and leveraging the opportunities that may arise as a result of the climate impacts on the water cycle and water resources. Efforts to increase resiliency and enhance adaptive capacity may create opportunities for a wide-ranging public discussion of water demands, improved collaboration around water use, increased public support for scientific and economic information, and the deployment of new technologies supporting adaptation. In addition, adaptation can promote the achievement of multiple water resource objectives through improved infrastructure planning, integrated regulation, and planning and management approaches at regional, watershed, or ecosystem scales. Pursuing these opportunities may require assessing how current institutional approaches support adaptation in light of the anticipated impacts of climate change.161\nClimate change will stress the nation's aging water infrastructure to varying degrees by location and over time. Much of the country's current drainage infrastructure is already overwhelmed during heavy precipitation and high runoff events, an impact that is projected to be exacerbated as a result of climate change, land-use change, and other factors. Large percentage increases in combined sewage overflow volumes, associated with increased intensity of precipitation events, have been projected for selected watersheds by the end of this century in the absence of adaptive measures.106,162 Infrastructure planning, especially for the long planning and operation horizons often associated with water resources infrastructure, can be improved by incorporating climate change as a factor in new design standards and in asset management and rehabilitation of critical and aging facilities, emphasizing flexibility, redundancy, and resiliency.106,132,163\nAdaptation strategies for water infrastructure include structural and non-structural approaches. These may include changes in system operations and/or demand management changes, adopting water conserving plumbing codes, and improving flood forecasts, telecommunications, and early warning systems164 that focus on both adapting physical structures and innovative management.106,132,165 Such strategies could take advantage of conventional (\"gray\") infrastructure upgrades (like raising flood control levees); adjustments to reservoir operating rules; new demand management and incentive strategies; land-use management that enhances adaptive capacity; protection and restoration at the scale of river basins, watersheds, and ecosystems; hybrid strategies that blend \"green\" infrastructure with gray infrastructure; and pricing strategies.1,106,132,166,167 Green infrastructure approaches that are\n\nincreasingly being implemented by municipalities across the country include green roofs, rain gardens, roadside plantings, porous pavement, and rainwater harvesting (Ch. 28: Adaptation). These techniques typically utilize soils and vegetation in the built environment to absorb runoff close to where it falls, limiting flooding and sewer backups.168 There are numerous non-infrastructure related adaptation strategies, some of which could include promoting drought-resistant crops, flood insurance reform, and building densely developed areas away from highly vulnerable areas.\nIn addition to physical adaptation, capacity-building activities can build knowledge and enhance communication and collaboration within and across sectors.1,167,169 In particular, building networks, partnerships, and support systems has been identified as a major asset in building adaptive capacity (Ch. 26: Decision Support; Ch. 28: Adaptation).170\nIn addition to stressing the physical infrastructure of water systems, future impacts of climate change may reveal the weaknesses in existing water law regimes to accommodate novel and dynamic water management conditions. The basic paradigms of environmental and natural resources law are preservation and restoration, both of which are based on the assumption that natural systems fluctuate within an unchanging envelope of variability (\"stationarity\").171 However, climate change is now projected to affect water supplies during the multi-decade lifetime of major water infrastructure projects in wide-ranging and pervasive ways.132 Under these circumstances, stationarity will no longer be reliable as the central assumption in water-resource risk assessment and planning.42,171 For example, in the future, water rights administrators may find it necessary to develop more flexible water rights systems conditioned to address the uncertain impacts of climate change.172 Agencies and courts may seek added flexibility in regulations and laws to achieve the highest and best uses of limited water resources and to enhance water management capacity in the context of new and dynamic conditions.132,173\nIn the past few years, many federal, state, and local agencies and tribal governments have begun to address climate change adaptation, integrating it into existing decision-making, planning, or infrastructure-improvement processes (Ch. 28: Adaptation).43,174 Drinking water utilities are increasingly utilizing climate information to prepare assessments of their supplies,175 and utility associations and alliances, such as the Water Research Foundation and Water Utility Climate Alliance, have undertaken original research to better understand the\n\n89\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fimplications of climate change on behalf of some of the largest municipal water utilities in the United States.119,156,176\nThe economic, social, and environmental implications of climate change induced water cycle changes are very significant, as is the cost of inaction. Adaptation responses need to address considerable uncertainties in the short-, medium-, and longterm; be proactive, integrated, and iterative; and be developed through well-informed stakeholder decision processes functioning within a flexible institutional and legal environment.\n\n3: WATER RESOURCES\n\n90\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES\n\nReferences\n\n1.

These discussions followed a thorough review of the literature, which included an interagency prepared foundational document,1 over 500 technical inputs provided by the public, as well as other published literature. The author team met in Seattle, Washington, in May 2012 for expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors wherein each message was defended before the entire author team before this key message was selected for inclusion in the Chapter. These discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each message, and they were based on criteria that help define \"key vulnerabilities.\" Key messages were further refined following input from the NCADAC report integration team and authors of Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nAnnual precipitation and river-flow increases are observed now in the Midwest and the Northeast regions. Very heavy precipitation events have increased nationally and are projected to increase in all regions. The length of dry spells is projected to increase in most areas, especially the southern and northwestern portions of the contiguous United States.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the inter-agency prepared foundational document,1 Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Ch. 20: Southwest, other technical input reports,2 and over 500 technical inputs on a wide range of topics that were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nNumerous peer-reviewed publications describe precipitation trends (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate)4,7,8,34 and river-flow trends.13,41 As discussed in Chapter 2, the majority of projections available from climate models (for example, Orlowsky and Seneviratne 2012;3 Kharin et al. 20135) indicate small projected changes in total average annual precipitation in many areas, while heavy precipitation6 and the length of dry spells are projected to increase across the entire country. Projected precipitation responses (such as changing extremes) to increasing greenhouse gases are robust in a wide variety of models and depictions of climate.\n\nThe broad observed trends of precipitation and river-flow increases have been identified by many long-term National Weather Service (NWS)/National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) weather monitoring networks, USGS streamflow monitoring networks, and analyses of records therefrom (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate;34,36,37). Ensembles of climate models3,42(see also Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Ch. 20: Southwest) are the basis for the reported projections.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence (cited above) confirmed many of the findings from the 2009 National Climate Assessment.177\nObserved trends: Precipitation trends are generally embedded amidst large year-to-year natural variations and thus trends may be difficult to detect, may differ from site to site, and may be reflections of multi-decadal variations rather than external (human) forcings. Consequently, careful analyses of longest-term records from many stations across the country and addressing multiple potential explanations are required and are cornerstones of the evidentiary studies described above.\nEfforts are underway to continually improve the stability, placement, and numbers of weather observations needed to document trends; scientists also regularly search for other previously unanalyzed data sources for use in testing these findings.\nProjected trends: The complexity of physical processes that result in precipitation and runoff reduces abilities to represent or predict them as accurately as would be desired and with the spatial and temporal resolution required for many applications; however, as noted, the trends at the scale depicted in this message are very robust among a wide variety of climate models and projections, which lends confidence that the projections are appropriate lessons from current climate (and streamflow) models. Nonetheless, other influences not included in the climate change projections might influence future patterns of precipitation and runoff, including changes in land cover, water use (by humans and vegetation), and streamflow management.\nClimate models used to make projections of future trends are continually increasing in number, resolution, and in the number of additional external and internal influences that might be confounding current projections. For example, much more of all three of these\n\n105\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\ndirections for improvement are already evident in projection archives for the next IPCC assessment.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Observed trends have been demonstrated by a broad range of methods over the past 20+ years based on best available data; projected precipitation and river-flow responses to greenhouse gas increases are robust across large majorities of available climate (and hydrologic) models from scientific teams around the world.\nConfidence is therefore judged to be high that annual precipitation and river-flow increases are observed now in the Midwest and the Northeast regions.\nConfidence is high that very heavy precipitation events have increased nationally and are projected to increase in all regions.\nConfidence is high that the length of dry spells is projected to increase in most areas, especially the southern and northwestern portions of the contiguous United States.\nConfidence Level\nVery High Strong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus High\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods\nvary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus Medium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow Inconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\n\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nShort-term (seasonal or shorter) droughts are expected to intensify in most U.S. regions. Longerterm droughts are expected to intensify in large areas of the Southwest, southern Great Plains, and Southeast.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the inter-agency prepared foundational document,1 Ch. 16: Northeast, Ch 17: Southeast, Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Ch. 18: Midwest, Ch. 19: Great Plains, Ch. 20: Southwest, Ch. 21: Northwest, Ch. 23: Hawai`i and Pacific Islands, and over 500 technical inputs on a wide range of topics that were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nProjected drought trends derive directly from climate models in some studies (for example, Hoerling et al. 2012;8 Wehner et al. 2011;30 Gao et al. 2012;32 Gao et al. 2011;33), from hydrologic models responding to projected climate trends in others (for example, Georgakakos and Zhang 2011;38 Cayan et al. 2010;48), from considerations of the interactions between precipitation deficits and either warmer or cooler temperatures in historical (observed) droughts,48 and from combinations of these approaches (for example, Trenberth et al. 200449) in still other studies.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence (cited above) confirmed many of the findings from the 2009 National Climate Assessment.177\nWarmer temperatures are robustly projected by essentially all climate models, with what are generally expected to be directly attendant increases in the potentials for greater evapotranspiration, or ET (although it is possible that current estimates of future ET are overly influenced by temperatures at the expense of other climate variables, like wind speed, humidity, net surface radiation, and soil moisture that might change in ways that could partly ameliorate rising ET demands). As a consequence, there is a widespread expectation that more water from precipitation will be evaporated or transpired in the warmer future, so that except in regions where precipitation increases more than ET increases, less overall water will remain on the landscape and droughts will intensify and become more common. Another widespread expectation is that precipitation variability will increase, which may result in larger swings in moisture availability, with swings towards the deficit side resulting in increased frequencies and intensities of drought conditions on seasonal time scales to times scales of multiple decades. An important remaining uncertainty, discussed in the supporting text for Key Message #1, is the extent to which the types of models used to project future droughts may be influencing results with a notable recent tendency for studies with more complete, more resolved land-surface models, as well as climate models, to yield more moderate projected changes.\n\n106\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\nOther uncertainties derive from the possibility that changes in other variables or influences of CO2-fertilization and/or land cover change may also partly ameliorate drought intensification. Furthermore in many parts of the country, El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (and other oceanic) influences on droughts and floods are large, and can overwhelm climate change effects during the next few decades. At present, however, the future of these oceanic climate influences remains uncertain.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties:\nConfidence is judged to be medium-high that short-term (seasonal or shorter) droughts are expected to intensify in most U.S. regions. Confidence is high that longer-term droughts are expected to intensify in large areas of the Southwest, southern Great Plains, and Southeast.\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence (cited above) confirmed many of the findings from the 2009 National Climate Assessment.177\nLarge uncertainties remain in efforts to detect flood-statistic changes attributable to climate change, because a wide range of local factors (such as dams, land-use changes, river channelization) also affect flood regimes and can mask, or proxy for, climate change induced alterations. Furthermore, it is especially difficult to detect any kinds of trends in what are, by definition, rare and extreme events. Finally, the response of floods to climate changes are expected to be fairly idiosyncratic from basin to basin, because of the strong influences of within-storm variations and local, basin-scale topographic, soil and vegetation, and river network characteristics that influence the size and extent of flooding associated with any given storm or season.54,55,56,57\n\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nFlooding may intensify in many U.S. regions, even in areas where total precipitation is projected to decline.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the inter-agency prepared foundational document,1 Ch. 16: Northeast, Ch 17: Southeast, Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Ch. 18: Midwest, Ch. 19: Great Plains, Ch. 20: Southwest, Ch. 21: Northwest, Ch. 23: Hawai`i and Pacific Islands, and over 500 technical inputs on a wide range of topics that were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nThe principal observational bases for the key message are careful national-scale flood-trend analyses58 based on annual peak-flow records from a selection of 200 USGS streamflow gaging stations measuring flows from catchments that are minimally influenced by upstream water uses, diversions, impoundments, or land-use changes with more than 85 years of records, and analyses of two other subsets of USGS gages with long records (including gages both impacted by human activities and less so), including one analysis of 50 gages nationwide56 and a second analysis of 572 gages in the eastern United States.57 There is some correspondence among regions with significant changes in annual precipitation (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate) and soil moisture (Figures 3.2 and 3.3), and annual flood magnitudes (Figure 3.5).58\nProjections of future flood-frequency changes result from detailed hydrologic models (for example, Das et al. 2012;60 Raff et al. 2009;133Walker et al. 2011135) of rivers that simulate responses to projected precipitation and temperature changes from climate models; such simulations have only recently begun to emerge in the peerreviewed literature.\n\nLarge uncertainties still exist as to how well climate models can represent and project future extremes of precipitation. This has \u00ad until recently \u00ad limited attempts to make specific projections of future flood frequencies by using climate model outputs directly or as direct inputs to hydrologic models. However, precipitation extremes are expected to intensify as the atmosphere warms, and many floods result from larger portions of catchment areas receiving rain as snowlines recede upward. As rain runs off more quickly than snowfall this results in increased flood potential; furthermore, occasional rain-onsnow events exacerbates this effect. This trend is broadly expected to increase in frequency under general warming trends, particularly in mountainous catchments.62 Rising sea levels and projected increase in hurricane-associated storm intensity and rainfall rates provide first-principles bases for expecting intensified flood regimes in coastal settings (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Future changes in flood frequencies and intensities will depend on a complex combination of local to regional climatic influences, and the details of complex surface-hydrologic conditions in each catchment (for example, topography, land cover, and upstream management). Consequently, flood frequency changes may be neither simple nor regionally homogeneous, and basin by basin projections may need to be developed. Early results now appearing in the literature have most often projected intensifications of flood regimes, in large part as responses to projections of more intense storms and increasingly rainy (rather than snowy) storms in previously snow-dominated settings. Confidence in current estimates of future changes in flood frequencies and intensities is overall judged to be low.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nClimate change is expected to affect water demand, groundwater withdrawals, and aquifer recharge, reducing groundwater availability in some areas.\n\n107\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the inter-agency prepared foundational document,1 regional chapters of the NCA, and over 500 technical inputs on a wide range of topics that were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nSeveral recent studies65,66,67,68,71,72 have evaluated the potential impacts of changes in groundwater use and recharge under scenarios including climate change, and generally they have illustrated the common-sense conclusion that changes in pumpage can have immediate and significant effects in the nation's aquifers. This has certainly been the historical experience in most aquifers that have seen significant development; pumpage variations usually tend to yield more immediate and often larger changes on many aquifers than do historical climate variations on time scales from years to decades. Meanwhile, for aquifers in the Southwest, there is a growing literature of geochemical studies that fingerprint various properties of groundwater and that are demonstrating that most western groundwater derives preferentially from snowmelt, rather than rainfall or other sources.50,51,66,74 This finding suggests that much western recharge may be at risk of changes and disruptions from projected losses of snowpack, but as yet provides relatively little indication whether the net effects will be recharge declines, increases, or simply spatial redistribution.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The precise responses of groundwater storage and flow to climate change are not well understood, but recent and ongoing studies provide insights on underlying mechanisms.65,66,67 The observations and modeling evidence to make projections of future responses of groundwater recharge and discharge to climate change are thus far very limited, primarily because of limitations in data availability and in the models themselves. New forms and networks of observations and new modeling approaches and tools are needed to provide projections of the likely influences of climate changes on groundwater recharge and discharge. Despite the uncertainties about the specifics of climate change impacts on groundwater, impacts of reduced groundwater supply and quality would likely be detrimental to the nation.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is judged to be high that climate change is expected to affect water demand, groundwater withdrawals, and aquifer recharge, reducing groundwater availability in some areas.\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nSea level rise, storms and storm surges, and changes in surface and groundwater use patterns are expected to compromise the sustainability of coastal freshwater aquifers and wetlands.\nDescription of evidence base This message has a strong theoretical and observational basis, in-\n\ncluding considerable historical experience with seawater intrusion into many of the nation's coastal aquifers and wetlands under the influence of heavy pumpage, some experience with the influences of droughts and storms on seawater intrusion, and experience with seepage of seawater into shallow coastal aquifers under storm and storm surge conditions that lead to coastal inundations with seawater. The likely influences of sea level rise on seawater intrusion into coastal (and island) aquifers and wetlands are somewhat less certain, as discussed below, although it is projected that sea level rise may increase opportunities for saltwater intrusion (see Ch. 25: Coasts).\nNew information and remaining uncertainties There are few published studies describing the kinds of groundwater quality and flow modeling that are necessary to assess the real-world potentials for sea level rise to affect seawater intrusion.78 Studies in the literature and historical experience demonstrate the detrimental impacts of alterations to the water budgets of the freshwater lenses in coastal aquifers and wetlands around the world (most often by groundwater development), but few evaluate the impacts of sea level rise alone. More studies with real-world aquifer geometries and development regimes are needed to reduce the current uncertainty of the potential interactions of sea level rise and seawater intrusion.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Confidence is high that sea level rise, storms and storm surges, and changes in surface and groundwater use patterns are expected to compromise the sustainability of coastal freshwater aquifers and wetlands.\nKey message #6 Traceable Account\nIncreasing air and water temperatures, more intense precipitation and runoff, and intensifying droughts can decrease river and lake water quality in many ways, including increases in sediment, nitrogen, and other pollutant loads.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the inter-agency prepared foundational document,1 Ch. 8: Ecosystems, Ch. 15: Biogeochemical Cycles, and over 500 technical inputs on a wide range of topics that were reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nThermal stratification of deep lakes and reservoirs has been observed to increase with increased air and water temperatures,1,81,82 and may be eliminated in shallow lakes. Increased stratification reduces mixing, resulting in reduced oxygen in bottom waters. Deeper set-up of vertical thermal stratification in lakes and reservoirs may reduce or eliminate a bottom cold water zone; this, coupled with lower oxygen concentration, results in a degraded aquatic ecosystem.\nMajor precipitation events and resultant water flows increase watershed pollutant scour and thus increase pollutant loads.84 Fluxes of mineral weathering products (for example, calcium, magnesium,\n\n108\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\nsodium, and silicon) have also been shown to increase in response to higher discharge.86 In the Mississippi drainage basin, increased precipitation has resulted in increased nitrogen loads contributing to hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico.85 Models predict and observations confirm that continued warming will have increasingly negative effects on lake water quality and ecosystem health.81\nFuture re-mobilization of sediment stored in large river basins will be influenced by changes in flood frequencies and magnitudes, as well as on vegetation changes in the context of climate and other anthropogenic factors.87 Model projections suggest that changes in sediment delivery will vary regionally and by land-use type, but on average could increase by 25% to 55%.88\nNew information and remaining uncertainties It is unclear whether increasing floods and droughts cancel each other out with respect to long-term pollutant loads.\nIt is also uncertain whether the absolute temperature differential with depth will remain constant, even with overall lake and reservoir water temperature increases. Further, it is uncertain if greater mixing with depth will eliminate thermal stratification in shallow, previously stratified lakes. Although recent studies of Lake Tahoe provide an example of longer stratification seasons,83 lakes in other settings and with other geometries may not exhibit the same response.\nMany factors influence stream water temperature, including air temperature, forest canopy cover, and ratio of baseflow to streamflow.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base, confidence is medium that increasing air and water temperatures, more intense precipitation and runoff, and intensifying droughts can decrease river and lake water quality in many ways, including increases in sediment, nitrogen, and pollutant loads.\nKey message #7 Traceable Account\nClimate change affects water demand and the ways water is used within and across regions and economic sectors. The Southwest, Great Plains, and Southeast are particularly vulnerable to changes in water supply and demand.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the inter-agency prepared foundational document,1 Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Ch. 17: Southeast, Ch. 19: Great Plains, Ch. 20: Southwest, Ch. 23: Hawai`i and Pacific Islands, and many technical inputs on a wide range of topics that were received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nObserved Trends: Historical water withdrawals by sector (for example, municipal, industrial, agricultural, and thermoelectric) have\n\nbeen monitored and documented by USGS for over 40 years and represent a credible database to assess water-use trends, efficiencies, and underlying drivers. Water-use drivers principally include population, personal income, electricity consumption, irrigated area, mean annual temperature, growing season precipitation, and growing season potential evapotranspiration.99 Water-use efficiencies are also affected by many non-climate factors, including demand management, plumbing codes, water efficient appliances, efficiency improvement programs, and pricing strategies;100 changes from water intensive manufacturing and other heavy industrial activities to service-oriented businesses,101 and enhanced water-use efficiencies in response to environmental pollution legislation; replacement of older once-through-cooling electric power plants by plants that recycle their cooling water; and switching from flood irrigation to more efficient methods in the western United States.102\nProjected Trends and Consequences: Future projections have been carried out with and without climate change to first assess the water demand impacts of projected population and socioeconomic increases, and subsequently combine them with climate change induced impacts. The main findings are that in the absence of climate change total water withdrawals in the U.S. will increase by 3% in the coming 50 years,99 with approximately half of the U.S. experiencing a total water demand decrease and half an increase. If, however, climate change projections are also factored in, the demand for total water withdrawals is projected to rise by an average of 26%,99 with more than 90% of the U.S. projected to experience a total demand increase, and decreases projected only in parts of the Midwest, Northeast, and Southeast. When coupled with the observed and projected drying water cycle trends (see key messages in \"Climate Change Impacts on the Water Cycle\" section), the water demand impacts of projected population, socioeconomic, and climate changes intensify and compound in the Southwest and Southeast, rendering these regions particularly vulnerable in the coming decades.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The studies of water demand in response to climate change and other stressors are very recent and constitute new information on their own merit.99 In addition, for the first time, these studies make it possible to piece together the regional implications of climate change induced water cycle alterations in combination with projected changes in water demand. Such integrated assessments also constitute new information and knowledge building.\nDemand projections include various uncertain assumptions which become increasingly important in longer term (multi-decadal) projections. Because irrigation demand is the largest water demand component most sensitive to climate change, the most important climate-related uncertainties are precipitation and potential evapotranspiration over the growing season. Non-climatic uncertainties relate to future population distribution, socioeconomic changes, and water-use efficiency improvements.\n\n109\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Considering that (a) droughts are projected to intensify in large areas of the Southwest, Great Plains, and the Southeast, and (b) that these same regions have experienced and are projected to experience continuing population and demand increases, confidence that these regions will become increasingly vulnerable to climate change is judged to be high.\nKey message #8 Traceable Account\nChanges in precipitation and runoff, combined with changes in consumption and withdrawal, have reduced surface and groundwater supplies in many areas. These trends are expected to continue, increasing the likelihood of water shortages for many uses.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the inter-agency prepared foundational document,1 Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Ch. 17: Southeast, Ch. 19: Great Plains, Ch. 20: Southwest, Ch. 23: Hawai`i and Pacific Islands, and over 500 technical inputs on a wide range of topics that were received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nObserved Trends: Observations suggest that the water cycle in the Southwest, Great Plains, and Southeast has been changing toward drier conditions (Ch. 17: Southeast).130,151,152 Furthermore, paleoclimate tree-ring reconstructions indicate that drought in previous centuries has been more intense and of longer duration than the most extreme drought of the 20th and 21st centuries.40\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The drying climate trend observed in the Southwest and Southeast in the last decades is consistent across all water cycle variables (precipitation, temperature, snow cover, runoff, streamflow, reservoir levels, and soil moisture) and is not debatable. The debate is over whether this trend is part of a multi-decadal climate cycle and whether it will reverse direction at some future time. However, the rate of change and the comparative GCM assessment results with and without historical CO2 forcing (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate) support the view that the observed trends are due to both factors acting concurrently.\nGCMs continue to be uncertain with respect to precipitation, but they are very consistent with respect to temperature. Runoff, streamflow, and soil moisture depend on both variables and are thus less susceptible to GCM precipitation uncertainty. The observed trends and the general GCM agreement that the southern states will continue to experience streamflow and soil moisture reductions34,41 provides confidence that these projections are robust.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is high that changes in precipitation and runoff, combined with changes in consumption and withdrawal, have reduced surface and groundwater supplies in many areas. Confidence is high that these trends are expected to continue, increasing the likelihood of water shortages for many uses.\nKey message #9 Traceable Account\nIncreasing flooding risk affects human safety and health, property, infrastructure, economies, and ecology in many basins across the U.S.\n\nProjected Trends and Consequences: Global Climate Model (GCM) projections indicate that this trend is likely to persist, with runoff reductions (in the range of 10% to 20% over the next 50 years) and intensifying droughts.48\nThe drying water cycle is expected to affect all human and ecological water uses, especially in the Southwest. Decreasing precipitation, rising temperatures, and drying soils are projected to increase irrigation and outdoor watering demand (which account for nearly 90% of consumptive water use) by as much as 34% by 2060 under the A2 emissions scenario.99 Decreasing runoff and groundwater recharge are expected to reduce surface and groundwater supplies,66 increasing the annual risk of water shortages from 25% to 50% by 2060.130 Changes in streamflow timing will increase the mismatch of supply and demand. Earlier and declining streamflow and rising demands will make it more difficult to manage reservoirs, aquifers, and other water infrastructure.130\nSuch impacts and consequences have been identified for several southwestern and western river basins including the Colorado,38 Rio Grande,126 and Sacramento-San Joaquin.127,128,129\n\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the inter-agency prepared foundational document,1 Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Ch. 21: Northwest, Ch. 19: Great Plains, Ch. 18: Midwest, Ch. 16: Northeast, and over 500 technical inputs on a wide range of topics that were received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nObserved Trends: Very heavy precipitation events have intensified in recent decades in most U.S. regions, and this trend is projected to continue (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). Increasing heavy precipitation is an important contributing factor for floods, but flood magnitude changes also depend on specific watershed conditions (including soil moisture, impervious area, and other human-caused alterations). There is, however, some correspondence among regions with significant changes in annual precipitation (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate), soil moisture (Figures 3.2 and 3.3), and annual flood magnitudes (Figure 3.5).58\nFlooding and seawater intrusion from sea level rise and increasing storm surge threaten New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Virginia Beach, Wilmington, Charleston, Miami, Tampa, Naples, Mobile,\n\n110\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\nHouston, New Orleans, and many other coastal cities (Chapter 25: Coasts).\nProjected Trends: Projections of future flood-frequency changes result from detailed hydrologic60,133,135 and hydraulic models of rivers that simulate responses to projected precipitation and temperature changes from climate models.\n\nregimes, in large part as responses to projections of more intense storms and more rainfall runoff from previously snowbound catchments and settings.\nTherefore, confidence is judged to be medium that increasing flooding risk affects human safety and health, property, infrastructure, economies, and ecology in many basins across the U.S.\n\nConsequences: Floods already affect human health and safety and result in substantial economic, ecological, and infrastructure damages. Many cities are located along coasts and, in some of these cities (including New York, Boston, Miami, Savannah, and New Orleans), sea level rise is expected to exacerbate coastal flooding issues by backing up flood flows and impeding flood-management responses (see Ch. 16: Northeast and Ch. 25: Coasts).136\nProjected changes in flood frequency and severity can bring new challenges in flood risk management. For urban areas in particular, flooding impacts critical infrastructure in ways that are difficult to foresee and can result in interconnected and cascading failures (for example, failure of electrical generating lines can cause pump failure, additional flooding, and failure of evacuation services). Increasing likelihood of flooding also brings with it human health risks associated with failure of critical infrastructure (Ch. 11: Urban),137 from waterborne disease that can persist well beyond the occurrence of very heavy precipitation (Ch. 9: Human Health),139 from water outages associated with infrastructure failures that cause decreased sanitary conditions,138 and from ecosystem changes that can affect airborne diseases (Ch. 8: Ecosystems).140\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Large uncertainties still exist as to how well climate models can represent and project future precipitation extremes. However, precipitation extremes are expected to intensify as the atmosphere warms, and many floods result from larger portions of catchment areas receiving rain as snowlines recede upward. As rain runs off more quickly than snowfall, this results in increased flood potential; furthermore occasional rain-on-snow events exacerbate this effect. This trend is broadly expected to increase in frequency under general warming trends, particularly in mountainous catchments.62\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Future changes in flood frequencies and intensities will depend on a complex combination of local to regional climatic influences and on the details of complex surface-hydrologic conditions in each catchment (for example, topography, land cover, and upstream managements). Consequently, flood frequency changes may be neither simple nor regionally homogeneous, and basin by basin projections may need to be developed.

Recent assessments illustrate water management challenges facing California,127,128,129,149 the Southwest,130,151 Southeast (Ch. 17: Southeast),136,152 Northwest,153 Great Plains,154 and Great Lakes.155\nThe Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta is already threatened by flooding, seawater intrusion, and changing needs for environmental, municipal, and agricultural water uses. Managing these risks and uses requires reassessment of a very complex system of water rights, levees, stakeholder consensus processes, reservoir system operations, and significant investments, all of which are subject to large uncertainties.54,148 Given the projected climate changes in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta, adherence to historical management and planning practices may not be a long-term viable option,128,129 but the supporting science is not yet fully actionable,42 and a flexible legal and policy framework embracing change and uncertainty is lacking.\nThe Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River basin in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida supports a wide range of water uses and the regional economy, creating challenging water-sharing tradeoffs for the basin stakeholders. Climate change presents new stresses and uncertainties.152 ACF stakeholders are working to develop a management plan that balances economic, ecological, and social values.160\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Changes in climate, water demand, land use, and demography combine to challenge water management in unprecedented ways. This is happening with a very high degree of certainty in most U.S. regions. Regardless of its underlying causes, climate change poses difficult\n\n111\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f3: WATER RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\nchallenges for water management because it invalidates stationarity \u00ad the perception that climate varies around a predictable mean based on the experience of the last century \u00ad and increases hydrologic variability and uncertainty. These conditions suggest that past management practices will become increasingly ineffective and that water management can benefit by the adoption of iterative, risk-based, and adaptive approaches.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence The water resources literature is unanimous that water management should rely less on historical practices and responses and more on robust, risk-based, and adaptive decision approaches.\n\nland-use and watershed management, and use of \"green\" infrastructure.1,106,132,166,167\nBuilding adaptive capacity ultimately increases the ability to develop and implement adaptation strategies and is considered a no-regrets strategy.1,169 Building networks, partnerships, and support systems has been identified as a major asset in building adaptive capacity (Ch. 26: Decision Support; Ch. 28: Adaptation).170\nWater utility associations have undertaken original research to better understand the implications of climate change on behalf of some of the largest municipal water utilities in the United States.119,156,176\n\nTherefore confidence is very high that in most U.S. regions, water resources managers and planners will face new risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities that may not be properly managed with existing practices.\nKey message #11 Traceable Account\nIncreasing resilience and enhancing adaptive capacity provide opportunities to strengthen water resources management and plan for climate change impacts.

Extreme weather events are affecting energy production and delivery facilities, causing supply disruptions of varying lengths and magnitudes and affecting other infrastructure that depends on energy supply. The frequency and intensity of certain types of extreme weather events are expected to change.\n2. Higher summer temperatures will increase electricity use, causing higher summer peak loads, while warmer winters will decrease energy demands for heating. Net electricity use is projected to increase.\n3. Changes in water availability, both episodic and long-lasting, will constrain different forms of energy production.\n4. In the longer term, sea level rise, extreme storm surge events, and high tides will affect coastal facilities and infrastructure on which many energy systems, markets, and consumers depend.\n5. As new investments in energy technologies occur, future energy systems will differ from today's in uncertain ways. Depending on the character of changes in the energy mix, climate change will introduce new risks as well as opportunities.\n\nThe U.S. energy supply system is diverse and robust in its ability to provide a secure supply of energy with only occasional interruptions. However, projected impacts of climate change will increase energy use in the summer and pose additional risks to reliable energy supply. Extreme weather events and water shortages are already interrupting energy supply, and impacts are expected to increase in the future. Most vulnerabilities and risks to energy supply and use are unique to local situations; others are national in scope.\nIn addition to being vulnerable to the effects of climate change, electricity generation is a major source of the heat-trapping\n\ngases that contribute to climate change. Therefore, regulatory or policy efforts aimed at reducing emissions would also affect the energy supply system. See Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land, Key Message 2; and Ch. 27: Mitigation for more on this topic. This chapter focuses on impacts of climate change to the energy sector.\nThe impacts of climate change in other countries will also affect U.S. energy systems through global and regional crossborder markets and policies. Increased energy demand within global markets due to industrialization, population growth, and other factors will influence U.S. energy costs through competition for imported and exported energy products. The physical impacts of climate change on future energy systems in the 25- to 100-year timeframe will depend on how those energy systems evolve. That evolution will be driven by multiple factors, including technology innovations and carbon emission constraints.\n\nEnergy infrastructure around the country has been compromised by extreme weather events.\n\n\u00a9Gene Blevins\n\nAdaptation actions can allow energy infrastructure to adjust more readily to climate change. Many investments toward adaptation provide short-term benefits because they address current vulnerabilities as well as future risks, and thus entail \"no regrets.\" Such actions can include a focus on increased efficiency of energy use as well as improvements in the reliability of production and transmission of energy. The general concept of adaptation is presented in Chapter 28: Adaptation.\n\n114\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f4: ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE\n\nKey Message 1: Disruptions from Extreme Weather\n\nExtreme weather events are affecting energy production and delivery facilities, causing supply disruptions of varying lengths and magnitudes and affecting other infrastructure\nthat depends on energy supply.

A substantial portion of U.S. energy facilities is located on the Gulf Coast as well as offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, where they are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes and other storms and sea level rise. (Figure source: U.S. Government Accountability Office 2006).\n\nVarious aspects of climate change will affect and disrupt energy distribution and energy production systems. It is projected that wildfires will affect extensive portions of California's electricity transmission grid.10 Extreme storm surge events at high tides are expected to increase,11 raising the risk of inundating energy facilities such as power plants, refineries, pipelines, and transmission and distribution networks. Rail transportation lines that carry coal to power plants, which produced 42% of U.S. electricity in 2011, often follow riverbeds. More intense rainstorms can lead to river flooding that degrades or washes out nearby railroads and roadbeds, and increases in rainstorm intensity have been observed and are projected to continue.\n\n115\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f4: ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE\n\nBy learning from previous events, offshore operations can be\nmade more resilient to the impacts of hurricanes. During Hur-\nricane Isaac in August 2012, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and En-\nvironmental Enforcement reported that oil and gas production was safely shut down and restarted within days of the event.12\n\nThe geographical diversification of energy sources away from hurricane-prone areas such as the Gulf of Mexico has reduced vulnerability to hurricanes. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that the percentage of natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico shifted from 20% in 2005 to 7% in 2012.13 This is due to the development of shale gas production in other parts of the United States.\n\nKey Message 2: Climate Change and Seasonal Energy Demands\n\nHigher summer temperatures will increase electricity use, causing higher summer peak loads, while warmer winters will decrease energy demands for heating. Net electricity use is projected to increase.\n\nOver the last 20 years, annual average temperatures typically have been higher than the long-term average; nationally, temperatures were above average during 12 of the last 14 summers (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).2 These increased temperatures are already affecting the demand for energy needed to cool buildings in the United States.\nAverage temperatures have increased in recent decades. In response, the Energy Information Administration began using 10-year average weather data instead of 30-year average weather data in order to estimate energy demands for heating and cooling purposes. The shorter period is more consistent with the observed trend of warmer winters and summers,14 but is still not necessarily optimal for anticipating near-term temperatures.17\n\nconditions, energy prices, consumer behavior, conservation programs, and changes in energy-using equipment), increases in temperature will result in increased energy use for cooling and decreased energy use for heating. These impacts differ among regions of the country and indicate a shift from predominantly heating to predominantly cooling in some regions with moderate climates. For example, in the Northwest, energy demand for cooling is projected to increase over the next century due to population growth, increased cooling degree days, and increased use of air conditioners as people adapt to higher temperatures.19 Population growth is also expected to increase energy demand for heating. However, the projected increase in energy demand for heating is about half as much when the effects of a warming climate are considered along with population growth.19\n\nWhile recognizing that many factors besides climate change af- Demands for electricity for cooling are expected to increase\n\nfect energy demand (including population changes, economic in every U.S. region as a result of increases in average tem-\n\nperatures and high temperature extremes.\nIncrease in Cooling Demand and Decrease in Heating Demand The electrical grid handles virtually the en-\n\ntire cooling load, while the heating load is\n\ndistributed among electricity, natural gas,\n\nheating oil, passive solar, and biofuel. In\n\norder to meet increased demands for peak\n\nelectricity, additional generation and distri-\n\nbution facilities will be needed, or demand\n\nwill have to be managed through a variety\n\nof mechanisms. Electricity at peak demand\n\ntypically is more expensive to supply than at average demand.21 Because the balance\n\nbetween heating and cooling differs by lo-\n\ncation, the balance of energy use among\n\ndelivery forms and fuel types will likely\n\nFigure 4.2. The amount of energy needed to cool (or warm) buildings is proportional to cooling (or heating) degree days. The figure shows increases in population-weighted cooling degree days, which result in increased air conditioning use, and decreases in population-weighted heating degree days, meaning less energy required to heat buildings in winter, compared to the average for 1970-2000. Cooling degree days are defined as the number of degrees that a day's average temperature is above 65\u00baF, while heating degree days are the number of degrees a day's average temperature\n\nshift from natural gas and fuel oil used for heating to electricity used for air conditioning. In hotter conditions, more fuel and energy are required to generate and deliver electricity, so increases in air conditioning use and shifts from heating to cooling in re-\n\nis below 65\u00baF. As shown, the increase in cooling needs is greater than the decrease gions with moderate climates will increase\n\nin heating needs (Data from NOAA NCDC 201216).\n\nprimary energy demands.4\n\n116\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f4: ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE\n\nIncrease in Numbers of Cooling Degree Days\n\nClimate-related temperature shifts are expected to cause a net increase in residential electricity use.21,22 Increased electricity demands for cooling will exceed electricity savings resulting from lower energy demands for heating. One study examining state-level energy consumption, weather data, and high emission scenarios (A2 and A1FI; Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement) found a net increase of 11% in residential energy demand.23 Another study reported annual increases in net energy expenditures for cooling and heating of about 10% ($26 billion in 1990 U.S. dollars) by the end of this century for 4.5\u00b0F of warming, and 22% ($57 billion in 1990 dollars) for overall warming of about 9\u00b0F.24 New energy-efficient technology could help to offset growth in demand.\n\nFigure 4.3. These maps show projected average changes in cooling degree days for two future time periods: 2021-2050 and 2070-2099 (as compared to the period 1971-2000). The top panel assumes climate change associated with continued increases in emissions of heat-trapping gases (A2), while the bottom panel assumes significant reductions (B1). The projections show significant regional variations, with the greatest increases in the southern United States by the end of this century under the higher emissions scenario. Furthermore, population projections suggest continued shifts toward areas that require air conditioning in the summer, thereby increasing the impact of temperature changes on increased energy demand.18 (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nTable 4.1. Hotter and longer summers will increase the amount of electricity necessary to run air conditioning, especially in the Southeast and Southwest. Warmer winters will decrease the amount of natural gas required to\nheat buildings, especially in the Northeast, Midwest, and Northwest.

Under these circumstances, electricity would displace direct use of fossil fuels for some applications, such as heating, to reduce overall emissions of heattrapping gases.25,26 The implications for peak electricity demand could be significant. In California, for example, the estimated increase in use of electricity for space heating would shift the peak in electricity demand from summer to winter.27 In addition, the fact that electricity from wind and solar is highly variable and may not be available when needed has the potential to decrease the reliability of the electricity system. However, some initial studies suggest that a well-designed electricity system with high penetration of renewable sources of energy should not decrease reliability (for example, Hand et al. 201228).\n\n117\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f4: ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE\n\nKey Message 3: Implications of Less Water for Energy Production\n\nChanges in water availability, both episodic and long-lasting, will constrain different forms of energy production.\n\nProducing energy from fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), nuclear power, biofuels, hydropower, and some solar power systems often requires adequate and sustainable supplies of water. Issues relatableted to water, including availability and restrictions on the temperature of cooling water returned to streams, already pose challenges to production from existing power plants and the ability to obtain permits to build new facilities (Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land).21,29,30\n\nproduction at existing facilities and permitting of new power plants. Increases in water temperatures may reduce the efficiency of thermal power plant cooling technologies, potentially leading to warmer water discharge from some power plants, which in turn can affect aquatic life. Studies conducted during 2012 indicate that there is an increasing likelihood of water shortages limiting power plant electricity production in many regions.21,33\n\nIn the future, long-term precipitation changes, drought, and Hydropower plants in the western United States depend\n\nreduced snowpack are projected to alter water availability on the seasonal cycle of snowmelt to provide steady output\n\n(Ch. 3: Water).

Climate change affects precipitation patterns as well as temperature patterns. The maps show projected changes in average precipitation by season for 2041\u00ad2070 compared to 1971\u00ad1999, assuming emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to rise (A2 scenario). Note significantly drier conditions in the Southwest in spring and Northwest in summer, as well as significantly more precipitation (some of which could fall as snow) projected for northern areas in winter and spring. Hatched areas indicate that the projected changes are significant and consistent among models. White areas indicate that the changes are not projected to be larger than could be expected from natural variability. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n118\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f4: ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE\n\nThe Electric Power Research Institute's (EPRI) scenario-based technical projections of water demand in 2030 find that onequarter of existing power generation facilities (about 240,000 megawatts) nationwide are in counties that face some type\n\nof water sustainability issue.34 Many regions face water sus-\ntainability concerns, with the most significant water-related\nstresses in the Southeast, Southwest, and Great Plains regions (Ch. 3: Water).34\n\nKey Message 4: Sea Level Rise and Infrastructure Damage\n\nIn the longer term, sea level rise, extreme storm surge events, and high tides will affect coastal facilities and infrastructure on which many energy systems, markets, and consumers depend.\n\nSignificant portions of the nation's energy production and delivery infrastructure are in lowlying coastal areas; these facilities include oil and natural gas production and delivery facilities, refineries, power plants, and transmission lines.\n\nCalifornia Power Plants Potentially at Risk from Sea Level Rise\n\nGlobal sea level has risen by about 8 inches since reliable record keeping began in 1880, affecting countries throughout the world, including the United States. The rate of rise increased in recent decades and is not expected to slow. Global average sea level is projected to rise 1 to 4 feet by 2100 and is expected to continue to rise well beyond this century (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). Sea level change at any particular location can deviate substantially from this global average (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).35\n\nRising sea levels, combined with normal and potentially more intense coastal storms, an increase in very heavy precipitation events, and local land subsidence, threaten coastal energy equipment as a result of inundation, flooding, and erosion. This can be compounded in areas that are projected to receive more precipitation. In particular, sea level rise and coastal storms pose a danger to the dense network of Outer Continental Shelf marine and coastal facilities in the central Gulf Coast region.36 Many of California's power plants are at risk from rising sea levels, which result in more extensive coastal storm flooding, especially in the low-lying San Francisco Bay area (Figure 4.5). Power plants and energy infrastructure in coastal areas throughout the United States face similar risks.\n\nFigure 4.5. Rising sea levels will combine with storm surges and high tides to threaten power-generating facilities located in California coastal communities and around the San Francisco Bay. Sea level rise and more intense heavy precipitation events increase the risk of coastal flooding and damages to infrastructure (Ch. 3: Water). (Figure source: Sathaye et al. 201137).\n\n119\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f4: ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE\n\nKey Message 5: Future Energy Systems\n\nAs new investments in energy technologies occur, future energy systems will differ from today's in uncertain ways. Depending on the character of changes in the energy mix, climate change will introduce new risks as well as opportunities.\n\nCountless aspects of the U.S. economy today are supported by reliable, affordable, and accessible energy supplies. Electricity and other forms of energy are necessary for telecommunications, water and sewer systems, banking, public safety, and more. Today's energy systems vary significantly by region, however, with differences in climate-related impacts also introducing considerable variation by locale. Table 4.3 shows projected impacts of climate change on, and potential risks to, energy systems as they currently exist in different regions. Most vulnerabilities and risks for energy supply and use are unique to local situations, but others are national in scope. For example, biofuels production in three regions (Midwest, Great Plains, and Southwest) could be affected by the projected decrease in precipitation during the critical growing season in the summer months (Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land; Ch. 7: Forests).\n\ncharacter of energy systems contributes another layer of complexity to understanding how climate change will affect energy systems.\nAs they consider actions to enhance the resiliency of energy systems, decision-makers confront issues with current energy systems as well as possible future configurations. The systems will evolve and will be more resilient over time if actions tied to features of today's systems do not make future systems less resilient as a result. For example, if moving toward biomass as an energy source involves more water-consumptive energy supplies that could be constrained by drier future climate conditions, then decisions about energy choices should be made with consideration of potential changes in climate conditions and the risks these changes present (See Ch. 26: Decision Support).\n\nOne certainty about future energy systems is that they will be different than today's, but in ways not yet known. Many uncertainties \u00ad financial, economic, regulatory, technological, and so on \u00ad will affect private and public consumption and investment decisions on energy fuels, infrastructure, and systems. Energy systems will evolve over time, depending upon myriad choices made by countless decision-makers responding to changing conditions in markets, technologies, policies, consumer preferences, and climate. A key challenge to understanding the nature and intensity of climate change impacts on future energy systems is the amount of uncertainty regarding future choices about energy technologies and their deployment. An evolving energy system is also an opportunity to develop an energy system that is more resilient and less vulnerable to climate change.\nVery different future energy supply portfolios are possible depending upon key economic assumptions, including what climate legislation may look like,14,25,34 and whether significant changes in consumption patterns occur for a variety of other reasons. Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, hydropower, biofuels, and geothermal are meeting a growing portion of U.S. demand, and there is the opportunity for this contribution to increase in the future (Ch. 6: Agriculture; Ch. 7: Forests). This fundamental uncertainty about the evolving\n\nBecause energy systems in the United States are not centrally planned, they tend to reflect energy decisions shaped by law, regulation, other policies, and economic, technological, and other factors in markets. Trends in use patterns may continue into the future; this is an opportunity to increase resilience but also a major uncertainty for energy utilities and policy makers. Energy infrastructure tends to be long-lived, so resiliency can be enhanced by more deliberate applications of risk-management techniques and information about anticipated climate impacts and trends.38\nFor example, risk-management approaches informed by evolving climate conditions could be used to project the value of research and development on, or investments in, construction of dikes and barriers for coastal facilities or for dry-cooling technologies for power plants in regions where water is already in short supply. Solar and wind electricity generation facilities could be sited in areas that are initially more expensive (such as offshore areas) but less subject to large reductions in power plant output resulting from climatic changes. Targets for installed reserve margins for electric generating capacity and capacity of power lines can be established using certain temperature expectations, but adjusted as conditions unfold over time.\n\n120\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f4: ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE\n\nA range of climate change impacts will affect future energy production. This table shows possible ways to anticipate and respond to these changes. Innovations in technologies may provide additional opportunities and benefits to these and other adaptation actions. Behavioral change by consumers can also promote resiliency.\n\nTable 4.2 summarizes actions that can be taken to increase the ease with which energy systems can adjust to climate change. Many of these adaptation investments entail \"no regrets\" actions, providing short-term benefits because they address current vulnerabilities\nas well as future risks.\n\nPossible Climate Resilience and Adaptation Actions in Energy Sector\n\nKey Challenges Addressed\n\nPossible Actions\n\nExtreme Weather Events\n\nIncrease in Peak Energy Loads\n\nSupply: System and Operational Planning\n\nDiversifying supply chains\n\nX\n\nX\n\nStrengthening and coordinating emergency response plans\n\nX\n\nX\n\nProviding remote/protected emergency-response coordination centers\n\nX\n\nDeveloping flood-management plans or improving stormwater management\n\nX\n\nDeveloping drought-management plans for reduced cooling flows\n\nDeveloping hydropower management plans/policies addressing extremes\n\nSupply: Existing Equipment Modifications\n\nHardening/building redundancy into facilities\n\nX\n\nX\n\nElevating water-sensitive equipment or redesigning elevation of intake structures\n\nX\n\nBuilding coastal barriers, dikes, or levees\n\nX\n\nImproving reliability of grid systems through back-up power supply, intelligent controls, and distributed generation\n\nX\n\nX\n\nInsulating equipment for temperature extremes\n\nX\n\nReferences to technical studies with case studies on many of these topics may be found in Wilbanks et al. 2012.4\n\nImplementing dry (air-cooled) or low-water hybrid (or recirculating) cooling systems for power plants\n\nAdding technologies/systems to pre-cool water discharges\n\nUsing non-fresh water supplies: municipal effluent, brackish or seawater\n\nRelocating vulnerable facilities\n\nX\n\nSupply: New Equipment\n\nAdding peak generation, power storage capacity, and distributed generation\n\nX\n\nX\n\nAdding back-up power supply for grid interruptions\n\nX\n\nX\n\nIncreasing transmission capacity within and between regions\n\nX\n\nX\n\nUse: Reduce Energy Demand\n\nImproving building energy, cooling-system and manufacturing efficiencies, and demand-response capabilities (for example, smart grid)\n\nX\n\nX\n\nSetting higher ambient temperatures in buildings\n\nX\n\nX\n\nImproving irrigation and water distribution/reuse efficiency\n\nX\n\nAllowing flexible work schedules to transfer energy use to off-peak hours\n\nX\n\nWater Constraints on Energy Production\nX X\nX X\nX\nX X X X X X X\nX\n\nSea Level Rise\nX X\nX X\nX X X\n\n121\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f4: ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE\n\nTable 4.3.

Early in the development of key messages and a chapter outline, the authors reviewed all of the four dozen relevant technical input reports that were received in response to the Federal Register solicitation for public input. Selected authors participated in a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored workshop on Energy Supply and Use, December 29-30, 2011, in Washington, D.C. The workshop was organized specifically to inform a DOE technical input report and this National Climate Assessment and to engage stakeholders in this process. The authors selected key messages based on the risk and likelihood of impacts, associated consequences, and available evidence. Relevance to decision support within the energy sector was also an important criterion.\nThe U.S. maintains extensive data on energy supply and use. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of Energy is a primary organization in this activity, and data with quality control, quality assurance, and expert review are available through EIA Web pages (for example, EIA 2012, EIA 201339).\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nExtreme weather events are affecting energy production and delivery facilities, causing supply disruptions of varying lengths and magnitudes and affecting other infrastructure that depends on energy supply. The frequency and intensity of certain types of extreme weather events are expected to change.\nDescription of evidence base A series of NCA workshops reviewed potential influences of climate change thus far on the frequency and intensity of certain types of extreme events.3 Numerous past extreme events demonstrate damage to energy facilities and infrastructure. Data assembled and reviewed by the Federal Government summarize typical costs associated with damage to energy facilities by extreme events.5 State and regional reports as well as data provided by public utilities document specific examples.4,9,10,26\n\nDamage to Gulf Coast energy facilities and infrastructure by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 provides excellent examples to support this key message.8,9 Wildfire also damages transmission grids.10\nThe authors benefited from Agency-sponsored technical input reports summarizing relevant data and information on energy supply and use as well as urban systems and infrastructure.4,21,25 A number of other technical input reports were relevant as well. These were reviewed carefully, particularly with regard to the identification of key messages.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The information provided through a series of NCA workshops provided new (and current) evidence for influences of climate change on the frequency and intensity of extreme events. The summaries from those workshops provide succinct evidence that certain extreme events that damage energy facilities and infrastructure can be expected to increase in number and intensity with climate change (for example, Peterson et al. 20123). Documentation of damage to energy facilities and infrastructure continues to accumulate, increasing confidence in this key message.5,14\nThe regional and local character of extreme events varies substantially, and this variability is a source of significant uncertainty regarding the impacts of climate change and consequences in terms of damage to energy facilities by extreme events. Additionally, damage to energy infrastructure in a specific location can have far-reaching consequences for energy production and distribution, and synthesis of such indirect consequences for production and distribution does not yet support detailed projections.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence High. There is high consensus with moderate evidence that extreme weather events associated with climate change will increase disruptions of energy infrastructure and services in some locations.\n\n127\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f4: ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE Traceable Accounts\n\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.),\nhigh consensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium\nconsensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing\nschools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nHigher summer temperatures will increase electricity use, causing higher summer peak loads, while warmer winters will decrease energy demands for heating. Net electricity use is projected to increase.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the energy supply and use technical input.4 Global climate models simulate increases in summer temperatures, and the NCA climate scenarios2,20 describe this aspect of climate change projections for use in preparing this report (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). Data used by Kunkel et al.2 and Census Bureau population data, synthesized by the EIA,15 were the basis for calculating population-weighted heating and cooling degreedays over the historic period as well as projections assuming SRES B1 and A2 scenarios.\nThe NCA climate scenarios2 project an increase in the number of cooling days and decrease in heating days, with peak electricity demand in some regions shifting from winter to summer27 and shifting to electricity needs for cooling instead of fossil fuels for heating.25,26,27\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties While there is little uncertainty that peak electricity demands will increase with warming by climate change, substantial regional variability is expected. Climate change projections do not provide sufficient spatial and temporal detail to fully analyze these consequences. Socioeconomic factors including population changes, economic conditions, and energy prices, as well as technological developments in electricity generation and industrial equipment, will have a strong bearing on electricity demands, specific to each region of the country.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence High.Assuming specific climate change scenarios, the consequences for heating and cooling buildings are reasonably predictable, especially for the residential sector. With a shift to higher summer demands for electricity, peak demands for electricity can be confidently expected to increase.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nChanges in water availability, both episodic and long-lasting, will constrain different forms of energy production.\nDescription of evidence base Climate scenarios prepared for the NCA2 describe decreases in precipitation under the SRES A2 scenario, with the largest decreases across the Northwest and Southwest in the spring and summer.\nTechnical input reports (for example, Wilbanks et al.4,21) summarize data and studies show that changes in water availability will affect energy production,33 and more specifically, that water shortages will constrain electricity production (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).29,32 The impacts of drought in Texas during 2011 are an example of the consequences of water shortages for energy production as well as other uses (Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land). Electric utility industry reports document potential consequences for operation of generating facilities.34 A number of power plants across the country have experienced interruptions due to water shortages.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties An increasing number of documented incidents of interruptions in energy production due to water shortages provide strong evidence that decreased precipitation or drought will have consequences for energy production.21\nThere is little uncertainty that water shortages due to climate change will affect energy production. But uncertainty about changes in precipitation and moisture regimes simulated by global climate models is significantly higher than for simulated warming. Additionally, climate change simulations lack the spatial and temporal detail required to analyze the consequences for water availability at finer scales (for example, local and regional). Finer-\n\n128\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f4: ENERGY SUPPLY AND USE Traceable Accounts\n\nscale projections would be relevant to decisions about changes in energy facilities to reduce risk or adapt to water shortages associated with climate change.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence High. The evidence is compelling that insufficient water availability with climate change will affect energy production; however, simulations of climate change lack the detail needed to provide more specific information for decision support.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nIn the longer term, sea level rise, extreme storm surge events, and high tides will affect coastal facilities and infrastructure on which many energy systems, markets, and consumers depend.\nDescription of evidence base The sea level change scenario report prepared for the NCA (see also Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate)35 provides further information about sea level change. Extreme surge events at high tides are expected to increase,11 raising the risk of inundating energy facilities such as power plants, refineries, pipelines, and transmission and distribution networks (for example, Sathaye et al. 201310) Data available through the EIA (for example, EIA 201015 provide highquality information about the locations and distribution of energy facilities.\n\nDescription of evidence base A number of studies describe U.S. energy system configurations in terms of supply and use assuming different scenarios of climate change, including SRES B1 and A2.14,25,34 A technical input report to the NCA by DOE4,21 provides details and updates earlier studies. The potential role of biofuels is described within chapters 6 and 7 of this report (Ch. 6: Agriculture; Ch. 7: Forests).\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Understanding of options for future energy supply and use within the U.S. improves, as the EIA and other organizations update data and information about U.S. energy systems as well as projections of the mix of primary energy under various assumptions about demographic, economic, and other factors. With additional data and better models, alternative energy mixes can be explored with respect to climate change adaptation and mitigation. But numerous factors that are very difficult to predict \u00ad financial, economic, regulatory, technological \u00ad affect the deployment of actual facilities and infrastructure.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence High. Given the evidence about climate change impacts and remaining uncertainties associated with the future configuration of energy systems and infrastructure, there is high confidence that U.S. energy systems will evolve in ways that affect risk with respect to climate change and options for adaptation or mitigation.\n\nA substantial portion of the nation's energy facilities and infra-\nstructure are located along coasts or offshore, and sea level rise\nwill affect these facilities (Ch. 25: Coasts; Ch. 17: Southeast; Ch. 5: Transportation).4,10,21,36\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Projections of sea level change are relatively uncertain compared to other aspects of climate change. More importantly, there will be substantial regional and local variability in sea level change, and facilities in locations exposed to more frequent and intense extreme wind and precipitation events will be at higher risk. Data and analyses to understand regional and local sea level change are improving, but substantial uncertainty remains and decision support for adaptation is challenged by these limitations.\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence High. There is high confidence that increases in global mean sea level, extreme surge events, and high tides will affect coastal energy facilities; however, regional and local details are less certain.\n\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nAs new investments in energy technologies occur, future energy systems will differ from today's in uncertain ways. Depending on the character of changes in the energy mix, climate change will introduce new risks as well as opportunities.\n\n129\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 5 TRANSPORTATION\nConvening Lead Authors\nHenry G.

The impacts from sea level rise and storm surge, extreme weather events, higher temperatures and heat waves, precipitation changes, Arctic warming, and other climatic conditions are  affecting the reliability and capacity of the U.S. transportation system in many ways.\n2. Sea level rise, coupled with storm surge, will continue to increase the risk of major coastal impacts on transportation infrastructure, including both temporary and permanent flooding of airports, ports and harbors, roads, rail lines, tunnels, and bridges.\n3. Extreme weather events currently disrupt transportation networks in all areas of the country; projections indicate that such disruptions will increase.\n4. Climate change impacts will increase the total costs to the nation's transportation systems and their users, but these impacts can be reduced through rerouting, mode change, and a wide range of adaptive actions.\n\nThe U.S. economy depends on the personal and freight mobility provided by the country's transportation system. Essential products and services like energy, food, manufacturing, and trade all depend in interrelated ways on the reliable functioning of these transportation components. Disruptions to transportation systems, therefore, can cause large economic and personal losses.1 The national transportation system is composed of four main components that are increasingly vulnerable to climate change impacts:\n\u00b7 fixed node infrastructure, such as ports, airports, and rail terminals;\n\u00b7 fixed route infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, pedestrian/bicycle trails and lanes, locks, canals/channels, light rail, subways, freight and commuter railways, and pipelines, with mixed public and private ownership and management;\n\u00b7 vehicles, such as cars, transit buses, and trucks; transit and railcars and locomotives; ships and barges; and aircraft \u00ad many privately owned; and\n\u00b7 the people, institutions, laws, policies, and information systems that convert infrastructure and vehicles into working transportation networks.\nBesides being affected by climate changes, transportation systems also contribute to changes in the climate through emissions. In 2010, the U.S. transportation sector accounted for 27% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, with cars and trucks accounting for 65% of that total.2 Petroleum accounts for 93% of the nation's transportation energy use.2 This means that policies and behavioral changes aimed at reducing green-\n\nhouse gas emissions will have significant implications for the various components of the transportation sector.\nWeather events influence the daily and seasonal operation of transport systems.3,4,5 Transportation systems are already experiencing costly climate change related impacts. Many inland states \u00ad for example, Vermont, Tennessee, Iowa, and Missouri \u00ad have experienced severe precipitation events, hail, and flooding during the past three years, damaging roads, bridges, and rail systems and the vehicles that use them. Over the coming decades, all regions and modes of transportation will be affected by increasing temperatures, more extreme weather events, and changes in precipitation. Concentrated transportation impacts are likely in Alaska and along seacoasts.\nClimate trends affect the design of transport infrastructure, which is expensive and designed for long life (typically 50 to 100 years). The estimated value of U.S. transportation facilities in 2010 was $4.1 trillion.6 As climatic conditions shift, portions of this infrastructure will increasingly be subject to climatic stresses that will reduce the reliability and capacity of transportation systems.7 Transportation systems are also vulnerable to interruptions in fuel and elec-\n\n\u00a9Tom Mihalek/Reuters/Corbis\n\n131\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f5: TRANSPORTATION\n\ntricity supply, as well as communications disruptions \u00ad which are also subject to climatic stresses.7,8 For example, power outages resulting from Hurricane Katrina shut down three major petroleum pipelines for two days, and the systems operated at reduced capacities for two weeks.9\nClimate change will affect transportation systems directly, through infrastructure damage, and indirectly, through changes in trade flows, agriculture, energy use, and settlement patterns. If, for instance, corn cultivation shifts northward in response to rising temperatures, U.S. agricultural products may flow to markets from different origins by different routes.10 If policy measures and technological changes reduce greenhouse gas emissions by affecting fuel types, there will likely be significant impacts on the transportation of energy supplies (such as pipelines and coal trains) and on the cost of transportation to freight and passenger users.11\nShifts in demographic trends, land-use patterns, and advances in transportation technology over the next few decades will have profound impacts on how the nation's transportation system functions, its design, and its spatial extent. As transportation officials shape the future transportation system to address\n\nnew demands, future climate conditions should be considered as part of the planning and decision-making process.\nDisruptions to transportation system capacity and reliability can be partially offset by adaptations. Transportation systems as networks may use alternative routes around damaged elements or shift traffic to undamaged modes. Other adaptation actions include new infrastructure designs for future climate conditions, asset management programs, at-risk asset protection, operational changes, and abandoning/relocating infrastructure assets that would be too expensive to protect.12 As new and rehabilitated transportation systems are developed, climate change impacts should be routinely incorporated into the planning for these systems.\nThere will be challenges in adapting transportation systems to climate related changes, particularly when factoring in projected growth in the transportation sector. A National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Commission in 2007 forecast the following annual average growth rates: average annual tonnage growth rates of 2.1% for trucks, 1.9% for rail, and 1.2% for waterborne transportation, and an average annual passenger vehicle miles traveled growth rate of 1.82% through 2035 and 1.72% through 2055.13\n\nKey Message 1: Reliability and Capacity at Risk\n\nThe impacts from sea level rise and storm surge, extreme weather events, higher temperatures and heat waves, precipitation changes, Arctic warming,\nand other climatic conditions are affecting the reliability and capacity of the U.S. transportation system in many ways.\n\nGlobal climate change has both gradual and extreme event im-\nplications. A gradually warming climate will accelerate asphalt deterioration and cause buckling of pavements and rail lines.14\n\n(A2 scenario) would lead to an increase in average temperatures ranging from 5\u00b0F in Florida to 9\u00b0F in the upper Midwest.17\n\nStreamflows based on increasingly more frequent and intense The impact on transportation systems not designed for such\n\nrainfall instead of slower snowmelt could increase the likelihood of bridge damage from faster-flowing streams.15 How-\never, less snow in some areas will reduce snow removal costs\n\nextreme temperatures would be severe. At higher tempera-\ntures, expansion joints on bridges and highways are stressed and some asphalt pavements deteriorate more rapidly.18 Rail\n\nand extend construction seasons. Shifts in agricultural production\n\nThawing alaska\n\npatterns will necessitate changes in transportation routes and modes.16\n\nPermafrost \u00ad soil saturated with frozen water \u00ad is a key feature of the Alaskan landscape. Frozen permafrost is a suitable base for transportation infrastructure such\n\nClimate models project that extreme heat and heat waves will become more intense, longer lasting, and more frequent (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). By 2080-2100, average temperatures are expected to increase by 3\u00b0F to 6\u00b0F for the continental United States, assuming emissions reductions from current trends (B1 scenario), while continued increases in emissions\n\nas roads and airfields. In rapidly warming Alaska, however, as permafrost thaws into mud, road shoulders slump, highway cuts slide, and runways sink. Alaska currently spends an extra $10 million per year repairing permafrost damage.25\nA recent study, which examined potential climate damage to Alaskan public infrastructure using results from three different climate models,26 considered 253 airports, 853 bridges, 131 harbors, 819 miles of railroad, 4,576 miles of paved road, and 5,000 miles of unpaved road that could be affected by climate change. The present value of additional public infrastructure costs due to climate change impacts was estimated at $5.6 to $7.6 billion through 2080, or 10% to 12% of total public infrastructure costs in Alaska. These costs might be reduced by 40% with strong adaptation actions.26\n\n132\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f5: TRANSPORTATION\n\ntrack stresses and track buckling will increase.14,19 High air temperatures can affect aircraft performance; lift-off limits at hot-weather and high-altitude airports will reduce aircraft operations.20\nConstruction crews may have to operate on altered time schedules to avoid the heat of the day, with greater safety risks for workers.21 The construction season may lengthen in many localities. Similarly, higher temperatures (and precipitation changes) are likely to affect transit ridership, bicycling, and walking.14,22\nClimate change is most pronounced at high northern latitudes. Alaska has experienced a 3\u00b0F rise in average temperatures since 1949,23 double the rest of the country. Winter temperatures have risen by 6\u00b0F.23 On the North Slope, sea ice formerly\n\nprovided protection to the shoreline against strong fall/winter winds and storms (see Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples). Retreating ice reduces this protection, eroding the shoreline and endangering coastal villages. Thawing permafrost is causing pavement, runway, rail, and pipeline displacements, creating problems for operation and maintenance, and requiring reconstruction of key facilities.\nArctic warming is also projected to allow the seasonal opening of the Northwest Passage to freight shipment.24 Global climate projections to 2100 show extensive open water areas during the summer around the Arctic basin. Retreat of Arctic sea ice has been observed in all seasons over the past five decades, with the most prominent retreat in summer.24 This has allowed a limited number of freighters, cruise ships, and smaller vessels to traverse the Northwest Passage for several years.\n\nPossible Future Flood Depths in Mobile, AL with Rising Sea Level\nFigure 5.1. Many coastal areas in the United States, including the Gulf Coast, are especially vulnerable to sea level rise impacts on transportation systems.11,27,28 This is particularly true when one considers the interaction among sea level rise, wave action, and local geology.29 This map shows that many parts of Mobile, Alabama, including critical roads, rail lines, and pipelines, would be exposed to storm surge under a scenario of a 30-inch sea level rise combined with a storm similar to Hurricane Katrina. Not all roads would be flooded if they merely run through low areas since some are built above flood levels. A 30-inch sea level rise scenario is within the range projected for global sea level rise (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10). (Figure source: U.S. Department of Transportation 201230).\n\n133\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f5: TRANSPORTATION\n\nKey Message 2: Coastal Impacts\n\nSea level rise, coupled with storm surge, will continue to increase the risk of major coastal impacts on transportation infrastructure, including both temporary and permanent flooding of\nairports, ports and harbors, roads, rail lines, tunnels, and bridges.\n\nThe transportation impacts of rising global sea level, which is\nexpected to continue to rise by an additional 1 to 4 feet by 2100 (see also Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10),31\n\noil consumed, and 56% of those imports passed through Gulf Coast ports.32\n\nwill vary widely by location and geography.

Thirteen of the nation's 47 largest airports have at least one runway with an elevation within the reach of moderate to high storm surge. Sea level rise will pose a threat to low-lying infrastructure, such as the airports shown here. (Data from Federal Aviation Administration 201233).\n\n134\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f5: TRANSPORTATION\n\nKey Message 3: Weather Disruptions\n\nExtreme weather events currently disrupt transportation networks in all areas of the country; projections indicate that such disruptions will increase.\n\nChanges in precipitation patterns, particularly more extreme precipitation events and drought, will affect transportation systems across the country. Delays caused by severe storms disrupt almost all types of transportation. Storm drainage systems for highways, tunnels, airports, and city streets could prove inadequate, resulting in localized flooding. Bridge piers are subject to scour as runoff increases stream and river flows, potentially weakening bridge foundations. Severe storms will disrupt highway traffic, leading to more accidents and delays. More airline traffic will be delayed or canceled.\n\n\u00a9 John Wark/ /AP/Corbis\n\nInland waterways may well experience greater\n\nfloods, with high flow velocities that are unsafe\n\nfor navigation and that cause channels to shut\n\ndown intermittently.

Many of the na-\n\ntion's military installations are\n\nin areas that are vulnerable to\n\nextreme weather events, such\n\nas naval bases located in hurri-\n\ncane-prone zones.\n\nFigure 5.3. Within this century, 2,400 miles of major roadway are projected to be inundated by sea level rise in the Gulf Coast region. The map shows roadways at risk in the event of a sea level rise of about 4 feet, which is within the range of projections for this region in this century (see also Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10). In total, 24% of interstate highway miles and 28% of secondary road miles in the Gulf Coast region are at elevations below 4 feet. (Figure source: Kafalenos et al. 200839).\n\n135\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f5: TRANSPORTATION\n\nHurricane sandy\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy\n\nHurricane Sandy Causes Flooding in\n\ndealt the transportation systems of New Jersey and New York and environs a massive\n\nNew York City Subway Stations\n\nblow (See also Ch.16: Northeast, \"Hurri-\n\ncane Vulnerability\"; Ch. 11: Urban \"Hurri-\n\ncane Sandy\"). The damages from Sandy are\n\nindicative of what powerful tropical storms\n\nand higher sea levels could bring on a more\n\nfrequent basis in the future and were very\n\nmuch in line with vulnerability assessments\n\nconducted over the past four years.40,41,42 All\n\ntunnels and most bridges leading into New\n\nYork City were closed during the storm. Storm tides of up to 14 feet43 flooded the Queens\n\nMidtown, Holland, and Carey (Brooklyn Bat-\n\ntery) tunnels, which remained closed for at\n\nleast one week (two weeks for the Carey Tun-\n\nnel) while floodwaters were being pumped\n\nout and power restored.

Table 5.1 is an illustrative application of a risk matrix adapted from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. As shown, different types of climate-related incidents/events can have associated with them a likelihood of occurrence and a magnitude of the consequences if the incident does occur.\nIn assessing consequences, the intensity of system use, as well as the existence or lack of alternative routes, must be taken into account. Disabling a transportation facility can have ripple effects across a network, with trunk (main) lines and hubs having the most widespread impacts.53 Any comprehensive assessment of the consequences of climate change would need to encompass the broad array of factors that influence the nation's transportation system, and consider changes in population, society, technology, prices, regulation, and the economy that eventually affect transportation system performance.55 For example, the trend in recent years in the U.S. economy of adopting just-in-time logistics increases the vulnerability of businesses to day-to-day disruptions caused by weather and flooding.\n\nKey Message 4: Costs and Adaptation Options\nClimate change impacts will increase the total costs to the nation's transportation systems and their users, but these impacts can be reduced through rerouting, mode change, and a wide range of adaptive actions.\n\nAdaptation strategies can be employed to reduce the impact of climate change related events and the resulting consequences (see Ch. 28: Adaptation). Consideration of adaptation strategies in the transportation sector is especially important in the following five areas:\n\u00b7 Transportation and land-use planning: deciding what infrastructure to build and where to build it, as well as planning for vulnerable areas of the community and impacts on specific population groups.\n\u00b7 Vulnerability and risk assessment: identifying existing vulnerable facilities and systems, together with the expected consequences.\n\u00b7 New infrastructure design: adapting new infrastructure designs that anticipate changing environmental and operational conditions.\n\n\u00b7 Asset management: adapting existing infrastructure and operations that respond to current and anticipated conditions, including changed maintenance practices and retrofits.\n\u00b7 Emergency response: anticipating expected disruptions from extreme weather events, and developing emergency response capability.\nAdaptation takes place at multiple levels, from individual households and private businesses to federal, state, and local governments. The impacts associated with climate change are not new, since flooding, storm surge, and extreme heat have long been challenges. What is new is the changing frequency, intensity, and location/geography of impacts and hazards.\nResponding effectively to present and future environmental challenges enhances the resilience of communities. Examples\n\n137\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f5: TRANSPORTATION\nRole of Adaptive Strategies and Tactics in Reducing Impacts and Consequences\n\nFigure 5.5.

An additional 2,000 or more municipal roads and nearly 1,000 culverts were damaged, and more than 200 miles of state-owned rail required repair.75\n\nTropical Storm Impact on Vermont Road\n\nThe volume of water was unprecedented, as was the power of the water in the rivers running through the state. Culverts and bridges were affected and slope stability was threatened as a result of the immense amount and power of water and subsequent flooding.\n\nFigure 5.6. Vermont Route 131, outside Cavendish, a week after Tropical Storm Irene unleashed severe precipitation and flooding that damaged many Vermont roads, bridges, and rail lines. (Photo credit: Vermont Agency of Transportation).\n\nWhen asked about the lessons learned, the Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) indicated the importance of good maintenance of riverbeds as well as roads. VTrans is working with the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, looking upstream and downstream at the structure of the rivers, recognizing that risk reduction may involve managing rivers as much as changing bridges or roadways.\n\nRich Tetreault of VTrans emphasized that \"Certainly we will be looking to right-size the bridges and culverts that need to be replaced ... Knowing that we do not have the funds to begin wholesale rebuilding of the entire highway network to withstand future flooding, we will also enhance our ability to respond\" when future flooding occurs.74\n\n139\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f5: TRANSPORTATION\n\nchange.68 Planting street trees has been\nshown to reduce the urban heat island effect and reduce heat stress on pavement.73\n\nAP Photo/The Virginian-Pilot, Steve Earley\n\nEffective stormwater and stream/river management can reduce the risk of flooding for transportation infrastructure.

Technical input reports (21) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input. The author team's review included a foundational Technical Input Report for the National Climate Assessment, \"Climate Impacts and U.S. Transportation.\"57 Other published literature and professional judgment were also considered as the chapter key messages were developed. The chapter author team met in St. Louis, MO, in April 2012 for expert deliberation and finalization of key messages.\nKey Message #1 Traceable Account\nThe impacts from sea level rise and storm surge, extreme weather events, higher temperatures and heat waves, precipitation changes, Arctic warming, and other climatic conditions are affecting the reliability and capacity of the U.S. transportation system in many ways.\n\nconstraints on infrastructure.12 The effects of climate on transit systems are summarized in Hodges 2011.14 The impact of heat and other climate effects on rail systems are described by Hodges 2011 and Rossetti 2002.14,19\nFuture impacts of sea level rise and other climatic effects on transportation systems in the Gulf Coast were examined by CCSP 2008.11 The impacts of climate change on New York State, including its transportation system, were undertaken by Rosenzweig et al. 2011.60 Impacts of sea level rise on transportation infrastructure for the mid-Atlantic were also discussed in CCSP 2009 SAP 4.1, Ch. 7.27\nWeather impacts on road systems are discussed in \"Climate Impacts and U.S. Transportation\"57 and numerous other sources. Weather impacts on aviation operations are discussed in Kulesa 200320 and numerous other sources.\nIn addition, the key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in \"Climate Impacts and U.S. Transportation.\"57\n\nDescription of evidence base Climate impacts in the form of sea level rise, changing frequency of extreme weather events, heat waves, precipitation changes, Arctic warming, and other climatic conditions are documented in Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate of this report.\nClimate can be described as the frequency distribution of weather over time. Existing weather conditions, flooding, and storm surge demonstrably affect U.S. transportation systems. By changing the frequency of these weather conditions, climate change will inevitably affect the reliability and capacity of U.S. transportations systems. This view is supported by multiple studies of the impacts of weather and climate change on particular transportation systems or particular regions.\nAn aggregate summary of impacts of climate change on U.S. transportation can be found in NRC 2008.7 A paper commissioned for NRC 2008 considers specific impacts of various forms of climate change on infrastructure, for example, possible future\n\nAdditional peer-reviewed publications discuss the fact that Arctic warming is affecting existing Alaskan transportation infrastructure today, and is projected to allow the seasonal opening of the Northwest Passage to freight shipment.24\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Recent changes in global sea level rise estimates documented in this report (Ch.2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10) have not been incorporated into existing regional studies of coastal areas. In addition, recent research by USGS on the interaction between sea level rise, wave action, and local geology have been incorporated in only a few studies.29\nSpecific estimates of climate change impacts on transportation are acutely sensitive to regional projections of climate change and, in particular, to the scale, timing, and type of predicted precipitation. New (CMIP5-based) regional climate projections will therefore affect most existing specific estimates of climate change impacts on transportation. Transportation planning in the face of uncertainties about regional-scale climate impacts presents particular challenges.\n\n146\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f5: TRANSPORTATION Traceable Accounts\n\nImpacts of climate on transportation system operations, including safety and congestion, both on road systems and in aviation, have been little studied to date.\n\nDescription of evidence base Estimates of global sea level rise are documented in Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10 of this report.\n\nFuture characteristics of society, such as land-use patterns, demographics, and the use of information technology to alter transportation patterns, and possible changes to the very nature of future transportation systems themselves all create uncertainty in evaluating climate impacts on the nation's transportation networks. These societal changes will probably occur gradually, however, allowing the transportation systems to adapt. Adaptation can significantly ameliorate impacts on the transportation sector; however, evaluation of adaptation costs and strategies for the transportation sector is at a relatively early stage.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Confidence is high that transportation systems will be affected by climate change, given current climate projections, particularly regarding sea level rise and extreme weather events.\nConfidence Level\nVery High Strong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.),\nhigh consensus\nHigh Moderate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium\nconsensus\nMedium Suggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing\nschools of thought\nLow Inconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts\nKey Message #2 Traceable Account\nSea level rise, coupled with storm surge, will continue to increase the risk of major coastal impacts on transportation infrastructure, including both temporary and permanent flooding of airports, ports and harbors, roads, rail lines, tunnels, and bridges.\n\nThe prospective impact of sea level rise and storm surge on transportation systems is illustrated by the impact of recent hurricanes on U.S. coastlines. In addition, research on impacts of sea level rise and storm surge on transportation assets in particular regions of the United States demonstrate the potential for major coastal impacts (for example, CCSP 2008, Rosenzweig et al. 2011, and Suarez et al. 200511,28,60). Note that most existing literature on storm surge and sea level rise impacts on transportation systems is based on a global sea level rise of less than one meter (about 3 feet). The most recent projections include a potentially greater rise in global sea level (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10).\nIn addition, the key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in \"Climate Impacts and U.S. Transportation.\"57\nNew information and remaining uncertainties As noted above, new estimates of global sea level rise have overtaken most of the existing literature on transportation and sea level rise in the United States. In addition, it is not clear that the existing transportation literature reflects recent USGS work on interactions between sea level rise, wave action, and local geology.29\nNew global sea level rise estimates will enable the development of new regional estimates, as well as revision of regional coastal erosion and flood modeling. Such smaller scale estimates are important because transportation and other infrastructure impacts must necessarily be studied in a local context.\nGenerally speaking, modeling of sea level rise impacts using existing USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED) data has well-understood limitations. Since NED data is freely and easily available, it is often used for preliminary modeling. More accurate and more recent elevation data may be captured via LIDAR campaigns, and this data collection effort will be necessary for accurate understanding of regional and local sea level rise and storm surge impacts.27\nAccurate understanding of transportation impacts is specific to particular infrastructure elements, so detailed inventories of local and regional infrastructure must be combined with detailed and accurate elevation data and the best available predictions of local sea level rise and storm surge. Therefore, national assessments of sea level rise must be built on detailed local and regional assessments.\nImproved modeling is needed on the interactions among sea level rise, storm surge, tidal movement, and wave action to get a better understanding of the dynamics of the phenomena.\n\n147\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f5: TRANSPORTATION Traceable Accounts\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence The authors have high confidence sea levels are rising and storm surge on top of these higher sea levels pose risks to coastal transportation infrastructure.\n\nsystem may be affected by changing precipitation patterns, with\npotential consequences for agriculture and industry, and, conse-\nquently for transportation systems. In addition, the Seattle area may be affected by sea level rise.63\n\nKey Message #3 Traceable Account\nExtreme weather events currently disrupt transportation networks in all areas of the country; projections indicate that such disruptions will increase.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in \"Climate Impacts and U.S. Transportation.\"57\nSpecific regional climate impacts can be identified in each NCA region of the country. Specific climate impacts on transportation by region include:\nIn Alaska, rising temperatures cause permafrost to melt, causing damage to roadbeds, airfields, pipelines, and other transportation infrastructure.25\n\nMany relevant and recent climate data and models predict more intense precipitation events in much of the U.S., especially the Great Plains, Midwest, Northeast, and Southeast, with decreased precipitation in parts of the Southwest and Southeast (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 5).\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Recent data clearly show \u00ad and climate models further substantiate \u00ad an increase in the intensity of precipitation events throughout much of the U.S.\nThere is a need for a better definition of the magnitude of increased storm intensity so that accurate return frequency curves can be established.\nNew regional climate model data from CMIP5 will have a significant impact on regional impact assessments.\n\nIn the Northeast, the Chesapeake region is likely to experience particularly severe local sea level rise due to geologic subsidence,27 and increased precipitation generally (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 5, and Ch.16: Northeast), along with an increased incidence of extreme weather events. The presence of large populations with associated transportation systems in coastal areas increases the potential impacts of sea level rise, storm surge, and precipitation-induced flooding.\nThe Southeast is subject to the interacting effects of sea level rise, increased precipitation, and other extreme events. The Southeast includes Virginia, so it shares the threat of regional sea level rise in the Chesapeake. In Louisiana, climate change poses a significant threat to transportation infrastructure of national significance.11\nMidwest transportation infrastructure is subject to changing water levels on the Great Lakes.54 Barge traffic disruptions, due to flooding or drought on the Mississippi/Missouri/Ohio river system, might be induced by changes in precipitation patterns.\nA major concern in the Southwest is that declining precipitation (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 5) may induce changes in the economy and society that will affect the transportation systems that serve this region. In the Southwest, rail and highway systems may be exposed to increased heat damage from the higher temperatures. San Francisco Bay, which encompasses two major airports and numerous key transportation links, is at risk for sea level rise and storm surge.61\nMuch of the economy of the Northwest is built around electricity and irrigation from a network of dams. The performance of this\n\nClimate and impact data desired by transportation planners may be different from the projections generated by regional climate models. This presents a number of challenges:\nRegional scale transportation impacts are often determined by flood risk and by water flows in rivers and streams. Flooding is, of course, linked to precipitation, but the linkage between precipitation and hydrology is very complex. Precipitation, as projected by climate models, is often difficult to convert into predictions of future flooding, which is what infrastructure designers need.\nSimilarly, an ice storm would be an extreme event for a transportation planner, but the frequency of ice storms has not yet been derived from climate models. More generally, improved methods of deriving the frequency of infrastructure-affecting weather events from regional climate models may be helpful in assessing climate impacts on transportation systems.\nThere are uncertainties associated with the correlation between a warming climate and increased hurricane intensity.\nIn regions likely to see decreased precipitation, especially those areas subject to drought, stronger correlations to fire threat and lowered water levels in major waterways are needed as projections of climate models.\nPlanning tools and models can present a step-by-step process for connecting the risk of impact with specific planning strategies such as assessing the vulnerability of existing and proposed infrastructure and then identifying key adaptation practices to address the risk.\n\n148\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f5: TRANSPORTATION Traceable Accounts\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is high that extreme weather events will affect transportation in all areas of the country.\nKey Message #4 Traceable Account\nClimate change impacts will increase the total costs to the nation's transportation systems and their users, but these impacts can be reduced through rerouting, mode change, and a wide range of adaptive actions.\nDescription of evidence base The economic cost of climate change to the transportation sector has been little studied. However, there is substantial evidence that costs will be significant. A recent study of climate change in New York indicated that a storm surge severe enough to flood Manhattan tunnels might cost as much as $100 billion.60 The actual experience of Hurricane Sandy, where multiple tunnels were flooded, attests to the scale of the costs and disruption that attend an event of this magnitude (See also Ch. 11: Urban; Box on Hurricane Sandy). A study of the risk to specific infrastructure elements in Alaska26 estimated the net present value of the extra cost from climate change at $2 to $4 billion through 2030, and $4 to $8 billion through 2080.\nThe indirect evidence for significant costs from climate change impacts begin with the consequences of recent hurricanes, particularly on the Eastern seaboard, where Hurricane Irene, a rather minor storm, produced unexpectedly heavy infrastructure damage from heavy rains.75 The economic cost of infrastructure damage is often greater than the cost of repairing or replacing infrastructure.\nIn addition, a recent study of on-road congestion estimates the annual cost of highway congestion at about $100 billion,5 and the Federal Highway Administration estimates that weather accounts for about 15% of total delay.4 Similarly, a recent study of aviation congestion indicates that the annual cost of airline delay is about $33 billion3 and that weather accounts for more than a third of airline delays. There is a strong circumstantial case to be made that increased frequency of extreme events (as defined by climate scientists) will produce increased traffic and aviation delays. Given the scale of current costs, even small changes in delay can have substantial economic costs.\nThere is little published material on transportation adaptation costs and benefits in the literature, in part because \"adaptation\" is an abstraction (see Ch. 28: Adaptation). Climate change is statistical weather, and manifests itself as a change in the frequency of events that would still occur (but with lower frequency) in the absence of climate change. Transportation agencies decide to protect (or not) specific pieces of infrastructure based on a range of considerations, including age and condition, extent of current and future usage, and cost of protection, as well as changing weather\n\npatterns. The authors, however, are aware, that transportation systems have always been required to adapt to changing conditions, and that, in general, it is almost always far less expensive to protect useful infrastructure than to wait for it to collapse. This professional experience, based on examination of multitudes of individual engineering studies, is the basis for the conclusion in this report (for example, Caltrans Climate Change Workshop 2011, CCSP 2008, and Meyer 200811,12,69).\nThere are numerous examples of actions taken by state and local governments to enhance resilience and reduce climate impact costs on transportation, including land-use planning to discourage development in vulnerable areas, establishment of design guidelines to reduce vulnerability to sea level rise, use of effective stormwater management techniques, and coordinated emergency response systems.7,69\nNew information and remaining uncertainties There is relatively little information on the costs of climate change in the transportation sector, and less on the benefits of adaptation. Much of the available research is focused on the costs of replacing assets that are affected by extreme weather events, with far less effort devoted to both longer-term impacts of climate change on transportation systems (such as inundation of coastal roads due to sea level rise) and to the broader effects of disrupted facilities on network operations or on the community, for example, rerouting of traffic around bottlenecks or evacuation of sensitive populations from vulnerable areas.\nCalculating climate impact and adaptation costs and benefits is an exceptionally complex problem, particularly at high levels of aggregation, since both costs and benefits accrue based on a multitude of location-specific events. In addition, all of the methodological issues that are confronted by any long-term forecasting exercise are present. The forecasting problem may be more manageable at the local and regional scales at which most transportation decisions are usually made.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence The authors have high confidence that climate impacts will be costly to the transportation sector, but are far less confident in assessing the exact magnitude of costs, based on the available evidence and their experience. The authors also have high confidence, based upon their experience, that costs may be significantly reduced by adaptation action, though, as noted, the magnitude of such potential reductions on a national scale would be difficult to determine.\n\n149\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 6 AGRICULTURE\nConvening Lead Authors\nJerry Hatfield, U.S. Department of Agriculture Gene Takle, Iowa State University\nLead Authors\nRichard Grotjahn, University of California, Davis Patrick Holden, Waterborne Environmental, Inc.

Climate disruptions to agricultural production have increased in the past 40 years and are projected to increase over the next 25 years. By mid-century and beyond, these impacts will be increasingly negative on most crops and livestock.\n2. Many agricultural regions will experience declines in crop and livestock production from increased stress due to weeds, diseases, insect pests, and other climate change induced stresses.\n3. Current loss and degradation of critical agricultural soil and water assets due to increasing extremes in precipitation will continue to challenge both rainfed and irrigated agriculture unless innovative conservation methods are implemented.\n4. The rising incidence of weather extremes will have increasingly negative impacts on crop and livestock productivity because critical thresholds are already being exceeded.\n5. Agriculture has been able to adapt to recent changes in climate; however, increased innovation will be needed to ensure the rate of adaptation of agriculture and the associated socioeconomic system can keep pace with climate change over the next 25 years.\n6. Climate change effects on agriculture will have consequences for food security, both in the U.S. and globally, through changes in crop yields and food prices and effects on food processing, storage, transportation, and retailing. Adaptation measures can help delay and reduce some of these impacts.\n\nThe United States produces nearly $330 billion per year in agricultural commodities, with contributions from livestock accounting for roughly half of that value (Figure 6.1).1 Production of all commodities will be vulnerable to direct impacts (from changes in crop and livestock development and yield due to changing climate conditions and extreme weather events) and indirect impacts (through increasing pressures from pests and pathogens that will benefit from a changing climate). The agricultural sector continually adapts to climate change through changes in crop rotations, planting times, genetic selection, fertilizer management, pest management, water management, and shifts in areas of crop production. These have proven to be effective strategies to allow previous agricultural production to increase, as evidenced by the continued growth in production and efficiency across the United States.\nClimate change poses a major challenge to U.S. agriculture because of the critical dependence of the agricultural system on climate and because of the complex role agriculture plays in rural and national social and economic systems (Figure 6.2). Climate change has the potential to both positively and nega-\n\ntively affect the location, timing, and productivity of crop, livestock, and fishery systems at local, national, and global scales. It will also alter the stability of food supplies and create new food security challenges for the United States as the world seeks to feed nine billion people by 2050. U.S. agriculture exists as part of the global economy and agricultural exports have outpaced imports as part of the overall balance of trade. However, climate change will affect the quantity of produce available for export and import as well as prices (Figure 6.3).\nThe cumulative impacts of climate change will ultimately depend on changing global market conditions as well as responses to local climate stressors, including farmers adjusting planting patterns in response to altered crop yields and crop species, seed producers investing in drought-tolerant varieties, and nations restricting trade to protect food security. Adaptive actions in the areas of consumption, production, education, and research involve seizing opportunities to avoid economic damages and decline in food quality, minimize threats posed by climate stress, and in some cases increase profitability.\n\n151\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE\n\nKey Message 1: Increasing Impacts on Agriculture\n\nClimate disruptions to agricultural production have increased in the past 40 years and are projected to increase over the next 25 years. By mid-century and beyond,\nthese impacts will be increasingly negative on most crops and livestock.\n\nImpacts on Crop Production\n\nProducers have many available strategies for adapting to the\naverage temperature and precipitation changes projected (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate)2 for the next 25 years. These strate-\n\nfurther intensified, yields of major U.S. crops and farm profits are expected to decline.6,7 There have already been detectable impacts on production due to increasing temperatures.8\n\ngies include continued technological advancements, expansion Over time, climate change is expected to increase the annual\n\nof irrigated acreage, regional shifts in crop acreage and crop variation in crop and livestock production because of its ef-\n\nspecies, other adjustments in inputs and outputs, and changes\nin livestock management practices in response to changing climate patterns.3,4 However, crop production projections often\n\nfects on weather patterns and because of increases in some types of extreme weather events.9,10 Overall implications for\nproduction are for increased uncertainty in production totals,\n\nfail to consider the indirect impacts from weeds, insects, and which affects both domestic and international markets and\n\ndiseases that accompany changes in both average trends and extreme events, which can increase losses significantly.2,5 By\nmid-century, when temperature increases are projected to\n\nfood prices.

Agricultural activity is distributed across the U.S. with market value and crop types varying by region. In 2010, the total\nmarket value was nearly $330 billion. Wide variability in climate, commodities, and practices across the U.S. will likely result in differing responses, both in terms of yield and management.

U.S. agriculture exists in the context of global markets. Climate is among the important factors that affect these markets. For example, the increase in U.S. food exports in the 1970s is attributed to a combination of rising incomes in other nations, changes in national currency values and farm policies, and poor harvests in many nations in which climate was a factor. Through seasonal weather impacts on harvests and other impacts, climate change will continue to be a factor in global markets. The graph shows U.S. imports and exports for 1935-2011 in adjusted dollar values. (Data from USDA Economic Research Service 201214).\n\n6: AGRICULTURE\nPlant response to climate change is dictated by complex interactions among carbon dioxide (CO2), temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation. Each crop species has a temperature range for growth, along with an optimum temperature.9 Plants have specific temperature tolerances, and can only be grown in areas where their temperature thresholds are not exceeded. As temperatures increase over this century, crop production areas may shift to follow the temperature range for optimal growth and yield of grain or fruit. Temperature effects on crop production are only one component; production over years in a given location is more affected by available soil water during the growing season than by temperature, and increased variation in seasonal precipitation, coupled with shifting patterns of precipitation within the season, will create more variation in soil water availability.9,15 The use of a model to evaluate the effect of changing temperatures in the absence of changes in water availability reveals that crops in California's Central Valley will respond differently to projected temperature increases, as illustrated in Figure 6.4. This example demonstrates one of the methods available for studying the potential effects of climate change on agriculture.\n\nCrop Yield Response to Warming in California's Central Valley\nFigure 6.4. Changes in climate through this century will affect crops differently because individual species respond differently to warming. This figure is an example of the potential impacts on different crops within the same geographic region. Crop yield responses for eight crops in the Central Valley of California are projected under two emissions scenarios, one in which heat-trapping gas emissions are substantially reduced (B1) and another in which these emissions continue to grow (A2). This analysis assumes adequate water supplies (soil moisture) and nutrients are maintained while temperatures increase. The lines show five-year moving averages for the period from 2010 to 2094, with the yield changes shown as differences from the year 2009. Yield response varies among crops, with cotton, maize, wheat, and sunflower showing yield declines early in the period. Alfalfa and safflower showed no yield declines during the period. Rice and tomato do not show a yield response until the latter half of the period, with the higher emissions scenario resulting in a larger yield response. (Figure source: adapted from Lee et al. 201116).\n\n154\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE\n\nOne critical period in which temperatures are a major factor is the pollination stage; pollen release is related to development of fruit, grain, or fiber. Exposure to high temperatures during this period can greatly reduce crop yields and increase the risk of total crop failure. Plants exposed to high nighttime temperatures during the grain, fiber, or fruit production period experience lower productivity and reduced quality.15 These effects have already begun to occur; high nighttime temperatures affected corn yields in 2010 and 2012 across the Corn Belt. With the number of nights with hot temperatures projected to increase as much as 30%, yield reductions will become more prevalent.9\nProjected Changes in Key Climate Variables Affecting Agricultural Productivity\n\nTemperature and precipitation changes will include an increase in both the number of consecutive dry days (days with less than 0.01 inches of precipitation) and the number of hot nights (Figure 6.5). The western and southern parts of the nation show the greatest projected increases in consecutive dry days, while the number of hot nights is projected to increase throughout the U.S. These increases in consecutive dry days and hot nights will have negative impacts on crop and animal production. High nighttime temperatures during the grain-filling period (the period between the fertilization of the ovule and the production of a mature seed in a plant) increase the rate of grain-filling and decrease the length of the grain-filling period, resulting in reduced grain yields. Exposure to multiple hot nights increases the degree of stress imposed on animals resulting in reduced rates of meat, milk, and egg production.17\n\n\u00a9iStockPhoto/ valentinrussanov\n\nFigure 6.5. Many climate variables affect agriculture. The maps above show projected changes in key climate variables affecting agricultural productivity for the end of the century (2070-2099) compared to 1971-2000. Changes in climate parameters critical to agriculture show lengthening of the frost-free or growing season and reductions in the number of frost days (days with minimum temperatures below freezing), under an emissions scenario that assumes continued increases in heat-trapping gases (A2). Changes in these two variables are not identical, with the length of the growing season increasing across most of the United States and more variation in the change in the number of frost days. Warmer-season crops, such as melons, would grow better in warmer areas, while other crops, such as cereals, would grow more quickly, meaning less time for the grain itself to mature, reducing productivity.9 Taking advantage of the increasing length of the growing season and changing planting dates could allow planting of more diverse crop rotations, which can be an effective adaptation strategy. On the frost-free map, white areas are projected to experience no freezes for 2070-2099, and gray areas are projected to experience more than 10 frost-free years during the same period. In the lower left graph, consecutive dry days are defined as the annual maximum number of consecutive days with less than 0.01 inches of precipitation. In the lower right graph, hot nights are defined as nights with a minimum temperature higher than 98% of the minimum temperatures between 1971 and 2000. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nThough changes in temperature, CO2 concentrations, and solar radiation may benefit plant growth rates, this does not equate to increased production. Increasing temperatures cause cultivated plants to grow and mature more quickly. But because the soil may not be able to supply nutrients at required rates for faster growing plants, plants may be smaller, reducing grain, forage, fruit, or fiber production. Reduction in solar radiation in agricultural areas due to increased clouds and humidity in the last 60 years18 is projected to continue19 and may partially offset the acceleration\n\n155\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE\n\nof plant growth due to higher temperatures and CO2 levels, depending on the crop. In vegetables, exposure to temperatures in the range of 1.8\u00b0F to 7.2\u00b0F above optimal moderately reduces yield, and exposure to temperatures more than 9\u00b0F to 12.6\u00b0F above optimal often leads to severe if not total production losses. Selective breeding and genetic engineering for both plants and animals provides some opportunity for adapting to climate change; however, development of new varieties in perennial specialty crops commonly requires 15 to 30 years or more, greatly limiting adaptive opportunity, unless varieties could be introduced from other areas. Additionally, perennial crops require time to reach their production potential.\n\nA warmer climate will affect growing conditions, and the lack of cold temperatures may threaten perennial crop production (Figure 6.6). Perennial specialty crops have a winter chilling requirement (typically expressed as hours when temperatures are between 32\u00b0F and 50\u00b0F) ranging from 200 to 2,000 cumulative hours. Yields decline if the chilling requirement is not completely satisfied, because flower emergence and viability is low.20 Projections show that chilling requirements for fruit and nut trees in California will not be met by the middle to the end of this century.21 For most of the Northeast, a 400-hour chilling requirement for apples is projected to continue to be met during this century, but crops with prolonged chilling re-\n\nReduced Winter Chilling Projected for California\n\nFigure 6.6. Many perennial plants (such as fruit trees and grape vines) require exposure to particular numbers of chilling hours (hours in which the temperatures are between 32\u00b0F and 50\u00b0F over the winter). This number varies among species, and many trees require chilling hours before flowering and fruit production can occur. With rising temperatures, chilling hours will be reduced. One example of this change is shown here for California's Central Valley, assuming that observed climate trends in that area continue through 2050 and 2090. Under such a scenario, a rapid decrease in the number of chilling hours is projected to occur.\nBy 2000, the number of chilling hours in some regions was 30% lower than in 1950. Based on the A2 emissions scenario that assumes continued increases in heat-trapping gases relative to 1950, the number of chilling hours is projected to decline by 30% to 60% by 2050 and by up to 80% by 2100. These are very conservative estimates of the reductions in chilling hours because climate models project not just simple continuations of observed trends (as assumed here), but temperature trends rising at an increasing rate.21 To adapt to these kinds of changes, trees with a lower chilling requirement would have to be planted and reach productive age.\nVarious trees and grape vines differ in their chilling requirements, with grapes requiring 90 hours, peaches 225, apples 400, and cherries more than 1,000.21 Increasing temperatures are likely to shift grape production for premium wines to different regions, but with a higher risk of extremely hot conditions that are detrimental to such varieties.24 The area capable of consistently producing grapes required for the highest-quality wines is projected to decline by more than 50% by late this century.24 (Figure source: adapted from Luedeling et al. 200921).\n\n156\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE\n\nquirements, such as plums and cherries (with chilling require-\nments of more than 700 hours), could be negatively affected, particularly in southern parts of the Northeast.21,22 Warmer\nwinters can lead to early bud burst or bloom of some perennial\nplants, resulting in frost damage when cold conditions occur in late spring15, as was the case with cherries in Michigan in 2012,\nleading to an economic impact of $220 million (Andresen 2012, personal communication).23\n\nsoybean and alfalfa, elevated CO2 has been associated with reduced nitrogen and protein content, causing a reduction in\ngrain and forage quality and reducing the ability of pasture and rangeland to support grazing livestock.30 The growth stimula-\ntion effect of increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations has a disproportionately positive impact on several weed species.\nThis effect will contribute to increased risk of crop loss due to weed pressure.28,31\n\nThe effects of elevated CO2 on grain and fruit yield and quality\nare mixed. Some experiments have documented that elevated\nCO2 concentrations can increase plant growth while increasing water use efficiency.25,26 The magnitude of CO2 growth stimu-\nlation in the absence of other stressors has been extensively analyzed for crop and tree species27,28 and is relatively well\nunderstood; however, the interaction with changing tempera-\nture, ozone, and water and nutrient constraints creates uncertainty in the magnitude of these responses.29 In plants such as\n\nThe advantage of increased water-use efficiency due to elevated CO2 in areas with limited soil water supply may be offset by other impacts from climate change. Rising average temperatures, for instance, will increase crop water demand, increasing the rate of water use by the crop. Rising temperatures coupled with more extreme wet and dry events, or seasonal shifts in precipitation, will affect both crop water demand and plant production.\n\nImpacts on Animal Production from Temperature Extremes\n\nAnimal agriculture is a major component of the U.S. agriculture Animals respond to extreme temperature events (hot or cold)\n\nsystem (Figure 6.1). Changing climatic conditions affect animal by altering their metabolic rates and behavior. Increases in\n\nagriculture in four primary ways: 1) feed-grain production, extreme temperature events may become more likely for ani-\n\navailability, and price; 2) pastures and forage crop production mals, placing them under conditions where their efficiency in\n\nand quality; 3) animal health, growth, and reproduction; and meat, milk, or egg production is affected.

Current estimates of losses in global crop production show that weeds cause the largest losses (34%), followed by insects (18%), and diseases (16%).36 Further increases in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns will induce new conditions that will affect insect populations, incidence of pathogens, and the geographic distribution of insects and diseases.15,37 Increasing CO2 boosts weed growth, adding to the potential for increased competition between crops and weeds.38 Several weed species benefit more than crops from higher temperatures and CO2 levels.28,31\nOne concern involves the northward spread of invasive weeds like privet and kudzu, which are already present in the southern states.39 Changing climate and changing trade patterns are likely to increase both the risks posed by, and the sources of, invasive species.40 Controlling weeds costs the U.S. more than $11 billion a year, with most of that spent on herbicides. Both herbicide use and costs are expected to increase as temperatures and CO2 levels rise.41 Also, the most widely used herbicide in the United States, glyphosate (also known as RoundUpTM and other brand names), loses its efficacy on weeds grown at CO2 levels projected to occur in the coming decades.42 Higher concentrations of the chemical and more frequent sprayings thus will be needed, increasing economic and environmental costs associated with chemical use.\nClimate change effects on land-use patterns have the potential to create interactions among climate, diseases, and crops.37,43 How climate change affects crop diseases depends upon the effect that a combination of climate changes has on both the host and the pathogen. One example of the complexity of the interactions among climate, host, and pathogen is aflatoxin (Aspergillus flavus). Temperature and moisture availability are crucial for the production of this toxin, and both pre-harvest and post-harvest conditions are critical in understanding the impacts of climate change. High temperatures and drought stress increase aflatoxin production and at the same time reduce the growth of host plants. The toxin's impacts are augmented by the presence of insects, creating a potential for climate-toxin-insect-plant interactions that further affect\n\ncrop production.44 Earlier spring and warmer winter conditions are also expected to increase the survival and proliferation of disease-causing agents and parasites.\nInsects are directly affected by temperature and synchronize their development and reproduction with warm periods and are dormant during cold periods.45 Higher winter temperatures increase insect populations due to overwinter survival and, coupled with higher summer temperatures, increase reproductive rates and allow for multiple generations each year.46 An example of this has been observed in the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubialis) which produces one generation in the northern Corn Belt and two or more generations in the southern Corn Belt.47 Changes in the number of reproductive generations coupled with the shift in ranges of insects will alter insect pressure in a given region.\nSuperimposed on these climate change related impacts on weed and insect proliferation will be ongoing land-use and land-cover changes (Ch. 13: Land Use & Land Cover Change). For example, northward movement of non-migratory butterflies in Europe and changes in the range of insects were associated with land-use patterns and climate change.48\nLivestock production faces additional climate change related impacts that can affect disease prevalence and range. Regional warming and changes in rainfall distribution have the potential to change the distributions of diseases that are sensitive to temperature and moisture, such as anthrax, blackleg, and hemorrhagic septicemia, and lead to increased incidence of ketosis, mastitis, and lameness in dairy cows.33,49\nThese observations illustrate some of the interactions among climate change, land-use patterns, and insect populations. Weeds, insects, and diseases thus cause a range of direct and indirect effects on plants and animals from climate change, although there are no simple models to predict the potential interactions. Given the economic impact of these pests and the potential implications for food security, research is critical to further understand these dynamics.\n\n158\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE\n\nKey Message 3: Extreme Precipitation and Soil Erosion\n\nCurrent loss and degradation of critical agricultural soil and water assets due to increasing extremes in precipitation will continue to challenge both rainfed and irrigated agriculture unless innovative conservation methods are implemented.\n\nSeveral processes act to degrade soils, including erosion, compaction, acidification, salinization, toxification, and net loss of organic matter (Ch. 15: Biogeochemical Cycles). Several of these processes, particularly erosion, will be directly affected by climate change. Rainfall's erosive power is expected to increase as a result of increases in rainfall amount in northern portions of the United States (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate), accompanied by further increases in precipitation intensity.50 Projected increases in rainfall intensity that include more extreme events will increase soil erosion in the absence of conservation practices.51,52\n\nSoil and water are essential resources for agricultural production, and both are subject to new conditions as climate changes. Precipitation and temperature affect the potential amount of water available, but the actual amount of available water also depends on soil type, soil water holding capacity, and the rate at which water filters through the soil (Figure 6.7 and 6.8). Such soil characteristics, however, are sensitive to changing climate conditions; changes in soil carbon content and soil loss will be affected by direct climate effects through changes in soil temperature, soil water availability, and the amount of organic matter input from plants.53\n\nIt is all about the water!\nSoil is a critical component of agricultural systems, and the changing climate affects the amount, distribution, and intensity of precipitation. Soil erosion occurs when the rate of precipitation exceeds the ability of the soil to maintain an adequate infiltration rate. When this occurs, runoff from fields moves water and soil from the field into nearby water bodies.\n\nFigure 6.7\n\nFigure 6.8\n\nWater and soil that are lost from the field are no longer available to support crop growth. The increasing intensity of storms and the shifting of rainfall patterns toward more spring precipitation in the Midwest may lead to more scenes similar to this one (Figure 6.7). An analysis of the rainfall patterns across Iowa has shown there has not been an increase in total annual precipitation; however, there has been a large increase in the number of days with heavy rainfall (Figure 6.9). The increase in spring precipitation is evidenced by a decrease of three days in the number of workable days in the April to May period during 2001 through 2011 in Iowa compared to the period 1980-2000.15 To offset this increased precipitation, producers have been installing subsurface drainage to remove more water from the fields at a cost of $500 per acre (Figure 6.8). These are elaborate systems designed to move water from the landscape to allow agricultural operations to occur in the spring. Water erosion and runoff is only one portion of the spectrum of extreme precipitation. Wind erosion could increase in areas with persistent drought because of the reduction in vegetative cover.

Iowa is the nation's top corn and soybean producing state. These crops are planted in the spring. Heavy rain can delay planting and create problems in obtaining a good stand of plants, both of which can reduce crop productivity. In Iowa soils with even modest slopes, rainfall of more than 1.25 inches in a single day leads to runoff that causes soil erosion and loss of nutrients and, under some circumstances, can lead to flooding. The figure shows the number of days per year during which more than 1.25 inches of rain fell in Des Moines, Iowa. Recent frequent occurrences of such events are consistent with the significant upward trend of heavy precipitation events documented in the Midwest.51,55 (Figure source: adapted from Takle 201156).\n\nA few of the many important ecosystem services provided by soils include the provision of food, wood, fiber such as cotton, and raw materials; flood mitigation; recycling of wastes; biological control of pests; regulation of carbon and other heat-trapping gases; physical support for roads and buildings; and cultural and aesthetic values.54 Productive soils are characterized by levels of nutrients necessary for the production of healthy plants, moderately high levels of organic matter, a soil structure with good binding of the primary soil particles, moderate pH levels, thickness sufficient to store adequate water for plants, a healthy microbial community, and the absence of elements or compounds in concentrations that are toxic for plant, animal, and microbial life.\nChanges in production practices can have more effect than climate change on soil erosion; however, changes in climate will exacerbate the effects of management practices that do not protect the soil surface from the forces of rainfall. Erosion is managed through maintenance of cover on the soil surface to reduce the effect of rainfall intensity. Studies have shown that a reduction in projected crop biomass (and hence the amount of crop residue that remains on the surface over the winter) will increase soil loss.57,58 Expected increases in soil erosion under climate change also will lead to increased off-site,\n\nnon-point-source pollution. Soil conservation practices will therefore be an important element of agricultural adaptation to climate change.59\nRising temperatures and CO2 and shifting precipitation patterns will alter crop-water requirements, crop-water availability, crop productivity, and costs of water access across the agricultural landscape. Higher temperatures are projected to increase both evaporative losses from land and water surfaces and transpiration losses (through plant leaves) from non-crop land cover, potentially reducing annual runoff and streamflow for a given amount of precipitation. The resulting shift in crop health will, in turn, drive changes in cropland allocations and production systems.\n\n\u00a9Nati Harnik/AP/Corbis\n\n160\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE\n\nKey Message 4: Heat and Drought Damage\n\nThe rising incidence of weather extremes will have increasingly negative impacts on crop and livestock productivity because critical thresholds are already being exceeded.\n\nClimate change projections suggest an increase in extreme heat, severe drought, and heavy precipitation.60 Extreme climate conditions, such as dry spells, sustained droughts, and heat waves all have large effects on crops and livestock. The timing of extreme events will be critical because they may occur at sensitive stages in the life cycles of agricultural crops or reproductive stages for animals, diseases, and insects. Extreme events at vulnerable times could result in major impacts on growth or productivity, such as hot-temperature extreme weather events on corn during pollination. By the end of this century, the occurrence of very hot nights and the duration of periods lacking agriculturally significant rainfall are projected to increase. Recent studies suggest that increased average temperatures and drier conditions will amplify future drought severity and temperature extremes.6,61,62 Crops and livestock will be at increased risk of exposure to extreme heat events. Projected increases in the occurrence of extreme heat events will expose production systems to conditions exceeding maximum thresholds for given species more frequently. Goats, sheep, beef cattle, and dairy cattle are the livestock species most widely managed in extensive outdoor facilities. Within physiological limits, animals can adapt to and cope with gradual thermal changes, though shifts in thermoregulation may result in a loss of productivity.63 Lack of prior conditioning to\n\nrapidly changing or adverse weather events, however, often\nresults in catastrophic deaths in domestic livestock and losses of productivity in surviving animals.34\n\n\u00a9iStockPhoto.com/shotbydave\n\nKey Message 5: Rate of Adaptation\n\nAgriculture has been able to adapt to recent changes in climate; however, increased innovation will be needed to ensure the rate of adaptation of agriculture and the associated\nsocioeconomic system can keep pace with climate change over the next 25 years.\n\nThere is emerging evidence about the economic impacts of climate change on agriculture and the potential for adaptive strategies.64 Much of the economic literature suggests that in the short term, producers will continue to adapt to weather changes and shocks as they always have, with changes in the timing of field operations, shifts in crops grown, and changing tillage or irrigation practices.64 In the longer term, however, existing adaptive technologies will likely not be sufficient to buffer the impacts of climate change without significant impacts to domestic producers, consumers, or both. New strategies for building long-term resilience include both new technologies and new institutions to facilitate appropriate, informed producer response to a changing climate. Furthermore, there are both public and private costs to adjusting agricultural production and infrastructure in a manner that enables adaptation.2 Limits to public investment and constraints on private investment could slow the speed of adaptation, yet potential constraints and limits are not well understood or integrated into economic impact assessments. The economic implications\n\nof changing biotic pressures on crops and livestock, and on the agricultural system as a whole, are not well understood, either in the short or long term.15 Adaptation may also be limited by the availability of inputs (such as land or water), changing prices of other inputs with climate change (such as energy and fertilizer), and by the environmental implications of intensifying or expanding agricultural production.\nAdaptation strategies currently used by U.S. farmers to cope with weather and climate changes include changing selection of crops, the timing of field operations, and the increasing use of pesticides to control increased pressure from pests. Technological innovation increases the tools available to farmers in some agricultural sectors. Diversifying crop rotations, integrating livestock with crop production systems, improving soil quality, minimizing off-farm flows of nutrients and pesticides, and other practices typically associated with sustainable agriculture also increase the resiliency of the agricultural system to productivity impacts of climate change.65,66 In the Midwest,\n\n161\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE\n\nthere have been shifts in the distribution of crops and land-use change partially related to the increased demand for biofuels67 (see also Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land for more discussion on biofuels). In California's Central Valley, an adaptation plan consisting of integrated changes in crop mix, irrigation methods, fertilization practices, tillage practices, and land management may be an effective approach to managing climate risk.68 These practices are available to all agricultural regions of the United States as potential adaptation strategies.\nBased on projected climate change impacts in some areas of the United States, agricultural systems may have to undergo more transformative changes to remain productive and profitable in the long term.65 Research and development of sustainable natural resource management strategies inform adaptation options for U.S. agriculture. More transformative adaptive strategies, such as conversion to integrated crop-livestock farming, may reduce environmental impacts, improve profitability and sustainability, and enhance ecological resilience to climate change in U.S. livestock production systems.69\nThere are many possible responses to climate change that will allow agriculture to adapt over the next 25 years; however, potential constraints to adaptation must be recognized and addressed. In addition to regional constraints on the availability of critical basic resources such as land and water, there are potential constraints related to farm financing and credit availability in the U.S. and elsewhere. Research suggests that such constraints may be significant, especially for small family farms with little available capital.22,64,70 In addition to the technical\n\nand financial ability to adapt to changing average conditions, farm resilience to climate change is also a function of financial capacity to withstand increasing variability in production and returns, including catastrophic loss.71 As climate change intensifies, \"climate risk\" from more frequent and intense weather events will add to the existing risks commonly managed by producers, such as those related to production, marketing, finances, regulation, and personal health and safety factors.72 The role of innovative management techniques and government policies as well as research and insurance programs will have a substantial impact on the degree to which the agricultural sector increases climate resilience in the longer term.\nModern agriculture has continually adapted to many changing factors, both within and outside of agricultural systems. As a result, agriculture in the U.S. over the past century has steadily increased productivity and integration into world markets. Although agriculture has a long history of successful adaptation to climate variability, the accelerating pace of climate change and the intensity of projected climate change represent new and unprecedented challenges to the sustainability of U.S. agriculture. In the short term, existing and evolving adaptation strategies will provide substantial adaptive capacity, protecting domestic producers and consumers from many of the impacts of climate change, except possibly the occurrence of protracted extreme events. In the longer term, adaptation will be more difficult and costly because the physiological limits of plant and animal species will be exceeded more frequently, and the productivity of crop and livestock systems will become more variable.\n\nKey Message 6: Food Security\n\nClimate change effects on agriculture will have consequences for food security, both in the U.S. and globally, through changes in crop yields and food\nprices and effects on food processing, storage, transportation, and retailing. Adaptation measures can help delay and reduce some of these impacts.\n\nClimate change impacts on agriculture will have consequences\nfor food security both in the U.S. and globally. Food security\nincludes four components: availability, stability, access, and utilization of food.73 Following this definition, in 2011, 14.9%\nof U.S. households did not have secure food supplies at some\npoint during the year, with 5.7% of U.S. households experiencing very low food security.74 Food security is affected by a vari-\nety of supply and demand-side pressures, including economic\nconditions, globalization of markets, safety and quality of food,\nland-use change, demographic change, and disease and poverty.75,76\n\n\u00a9iStockPhoto.com/ mycola\n\nWithin the complex global food system, climate change is expected to affect food security in multiple ways.77 In addition\nto altering agricultural yields, projected rising temperatures,\nchanging weather patterns, and increases in frequency of\nextreme weather events will affect distribution of food- and\n\n162\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE\n\nwater-borne diseases as well as food trade and distribution.78 This means that U.S. food security depends not only on how climate change affects crop yields at the local and national level, but also on how climate change and changes in extreme events affect food processing, storage, transportation, and retailing, through the disruption of transportation as well as the ability of consumers to purchase food. And because about one-fifth of all food consumed in the U.S. is imported, our food supply and security can be significantly affected by climate variations and changes in other parts of the world. The import share has increased over the last two decades, and the U.S. now imports 13% of grains, 20% of vegetables (much higher in winter months), almost 40% of fruit, 85% of fish and shellfish, and almost all tropical products such as coffee, tea, and bananas (Figure 6.3).79 Climate extremes in regions that supply these products to the U.S. can cause sharp reductions in production and increases in prices.\nIn an increasingly globalized food system with volatile food prices, climate events abroad may affect food security in the U.S. while climate events in the U.S. may affect food security globally. The globalized food system can buffer the local impacts of weather events on food security, but can also increase the global vulnerability of food security by transmitting price shocks globally.80\n\nThe connections of U.S. agriculture and food security to global conditions are clearly illustrated by the recent food price spikes in 2008 and 2011 that highlighted the complex connections of climate, land use, demand, and markets. The doubling of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) food price index over just a few months in 2010 was caused partly by weather conditions in food-exporting countries such as Australia, Russia, and the United States, but was also driven by increased demand for meat and dairy in Asia, increased energy costs and demand for biofuels, and commodity speculation in financial markets.81\nAdapting food systems to limit the impacts of climate extremes and changes involves strategies to maintain supply and manage demand as well as an understanding of how other regions of the world adapt their food systems in ways that might affect U.S. agricultural competitiveness, imports, and prices. Supplies can be maintained through adaptations such as reducing waste in the food system, making food distribution systems more resilient to climate risks, protecting food quality and safety in higher temperatures, and policies to ensure food access for disadvantaged populations and during extreme events (Ch. 28 Adaptation).15,75,76,80,81\n\n163\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Discussions were followed by expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors and targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each message.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nClimate disruptions to agricultural production have increased in the past 40 years and are projected to increase over the next 25 years. By midcentury and beyond, these impacts will be increasingly negative on most crops and livestock.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Agriculture TIR, \"Climate Change and Agriculture in the United States: An Assessment of Effects and Potential for Adaptation.15 Additional Technical Input Reports (56) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nEvidence that climate change has had and will have impacts on crops and livestock is based on numerous studies and is incontrovertible.6,7,8\n\nwhile changes in the timing and intensity of extreme temperature effects are expected to negatively affect crop development during critical windows such as pollination. Crop production will also be affected by changing patterns of seasonal precipitation; extreme precipitation events are expected to occur more frequently and negatively affect production levels. Livestock production is directly affected by extreme temperature as the animal makes metabolic adjustments to cope with heat stress.15 Further, production costs in confined systems markedly increase when climate regulation is necessary.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence (cited above) confirmed many of the findings in the past Synthesis and Assessment Product on agriculture,82 which informed the 2009 National Climate Assessment.83\nThere is insufficient understanding of the effects on crop production of rising carbon dioxide, changing temperatures and more variable precipitation patterns.9 The combined effects on plant water demand and soil water availability will be critical to understanding regional crop response. The role of increasing minimum temperatures on water demand and growth and senescence rates of plants is an important factor. There is insufficient understanding of how prolonged exposure of livestock to high or cold temperatures affects metabolism and reproductive variables.26 For grazing animals, climate conditions during the growing season are critical in determining feed availability and quality on rangeland and pastureland.69\nThe information base can be enhanced by evaluating crop growth and livestock production models. This evaluation would further the understanding of the interactions of climate variables and the biological system. Better understanding of projected changes in precipitation will narrow uncertainty about future yield reductions.9,69\n\nThe literature strongly suggests that carbon dioxide, temperature, and precipitation affect livestock and crop production. Plants have an optimal temperature range to which they are adapted, and regional crop growth will be affected by shifts in that region's temperatures relative to each crop's optimal range. Large shifts in temperature can significantly affect seasonal biomass growth,\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There are a range of controlled environment and field studies that provide the evidence for these findings. Confidence in this key message is therefore judged to be high.\n\n171\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE Traceable Accounts\n\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent\nresults, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods\nvary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nMany agricultural regions will experience declines in crop and livestock production from increased stress due to weeds, diseases, insect pests, and other climate change induced stresses.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Agriculture TIR, \"Climate Change and Agriculture in the United States: An Assessment of Effects and Potential for Adaptation\".15 Additional Technical Input Reports (56) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nNumerous peer-reviewed publications describe the direct effects of climate on the ecological systems within which crop and livestock operations occur. Many weeds respond more strongly to CO2 than do crops, and it is believed that the range of many diseases and pests (for both crop and livestock) will expand under warming conditions.28,31,40 Pests may have increased overwinter survival and fit more generations into a single year, which may also facilitate faster evolution of pesticide resistance. Changing patterns of pressure from weeds, other pests, and disease can affect crop and livestock production in ways that may be costly or challenging to address.9,15\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence (cited above) confirmed many of the findings in the past Synthesis and Assessment Product on agriculture,82 which informed the 2009 National Climate Assessment.83\n\nIn addition to extant species already in the U.S., exotic weeds, diseases, and pests have particular significance in that: 1) they can often be invasive (that is, arrive without normal biological/ ecological controls) and highly damaging; 2) with increasing international trade, there are numerous high-threat, high-impact species that will arrive on commodities from areas where some species even now are barely known to modern science, but which have the potential to emerge under a changed climate regime to pose significant risk of establishment in the U.S. and economic loss; and 3) can take advantage of \"disturbances,\" where climate variability acts as an additional ecological disturbance. Improved models and observational data related to how many agricultural regions will experience declines in animal and plant production from increased stress due to weeds, diseases, insect pests, and other climate change induced stresses will need to be developed.\nA key issue is the extent of the interaction between components of the natural biological system (for example, pests) and the economic biological system (for example, crop or animal). For insects, increased populations are a factor; however, their effect on the plant may be dependent upon the phenological stage of the plant when the insect is at specific phenological stages.15\nTo enhance our understanding of these issues will require a concerted effort to begin to quantify the interactions of pests and the economic crop or livestock system and how each system and their interactions are affected by climate.15\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence The scientific literature is beginning to emerge; however, there are still some unknowns about the effects of biotic stresses, and there may well be emergent \"surprises\" resulting from departures from past ecological equilibria. Confidence is therefore judged to be medium that many agricultural regions will experience declines in animal and plant production from increased stress due to weeds, diseases, insect pests, and other climate change induced stresses.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nCurrent loss and degradation of critical agricultural soil and water assets due to increasing extremes in precipitation will continue to challenge both rainfed and irrigated agriculture unless innovative conservation methods are implemented.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Agriculture TIR, \"Climate Change and Agriculture in the United States: An Assessment of Effects and Potential for Adaptation.\"15 Additional Technical Input Reports (56) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nSoil erosion is affected by rainfall intensity and there is evidence of increasing intensity in rainfall events even where the annual\n\n172\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE Traceable Accounts\n\nmean is reduced.53 Unprotected soil surfaces will have increased erosion and require more intense conservation practices.58,59 Shifts in seasonality and type of precipitation will affect both timing and impact of water availability for both rainfed and irrigated agriculture. Evidence is strong that in the future there will be more precipitation globally, and that rain events will be more intense, even if separated by longer periods without rain.6\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence (cited above) confirmed many of the findings in the past Synthesis and Assessment Product on agriculture,82 which informed the 2009 National Climate Assessment.83 Both rainfed and irrigated agriculture will increasingly be challenged, based on improved models and observational data related to the effects of increasing precipitation extremes on loss and degradation of critical agricultural soil and water assets.51,52\nPrecipitation shifts are the most difficult to project, and uncertainty in regional projections increases with time into the future.61 To improve these projections will require enhanced understanding of shifts in timing, intensity, and magnitude of precipitation events. In the northern U.S., more frequent and severe winter and spring storms are projected, while there is a projected reduction in precipitation in the Southwest (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence (cited above) confirmed many of the findings in the past Synthesis and Assessment Product on agriculture, 82 which informed the 2009 National Climate Assessment.83\nOne key area of uncertainty is the timing of extreme events during the phenological stage of the plant or the growth stage of the animal. For example, plants are more sensitive to extreme high temperatures during the pollination stage compared to vegetative growth stages.9 A parallel example for animals is relatively strong sensitivity to high temperatures during the conception phase.34 Milk and egg production are also vulnerable to temperature extremes. The effects of extreme combinations of weather variables must be considered, such as elevated humidity in concert with high temperatures.34\nOther key uncertainties include inadequate precision in simulations of the timing of extreme events relative to short time periods of crop vulnerability, and temperatures close to key thresholds such as freezing.22 The uncertainty is amplified by the rarity of extreme events; this rarity means there are infrequent opportunities to study the impact of extreme events. In general, a shift of the distribution of temperatures can increase the frequency of threshold exceedance.15\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence The precipitation forecasts are the limiting factor in these assessments; the evidence of the impact of precipitation extremes on soil water availability and soil erosion is well established. Confidence in this key message is therefore judged to be high.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nThe rising incidence of weather extremes will have increasingly negative impacts on crop and livestock productivity because critical thresholds are already being exceeded.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Agriculture TIR, \"Climate Change and Agriculture in the United States: An Assessment of Effects and Potential for Adaptation\".15 Additional Technical Input Reports (56) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nNumerous peer-reviewed publications6,61,62 provide evidence that the occurrence of extreme events is increasing, and exposure of plants or animals to temperatures and soil water conditions (drought, water-logging, flood) outside of the biological range for the given species will cause stress and reduce production.6,61,62 The direct effects of an extreme event will depend upon the timing of the event relative to the growth stage of the biological system.\n\nThe information base can be enhanced by improving the forecast of extreme events, given that the effect of extreme events on plants or animals is known.3,61\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is high confidence in the effects of extreme temperature events on crops and livestock, and the agreement in the literature is good.\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nAgriculture has been able to adapt to recent changes in climate; however, increased innovation will be needed to ensure the rate of adaptation of agriculture and the associated socioeconomic system can keep pace with climate change over the next 25 years.\nDescription of evidence base There is emerging evidence about the economic impacts of climate change on agriculture and the potential for adaptive strategies.64 In the case of crop production, much of the economic literature suggests that in the short term, producers will continue to adapt to weather changes and shocks as they always have, with changes in the timing of field operations, shifts in crops grown, and changing tillage or irrigation practices.64 In the longer term, however, existing adaptive technologies will likely not be sufficient to buffer the impacts of climate change without significant impacts to domestic producers, consumers, or both.\n\n173\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f6: AGRICULTURE Traceable Accounts\n\nNew strategies for building long-term resilience include both new technologies and new institutions to facilitate appropriate, informed producer response to a changing climate. Furthermore, there are both public and private costs to adjusting agricultural production and infrastructure in a manner that enables adaptation.2\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Limits to public investment and constraints on private investment could slow the speed of adaptation, yet potential constraints and limits are not well-understood or integrated into economic impact assessments. The economic implications of changing biotic pressures on crops and livestock, and on the agricultural system as a whole, are not well-understood, either in the short or long term.15 Adaptation may also be limited by availability of inputs (such as land or water), changing prices of other inputs with climate change (such as energy and fertilizer), and by the environmental implications of intensifying or expanding agricultural production.\nIt is difficult to fully represent the complex interactions of the entire socio-ecological system within which agriculture operates, to assess the relative effectiveness and feasibility of adaptation strategies at various levels. Economic impact assessments require improved understanding of adaptation capacity and agricultural resilience at the system level, including the agri-ecosystem impacts related to diseases and pests. Economic impact assessments also require improved understanding of adaptation opportunities, economic resilience, and constraints to adaptation at the producer level.2,64 The economic value of ecological services, such as pollination services, is particularly difficult to quantify and incorporate into economic impact efforts.15\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Emerging evidence about adaptation of agricultural systems to changing climate is beginning to be developed. The complex interactions among all of the system components present a limitation to a complete understanding, but do provide a comprehensive framework for the assessment of agricultural responses to climate change. Given the overall and remaining uncertainty, there is medium confidence in this message.\n\nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture,85 and the National Research Council.77 There are many factors that affect food security, and agricultural yields are only one of them. Climate change is also expected to affect distribution of food- and waterborne diseases, and food trade and distribution.78\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The components of food security derive from the intersection of political, physical, economic, and social factors. In many ways the impact of climate change on crop yields is the least complex of the factors that affect the four components of food security (availability, stability, access, and utilization). As the globalized food system is subject to conflicting pressures across scales, one approach to reducing risk is a \"cross-scale problem-driven\" approach to food security.76 This and other approaches to understanding and responding to the complexities of the global food system need additional research. Climate change will have a direct impact on crop and livestock production by increasing the variability in production levels from year to year, with varying effects across different regions. Climate change will also affect the distribution of food supplies as a result of disruptions in transportation routes. Addressing food security will require integration of multiple factors, including the direct and indirect impacts of climate change.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainty, there is high confidence that climate change impacts will have consequences for food security both in the U.S. and globally through changes in crop yields and food prices, and very high confidence that other related factors, including food processing, storage, transportation, and retailing will also be affected by climate change. There is high confidence that adaptation measures will help delay and reduce some of these impacts.\n\nKey message #6 Traceable Account\nClimate change effects on agriculture will have consequences for food security, both in the U.S. and globally, through changes in crop yields and food prices and effects on food processing, storage, transportation, and retailing.

Climate change is increasing the vulnerability of many forests to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought, and disease outbreaks.\n2. U.S. forests and associated wood products currently absorb and store the equivalent of about 16% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by fossil fuel burning in the U.S. each year. Climate change, combined with current societal trends in land use and forest management, is projected to reduce this rate of forest CO2 uptake.\n3. Bioenergy could emerge as a new market for wood and could aid in the restoration of forests killed by drought, insects, and fire.\n4. Forest management responses to climate change will be influenced by the changing nature of private forestland ownership, globalization of forestry markets, emerging markets for bioenergy, and U.S. climate change policy.\n\nForests occur within urban areas, at the interface between urban and rural areas (wildland-urban interface), and in rural areas. Urban forests contribute to clean air, cooling buildings, aesthetics, and recreation in parks. Development in the wildland-urban interface is increasing because of the appeal of owning homes near or in the woods. In rural areas, market factors drive land uses among commercial forestry and land uses such as agriculture. Across this spectrum, forests provide recreational opportunities, cultural resources, and social values such as aesthetics.1\nEconomic factors have historically influenced both the overall area and use of private forestland. Private entities (such as corporations, family forest owners, and tribes) own 56% of the forestlands in the United States. The remaining 44% of forests are on public lands: federal (33%), state (9%), and county and municipal government (2%).2 Market factors can influence management objectives for public lands, but societal values also influence objectives by identifying benefits such as environmental services not ordinarily provided through markets, like watershed protection and wildlife habitat. Different challenges and opportunities exist for public and for private forest management decisions, especially when climaterelated issues are considered on a national scale. For example, public forests typically carry higher levels of forest biomass, are more remote, and tend not to be as intensively managed as private forestlands.1\n\nForests provide opportunities to reduce future climate change by capturing and storing carbon, as well as by providing resources for bioenergy production (the use of forest-derived plant-based materials for energy production). The total amount of carbon stored in U.S. forest ecosystems and wood products (such as lumber and pulpwood) equals roughly 25 years of U.S. heat-trapping gas emissions at current rates of emission, providing an important national \"sink\" that could grow or shrink depending on the extent of climate change, forest management practices, policy decisions, and other factors.3,4 For example, in 2011, U.S. forest ecosystems and the associated wood products industry captured and stored roughly 16% of all carbon dioxide emitted by fossil fuel burning in the United States.3\nManagement choices for public, private, and tribal forests all involve similar issues. For example, increases in wildfire, disease, drought, and extreme events are projected for some regions (see also Ch. 16: Northeast; Ch. 20: Southwest; Ch. 21: Northwest, Key Message 3; and Ch. 22: Alaska). At the same time, there is growing awareness that forests may play an expanded role in carbon management. Urban expansion fragments forests and may limit forest management options. Addressing climate change effects on forestlands requires considering the interactions among land-use practices, energy options, and climate change.5\n\n176\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f7: FORESTS\n\nKey Message 1: Increasing Forest Disturbances\n\nClimate change is increasing the vulnerability of many forests to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought, and disease outbreaks.\n\nInsect and pathogen outbreaks, invasive species, wildfires, and extreme events such as droughts, high winds, ice storms, hurricanes, and landslides induced by storms8 are all disturbances that affect U.S. forests and their management (Figure 7.1). These disturbances are part of forest dynamics, are often interrelated, and can be amplified by underlying trends \u00ad for example, decades of rising average temperatures can increase damage to forests when a drought occurs.9 Disturbances that affect large portions of forest ecosystems occur relatively infrequently and in response to climate extremes. Changes in climate in the absence of extreme climate events (and the forest disturbances they trigger) may result in\n\nincreased forest productivity, but extreme climate events can potentially overturn such patterns.10\nFactors affecting tree death \u00ad such as drought, physiological water stress, higher temperatures, and/or pests and pathogens \u00ad are often interrelated, which means that isolating a single cause of mortality is rare.11,12,13 However, in western forests there have been recent large-scale die-off events due to one or more of these factors,14,15,16 and rates of tree mortality are well correlated with both rising temperatures and associated increases in evaporative water demand.17 In eastern forests, tree mortality at large spatial scales was more sensitive\n\nForest Ecosystem Disturbances\n\n\u00a9 Melanie Stetson Freeman/Getty Images\n\nA Montana saw mill owner inspects a lodgepole pine covered in pitch tubes that show the tree trying, unsuccessfully, to defend itself against the bark beetle.

An example of the variability and distribution of major ecosystem disturbance types in North America, compiled from 2005 to 2009. Forest disturbance varies by topography, vegetation, weather patterns, climate gradients, and proximity to human settlement. Severity is mapped as a percent change in a satellite-derived Disturbance Index. White areas represent natural annual variability, orange represents moderate severity, and red represents high severity.6 Fire dominates much of the western forest ecosystems, and storms affect the Gulf Coast. Insect damage is widespread but currently concentrated in western regions, and timber harvest is predominant in the Southeast. (Figure source: modified from Goetz et al. 2012;7 Copyright 2012 American Geophysical Union).\n\nWarmer winters allow more insects to survive the cold season, and a longer summer allows some insects to complete two life cycles in a year instead of one. Drought stress reduces trees' ability to defend against boring insects.

Nonetheless,\nmortality of some eastern tree groups is related to rising temperature18 and is expected to increase as climate warms.19\n\nEffectiveness of Forest Management in Reducing Wildfire Risk\n\nFuture disturbance rates in forests will depend on changes in the frequency of extreme events as well as the underlying changes in average climate conditions.9,20 Of particular concern is the potential for increased forest disturbance as the result of drought accompanied with warmer temperatures, which can cause both wildfire and tree death. Temperatures have generally been increasing and are projected to increase in the future (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). Therefore, although it is difficult to predict trends in future extreme events,21 there is a high degree of confidence that future droughts will be accompanied by generally warmer conditions. Trees die faster when drought is accompanied by higher temperatures, so short droughts can trigger mortality if temperatures are higher.22 Short droughts occur more frequently than long droughts. Consequently, a direct effect of rising temperatures may be substantially greater tree mortality even with no change in drought frequency.22\nGiven strong relationships between climate and fire, even when modified by land use and management, such as fuel treatments (Figure 7.2), projected climate changes suggest that western forests in the United States will be increasingly affected by large and intense fires that occur more frequently.16,23,24,25 These impacts are compounded by a legacy of fire suppression that has resulted in many U.S. forests becoming increasingly dense.26 Eastern forests are less likely to experience immediate increases in wildfire, unless a point is reached at which rising temperatures combine with seasonal dry periods, more protracted drought, and/or insect outbreaks to trigger wildfires \u00ad conditions that have been seen in Florida (see Ch. 17: Southeast).\n\nFigure 7.2. Forest management that selectively removes trees to reduce fire risk, among other objectives (a practice referred to as \"fuel treatments\"), can maintain uneven-aged forest structure and create small openings in the forest. Under some conditions, this practice can help prevent large wildfires from spreading.

For\nexample, most functional groups show a decrease in mortal-\nity with higher summer temperatures (with the exception of\nnorthern groups), whereas warmer winters are correlated with higher mortality for some functional groups.18 Tree mortality\nis often the result of a combination of many factors; thus in-\ncreases in pollutants, droughts, and wildfires will increase the\nprobability of a tree dying (Figure 7.3).

The figure shows a conceptual climate envelope analysis of forest vulnerability under current and projected future ranges of variability in climate parameters (temperature and precipitation, or alternatively drought duration and intensity). Climate models project increasing temperatures across the U.S. in coming decades, but a range of increasing or decreasing precipitation depending on region. Episodic droughts (where evaporation far exceeds precipitation) are also expected to increase in duration and/or intensity (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). The overall result will be increased vulnerability of forests to periodic widespread regional mortality events resulting from trees exceeding their physiological stress thresholds.11 (Figure source: Allen et al. 201011).\n\nLarge-scale die-off and wildfire disturbance events could have potential impacts occurring at local and regional scales for timber production, flooding and erosion risks, other changes in water budgets, biogeochemical changes including carbon storage, and aesthetics.29,30,31 Rising disturbance rates can increase harvested wood output and potentially lower prices; however, higher disturbance rates could make future forest\n\ninvestments more risky (Figure 7.4). Western forests could also lose substantial amounts of carbon storage capacity. For example, an increase in wildfires, insect outbreaks, and droughts that are severe enough to alter soil moisture and nutrient contents can result in changes in tree density or species composition.10\n\nKey Message 2: Changing Carbon Uptake\n\nU.S. forests and associated wood products currently absorb and store the equivalent of about 16% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by fossil fuel burning in the U.S. each year.\nClimate change, combined with current societal trends in land use and forest management, is projected to reduce this rate of forest CO2 uptake.\n\nClimate-related Effects on Trees and Forest Productivity\n\nForests within the United States grow across a wide range of season in the last thirty years, yet earlier spring growth may be latitudes and altitudes and occupy all but the driest regions. negated by mid-summer drought.34\n\nCurrent forest cover has been shaped by climate, soils,\n\ntopography, disturbance frequency, and human activity. By the end of the century, snowmelt may occur a month\n\nForest growth appears to be slowly accelerating (less than 1% earlier, but forest drought stress could increase by two per decade) in regions where tree growth is limited by low months in the Rocky Mountain forests.35 In the eastern United\n\ntemperatures and short growing seasons that are gradually\nbeing altered by climate change (for species shifts, see Ch. 8: Ecosystems).32 Forest carbon storage appears to be increasing both globally and within the United States.33 Continental-scale\n\nStates, elevated CO2 and temperature may increase forest\ngrowth and potentially carbon storage if sufficient water is available.1,31,36 Despite recent increases in forest growth,\nfuture net forest carbon storage is expected to decline due to\n\nsatellite measurements document a lengthening growing accelerating mortality and disturbance.\n\n179\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f7: FORESTS\nForests can be a Source \u00ad or a Sink \u00ad for Carbon\nFigure 7.4. Relative vulnerability of different forest regions to climate change is illustrated in this conceptual risk analysis diagram. Forest carbon exchange is the difference between carbon captured in photosynthesis and carbon released by respiration of vegetation and soils. Both photosynthesis and respiration are generally accelerated by higher temperatures, and slowed by water deficits, but the relative strengths of these controls are highly variable. Western forests are inherently limited by evaporation that exceeds precipitation during much of the growing season. Xeric (drier) eastern forests grow on shallow, coarse textured soils and experience water deficits during long periods without rain. Mesic (wetter) eastern forests experience severe water deficits only for relatively brief periods in abnormally dry years so the carbon exchanges are more controlled by temperature fluctuations. (Figure source: adapted from Vose et al. 20121).\n\nForest Carbon Sequestration and Carbon Management From the onset of European settlement to the start of the million tons of carbon per year.3 The amount of carbon taken\nlast century, changes in U.S. forest cover due to expansion up by U.S. land is dominated by forests (Figure 7.5), which have\nof agriculture, tree harvests, and settlements resulted in annually absorbed 7% to 24% of fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) net emissions of carbon.37,38 More recently, with forests emissions in the U.S. over the past two decades. The best\nreoccupying land previously used for agriculture, technological estimate is that forests and wood products stored about 16%\nadvances in harvesting, and changes in forest management, (833 teragrams, or 918.2 million short tons, of CO2 equivalent\nU.S. forests and associated wood products now serve as a in 2011) of all the CO2 emitted annually by fossil fuel burning in\nsubstantial carbon sink, capturing and storing more than 227.6 the United States (see also \"Estimating the U.S. Carbon Sink\" in Ch. 15: Biogeochemical Cycles).3\n\nForest Growth Provides an Important Carbon Sink\n\nThe future role of U.S. forests in the carbon cycle\nwill be affected by climate change through changes\nin disturbances (see Figures 7.3 and 7.4), as well\nas shifts in tree species, ranges, and productivity (Figure 7.6).19,38 Economic factors will affect any\nfuture carbon cycle of forests, as the age class\nand condition of forests are affected by the acceleration of harvesting,39,40 land-use changes such as urbanization,41 changes in forest types,42 and bioenergy development.41,43,44,45\n\nFigure 7.5. Forests are the largest component of the U.S. carbon sink, but growth rates of forests vary widely across the country. Well-watered forests of the Pacific Coast and Southeast absorb considerably more than the arid southwestern forests or the colder northeastern forests. Climate change and disturbance rates, combined with current societal trends regarding land use and forest management, are projected to reduce forest CO2 uptake in the coming decades.1 Figure shows average forest growth as measured by net primary production from 2000 to 2006. (Figure source: adapted from Running et al. 200446).\n\nEfforts in forestry to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels have focused on forest management and forest product use. Forest management strategies include land-use change to increase forest area (afforestation) and/or to avoid deforestation and optimizing carbon management in existing forests. Forest product-use strategies include the use of wood wherever possible as a structural substitute for steel and concrete, which require more carbon emissions to produce.38 The carbon emissions offset from using wood rather than alternate materials for a range of applications can be two or more times the carbon content of the product.47\n\n180\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f7: FORESTS\n\nIn the U.S., afforestation (active establishment or planting of forests) has the potential to capture and store a maximum of 225 million tons of additional carbon per year from 2010 to 211039,48 (an amount almost equivalent to the current annual carbon storage in forests). Tree and shrub encroachment into grasslands, rangelands, and savannas provides a large potential carbon sink that could exceed half of what existing U.S. forests capture and store annually.48\nExpansion of urban and suburban areas is responsible for much of the current and expected loss of U.S. forestland, although these human-dominated areas often have extensive tree cover and potential carbon storage (see also Ch. 13: Land Use & Land Cover Change).41 In addition, the increasing prevalence of extreme conditions that encourage wildfires can convert some forests to shrublands and meadows25 or permanently reduce\n\nthe amount of carbon stored in existing forests if fires occur more frequently.49\nCarbon management on existing forests can include practices that increase forest growth, such as fertilization, irrigation, switching to fast-growing planting stock, shorter rotations, and weed, disease, and insect control.50 In addition, forest management can increase average forest carbon stocks by increasing the interval between harvests, by decreasing harvest intensity, or by focused density/species management.4,51 Since 1990, CO2 emissions from wildland forest fires in the lower 48 United States have averaged about 67 million tons of carbon per year.52,53 While forest management practices can reduce on-site carbon stocks, they may also help reduce future climate change by providing feedstock material for bioenergy production and by possibly avoiding future, potentially larger, wildfire emissions through fuel treatments (Figure 7.2).1\n\nForests and Carbon\n\nFigure 7.6. Historical, current, and projected annual rates of forest ecosystem and harvested wood product CO2 net emissions/ sequestration in the U.S. from 1635 to 2055. In the top panel, the change in the historical annual carbon emissions (black line) in the early 1900s corresponds to the peak in the transformation of large parts of the U.S. from forested land to agricultural land uses. Green shading shows this decline in forest land area. In the bottom panel, future projections shown under higher (A2) and lower (B2 and A1B) emissions scenarios show forests as carbon sources (due to loss of forest area and accelerating disturbance rates) rather than sinks in the latter half of this century. The A1B scenario assumes similar emissions to the A2 scenario used in this report through 2050, and a slow decline thereafter.

Forest resources adopted renewable fuel standards. The economic viability of\n\npotentially could produce bioenergy from 504 million acres of using forests for bioenergy depends on regional context and\n\ntimberland and 91 million acres of other forested land (Figure circumstances, such as species type and prior management,\n\n7.7). Bioenergy from all sources, including agricultural and land conditions, transport and storage logistics, conversion forests, could theoretically supply the equivalent of up to 30% processes used to produce energy, distribution, and use.58 The\n\nof current U.S. petroleum consumption, but only if all relevant environmental and socioeconomic consequences of bioenergy policies were optimized.45 The maximum projected potential production vary greatly with region and intensity of human\n\nfor forest bioenergy ranges from 3% to 5% of total current U.S. management. energy consumption.54\n\nThe potential for biomass energy to increase timber harvests\n\nForest biomass energy could be one component of an overall\nbioenergy strategy to reduce emissions of carbon from fossil fuels,55 while also improving water quality56,57 and maintaining\nlands for timber production as an alternative to other\n\nhas led to debates about whether forest biomass energy leads to higher carbon emissions.44,59 The debate on biogenic\nemissions regulations revolves around how to account for emissions related to biomass production and use.60 The forest\n\nsocioeconomic options. Active biomass energy markets using carbon balance naturally changes over time and also depends\n\non forest management scenarios. For\n\nLocation of Potential Forestry Biomass Resources\n\nexample, utilizing natural beetle-killed forests will yield a different carbon\n\nbalance than growing and harvesting a\n\nlive, fast-growing plantation.\n\nFigure 7.7. Potential forestry bioenergy resources by 2030 at $80 per dry ton of biomass based on current forest area, production rates based on aggressive management for fast-growth, and short rotation bioenergy plantations. Units are oven dry tons (ODT) per square mile at the county level, where an ODT is 2,000 pounds of biomass from which the moisture has been removed. Includes extensive material from existing forestland, such as residues, simulated thinnings, and some pulpwood for bioenergy, among other sources. (Figure source: adapted from U.S. Department of Energy 201145).\n\nMarkets for energy from biomass appear to be ready to grow in response to energy pricing, policy, and demand,44 although recent increases in the supply of natural gas have reduced the perceived urgency for new biomass projects. Further, because energy facilities typically buy the lowest quality wood at prices that rarely pay much more than cutting and hauling costs, they often require a viable saw timber market nearby to ensure an adequate, low-cost supply of material.61 Where it is desirable to remove dead wood after disturbances to thin forests or to dispose of residues, a viable bioenergy industry could finance such activities. However, the bioenergy market has yet to be made a profitable enterprise in most U.S. regions.\n\n182\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f7: FORESTS\n\nKey Message 4: Influences on Management Choices\n\nForest management responses to climate change will be influenced by the changing nature of private forestland ownership, globalization of forestry markets, emerging\nmarkets for bioenergy, and U.S. climate change policy.\n\nClimate change will affect trees and forests in urban areas, the wildland-urban interface, and in rural areas. It will also challenge forest landowners managing forests for commercial products, energy development, environmental services such as watershed protection, or the conversion of forestland to developed and urban uses or agriculture. With increases in urbanization, the value of forests in and around urban areas in providing environmental services required by urban residents will increase.41 Potentially the greatest shifts in goods and environmental services produced from forests could occur in rural areas where social and economic factors will interact with the effects of climate change at landscape scales.\nOwner objectives, markets for forest products, crops and energy, the monetary value of private land, and policies governing private and public forestland all influence the actions taken to manage U.S. forestlands (56% privately owned, 44% public) (Figure 7.8). Ownership changes can bring changes in forest objectives. Among corporate owners (18% of all forestland), ownership has shifted from forest industry to investment management organizations that may or may not have active forest management as a primary objective. Noncorporate private owners, an aging demographic, manage 38% of forestland. Their primary objectives are maintaining aesthetics and the privacy that the land provides as well as preserving the land as part of their family legacy.62\nA significant economic factor facing private forest owners is the value of their forestlands for conversion to urban or developed uses. Economic opportunities from forests include wood products, non-timber forest products, recreation activities, and in some cases, environmental services.1,41 Less than 1% of the volume of commercial trees from U.S. forestlands is harvested annually, and 92% of this harvest comes from private forestlands.2 Markets for wood products in the United States have been affected by increasingly competitive global markets,63 and timber prices are not projected to increase without substantial increases in wood energy consumption or other new timber demands.41 Urban conversions of forestland over the next 50 years could result in the loss of 16 to 31 million acres.41 The willingness of private forest owners to actively\n\nmanage forests in the face of climate change will be affected primarily by market and policy incentives, not climate change itself.\nThe ability of public, private, and tribal forest managers to adapt to future climate change will be enhanced by their capacity to alter management regimes relatively rapidly in the face of changing conditions. The response to climate change may be greater on private forestlands where, in the past, owners have been highly responsive to market and policy signals.64 These landowners may be able to use existing or current forest management practices to reduce disturbance effects, increase the capture and storage of carbon, and modify plant species distributions under climate change. In addition, policy incentives, such as carbon pricing or cap and trade markets, could influence landowner choices. For human communities dependent upon forest resources, maintaining or enhancing their current resilience to change will influence their ability to respond to future stresses from climate change.65\nOn public, private, and tribal lands, management practices that can be used to reduce disturbance effects include altering tree planting and harvest strategies through species selection and timing; factoring in genetic variation; managing for reduced stand densities, which could reduce wildfire risk; reducing other stressors such as poor air quality; using forest management practices to minimize drought stress; and developing regional networks to mitigate impacts on ecosystem goods and services.1,30,66 Legally binding regulatory requirements may constrain adaptive management where plants, animals, ecosystems, and people are responding to climate change.67\nLack of fine-scale information about the possible effects of climate changes on locally managed forests limits the ability of managers to weigh these risks to their forests against the economic risks of implementing forest management practices such as adaptation and/or mitigation treatments. This knowledge gap will impede the implementation of effective management on public or private forestland in the face of climate change.\n\n183\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fPublic and Private Forestlands\n\n7: FORESTS\n\nFigure 7.8.

This session, along with numerous teleconferences, led to the foundational TIR, \"Effects of Climatic Variability and Change on Forest Ecosystems: A Comprehensive Science Synthesis for the U.S. Forest Sector.\"1\nThe chapter authors engaged in multiple technical discussions via teleconference between January and June 2012, which included careful review of the foundational TIR and of 58 additional technical inputs provided by the public, as well as other published literature and professional judgment. Discussions were followed by expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors and targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each message.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account Climate change is increasing the vulnerabil-\nity of many forests to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought, and disease outbreaks.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the TIR, \"Effects of Climatic Variability and Change on Forest Ecosystems: A Comprehensive Science Synthesis for the U.S. Forest Sector.\"1 Technical input reports (58) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nDale et al.8 addressed a number of climate change factors that will affect U.S. forests and how they are managed. This is supported by additional publications focused on effects of drought and by more large-scale tree die-off events,11,22 wildfire,16,23,25 insects and pathogens. 11,22 Other studies support the negative impact of climate change by examining the tree mortality rate due to rising temperatures,9,11,14,15,16,17,19,22 which is projected to increase in some regions.22\n\nAlthough it is difficult to detect a trend in disturbances because they are inherently infrequent and it is impossible to attribute an individual disturbance event to changing climate, there is nonetheless much that past events, including recent ones, reveal about expected forest changes due to future climate. Observational17 and experimental22 studies show strong associations between forest disturbance and extreme climatic events and/or modifications in atmospheric evaporative demand related to warmer temperature. Regarding eastern forests, there are fewer observational or experimental studies, with Dietz and Moorcroft18 being the most comprehensive.\nPollution and stand age are the most important factors in mortality. Tree survival increases with increased temperature in some groups. However, for other tree groups survival decreases with increased temperature.18 In addition, this study18 needs to be considered in the context that there have been fewer severe droughts in this region. However, physiological relationships suggest that trees will generally be more susceptible to mortality under an extreme drought, especially if it is accompanied by warmer temperatures.13,68 Consequently, it is misleading to assume that, because eastern forests have not yet experienced the types of large-scale die-off seen in the western forests, they are not vulnerable to such events if an extreme enough drought occurs. Although the effect of temperature on the rate of mortality during drought has only been shown for one species,22 the basic physiological relationships for trees suggest that warmer temperatures will exacerbate mortality for other species as well.13,68\nFigure 7.1: This figure uses a figure from Goetz et al. 20127 which uses the MODIS Global Disturbance Index (MGDI) results from 2005 to 2009 to illustrate the geographic distribution of major ecosystem disturbance types across North America (based on Mildrexler et al. 2007, 20096,69). The MGDI uses remotely sensed information to assess the intensity of the disturbance. Following the occurrence of a major disturbance, there will be a reduction in Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) because of vegetation damage; in contrast, Land Surface Temperature (LST) will increase because more absorbed solar radiation will be converted into sensible heat as a result of the reduction in evapotranspiration from less vegetation density. MGDI takes advantage of the contrast changes in EVI and LST following a disturbance to enhance the signal to ef-\n\n191\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f7: FORESTS Traceable Accounts\n\nfectively detect the location and intensity of disturbances (http:// www.ntsg.umt.edu/project/mgdi). Moderate severity disturbance is mapped in orange and represents a 65%-100% divergence of the current-year MODIS Global Disturbance Index value from the range of natural variability, High severity disturbance (in red) signals a divergence of over 100%.7\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Forest disturbances have large ecosystem effects, but high interannual variability in regional fire and insect activity makes detection of trends more difficult than for changes in mean conditions.20,21,70 Therefore, there is generally less confidence in assessment of future projections of disturbance events than for mean conditions (for example, growth under slightly warmer conditions).21\nThere are insufficient data on trends in windthrow, ice storms, hurricanes, and landslide-inducing storms to infer that these types of disturbance events are changing.\n\nmore frequently.16,23,25 This is based on the strong relationships between climate and forest response, shown observationally17 and experimentally.22 Expected responses will increase substantially to warming and also in conjunction with other changes such as an increase in the frequency and/or severity of drought and amplification of pest and pathogen impacts. Eastern forests are less likely to experience immediate increases in wildfire unless/until a point is reached at which warmer temperatures, concurrent with seasonal dry periods or more protracted drought, trigger wildfires.\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nU.S. forests and associated wood products currently absorb and store the equivalent of about 16% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by fossil fuel burning in the U.S. each year. Climate change, combined with current societal trends in land use and forest management, is projected to reduce this rate of forest CO2 uptake.\n\nFactors affecting tree death, such as drought, warmer temperatures, and/or pests and pathogens are often interrelated, which means that isolating a single cause of mortality is rare.11,12,13,17,22,68\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Very High. There is very high confidence that under projected climate changes there is high risk (high risk = high probability and high consequence) that western forests in the United States will be affected increasingly by large and intense fires that occur\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.),\nhigh consensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium\nconsensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing\nschools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts\n\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the TIR, \"Effects of Climatic Variability and Change on Forest Ecosystems: A Comprehensive Science Synthesis for the U.S. Forest Sector.\"1 Technical input reports (58) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nA recent study3 has shown that forests are a big sink of CO2 nationally. However, the permanence of this carbon sink is contingent on forest disturbance rates, which are changing, and on economic conditions that may accelerate harvest of forest biomass.56 Market response can cause changes in the carbon source/sink dynamics through shifts in forest age,39,40 land-use changes and urbanization that reduce forested areas,41 forest type changes,42 and bioenergy development changing forest management.41,43,44,45 Additionally, publications have reported that fires can convert a forest into a shrubland or meadow,25 with frequent fires permanently reducing the carbon stock.49\nNew information and remaining uncertainties That economic factors and societal choices will affect future carbon cycle of forests is known with certainty; the major uncertainties come from the future economic picture, accelerating disturbance rates, and societal responses to those dynamics.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Based on the evidence and uncertainties, confidence is high that climate change, combined with current societal trends regarding land use and forest management, is projected to reduce forest CO2 uptake in the U.S. The U.S. has already seen large-scale shifts in forest cover due to interactions between forestland use and agriculture (for example, between the onset of European settlement to the present). There are competing demands for how forestland is used today. The future role of U.S. forests in the\n\n192\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f7: FORESTS Traceable Accounts\n\ncarbon cycle will be affected by climate change through changes in disturbances (Key Message 1), growth rates, and harvest demands.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nBioenergy could emerge as a new market for wood and could aid in the restoration of forests killed by drought, insects, and fire.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the TIR, \"Effects of Climatic Variability and Change on Forest Ecosystems: A Comprehensive Science Synthesis for the U.S. Forest Sector.\"1 Technical input reports (58) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nStudies have shown that harvesting forest bioenergy can prevent carbon emissions55 and replace a portion of U.S. energy consumption to help reduce future climate change. Some newer literature has explored how use of forest bioenergy can replace a portion of current U.S. energy production from oil.20,45 Some more recent publications have reported some environmental benefits, such as improved water quality56,57 and better management of timber lands,45 that can result from forest bioenergy implementation.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The implications of forest product use for bioenergy depends on regional context and circumstances, such as feedstock type and prior management, land conditions, transport and storage logistics, conversion processes used to produce energy, distribution and use.58\nThe potential for biomass energy to increase forest harvests has led to debates about whether biomass energy is net carbon neutral.59 The debate on biogenic emissions regulations revolves around how to account for emissions related to biomass production and use.60 Deforestation contributes to atmospheric CO2 concentration, and that contribution has been declining over time. The bioenergy contribution question is largely one of incentives for appropriate management. When forests have no value, they are burned or used inappropriately. Bioenergy can be produced in a way that provides more benefits than costs or vice versa. The market for energy from biomass appears to be ready to grow in response to energy pricing, policy, and demand; however, this industry is yet to be made a large-scale profitable enterprise in most regions of the United States.\n\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nForest management responses to climate change will be influenced by the changing nature of private forestland ownership, globalization of forestry markets, emerging markets for bioenergy, and U.S. climate change policy.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the TIR, \"Effects of Climatic Variability and Change on Forest Ecosystems: A Comprehensive Science Synthesis for the U.S. Forest Sector.\"1 Technical input reports (58) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nThe forest management response to climate change in urban areas, the wildland-urban interface, and in rural areas has been studied from varying angles. The literature on urban forests identifies the value of those forests to clean air, aesthetics, and recreation and suggests that under a changing climate, urban communities will continue to enhance their environment with trees and urban forests.1,41 In the wildland-urban area and the rural areas, the changing composition of private forest landowners will affect the forest management response to climate change. Shifts in corporate owners to include investment organizations that may or may not have forest management as a primary objective has been described nationally.1,2 Family forest owners are an aging demographic; one in five acres of forestland is owned by someone who is at least 75 years of age.62 Multiple reasons for ownership are given by family forest owners, including the most commonly cited reasons of beauty/scenery, to pass land on to heirs, privacy, nature protection, and part of home/cabin. Many family forest owners feel it is necessary to keep the woods healthy but many are not familiar with forest management practices.62 Long-term studies of the forest sector in the southern United States document the adaptive response of forest landowners to market prices as they manage to supply wood and associated products from their forests;64 however prices are less of an incentive in other parts of the United States.1,41 Econometric approaches have been used to explore the economic activities in the forest sector, including interactions with other sectors such as agriculture, impact of climate change, and the potential for new markets with bioenergy.43,44 An earlier study explored the effects of globalization on forest management63 and a newer study looked at the effect of U.S. climate change policy.67 One of the biggest challenges is the lack of climate change information that results in inaction from many forest owners.62\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence High. Forest growth substantially exceeds annual harvest for normal wood and paper products, and much forest harvest residue is now unutilized. Forest bioenergy will become viable if policy and economic energy valuations make it competitive with fossil fuels.\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Human concerns regarding the effects of climate change on forests and the role of adaptation and mitigation will be viewed from the perspective of the values that forests provide to human populations, including timber products, water, recreation, and aesthetic and spiritual benefits.1 Many people, organizations, in-\n\n193\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fstitutions, and governments influence the management of U.S. forests. Economic opportunities influence the amount and nature of private forestland (and much is known quantitatively about this dynamic) and societal values have a strong influence on how public forestland is managed. However, it remains challenging to project exactly how humans will respond to climate change in terms of forest management.\nClimate change will alter known environmental and economic risks and add new risks to be addressed in the management of forests in urban areas, the wildland-urban interface, and rural areas. The capacity to manage risk varies greatly across landowners. While adaptation strategies provide a means to manage risks associated with climate change, a better understanding of risk perception by forest landowners would enhance the development and implementation of these management strategies. Identification of appropriate monitoring information and associated tools to evaluate monitoring data could facilitate risk assessment. Information and tools to assess environmental and economic risks associated with the impacts of climate change in light of specific management decisions would be informative to forestland managers and owners.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainty, there is medium confidence in this key message. Climate change and global and national economic events will have an integral impact on forest management, but it is uncertain to what magnitude. While forest landowners have shown the capacity to adapt to new economic conditions, potential changes in the international markets coincident with large-scale natural disturbances enhanced by climate change (fire, insects) could challenge this adaptive capacity. An important uncertainty is how people will respond to climate change in terms of forest management.\n\n7: FORESTS Traceable Accounts\n\n194\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 8 ECOSYSTEMS,\nBIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\nConvening Lead Authors\nPeter M.

Climate change impacts on ecosystems reduce their ability to improve water quality and regulate water flows.\n2. Climate change, combined with other stressors, is overwhelming the capacity of ecosystems to buffer the impacts from extreme events like fires, floods, and storms.\n3. Landscapes and seascapes are changing rapidly, and species, including many iconic species, may disappear from regions where they have been prevalent or become extinct, altering some regions so much that their mix of plant and animal life will become almost unrecognizable.\n4. Timing of critical biological events, such as spring bud burst, emergence from overwintering, and the start of migrations, has shifted, leading to important impacts on species and habitats.\n5. Whole system management is often more effective than focusing on one species at a time, and can help reduce the harm to wildlife, natural assets, and human well-being that climate disruption might cause.\n\nClimate change affects the living world, including people, through changes in ecosystems, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. Ecosystems entail all the living things in a particular area as well as the non-living things with which they interact, such as air, soil, water, and sunlight.1 Biodiversity refers to the variety of life, including the number of species, life forms, genetic types, and habitats and biomes (which are characteristic groupings of plant and animal species found in a particular climate). Biodiversity and ecosystems produce a rich array of benefits that people depend on, including fisheries, drinking water, fertile soils for growing crops, climate regulation, inspiration, and aesthetic and cultural values.2 These benefits are called \"ecosystem services\" \u00ad some of which, like food, are more easily quantified than others, such as climate regulation or cultural values. Changes in many such services are often not obvious to those who depend on them.\n\necosystem impacts, it is often difficult to quantify human vulnerability that results from shifts in ecosystem processes and services. For example, although it is more straightforward to predict how precipitation will change water flow, it is much harder to pinpoint which farms, cities, and habitats will be at risk of running out of water, and even more difficult to say how people will be affected by the loss of a favorite fishing spot or a wildflower that no longer blooms in the region. A better understanding of how a range of ecosystem responses affects people \u00ad from altered water flows to the loss of wildflowers \u00ad will help to inform the management of ecosystems in a way that promotes resilience to climate change.\n\nEcosystem services contribute to jobs, economic growth, health, and human well-being. Although we interact with ecosystems and ecosystem services every day, their linkage to climate change can be elusive because they are influenced by so many additional entangled factors.3 Ecosystem perturbations driven by climate change have direct human impacts, including reduced water supply and quality, the loss of iconic species and landscapes, distorted rhythms of nature, and the potential for extreme events to overwhelm the regulating services of ecosystems. Even with these well-documented\n\nForests absorb carbon dioxide and provide many other ecosystem services, such as purifying water and providing recreational opportunities.\n\n\u00a9 Michele Westmorland/Corbis\n\n196\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f8: ECOSYSTEMS, BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\n\nKey Message 1: Water\n\nClimate change impacts on ecosystems reduce their ability to improve water quality and regulate water flows.\n\nClimate-driven factors that control water availability and quality are moderated by ecosystems. Land-based ecosystems regulate the water cycle and are the source of sediment and other materials that make their way to aquatic ecosystems (streams, rivers, lakes, estuaries, oceans, groundwater). Aquatic ecosystems provide the critically important services of storing water, regulating water quality, supporting fisheries, providing recreation, and carrying water and materials downstream (Ch. 25: Coasts). Humans utilize, on average, the equivalent of more than 40% of renewable supplies of freshwater in more than 25% of all U.S. watersheds.4 Freshwater withdrawals are even higher in the arid Southwest, where the equivalent of 76% of all renewable freshwater is appropriated by people.5 In that region, climate change has likely decreased and altered the timing of streamflow due to reduced snowpack and lower precipitation in spring, although the precipitation trends are weak due to large year-to-year variability, as well as geographic variation in the patterns (Ch. 3: Water; Ch. 20: Southwest).6 Depriving ecosystems of water reduces their ability to provide water to people as well as for aquatic plant and animal habitat (see Figure 8.1).\nHabitat loss and local extinctions of fish and other aquatic species are projected from the combined effects of increased water withdrawal and climate change.7 In the U.S., 47% of trout habitat in the interior West would be lost by 2080 under a scenario (A1B) that assumes similar emissions to the A2 scenario used in this report (Ch. 1: Overview, Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate) through 2050, and a slow decline thereafter.8\nAcross the entire U.S., precipitation amounts and intensity and associated river discharge are major drivers of water pollution in the form of excess nutrients, sediment, and dissolved organic\n\ncarbon (DOC) (Ch. 3: Water).9 At high concentrations, nutrients that are required for life (such as nitrogen and phosphorus) can become pollutants and can promote excessive phytoplankton growth \u00ad a process known as eutrophication. Currently, many U.S. lakes and rivers are polluted (have concentrations above government standards) by excessive nitrogen, phosphorus, or sediment. There are well-established links among fertilizer use, nutrient pollution, and river discharge, and many studies show that recent increases in rainfall in several regions of the United States have led to higher nitrogen amounts carried by rivers (Northeast,10,11 California,12 and Mississippi Basin13,14). Over the past 50 years, due to both climate and land-use change, the Mississippi Basin is yielding an additional 32 million acre-feet of water each year \u00ad equivalent to four Hudson Rivers \u00ad laden with materials washed from its farmlands.15 This flows into the Gulf of Mexico, which is the site of the nation's largest hypoxic (low oxygen) \"dead\" zone.4 The majority of U.S. estuaries are moderately to highly eutrophic.16\nLinks between discharge and sediment transport are well established,17 and cost estimates for in-stream and off-stream damages from soil erosion range from $2.1 to $10 billion per year.18,19 These estimates include costs associated with damages to, or losses of, recreation, water storage, navigation, commercial fishing, and property, but do not include costs of biological impacts.18 Sediment transport, with accompanying nutrients, can play a positive role in the shoreline dynamics of coastlines and the life cycles of coastal and marine plants and animals. However, many commercially and recreationally important fish species such as salmon and trout that lay their eggs in the gravel at the edges of streams are especially sensitive to elevated sediment fluxes in rivers.20 Sediment loading in lakes has been shown to have substantial detrimental effects\non fish population sizes, community composition, and biodiversity.21\n\n\u00a9 Tim Fitzharris/Minden Pictures/Corbis\n\nDissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes to rivers and lakes are strongly driven by precipitation;22 thus in many regions where precipitation is expected to increase, DOC loading will also increase. Dissolved organic carbon is the substance that gives many rivers and lakes a brown, tea-colored look. Precipitation-driven increases in DOC concentration not only increase the cost of water treatment for municipal use,23 but also alter the ability of sunlight to act as nature's water treatment plant. For example, Cryptosporidium, a pathogen potentially lethal to the elderly, babies, and people with compromised immune systems, is present in 17% of drinking water supplies sampled\n\n197\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f8: ECOSYSTEMS, BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\n\nin the United States.24 This pathogen is inactivated by doses of ultraviolet (UV) light equivalent to less than a day of sun exposure.25 Similarly, UV exposures reduce fungal parasites that infect Daphnia, a keystone aquatic grazer and food source for fish.26 Increasing DOC concentrations may thus reduce the ability of sunlight to regulate these UV-sensitive parasites.\nFew studies have projected the impacts of climate change on nitrogen, phosphorus, sediment, or DOC transport from the land to rivers. However, given the tight link between river discharge and all of these potential pollutants, areas of the United States that are projected to see increases in precipitation, and increases in intense rainfalls, like the Northeast, Midwest, and mountainous West,27 will also see increases in excess nutrients, DOC, and sediments transported to rivers. One of the few future projections available suggests that downstream and coastal impacts of increased nitrogen inputs could be profound for the Mississippi Basin. Under a scenario in which atmospheric CO2 reaches double preindustrial levels, a 20% increase in river discharge is expected\n\nto lead to higher nitrogen loads and a 50% increase in algae growth in the Gulf of Mexico, a 30% to 60% decrease in deepwater dissolved oxygen concentration, and an expansion of the dead zone.28 A recent comprehensive assessment10 shows that, while climate is an important driver, nitrogen carried by rivers to the oceans is most strongly driven by fertilizer inputs to the land. Therefore, in the highly productive agricultural systems of the Mississippi Basin, the ultimate impact of more precipitation on the expansion of the dead zone will depend on agricultural management practices in the Basin.14,29\nRising air temperatures can also lead to declines in water quality through a different set of processes. Some large lakes, including the Great Lakes, are warming rapidly.30 Warmer surface waters can stimulate blooms of harmful algae in both lakes and coastal oceans,9 which may include toxic cyanobacteria that are favored at higher temperatures.31 Harmful algal blooms, which are caused by many factors, including climate change, exact a cost in freshwater degradation of approximately $2.2 billion annually in the United States alone.32\n\nWater Supplies Projected to Decline\n\nFigure 8.1. Climate change is projected to reduce the ability of ecosystems to supply water in some parts of the country. This is true in areas where precipitation is projected to decline, and even in some areas where precipitation is expected to increase. Compared\nto 10% of counties today, by 2050, 32% of counties will be at high or extreme risk of water shortages. Projections assume continued\nincreases in greenhouse gas emissions through 2050 and a slow decline thereafter (A1B scenario). Numbers in parentheses indicate number of counties in each category.

Hurricanes illustrate the links among precipitation, discharge and nutrient loading to coastal waters. Hurricanes bring intense rainfall to coastal regions, and ensuing runoff leads to blooms of algae. These blooms contribute to dead zone formation after they die and decompose. Photo above shows Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, after Hurricane Floyd. Note light green area off the coast, which is new algae growth. The graph on the left shows a steep drop in salinity of ocean water due to the large influx of freshwater from rain after a series of hurricanes. Red arrows indicate Hurricanes Dennis, Floyd, and Irene, which hit sequentially during the 1999 hurricane season. The graph on the right shows a steep rise in the amount of surface chlorophyll after these hurricanes, largely due to increased algae growth. (Figure source: (top) NASA SeaWiFS; (bottom) Paerl et al. 200333).\nKey Message 2: Extreme Events\n\nClimate change, combined with other stressors, is overwhelming the capacity of ecosystems to buffer the impacts from extreme events like fires, floods, and storms.\n\nEcosystems play an important role in \"buffering\" the effects of extreme climate conditions (floods, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes) on the movement of materials and the flow of energy through the environment.34 Climate change and human modifications often increase the vulnerability of ecosystems and landscapes to damage from extreme events while at the same time reducing their natural capacity to modulate the impacts of such events. Salt marshes, reefs, mangrove forests, and barrier islands provide an ecosystem service of defending coastal ecosystems and infrastructure against storm surges.35 Losses of these natural features \u00ad from coastal development, erosion, and sea level rise \u00ad render coastal ecosystems and infrastructure more vulnerable to catastrophic damage during or after extreme events (Ch. 25: Coasts).36 Floodplain wetlands, although greatly reduced from their historical extent, provide an ecosystem service of absorbing floodwaters and reducing the impact of high flows on river-margin lands. In the Northeast, even a small sea level rise (1.6 feet) would dramatically\n\nincrease the numbers of people (47% increase) and property loss (73% increase) affected by storm surge in Long Island compared to present day storm surge impacts.37 Extreme weather events that produce sudden increases in water flow and the materials it carries can decrease the natural capacity of ecosystems to process pollutants, both by reducing the amount of time water is in contact with reactive sites and by removing or harming the plants and microbes that remove the pollutants.36\nWarming and, in some areas, decreased precipitation (along with past forest fire suppression practices) have increased the risk of fires exceeding historical size, resulting in unprecedented social and economic challenges. Large fires put people living in the wildland-urban interface at risk for health problems and property loss. In 2011 alone, more than 8 million acres burned in wildfires, causing 15 deaths and property losses greater than $1.9 billion.38\n\n199\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f8: ECOSYSTEMS, BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\n\nKey Message 3: Plants and Animals\n\nLandscapes and seascapes are changing rapidly, and species, including many iconic species, may disappear from regions where they have been prevalent or become extinct, altering some\nregions so much that their mix of plant and animal life will become almost unrecognizable.\n\nVegetation model projections suggest that much of the United States will experience changes in the composition of species characteristic of specific areas. Studies applying different models for a range of future climates project biome changes for about 5% to 20% of the land area of the U.S. by 2100.4,39 Many major changes, particularly in the western states and Alaska, will in part be driven by increases in fire frequency and severity. For example, the average time between fires in the Yellowstone National Park ecosystem is projected to decrease from 100 to 300 years to less than 30 years, potentially causing coniferous (pine, spruce, etc.) forests to be replaced by woodlands and grasslands.40 Warming has also led to novel wildfire occurrence in ecosystems where it has been absent in recent history, such as arctic Alaska and the southwestern deserts where new fires are fueled by non-native annual grasses (Ch. 20: Southwest; Ch. 22: Alaska). Extreme weather conditions linked to sea ice decline in 2007 led to the ignition of the Anaktuvuk River Fire, which burned more than 380 square miles of arctic tundra that had not been disturbed by fire for more than 3,000 years.41 This one fire (which burned deeply into organic peat soils) released enough carbon to the atmosphere to offset all of the carbon taken up by the entire arctic tundra biome over the past quarter-century.42\nIn addition to shifts in species assemblages, there will also be changes in species distributions. In recent decades, in both land and aquatic environments, plants and animals have moved to higher elevations at a median rate of 36 feet (0.011 kilometers) per decade, and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 10.5 miles (16.9 kilometers) per decade.43 As the climate continues to change, models and long-term studies project even greater shifts in species ranges.44 However, many species may not be able to keep pace with climate change for several reasons, for example because their seeds do not disperse widely or because they have limited mobility, thus leading, in some places, to local extinctions of both plants and animals. Both range shifts and local extinctions will, in many places, lead to large changes in the mix of plants and animals present in the local ecosystem, resulting in new communities that bear little resemblance to those of today.4,8,45,46\nSome of the most obvious changes in the landscape are occurring at the boundaries between biomes. These include shifts in the latitude and elevation of the boreal (northern) forest/tundra boundary in Alaska;47 elevation shifts of the boreal and subalpine forest/tundra boundary in the Sierra Nevada, California;48 an elevation shift of the temperate broadleaf/conifer boundary in the Green Mountains, Vermont,49 the shift of temperate the shrubland/conifer forest\n\nboundary in Bandelier National Monument, New Mexico,50 and upslope shifts of the temperate mixed forest/conifer boundary in Southern California.51 All of these are consistent with recent climatic trends and represent visible changes, like tundra switching to forest, or conifer forest switching to broadleaf forest or even to shrubland.\nAs temperatures rise and precipitation patterns change, many fish species (such as salmon, trout, whitefish, and char) will be lost from lower-elevation streams, including a projected loss of 47% of habitat for all trout species in the western U.S. by 2080.8 Similarly, in the oceans, transitions from cold-water fish communities to warm-water communities have occurred in commercially important harvest areas,52 with new industries developing in response to the arrival of new species.53 Also, warm surface waters are driving some fish species to deeper waters.54,55\nWarming is likely to increase the ranges of several invasive plant species in the United States,56 increase the probability of establishment of invasive plant species in boreal forests in south-central Alaska, including the Kenai Peninsula,57 and expand the range of the hemlock wooly adelgid, an insect that has killed many eastern hemlocks in recent years.58 Invasive species costs to the U.S. economy are estimated at $120 billion per year,59 including substantial impacts on ecosystem services. For instance, the yellow star-thistle, a wildland pest which is predicted to thrive with increased atmospheric CO2,60 currently costs California ranchers and farmers $17 million in forage and control efforts61 and $75 million in water losses.62 Iconic desert species such as saguaro cactus are damaged or killed by fires fueled by non-native grasses, leading to a largescale transformation of desert shrubland into grassland in many of the familiar landscapes of the American West.63 Bark beetles have infested extensive areas of the western United States and Canada, killing stands of temperate and boreal conifer forest across areas greater than any other outbreak in the last 125 years.64 Climate change has been a major causal factor, with higher temperatures allowing more beetles to survive winter, complete two life cycles in a season rather than one, and to move to higher elevations and latitudes.64,65 Bark beetle outbreaks in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem are occurring in habitats where outbreaks either did not previously occur or were limited in scale.66\nIt is important to realize that climate change is linked to far more dramatic changes than simply altering species' life cycles or shifting their ranges. Several species have exhibited population declines linked to climate change, with some declines so\n\n200\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f8: ECOSYSTEMS, BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\n\nsevere that species are threatened with extinction.67 Perhaps the most striking impact of climate change is its effect on iconic species such as the polar bear, the ringed seal, and coral species (Ch. 22: Alaska; Ch. 24: Oceans). In 2008, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) was listed as a threatened species, with the\n\nprimary cause of its decline attributed to climate change.68 In\n2012, NOAA determined that four subspecies of the ringed\nseal (Phoca hispida) were threatened or endangered, with the primary threat being climate change.69   \n\nKey Message 4: Seasonal Patterns\n\nTiming of critical biological events, such as spring bud burst, emergence from overwintering, and the start of migrations, has shifted, leading to important impacts on species and habitats.\n\nThe effect of climate change on phenology \u00ad the pattern of seasonal life cycle events in plants and animals, such as timing of leaf-out, blooming, hibernation, and migration \u00ad has been called a \"globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts\" on plants and animals.70 Observed long-term trends towards shorter, milder winters and earlier spring thaws are altering the timing of critical spring events such as bud burst and emergence from overwintering. This can cause plants and animals to be so out of phase with their natural phenology that outbreaks of pests occur, or species cannot find food at the time they emerge.\n\nlengthening. A longer growing season will benefit some crops\nand natural species, but there may be a timing mismatch\nbetween the microbial activity that makes nutrients available\nin the soil and the readiness of plants to take up those nutrients for growth.78,79 Where plant phenology is driven by day length,\nan advance in spring may exacerbate this mismatch, causing\navailable nutrients to be leached out of the soil rather than absorbed and recycled by plants.80 Longer growing seasons\nalso exacerbate human allergies. For example, a longer fall\nallows for bigger ragweed plants that produce more pollen later into the fall (see also Ch. 9: Health).81\n\nRecent studies have documented an advance in the timing of springtime phenological events across species in response to increased temperatures.71 Long-term observations of lilac flowering indicate that the onset of spring has advanced one day earlier per decade across the northern hemisphere in response to increased winter and spring temperatures72 and by 1.5 days per decade earlier in the western United States.73 Other multi-decadal studies for plant species have documented similar trends for early flowering.74,75 In addition, plant-pollinator relationships may be disrupted by changes in nectar and pollen availability, as the timing of bloom shifts in response to temperature and precipitation.76,77\nAs spring is advancing and fall is being delayed in response to regional changes in climate,78 the growing season is\n\nChanges in the timing of springtime bird migrations are wellrecognized biological responses to warming, and have been documented in the western,82 midwestern,83 and eastern United States.84,85 Some migratory birds now arrive too late for the peak of food resources at breeding grounds because temperatures at wintering grounds are changing more slowly than at spring breeding grounds.86\nIn a 34-year study of an Alaskan creek, young pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) migrated to the sea increasingly earlier over time.87 In Alaska, warmer springs have caused earlier onset of plant emergence, and decreased spatial variation in growth and availability of forage to breeding caribou (Rangifer tarandus).\n\nKey Message 5: Adaptation\n\nWhole system management is often more effective than focusing on one species at a time, and can help reduce the harm to wildlife, natural assets, and human well-being that climate disruption might cause.\n\nAdaptation in the context of biodiversity and natural resource\nmanagement is fundamentally about managing change, which is an inherent property of natural ecosystems.4,88,89\nOne strategy \u00ad adaptive management, which is a structured\nprocess of flexible decision-making under uncertainty that\nincorporates learning from management outcomes \u00ad has\nreceived renewed attention as a tool for helping resource\nmanagers make decisions relevant to whole systems in response to climate change.89,90 Other strategies tinclude assessments of vulnerability and impacts,91 and scenario planning,92 that can\n\nbe assembled into a general planning process that is flexible and iterative.\nGuidance on adaptation planning for conservation has proliferated at the federal92,93,94 and state levels,95 and often emphasizes cooperation between scientists and managers.94,96,97 Ecosystem-based adaptation98,99 uses \"biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change.\"99 An example is the explicit use of\n\n201\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f8: ECOSYSTEMS, BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\n\nstorm-buffering coastal wetlands or mangroves rather than preferred habitat and making vulnerability assessments. Often\n\nbuilt infrastructure like seawalls or levies to protect coastal regions (Ch. 25: Coasts).100 An additional example is the use of wildlife corridors to connect fragmented wildlife habitat.101\n\nit could be specific life history stages that are the weak point in the species, and it is key to identify those weak links.106\n\nWhile there is considerable uncertainty about how climate\n\nAdaptation strategies to protect biodiversity include: 1) habitat change will play out in particular locations, proactive measures manipulation, 2) conserving populations with higher genetic can be taken to both plan for connectivity96,107 and to identify\n\ndiversity or more flexible behaviors or morphologies, 3) re- places or habitats that may in the future become valuable planting with species or ecotypes that are better suited for habitat as a result of climate change and vegetation shifts.108\n\nfuture climates, 4) managed relocation (sometimes referred to It is important to note that when the Endangered Species Act\n\nas assisted migration) to help move species and populations (ESA) was passed in 1973, climate change was not a known\n\nfrom current locations to those areas expected to become\nmore suitable in the future, and 5) offsite conservation such as seed banking, biobanking, and captive breeding.92,94,96,97,102,103\n\nthreat or factor and was not considered in setting recovery goals or critical habitat designations.109 However, agencies are\nactively working to include climate change considerations in\n\nAdditional approaches focus on identifying and protecting their ESA implementation activities.\n\nfeatures that are important for biodiversity and are less\n\nlikely to be altered by climate change.

In particular, not only will climate change make it difficult to achieve existing conservation goals, it will demand that goals be critically examined and potentially altered in dramatic ways.102,105 Climate changes can also severely diminish the effectiveness of current strategies and require fresh approaches. For example, whereas establishing networks of nature reserves has been a standard approach to protecting species, fixed networks of reserve do not lend themselves to adjustments for climate change.105 Finally, migratory species and species with complex life histories cannot be simply addressed by defining\n\nFigure 8.3. Iterative approaches to conservation planning require input and\ncommunication among many players to ensure flexibility in response to climate change.

Some rare threatened and endangered species, like the Jemez salamander, were damaged by this unusually severe fire.110 Fires are often part of the natural disturbance regime, but if drought, poor management, and high temperatures combine, a fire can be so severe and widespread that species are damaged that otherwise might even be considered to be fire tolerant (such as spotted owls). Following the fires, heavy rainstorms led to major flooding and erosion, including at least ten debris flows. Popular recreation areas were evacuated and floods damaged the newly renovated, multi-million dollar U.S. Park Service Visitor Center at Bandelier National Monument. Sediment and ash eroded by the floods were washed downstream into the Rio Grande, which supplies 50% of the drinking water for Albuquerque, the largest city in New Mexico. Water withdrawals by the city from the Rio Grande were stopped entirely for a week and reduced for several months due to the increased cost of treatment.\nThese fires provide an example of how forest ecosystems, biodiversity, and ecosystem services are affected by the impacts of climate change, other environmental stresses, and past management practices. Higher temperatures, reduced snowpack, and earlier onset of springtime are leading to increases in wildfire in the western United States,111 while extreme droughts are becoming more frequent.112 In addition, climate change is affecting naturally occurring bark beetles: warmer winter conditions allow these pests to breed more frequently and successfully.113,114 The dead trees left behind by bark beetles may make crown fires more likely, at least until needles fall from killed trees.114,115 Forest management practices also have made the forests more vulnerable to catastrophic fires. In New Mexico, even-aged, second-growth forests were hit hardest because they are much denser than naturally occurring forest and consequently consume more water from the soil and increase the availability of dry above-ground fuel.\n\nBiological responses to climate change\n\nFigure 8.4. Map of selected observed and projected biological responses to climate change across the United States. Case studies listed below correspond to observed responses (black icons on map) and projected responses (white icons on map, bold italicized statements). In general, because future climatic changes are projected to exceed those experienced in the recent past, projected biological impacts tend to be of greater magnitude than recent observed changes. Because the observations and projections presented here are not paired (that is, they are not for the same species or systems), that general difference is not illustrated. (Figure source: Staudinger et al., 20124).\n\nContinued\n203\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f8: ECOSYSTEMS, BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\nBiological responses to climate change (continued)\n1. Mussel and barnacle beds have declined or disappeared along parts of the Northwest coast due to higher temperatures and drier conditions that have compressed habitable intertidal space.116\n2. Northern flickers arrived at breeding sites earlier in the Northwest in response to temperature changes along migration routes, and egg laying advanced by 1.15 days for every degree increase in temperature, demonstrating that this species has the capacity to adjust their phenology in response to climate change.117\n3. Conifers in many western forests have experienced mortality rates of up to 87% from warming-induced changes in the prevalence of pests and pathogens and stress from drought.118\n4. Butterflies that have adapted to specific oak species have not been able to colonize new tree species when climate change-induced tree migration changes local forest types, potentially hindering adaptation.119\n5. In response to climate-related habitat change, many small mammal species have altered their elevation ranges, with lower-elevation species expanding their ranges and higher-elevation species contracting their ranges.120\n6. Northern spotted owl populations in Arizona and New Mexico are projected to decline during the next century and are at high risk for extinction due to hotter, drier conditions, while the southern California population is not projected to be sensitive to future climatic changes.121\n7. Quaking aspen-dominated systems are experiencing declines in the western U.S. after stress due to climateinduced drought conditions during the last decade.122\n8. Warmer and drier conditions during the early growing season in high-elevation habitats in Colorado are disrupting the timing of various flowering patterns, with potential impacts on many important plant-pollinator relationships.77\n9. Population fragmentation of wolverines in the northern Cascades and Rocky Mountains is expected to increase as spring snow cover retreats over the coming century.123\n10. Cutthroat trout populations in the western U.S. are projected to decline by up to 58%, and total trout habitat in the same region is projected to decline by 47%, due to increasing temperatures, seasonal shifts in precipitation, and negative interactions with non-native species.8\n11. Comparisons of historical and recent first flowering dates for 178 plant species from North Dakota showed significant shifts occurred in over 40% of species examined, with the greatest changes observed during the two warmest years of the study.75\n12. Variation in the timing and magnitude of precipitation due to climate change was found to decrease the nutritional quality of grasses, and consequently reduce weight gain of bison in the Konza Prairie in Kansas and the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma.124 Results provide insight into how climate change will affect grazer population dynamics in the future.\n13. (a and b) Climatic fluctuations were found to influence mate selection and increase the probability of infidelity in birds that are normally socially monogamous, increasing the gene exchange and the likelihood of offspring survival.125\n14. Migratory birds monitored in Minnesota over a 40-year period showed significantly earlier arrival dates, particularly in short-distance migrants, indicating that some species are capable of responding to increasing winter temperatures better than others.126\n15. Up to 50% turnover in amphibian species is projected in the eastern U.S. by 2100, including the northern leopard frog, which is projected to experience poleward and elevational range shifts in response to climatic changes in the latter quarter of the century.127\n16. Studies of black ratsnake (Elaphe obsoleta) populations at different latitudes in Canada, Illinois, and Texas suggest that snake populations, particularly in the northern part of their range, could benefit from rising temperatures if there are no negative impacts on their habitat and prey.128\n17. Warming-induced hybridization was detected between southern and northern flying squirrels in the Great Lakes region of Ontario, Canada, and in Pennsylvania after a series of warm winters created more overlap in their habitat range, potentially acting to increase population persistence under climate change.129\n\nContinued\n204\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f8: ECOSYSTEMS, BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES\nBiological responses to climate change (continued)\n18. Some warm-water fishes have moved northwards, and some tropical and subtropical fishes in the northern Gulf of Mexico have increased in temperate ocean habitat.130 Similar shifts and invasions have been documented in Long Island Sound and Narragansett Bay in the Atlantic.131\n19. Global marine mammal diversity is projected to decline at lower latitudes and increase at higher latitudes due to changes in temperatures and sea ice, with complete loss of optimal habitat for as many as 11 species by midcentury; seal populations living in tropical and temperate waters are particularly at risk to future declines.132\n20. Higher nighttime temperatures and cumulative seasonal rainfalls were correlated with changes in the arrival times of amphibians to wetland breeding sites in South Carolina over a 30-year time period (1978-2008).133\n21. Seedling survival of nearly 20 resident and migrant tree species decreased during years of lower rainfall in the Southern Appalachians and the Piedmont areas, indicating that reductions in native species and limited replacement by invading species were likely under climate change.134\n22. Widespread declines in body size of resident and migrant birds at a bird-banding station in western Pennsylvania were documented over a 40-year period; body sizes of breeding adults were negatively correlated with mean regional temperatures from the preceding year.85\n23. Over the last 130 years (1880-2010), native bees have advanced their spring arrival in the northeastern U.S. by an average of 10 days, primarily due to increased warming. Plants have also showed a trend of earlier blooming, thus helping preserve the synchrony in timing between plants and pollinators.135\n24. In the Northwest Atlantic, 24 out of 36 commercially exploited fish stocks showed significant range (latitudinal and depth) shifts between 1968 and 2007 in response to increased sea surface and bottom temperatures.55\n25. Increases in maximum, and decreases in the annual variability of, sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean have promoted growth of small phytoplankton and led to a reorganization in the species composition of primary (phytoplankton) and secondary (zooplankton) producers.136\n26. Changes in female polar bear reproductive success (decreased litter mass and numbers of yearlings) along the north Alaska coast have been linked to changes in body size and/or body condition following years with lower availability of optimal sea ice habitat.137\n27. Water temperature data and observations of migration behaviors over a 34-year time period showed that adult pink salmon migrated earlier into Alaskan creeks, and fry advanced the timing of migration out to sea. Shifts in migration timing may increase the potential for a mismatch in optimal environmental conditions for early life stages, and continued warming trends will likely increase pre-spawning mortality and egg mortality rates.87\n28. Warmer springs in Alaska have caused earlier onset of plant emergence, and decreased spatial variation in growth and availability of forage to breeding caribou. This ultimately reduced calving success in caribou populations.138\n29. Many Hawaiian mountain vegetation types were found to vary in their sensitivity to changes in moisture availability; consequently, climate change will likely influence elevation-related vegetation patterns in this region.139\n30. Sea level is predicted to rise by 1.6 to 3.3 feet in Hawaiian waters by 2100, consistent with global projections of 1 to 4 feet of sea level rise (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10). This is projected to increase wave heights, the duration of turbidity, and the amount of re-suspended sediment in the water; consequently, this will create potentially stressful conditions for coral reef communities.140\n\n\u00a9 Stephen Dalton/Minden Pictures/Corbis \u00a9 Jenny E.

Technical inputs (127) on a wide range of topics related to ecosystems were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nClimate change impacts on ecosystems reduce their ability to improve water quality and regulate water flows.\nDescription of evidence base The author team digested the contents of more than 125 technical input reports on a wide array of topics to arrive at this key message. The foundational Technical Input Report4 was the primary source used.\nStudies have shown that increasing precipitation is already resulting in declining water quality in many regions of the country, particularly by increasing nitrogen loading.10,11,12,13,14 This is because the increases in flow can pick up and carry greater loads of nutrients like nitrogen to rivers.11,12,13,14\nOne model for the Mississippi River Basin, based on a doubling of CO2, projects that increasing discharge and nitrogen loading will lead to larger algal blooms in the Gulf of Mexico and a larger dead zone.28 The Gulf of Mexico is the recipient system for the Mississippi Basin, receiving all of the nitrogen that is carried downriver but not removed by river processes, wetlands, or other ecosystems.\nSeveral models project that declining streamflow, due to the combined effects of climate change and water withdrawals, will cause local extinctions of fish and other aquatic organisms,7 particularly trout in the interior western U.S. (composite of 10 models, A1B\n\nscenario).8 The trout study8 is one of the few studies of impacts on fish that uses an emissions scenario and a combination of climate models. The researchers studied four different trout species. Although there were variations among species, their overall conclusion was robust across species for the composite model.\nWater quality can also be negatively affected by increasing temperatures. There is widespread evidence that warmer lakes can promote the growth of harmful algal blooms, which produce toxins.31\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Recent research has improved understanding of the relative importance of the effects of climate and human actions (for example, fertilization) on nitrogen losses from watersheds,10,12 and how the interactions between climate and human actions (for example, water withdrawals) will affect fish populations in the west.7,8 However, few studies have projected the impacts of future climate change on water quality. Given the tight link between river discharge and pollutants, only areas of the U.S. that are projected to see increases in precipitation will see increases in pollutant transport to rivers. It is also important to note that pollutant loading \u00ad for example, nitrogen fertilizer use \u00ad is often more important as a driver of water pollution than climate.10,12\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and uncertainties, there is high confidence that climate change impacts on ecosystems reduce their ability to improve water quality and regulate water flows.\nIt is well established that precipitation and associated river discharge are major drivers of water pollution in the form of excess nutrients, sediment, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transport into rivers. Increases in precipitation in many regions of the country are therefore contributing to declines in water quality in those areas. However, those areas of the country that will see reduced precipitation may experience water-quality improvement; thus, any lack of agreement on future water-quality impacts of climate change may be due to locational differences.\n\n216\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f8: ECOSYSTEMS, BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TRACEABLE ACCOUNTS\n\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent\nresults, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods\nvary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nClimate change, combined with other stressors, is overwhelming the capacity of ecosystems to buffer the impacts from extreme events like fires, floods, and storms.\nDescription of evidence base The author team digested the contents of more than 125 technical input reports on a wide array of topics to arrive at this key message. The foundational Technical Input Report4 was the primary source used.\nFires: Climate change has increased the potential for extremely large fires with novel social, economic, and environmental impacts. In 2011, more than 8 million acres burned, with significant human mortality and property damage ($1.9 billion).38 Warming and decreased precipitation have made fire-prone ecosystems more vulnerable to \"mega-fires\" \u00ad large fires that are unprecedented in their social, economic, and environmental impacts. Large fires put people living in the urban-wildland interface at risk for health problems and property loss.\nFloods: Natural ecosystems such as salt marshes, reefs, mangrove forests, and barrier islands defend coastal ecosystems and infrastructure against flooding due to storm surges. The loss of these natural features due to coastal development, erosion, and sea level rise render coastal ecosystems and infrastructure more vulnerable to catastrophic damage during or after extreme events (see Ch. 25: Coasts).36 Floodplain wetlands, which are also vul-\n\nnerable to loss by inundation, absorb floodwaters and reduce the impact of high flows on river-margin lands. In the Northeast, a sea level rise of 1.6 feet (within the range of 1 to 4 feet projected for 2100; Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 9) will dramatically increase impacts of storm surge on people (47% increase) and property loss (73% increase) in Long Island.37\nStorms: Natural ecosystems have a capacity to buffer extreme weather events that produce sudden increases in water flow and materials. These events reduce the amount of time water is in contact with sites that support the plants and microbes that remove pollutants (Chapter 25: Coasts).36\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A new analytical framework was recently developed to generate insights into the interactions among the initial state of ecosystems, the type and magnitude of disturbance, and effects of disturbance.34 Progress in understanding these relationships is critical for predicting how human activities and climate change, including extreme events like droughts, floods, and storms, will interact to affect ecosystems.\nUncertainties: The ability of ecosystems to buffer extreme events is extremely difficult to assess and quantify, as it requires understanding of complex ecosystem responses to very rare events. However, it is clear that the loss of this buffering ecosystem service is having important effects on coastal and fire-prone ecosystems across the United States.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and uncertainties, there is high confidence that climate change, combined with other stressors, is overwhelming the capacity of ecosystems to buffer the impacts from extreme events like droughts, floods, and storms.\nEcosystem responses to climate change will vary regionally. For example, whether salt marshes and mangroves will be able to accrue sediment at rates sufficient to keep ahead of sea level rise and maintain their protective function will vary by region.\nClimate has been the dominant factor controlling burned area during the 20th century, even during periods of fire suppression by forest management,40,111 and the area burned annually has increased steadily over the last 20 years concurrent with warming and/or drying climate. Warming and decreased precipitation have also made fire-prone ecosystems more vulnerable to \"mega-fires\" \u00ad large fires that are unprecedented in their social, economic, and environmental impacts. Large fires put people living in the urbanwildland interface at risk for health problems and property loss. In 2011 alone, 8.3 million acres burned in wildfires, causing 15 deaths and property losses greater than $1.9 billion.38\n\n217\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f8: ECOSYSTEMS, BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TRACEABLE ACCOUNTS\n\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nLandscapes and seascapes are changing rapidly, and species, including many iconic species, may disappear from regions where they have been prevalent or become extinct, altering some regions so much that their mix of plant and animal life will become almost unrecognizable.\nDescription of evidence base The analysis for the Technical Input Report applied a range of future climate scenarios and projected biome changes across 5% to about 20% of the land area in the U.S. by 2100.4 Other analyses support these projections.39 Studies predict that wildfire will be a major driver of change in some areas, including Yellowstone National Park40 and the Arctic.41 These biome shifts will be associated with changes in species distributions.43\nEvidence indicates that the most obvious changes will occur at the boundaries between ecosystems.47,48,49,51 Plants and animals are already moving to higher elevations and latitudes in response to climate change,43 with models projecting greater range shifts8,46 and local extinctions in the future, leading to new plant and animal communities that may be unrecognizable in some regions.4,45,46 One study on fish8 used global climate models (GCMs) simulating conditions in the 2040s and 2080s under the A1B emissions scenario, with the choice of models reflecting predictions of high and low climate warming as well as an ensemble of ten models. Their models additionally accounted for biotic interactions. In a second study, a 30-year baseline (1971-2000) and output from two GCMs under the A2 scenario (continued increases in global emissions) were used to develop climate variables that effectively predict present and future species ranges.46 Empirical data from the Sonoran Desert (n=39 plots) were used to evaluate species responses to past climate variability.\nIconic species: Wildfire is expected to damage and kill iconic desert species, including saguaro cactus.63 Bark beetle outbreaks, which have been exacerbated by climate change, are damaging extensive areas of temperate and boreal conifer forests that are characteristic of the western United States.64\nNew information and remaining uncertainties In addition to the Technical Input Report, more than 20 new studies of observed and predicted effects of climate change on biomes and species distribution were incorporated in the assessment.\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Based on the evidence base and uncertainties, confidence is high that familiar landscapes are changing so rapidly that iconic species may disappear from regions where they have been prevalent, altering some regions so much that their mix of plant and animal life will become almost unrecognizable. Many changes in species distribution have already occurred and will inevitably continue, resulting in the loss of familiar landscapes and the production of novel species assemblages.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nTiming of critical biological events, such as spring bud burst, emergence from overwintering, and the start of migrations, has shifted, leading to important impacts on species and habitats.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Ecosystems Technical Input, Phenology as a bio-indicator of climate change impacts on people and ecosystems: Towards an integrated national assessment approach.71 An additional 127 input reports, on a wide range of topics related to ecosystems, were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nMany studies have documented an advance in springtime phenological events of species in response to climate warming. For example, long-term observations of lilac flowering indicate that the onset of spring has advanced one day earlier per decade across the northern hemisphere in response to increased winter and spring temperatures, and by 1.5 days per decade earlier in the western United States.72,73 Other multi-decadal studies for plant species have documented similar trends for early flowering.74,75 Evidence suggests that insect emergence from overwintering may become out of sync with pollen sources,77 and that the beginning of bird and fish migrations are shifting.82,83,84,85,86,87\nNew information and remaining uncertainties In addition to the Ecosystems Technical Input71 many new studies have been conducted since the previous National Climate Assessment,141 contributing to our understanding of the impacts of climate change on phenological events. Many studies, in many areas, have shown significant changes in phenology, including spring bud burst, emergence from overwintering, and migration shifts.\n\nWhile changes in ecosystem structure and biodiversity, including the distribution of iconic species, are occurring and are highly likely to continue, the impact of these changes on ecosystem services is unclear, that is, there is uncertainty about the impact that loss of familiar landscapes will have on people.\n\nA key uncertainty is \"phase effects\" where organisms are so out of phase with their natural phenology that outbreaks of pests occur, species emerge and cannot find food, or pollination is disrupted. This will vary with specific species and is therefore very difficult to predict.70\n\n218\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f8: ECOSYSTEMS, BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TRACEABLE ACCOUNTS\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and uncertainties, there is very high confidence that the timing of critical events, such as spring bud burst, emergence from overwintering, and the start of migrations, has shifted, leading to important impacts on species and habitats. \nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nWhole system management is often more effective than focusing on one species at a time, and can help reduce the harm to wildlife, natural assets, and human well-being that climate disruption might cause.\nDescription of evidence base Adaptation planning for conservation at federal92,93,94 and state levels,95 is focused on cooperation between scientists and managers.34,94,96,97 Development of ecosystem-based whole system management98 utilizes concepts about \"biodiversity and ecosystem services to help people adapt to climate change.\"99 An example is the use of coastal wetlands or mangroves rather than built infrastructure like seawalls or levees to protect coastal regions from storms (Chapter 25: Coasts).100\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Adaptation strategies to protect biodiversity include: 1) habitat manipulations, 2) conserving populations with higher genetic diversity or more plastic behaviors or morphologies, 3) changing seed sources for re-planting to introduce species or ecotypes that are better suited for future climates, 4) managed relocation (sometimes referred to as assisted migration) to help move species and populations from current locations to those areas expected to become more suitable in the future, and 5) ex-situ conservation such as seed banking and captive breeding.92,94,96,97,102 Alternative approaches focus on identifying and protecting features that are important for biodiversity and are projected to be less altered by climate change. The idea is to conserve the physical conditions that contribute to high levels of biodiversity so that species and populations can find suitable areas in the future.104\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence and remaining uncertainties, there is very high confidence that ecosystem-based management approaches are increasingly prevalent, and provide options for reducing the harm to biodiversity, ecosystems, and the services they provide to society. The effectiveness of these actions is much less certain, however.\n\n219\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 9 HUMAN HEALTH\nConvening Lead Authors\nGeorge Luber, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Kim Knowlton, Natural Resources Defense Council and Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University\nLead Authors\nJohn Balbus, National Institutes of Health Howard Frumkin, University of Washington Mary Hayden, National Center for Atmospheric Research Jeremy Hess, Emory University Michael McGeehin, RTI International Nicky Sheats, Thomas Edison State College\nContributing Authors\nLorraine Backer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention C.

Climate change threatens human health and well-being in many ways, including impacts from increased extreme weather events, wildfire, decreased air quality, threats to mental health, and illnesses transmitted by food, water, and disease-carriers such as mosquitoes and ticks. Some of these health impacts are already underway in the United States.\n2. Climate change will, absent other changes, amplify some of the existing health threats the nation now faces. Certain people and communities are especially vulnerable, including children, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and some communities of color.\n3. Public health actions, especially preparedness and prevention, can do much to protect people from some of the impacts of climate change. Early action provides the largest health benefits. As threats increase, our ability to adapt to future changes may be limited.\n4. Responding to climate change provides opportunities to improve human health and well-being across many sectors, including energy, agriculture, and transportation. Many of these strategies offer a variety of benefits, protecting people while combating climate change and providing other societal benefits.\n\nClimate change, together with other natural and human-made health stressors, influences human health and disease in numerous ways. Some existing health threats will intensify and new health threats will emerge. Not everyone is equally at risk. Important considerations include age, economic resources, and location. Preventive and adaptive actions, such as setting up extreme weather early warning systems and improving water infrastructure, can reduce the severity of these impacts, but there are limits to the effectiveness of such actions in the face of some projected climate change threats.\nClimate change presents a global public health problem, with serious health impacts predicted to manifest in varying ways in different parts of the world. Public health in the U.S. can be affected by disruptions of physical, biological, and ecological systems, including disturbances originating in the U.S. and elsewhere. Health effects of these disruptions include increased respiratory and cardiovascular disease, injuries and premature deaths related to extreme weather events, changes in the prevalence and geographical distribution of food- and waterborne illnesses and other infectious diseases, and threats to mental health.\n\necosystem changes (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate); and rising sea levels that intensify coastal flooding and storm surge (Ch. 25: Coasts). Key drivers of vulnerability include the attributes of certain groups (age, socioeconomic status, race, current level of health \u00ad see Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples for examples of health impacts on vulnerable populations) and of place (floodplains, coastal zones, and urban areas), as well as the resilience of critical public health infrastructure. Multi-stressor situations, such as impacts on vulnerable populations following natural disasters that also damage the social and physical infrastructure necessary for resilience and emergency response, are particularly important to consider when preparing for the impacts of climate change on human health.\n\n\u00a9Jose Luis Pelaez, Inc./Blend Images/Corbis\n\nKey weather and climate drivers of health impacts include increasingly frequent, intense, and longer-lasting extreme heat, which worsens drought, wildfire, and air pollution risks; increasingly frequent extreme precipitation, intense storms, and changes in precipitation patterns that lead to drought and\n\n221\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH\n\nKey Message 1: Wide-ranging Health Impacts\n\nClimate change threatens human health and well-being in many ways, including impacts from increased extreme weather events, wildfire, decreased air quality, threats to mental health, and illnesses transmitted by food, water, and disease-carriers such as mosquitoes and ticks. Some of these health impacts are already underway in the United States.\n\n\u00a9National Geographic Society\n\nAir Pollution\nClimate change is projected to harm human health by increasing ground-level ozone and/or particulate matter air pollution in some locations. Ground-level ozone (a key component of smog) is associated with many health problems, such as diminished lung function, increased hospital admissions and emergency room visits for asthma, and increases in premature deaths.1,2,3 Factors that affect ozone formation include heat, concentrations of precursor chemicals, and methane emissions, while particulate matter concentrations are affected by wildfire emissions and air stagnation episodes, among other factors.4,5 By increasing these different factors, climate change is projected to lead to increased concentration of ozone and particulate matter in some regions.6,7,8,9 Increases in global temperatures could cause associated increases in premature certainty in the responses of airborne particles to climate deaths related to worsened ozone and particle pollution. Es- change than there is about the response of ozone. Health-retimates made assuming no change in regulatory controls or lated costs of the current effects of ozone air pollution exceedpopulation characteristics have ranged from 1,000 to 4,300 ing national standards have been estimated at $6.5 billion (in additional premature deaths nationally per year by 2050 from 2008 U.S. dollars) nationwide, based on a U.S. assessment of combined ozone and particle health effects.10,11 There is less health impacts from ozone levels during 2000 to 2002.12,13\n\nClimate Change Projected to Worsen Asthma\nFigure 9.1. Projected increases in temperature, changes in wind patterns, and ecosystem changes will all affect future ground-level ozone concentrations. Climate projections using an increasing emissions scenario (A2) suggest that ozone concentrations in the New York metropolitan region will increase because of future climate change. This figure shows the estimated increase in ozone-related emergency room visits for children in New York in the 2020s (compared to the mid-1990s) resulting from climate change related increases in ozone concentrations. The results from this modeling exercise are shown as a percent change in visits specifically attributed to ozone exposure. For example, the 10.2% increase in Suffolk County represents five additional emergency room visits that could be attributed to increased ozone exposure over the baseline of 46 ozone-related visits from the mid-1990s. In 2010, an estimated 25.7 million Americans had asthma, which has become a problem in every state. (Figure source: Sheffield et al. 201114).\n\nAllergens\nClimate change, resulting in more frost-free days and warmer seasonal air temperatures, can contribute to shifts in flowering time and pollen initiation from allergenic plant species, and increased CO2 by itself can elevate production of plant-based allergens.14,15,16,17,18,19 Higher pollen concentrations and longer pollen seasons can increase allergic sensitizations and asthma episodes,20,21,22 and diminish productive work and school days.19,22,23 Simultaneous exposure to toxic air pollutants can worsen allergic responses.24,25,26 Extreme rainfall and rising temperatures can also foster indoor air quality problems, including the growth of indoor fungi and molds, with increases in respiratory and asthma-related conditions.27 Asthma prevalence (the percentage of people who have ever been diagnosed with asthma and still have asthma) increased nationwide from 7.3% in 2001 to 8.4% in 2010. Asthma visits in primary care settings, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations were all stable from 2001 to 2009, and asthma death rates per 1,000 persons with asthma declined from 2001 to 2009.28 To the extent that increased pollen exposures occur, patients and their physicians will face increased challenges in maintaining adequate asthma control.\n\n222\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fRagweed Pollen Season Lengthens\n\n9: HUMAN HEALTH\n\n\u00a9Frans Lanting/Corbis\n\nWildfire Smoke has Widespread Health Effects\n\nFigure 9.2. Ragweed pollen season length has increased in central North America between 1995 and 2011 by as much as 11 to 27 days in parts of the U.S. and Canada in response to rising temperatures. Increases in the length of this allergenic pollen season are correlated with increases in the number of days before the first frost. As shown in the figure, the largest increases have been observed in northern cities.

Climate change is projected to increase the frequency of wildfire in certain regions of the United States (Ch. 7: Forests).17,29 Long\nperiods of record high temperatures are associated with droughts that contribute to dry conditions and drive wildfires in some areas.30\nWildfire smoke contains particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitro-\ngen oxides, and various volatile organic compounds (which are ozone precursors)31 and can significantly reduce air quality, both locally and in areas downwind of fires.32,33 Smoke exposure increases respiratory\nand cardiovascular hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and\nmedication dispensations for asthma, bronchitis, chest pain, chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease (commonly known by its acronym, COPD), respiratory infections, and medical visits for lung illnesses.32,34,35\nIt has been associated with hundreds of thousands of deaths annu-\nally, in an assessment of the global health risks from landscape fire smoke.32,34,36,37 Future climate change is projected to increase wildfire risks and associated emissions, with harmful impacts on health.17,38,39,40\n\nFigure 9.3. Wildfires, which are projected to increase in some regions due to climate change, have health impacts that can extend hundreds of miles. Shown here, forest fires in Quebec, Canada, during July 2002 (red circles) resulted in up to a 30-fold increase in airborne fine particle concentrations in Baltimore, Maryland, a city nearly a thousand miles downwind. These fine particles, which are extremely harmful to human health, not only affect outdoor air quality, but also penetrate indoors, increasing the longdistance effects of fires on health.41 An average of 6.4 million acres burned in U.S. wildfires each year between 2000 and 2010, with 9.5 and 9.1 million acres burned in 2006 and 2012, respectively.42 Total global deaths from the effects of landscape fire smoke have been estimated at 260,000 to 600,000 annually between the years 1997 and 2006.37 (Figure source: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument on the Terra satellite, Land Rapid Response Team, NASA/GSFC).\n\n223\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH\n\nTemperature Extremes\n\nExtreme heat events have long threatened public health in air conditioning for the U.S. population.55 However, extreme the United States.43,44,45 Many cities, including St. Louis, Phila- heat events remain a cause of preventable death nationwide.\n\ndelphia, Chicago, and Cincinnati, have suffered dramatic in- Urban heat islands, combined with an aging population and\n\ncreases in death rates during heat waves.

The maps show projected increases in the average temperature on the hottest days by late this century (2081-2100) relative to 1986-2005 under a scenario that assumes a rapid reduction in heat-trapping gases (RCP 2.6) and a scenario that assumes continued increases in these gases (RCP 8.5). The hottest days are those so hot they occur only once in 20 years. Across most of the continental United States, those days will be about 10\u00baF to 15\u00baF hotter in the future under the higher emissions scenario.

Floods extreme precipitation events when flooding occurs, other hazare the second deadliest of all weather-related hazards in the ards can often appear once a storm event has passed. Elevated United States, accounting for approximately 98 deaths per waterborne disease outbreaks have been reported in the weeks\n\n224\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH\n\nfollowing heavy rainfall,65 although other variables may affect these associations.66 Water intrusion into buildings can result\nin mold contamination that manifests later, leading to indoor\nair quality problems. Buildings damaged during hurricanes are\nespecially susceptible to water intrusion. Populations living in\ndamp indoor environments experience increased prevalence\nof asthma and other upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing67 as well as lower respiratory tract in-\nfections such as pneumonia, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and RSV pneumonia (see Figure 9.7).68\n\nAt the opposite end of precipitation extremes, drought also poses risks to public health and safety.69 Drought conditions may increase the environmental exposure to a broad set of health hazards including wildfires, dust storms, extreme heat events, flash flooding, degraded water quality, and reduced water quantity. Dust storms associated with drought conditions contribute to degraded air quality due to particulates and have been associated with increased incidence of Coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever), a fungal pathogen, in Arizona and California.70\n\nDisease Carried by Vectors\n\nClimate is one of the factors that influence the distribution of Infectious disease transmission is sensitive to local, small-scale\n\ndiseases borne by vectors (such as fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes, differences in weather, human modification of the landscape, which spread pathogens that cause illness).71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78 The the diversity of animal hosts,83 and human behavior that af-\n\ngeographic and seasonal distribution of vector populations, fects vector-human contact, among other factors. There is a\n\nand the diseases they can carry, depend not only on climate need for finer-scale, long-term studies to help quantify the\n\nbut also on land use, socioeconomic and cultural factors, pest relationships among weather variables, vector range, and\n\ncontrol, access to health care, and human responses to disease vector-borne pathogen occurrence, the consequences of shiftrisk, among other factors.72,73,79,80,81 Daily, seasonal, or year-to- ing distributions of vectors and pathogens, and the impacts on\n\nyear climate variability can sometimes result in vector/patho- human behavior. Enhanced vector surveillance and human dis-\n\ngen adaptation and shifts or expansions in their geographic ease tracking are needed to address these concerns. ranges.73,74,81 Such shifts can alter disease incidence depending\n\non vector-host interaction, host immunity, and pathogen evolution.71 North Americans are currently at risk from numerous vector-borne diseases, including Lyme,75,82,83,84 dengue fever,85 West Nile virus,86 Rocky Mountain spotted fever,87 plague, and tularemia.88 Vector-borne pathogens not currently found in the\n\nUnited States, such as chikungunya, Chagas disease, and Rift\n\nValley fever viruses, are also threats. Climate change effects\n\non the geographical distribution and incidence of vector-borne\n\ndiseases in other countries where these diseases are already\n\nfound can also affect North Americans, especially as a result\n\nof increasing trade with, and travel to, tropical and subtropical areas.74,81 Whether climate change in the U.S. will increase\n\nthe chances of domestically acquiring diseases such as dengue\n\nfever is uncertain, due to vector-control efforts and lifestyle factors, such as time spent indoors, that reduce human-insect contact.\n\nThe Culex tarsalis mosquito is a vector that transmits West Nile Virus.\n\nJames Gathany, CDC\n\nTransmission cycle of lyme disease\nThe development and survival of blacklegged ticks, their animal hosts, and the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, are strongly influenced by climatic factors, especially temperature, precipitation, and humidity. Potential impacts of climate change on the transmission of Lyme disease include: 1) changes in the geographic distribution of the disease due to the increase in favorable habitat for ticks to survive off their hosts;89 2) a lengthened transmission season due to earlier onset of higher temperatures in the spring and later onset of cold and frost; 3) higher tick densities leading to greater risk in areas where the disease is currently observed, due to milder winters and potentially larger rodent host populations; and 4) changes in human behaviors, including increased time outdoors, which may increase the risk of exposure to infected ticks.\n\n225\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fProjected Changes in Tick Habitat\n\n9: HUMAN HEALTH\n\nFigure 9.5. The maps show the current and projected probability of establishment of tick populations (Ixodes scapularis) that transmit Lyme disease. Projections are shown for 2020, 2050, and 2080. The projected expansion of tick habitat includes much of the eastern half of the country by 2080. For some areas around the Gulf Coast, the probability of tick population establishment is projected to decrease by 2080. (Figure source: adapted from Brownstein et al. 200590).\n\nFood- and Waterborne Diarrheal Disease\n\nDiarrheal disease is a major public health issue in developing by rapid snowmelt96 and changes in water treatment,97 have\n\ncountries and, while not generally increasing in the United also been shown to precede outbreaks.

Diarrheal diseases have also been found to occur more frequently in conjunction with both unusually high and low precipitation.95 Sporadic increases in streamflow rates, often preceded\n\nFigure 9.6. Maps show the increase in frequency of extreme daily precipitation events (a daily amount that now occurs just once in 20 years) by the later part of this century (2081-2100) compared to the latter part of the last century (1981-2000). Such extreme events are projected to occur more frequently everywhere in the United States. Under a rapid emissions reduction scenario (RCP 2.6), these events would occur nearly twice as often. For a scenario assuming continued increases in emissions (RCP 8.5), these events would occur up to five times as often. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n226\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH\nHeavy Downpours are Increasing Exposure to Disease\n\nFigure 9.7. Heavy downpours, which are increasing in the United States, have contributed to increases in heavy flood events (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 6). The figure above illustrates how people can become exposed to waterborne diseases. Human exposures to waterborne diseases can occur via drinking water, as well as recreational waters.100,101,102,103 (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\nHarmful Bloom of Algae\n\nFigure 9.8. Remote sensing color image of harmful algal bloom in Lake Erie on October 9, 2011. The bright green areas have high concentrations of algae, which can be harmful to human health. The frequency and range of harmful blooms of algae are increasing.102,103 Because algal blooms are closely related to climate factors, projected changes in climate could affect algal blooms and lead to increases in water- and food-borne exposures and subsequent cases of illness.103 Other factors related to increases in harmful algal blooms include shifts in ocean conditions such as excess nutrient inputs.101,102,103 (Figure source: NASA Earth Observatory104).\n\n227\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH\n\nFood Security\n\nGlobally, climate change is expected to threaten food produc- the nutritional value of some foods is projected to decline.\n\ntion and certain aspects of food quality, as well as food prices and distribution systems.

Certain people and communities are especially vulnerable, including\nchildren, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and some communities of color.\n\nClimate change will increase the risk of climate-related illness\nand death for a number of vulnerable groups in the United\nStates, as when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in\n2005. Children, primarily because of physiological and devel-\nopmental factors, will disproportionately suffer from the effects of heat waves,47 air pollution, infectious illness, and trauma resulting from extreme weather events.14,16,18,22,138,139,140,141\n\nThe country's older population also could be harmed more as\nthe climate changes. Older people are at much higher risk of dying during extreme heat events.45,47,139,142 Pre-existing health\nconditions also make older adults susceptible to cardiac and respiratory impacts of air pollution26 and to more severe consequences from infectious diseases;143 limited mobility among older adults can also increase flood-related health risks.144 Lim-\n\n228\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH\n\nited resources and an already high burden of chronic health conditions, including heart disease, obesity, and diabetes, will place the poor at higher risk of health impacts from climate change than higher income groups.26,47 Potential increases in food cost and limited availability of some foods will exacerbate current dietary inequalities and have significant health ramifications for the poorer segments of our population (Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples, Key Message 1).110,145\nClimate change will disproportionately affect low-income communities and some communities of color (Ch. 12: Indigenous\n\nPeoples, Key Message 2),139,149,151,152,153,154,155,156,157 raising environmental justice concerns. Existing health disparities153,158,159 and other inequities160,161 increase vulnerability. Climate\nchange related issues that have an equity component include\nheat waves, air quality, and extreme weather and climate\nevents. For example, Hurricane Katrina demonstrated how\nvulnerable certain groups of people were to extreme weather\nevents, because many low-income and of-color New Orleans\nresidents were killed, injured, or had difficulty evacuating and recovering from the storm.154,155,156,161,162,163,164\n\nElements of Vulnerability to Climate Change\n\nFigure 9.9. A variety of factors can increase the vulnerability of a specific demographic group to health effects due to climate change. For example, older adults are more vulnerable to heat stress because their bodies are less able to regulate their temperature. Overall population growth is projected to continue to at least 2050, with older adults comprising an increasing proportion of the population. Similarly, there are an increasing number of people who are obese and have diabetes, heart disease, or asthma, which makes them more vulnerable to a range of climate-related health impacts. Their numbers are also rising. The poor are less able to afford the kinds of measures that can protect them from and treat them for various health impacts. (Data from CDC; Health E-Stat; U.S. Census Bureau 2010, 2012; and Akinbami et al. 2011137).\n\n229\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH\nSocietal system failures during extreme events\nWe have already seen multiple system failures during an extreme weather event in the United States, as when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans.146 Infrastructure and evacuation failures and collapse of critical response services during a storm is one example of multiple system failures. Another example is a loss of electrical power during a heat wave or wildfires, which can reduce food and water safety.147 Air conditioning has helped reduce illness and death due to extreme heat,148 but if power is lost, everyone is vulnerable. By their nature, such events can exceed our capacity to respond.79 In succession, these events severely deplete our resources needed to respond, from the individual to the national scale, but disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations.149\nKatrina Diaspora\n\nFigure 9.10. This map illustrates the national scope of the dispersion of displaced people from Hurricane Katrina. It shows the location by zip code of the 800,000 displaced Louisiana residents who requested federal emergency assistance. The evacuees ended up dispersed across the entire nation, illustrating the wide-ranging impacts that can flow from extreme weather events, such as those that are projected to increase in frequency and/or intensity as climate continues to change (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 8). (Figure source: Kent 2006150).\n\nMultiple climate stressors and health\nClimate change impacts add to the cumulative stresses currently faced by vulnerable populations including children, the elderly, the poor, some communities of color, and people with chronic illnesses. These populations, and others living in certain places such as cities, floodplains, and coastlines, are more vulnerable not only to extreme events but also to ongoing, persistent climate-related threats. These threats include poor air quality, heat, drought, flooding, and mental health stress. Over time, the accumulation of these stresses will be increasingly harmful to these populations.\n\n230\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH\n\nKey Message 3: Prevention Provides Protection\n\nPublic health actions, especially preparedness and prevention, can do much to protect people from some of the impacts of climate change. Early action provides the largest health benefits.\nAs threats increase, our ability to adapt to future changes may be limited.\n\nPrevention is a central tenet of public health. Many conditions result in cost savings. For instance, heat wave early warning\n\nthat are difficult and costly to treat when a patient gets to the systems protect vulnerable groups very effectively and are\n\ndoctor could be prevented before they occur at a fraction of much less expensive than treating and coping with heat illness-\n\nthe cost.

When asked about\n\nActivities that reduce carbon pollution often also provide cobenefits in the form of preventive health measures. For exam-\n\nclimate change impacts, Americans do not mention health impacts,178 and when asked about health impacts specifically, most believe it will affect people in a different time or place.179\n\nple, reliance on cleaner energy sources for electricity production174 and more efficient and active transport, like biking or walking,175 can have immediate public health benefits, through\nimproved air quality and lowered rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.176 Reducing carbon pollution also reduces\n\nBut diverse groups of Americans find information on health\nimpacts to be helpful once received, particularly information\nabout the health benefits of mitigation (reducing carbon emissions) and adaptation.180\n\nlong-term adverse climate-health impacts, thus producing cost Determining which types of prevention to invest in (such as savings in the near and longer term.176 Preventing exposures to monitoring, early warning systems, and land-use changes that\n\nother climate-sensitive impacts already apparent can similarly reduce the impact of heat and floods) depends on several\n\nfactors, including health problems common to that\n\nLarge-scale environmental\nchange favors disease emergence\n\nparticular area, vulnerable populations, the preven-\ntive health systems already in place, and the expected impacts of climate change.181 Local capacity to adapt\nis very important; unfortunately the most vulnerable\n\npopulations also frequently have limited resources for\n\nClimate change is causing large-scale changes in the environ- managing climate-health risks.\n\nment, increasing the likelihood of the emergence or reemergence of unfamiliar disease threats.170 Factors include shifting ranges of disease-carrying pests, lack of immunity and preparedness, inadequate disease monitoring, and increasing global travel. Diseases including Lyme disease and dengue fever pose increasing health threats to the U.S. population; the number of U.S. patients hospitalized with dengue fever more than tripled from 2000 to 2007.171 Although most cases of dengue fever during that time period were acquired outside the contiguous United States, the introduction of infected people into areas where the dengue virus vector is established\n\nOverall, the capacity of the American public health and health care delivery systems faces many challenges.182\nThe cost of dealing with current health problems is\ndiverting resources from preventing them in the first\nplace. This makes the U.S. population more vulnerable.183,184 Without careful consideration of how to\nprevent future impacts, similar patterns could emerge\nregarding the health impacts from climate change.\nHowever, efforts to quantify and map vulnerability factors at the community level are underway.151,164,185\n\nincreases the risk of locally acquired cases. The public health system is not fully prepared to monitor or respond to these growing disease risks. The introduction of new diseases into non-immune populations has been and continues to be a major challenge in public health. There are concerns that climate change may provide opportunities for pathogens to expand or shift their geographic ranges.172,173\n\nThere are public health programs in some locations that address climate-sensitive health issues, and integrating such programs into the mainstream public health toolkit as adaptation needs increase would improve public health resilience to climate change.79,186,187 Given that these programs have demonstrated efficacy against current threats that are expected to worsen\n\nwith climate change, it is prudent to invest in creating\n\n231\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH\n\nthe strongest climate-health preparedness programs possible.153 One survey highlighted opportunities to address climate change preparedness activities and climate-health research181\n\nbefore needs become more widespread. America's Climate\nChoices: Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Choices (Table 3.5) provides examples of health adaptation options.187\n\nKey Message 4: Responses Have Multiple Benefits\n\nResponding to climate change provides opportunities to improve human health and well-being across many sectors, including energy, agriculture, and transportation. Many\nof these strategies offer a variety of benefits, protecting people while combating climate change and providing other societal benefits.\n\nPolicies and other strategies intended to reduce carbon pol-\nlution and mitigate climate change can often have indepen-\ndent influences on human health. For example, reducing CO2 emissions through renewable electrical power generation can\nreduce air pollutants like particles and sulfur dioxide. Efforts\nto improve the resiliency of communities and human infra-\nstructure to climate change impacts can also improve human\nhealth. There is a growing recognition that the magnitude of\nhealth \"co-benefits,\" like reducing both pollution and cardio-\nvascular disease, could be significant, both from a public health and an economic standpoint.176,188,189 Some climate change\nresilience efforts will benefit health, but potential co-harms\nshould be considered when implementing these strategies.\nFor example, although there are numerous benefits to urban\ngreening, such as reducing the urban heat island effect while simultaneously promoting an active healthy lifestyle,159,190,191\nthe urban planting of certain allergenic pollen producing species22 could increase human pollen exposure and allergic ill-\nness. Increased pollen exposure has been linked to increased\nemergency department visits related to asthma and wheezing192 in addition to respiratory allergic illnesses such as allergic rhinitis or hay fever.193 The selective use of low to moderate pollen-producing species can decrease pollen exposure.194\n\nurban heat island effect, such as green/cool roofs, increased green space, parkland and urban canopy, could reduce indoor temperatures, improve indoor air quality, and could produce additional societal co-benefits by promoting social interaction and prioritizing vulnerable urban populations.191,197\nPatterns of change related to improving health can also have co-benefits in terms of reducing carbon pollution and mitigating climate change. Current U.S. dietary guidelines and many health professionals have recommended diets higher in fruits and vegetables and lower in red meat as a means of helping\n\nMuch of the focus of health co-benefits has been on reducing health-harming air pollution.6,174,175,195,196 One study projects\nthat replacing 50% of short motor vehicle trips with bicycle\nuse and the other 50% with other forms of transportation like\nwalking or public transit would avoid nearly 1,300 deaths in 11\nmidwestern metropolitan areas and create up to $8 billion in health benefits annually for the upper Midwest region.188 Such\nmultiple-benefit actions can reduce heat-trapping gas emis-\nsions that lead to climate change, improve air quality by reduc-\ning vehicle pollutant emissions, and improve fitness and health through increased physical activity.99,197,198,199,200\n\nInnovative urban design could create increased access to active transport.99 The compact geographical area found in cities\npresents opportunities to reduce energy use and emissions\nof heat-trapping gases and other air pollutants through ac-\ntive transit, improved building construction, provision of ser-\nvices, and infrastructure creation, such as bike paths and sidewalks.197,201 Urban planning strategies designed to reduce the\n\n\u00a9Fotosearch\n\n232\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH\n\nto reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and some cancers.199,202,203 These changes in food consumption, and related changes to food production, could have co-benefits in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While the greenhouse gas footprint of the production of other foods, compared to sources such as livestock, is highly dependent on a number of factors, production of livestock currently accounts for about 30% of the U.S. total emissions of methane.199,203,204 This amount of methane can be reduced somewhat by recovery methods such as the use of biogas digesters, but future changes in dietary practices, including those motivated by considerations other than climate change mitigation, could also have an effect on the amount of methane emitted to the atmosphere.205\nIn addition to producing health co-benefits,206 climate change prevention and preparedness measures could also yield positive equity impacts. For example, several studies have found\n\nthat communities of color and poor communities experience disproportionately high exposures to air pollution.207,208 Climate change mitigation policies that improve local air quality thus have the potential to strongly benefit health in these communities.\nAn area where adaptation policy could produce more equitable health outcomes is with respect to extreme weather events. As discussed earlier, Hurricane Katrina demonstrated that communities of color, poor communities, and certain other vulnerable populations (like new immigrant communities) are at a higher risk to the adverse effects of extreme weather events.152,155 These vulnerable populations could benefit from urban planning policies that ensure that new buildings, including homes, are constructed to resist extreme weather events.197\n\n233\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The author team also engaged in targeted consultations during multiple exchanges with Contributing Authors, who provided additional expertise on subsets of the key message. These discussions were held after a review of the technical inputs and associated literature pertaining to human health, including a literature review,209 workshop reports for the Northwest and Southeast United States, and additional technical inputs on a variety of topics.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nClimate change threatens human health and well-being in many ways, including impacts from increased extreme weather events, wildfire, decreased air quality, threats to mental health, and illnesses transmitted by food, water, and diseasescarriers such as mosquitoes and ticks. Some of these health impacts are already underway in the United States.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in several foundational technical inputs prepared for this chapter, including a literature review209 and workshop reports for the Northwest and Southeast United States. Nearly 60 additional technical inputs related to human health were received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nmethane emissions, regulatory controls, and population characteristics.4 Ozone exposure leads to a number of health impacts.1,2\nAllergens: The effects of increased temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentration have been documented concerning shifts in flowering time and pollen initiation from allergenic plants, elevated production of plant-based allergens, and health effects of increased pollen concentrations and longer pollen seasons.15,16,17,18,20,22,23,24,26,106 Additional studies have shown extreme rainfall and higher temperatures can lead to increased indoor air quality issues such as fungi and mold health concerns.27\nWildfire: The effects of wildfire on human health have been well documented with increase in wildfire frequency17,29,39,40 leading to decreased air quality31,32,33 and negative health impacts.32,34,36\nTemperature Extremes: The effects of temperature extremes on human health have been well documented for increased heat waves,51,53,54 which cause more deaths,47,48 hospital admissions50 and population vulnerability.56,57\nPrecipitation Extremes - Heavy Rainfall, Flooding, and Droughts: The effects of weather extremes on human health have been well documented, particularly for increased heavy precipitation, which has contributed to increases in severe flooding events in certain regions. Floods are the second deadliest of all weather-related hazards in the United States.63,64 Elevated waterborne disease outbreaks have been reported in the weeks following heavy rainfall,65 although other variables may affect these associations.66 Populations living in damp indoor environments experience increased prevalence of asthma and other upper respiratory tract symptoms.67\n\nAir Pollution: The effects of decreased ozone air quality on human health have been well documented concerning projected increases in ozone,6,7,9,11,39 even with uncertainties in projections owing to the complex formation chemistry of ozone and climate change, precursor chemical inventories, wildfire emission, stagnation episodes,\n\nDisease Carried by Vectors:\nClimate is one of the factors that influence the range of disease vectors; 73,74,76 a shift in the current range may increase interactions with people and affect human health.71 North\nAmericans are currently at risk from a number of vector-borne diseases.75,82,83,85,86,87 There are some ambiguities on the relative\n\n252\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH Traceable Accounts\n\nrole and contribution of climate change among the range of factors that affect disease transmission dynamics.71,72,73,74,75,76 However, observational studies are already underway and confidence is high based on scientific literature that climate change has contributed to the expanded range of certain disease vectors, including Ixodes ticks which are vectors for Lyme disease in the United States.78,84,89\nFood- and Waterborne Diarrheal Disease: There has been extensive research concerning the effects of climate change on water- and food-borne disease transmission.92,93,95,96,97 The current evidence base strongly supports waterborne diarrheal disease being both seasonal and sensitive to climate variability. There are also multiple studies associating extreme precipitation events with waterborne disease outbreaks.65 This evidence of responsiveness of waterborne disease to weather and climate, combined with evidence strongly suggesting that temperatures will increase and extreme precipitation events will increase in frequency and severity (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate), provides a strong argument for climate change impacts on waterborne disease by analogy. There are multiple studies associating extreme precipitation events with waterborne disease outbreaks and strong climatological evidence for increasing frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events in the future. The scientific literature modeling the projected impacts of climate change on waterborne disease is somewhat limited, however. Combined, we therefore have overall medium confidence in the impact of climate change on waterborne and food-borne disease.\nHarmful Algal Blooms: Because algal blooms are closely related to climate factors, projected changes in climate could affect algal blooms and lead to increases in food- and waterborne exposures and subsequent cases of illness.96,97,98,99,103 Harmful algal blooms have multiple exposure routes.100\nFood Security: Climate change is expected to have global impacts on both food production and certain aspects of food quality. The impact of temperature extremes, changes in precipitation and elevated atmospheric CO2, and increasing competition from weeds and pests on crop plants are areas of active research (Ch. 6: Agriculture, Key Message 6).105,106 The U.S. as a whole will be less affected than some other countries. However, the most vulnerable, including those dependent on subsistence lifestyles, especially Alaska Natives and low-income populations, will confront shortages of key foods.\nMental Health and Stress-Related Disorders: The effects of extreme weather on mental health have been extensively studied.120,122,123 Studies have shown the impacts of mental health problems after disasters,124 with extreme events like Hurricane Katrina,125 floods,126 heat waves,127 and wildfires128 having led to mental health problems. Further work has shown that some people with mental illnesses are especially vulnerable\n\nto heat. Suicide rates vary with weather,131,132 dementia is a risk factor for hospitalization and death during heat waves,127,133 and medications for schizophrenia may interfere with temperature regulation or even directly cause hyperthermia.134 Additional potential mental health impacts include distress associated with environmental degradation, displacement, and the knowledge of climate change.122,123,136\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence on heat-health effects44,45 confirmed many of the findings from a prior literature review. Uncertainties in the magnitude of projections of future climate-related morbidity and mortality can result from differences in climate model projections of the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heat waves and other climate parameters such as precipitation.\nEfforts to improve the information base should address the coordinated monitoring of climate and improved surveillance of health effects.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Overall: Very High confidence. There is considerable consensus and a high quality of evidence in the published peer-reviewed literature that a wide range of health effects will be exacerbated by climate change in the United States. There is less agreement on the magnitude of these effects because of the exposures in question and the multi-factorial nature of climate-health vulnerability, with regional and local differences in underlying health susceptibilities and adaptive capacity. Other uncertainties include how much effort and resources will be put into improving the adap-\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent\nresults, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods\nvary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\n\n253\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH Traceable Accounts\n\ntive capacity of public health systems to prepare in advance for the health effects of climate change, prevent harm to individual and community health, and limit associated health burdens and societal costs.\nIncreased Ozone Exposure: Very High confidence. Allergens: High confidence. Wildfires: Very High confidence. Thermal Extremes: Very High confidence. Extreme Weather Events: Very High confidence. Vector-borne Infectious Diseases: High or Very High confidence for shift in range of disease-carrying vectors. Medium confidence for whether human disease transmission will follow. Food- and Waterborne disease: Medium confidence. Harmful Algal Blooms: Medium confidence. Food Security: Medium confidence for food quality; High confidence for food security.\nThreats to Mental Health: Very High confidence for post-disaster impacts; Medium confidence for climate-induced stress.\n\nChildren: The effects of climate change increase vulnerability of children to extreme heat, and increased health damage (morbidity, mortality) resulting from heat waves has been well documented.16,22,51,53,140 Extreme heat also causes more pediatric deaths,47,48 and more emergency room visits and hospital admissions.49,50 Adverse effects from increased heavy precipitation can lead to more pediatric deaths, waterborne diseases,66 and illness.141\nThe elderly: Heat stress is especially damaging to the health of older people,45,49,60,133,142,209 as are climate-sensitive increases in air pollution.\nThe sick: People and communities lacking the resources to adapt or to enhance mobility and escape health-sensitive situations are at relatively high risk.164\nThe poor: People and communities lacking the resources to adapt or to move and escape health-sensitive situations are at relatively high risk.164\n\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nClimate change will, absent other changes, amplify some of the existing health threats the nation now faces. Certain people and communities are especially vulnerable, including children, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and some communities of color.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in several foundational technical inputs prepared for this chapter, including a literature review209 and workshop reports for the Northwest and Southeast regions.210 Nearly 60 additional technical inputs related to human health were received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nCurrent epidemiological evidence on climate-sensitive health outcomes in the U.S. indicates that health impacts will differ substantially by location, pathway of exposure, underlying susceptibility, and adaptive capacity. These disparities in health impacts will largely result from differences in the distribution of individual attributes in a population that confers vulnerability (age, socioeconomic status, and race), attributes of place that reduce or amplify exposure (floodplain, coastal zone, and urban heat island), and the resilience of critical public health infrastructure.\nAmplification of existing health threats: The effects of extreme heat and heat waves, projected worsening air pollution and asthma, extreme rainfall and flooding, and displacement and injuries associated with extreme weather events, fueled by climate change, are already substantial public health issues. Trends projected under a changing climate are projected to exacerbate these health effects in the future.62\n\nSome communities of color: There are racial disparities in climate-sensitive exposures to extreme heat in urban areas, and in access to means of adaptation \u00ad for example air conditioning use.149,151,157,211 There are also racial disparities in withstanding, and recovering from, extreme weather events.155,162\nClimate change will disproportionately impact low-income communities and some communities of color, raising environmental justice concerns.139,149,151,154,155,157,161,164 Existing health disparities153,158,159 and other inequities161 increase vulnerability. For example, Hurricane Katrina demonstrated how vulnerable these populations were to extreme weather events because many lowincome and of-color New Orleans residents were killed, injured, or had difficulty evacuating and recovering from the storm.155,162 Other climate change related issues that have an equity component include heat waves and air quality.139,149,154,164\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence45 confirmed findings from a prior literature review.139\nThe potential for specific climate-vulnerable communities to experience highly harmful health effects is not entirely clear in specific regions and on specific time frames due to uncertainties in rates of adaptation and uncertainties about the outcome of public health interventions currently being implemented that aim to address underlying health disparities and determinants of health.206 The public health community has not routinely conducted evaluations of the overall success of adaptation interventions or of particular elements of those interventions.\n\n254\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f9: HUMAN HEALTH Traceable Accounts\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence that climate change will amplify existing health threats: Very High. Among those especially vulnerable are: Children: Very High. The elderly: Very High. The sick: Very High. The poor: Very High. Some communities of color: High.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nPublic health actions, especially preparedness and prevention, can do much to protect people from some of the impacts of climate change. Early action provides the largest health benefits. As threats increase, our ability to adapt to future changes may be limited.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in several foundational technical inputs prepared for this chapter, including a literature review209 and workshop reports for the Northwest and Southeast United States. Nearly 60 additional technical inputs related to human health were received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nA number of studies have demonstrated that prevention activities that reduce carbon pollution, like using alternative energy sources174 and using active transportation like biking or walking,188 can lead to significant public health benefits, which can save costs in the near and long term.176 Health impacts associated with climate change can be prevented through early action at significantly lower cost than dealing with them after they occur. For example, heat wave early warning systems are much less expensive than treating heatrelated illnesses.165 Existing adaptation programs have improved public health resilience.9,153 One survey highlighted opportunities to address climate change preparedness activities and climatehealth research181 before needs become more widespread.\nConsidering U.S. public health in general, the cost-effectiveness of many prevention activities is well established.183 Some preventive actions are cost-saving, while others are deemed costeffective based on a pre-determined threshold. Early preventive interventions, such as early warnings for extreme weather, can be particularly cost-effective.166 However, there is less information on the cost-effectiveness of specific prevention interventions relevant to climate sensitive health threats (for example, heat early warning systems). Overall, we have high confidence that public health actions can do much to protect people from some of the impacts of climate change, and that early action provides the largest health benefits.\n\nThe inverse relationship between the magnitude of an impact and a community's ability to adapt is well established and understood. Two extreme events, Hurricane Katrina and the European heat wave of 2003, illustrate this relationship well.167 Extreme events interact with social vulnerability to produce extreme impacts, and the increasing frequency of extreme events associated with climate change is prompting concern for impacts that may overwhelm adaptive capacity.62,173 This is equally true of the public health sector, specifically, leading to very high confidence that as threats increase, our ability to adapt to future changes may be limited.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key issue (uncertainty) is the extent to which the nation, states, communities and individuals will be able to adapt to climate change because this depends on the levels of local exposure to climate-health threats, underlying susceptibilities, and the capacities to adapt that are available at each scale. Overall, the capacity of the American public health and health care delivery systems faces many challenges.182 The cost of dealing with current health problems is diverting resources from preventing them in the first place. This makes the U.S. population more vulnerable.56,183\nSteps for improving the information base on adaptation include undertaking a more comprehensive evaluation of existing climatehealth preparedness programs and their effectiveness in various jurisdictions (cities, counties, states, nationally).\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Overall, given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties: High. High: Public health actions, especially preparedness and prevention, can do much to protect people from some of the impacts of climate change. Prevention provides the most protection; but we do not as yet have a lot of post-implementation information with which to evaluate preparedness plans. High: Early action provides the largest health benefits. There is evidence that heat-health early warning systems have saved lives and money in U.S. cities like Philadelphia, PA.165 Very High: Our ability to adapt to future changes may be limited.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nResponding to climate change provides opportunities to improve human health and well-being across many sectors, including energy, agriculture, and transportation. Many of these strategies offer a variety of benefits, protecting people while combating climate change and providing other societal benefits.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in several foundational technical inputs prepared for this chapter, including a literature review209 and work-\n\n255\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fshop reports for the Northwest and Southeast U.S. regions.210 Nearly 60 additional technical inputs related to human health were received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nA number of studies have explored the opportunities available to improve health and well-being as a result of adapting to climate change,176 with many recent publications illustrating the benefit of reduced air pollution.6,174,175,195 Additionally, some studies have looked at the co-benefits to climate change and health of applying innovative urban design practices which reduce energy consumption and pollution while increasing public health,99,188,197,198 decrease vulnerability of communities to extreme events152,197 and reduce the disparity between different societal groups.206,207,212\nNew information and remaining uncertainties More studies are needed to fully evaluate both the intended and unintended health consequences of efforts to improve the resiliency of communities and human infrastructure to climate change impacts. There is a growing recognition that the magnitude of these health co-benefits or co-harms could be significant, both from a public health and an economic standpoint. 176,188,189\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is Very High.\n\n9: HUMAN HEALTH Traceable Accounts\n\n256\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f\u00a9 James Christensen/ Foto Natura/Corbis\n\nClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 10 ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\nConvening Lead Authors\nKathy Hibbard, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory Tom Wilson, Electric Power Research Institute\nLead Authors\nKristen Averyt, University of Colorado Boulder Robert Harriss, Environmental Defense Fund Robin Newmark, National Renewable Energy Laboratory Steven Rose, Electric Power Research Institute Elena Shevliakova, Princeton University Vincent Tidwell, Sandia National Laboratories\nRecommended Citation for Chapter\nHibbard, K., T.

Energy, water, and land systems interact in many ways. Climate change affects the individual sectors and their interactions; the combination of these factors affects climate change  vulnerability as well as adaptation and mitigation options for different regions of the country.\n2. The dependence of energy systems on land and water supplies will influence the development of these systems and options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as their climate change vulnerability.\n3. Jointly considering risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities associated with energy, water, and land use is challenging, but can improve the identification and evaluation of options for reducing climate change impacts.\n\nEnergy, water, and land systems interact in many ways. Energy projects (energy production and delivery) require varying amounts of water and land; water projects (water supply and irrigation) require energy and land; and land-based activities (agriculture and forestry) depend upon energy and water. Increasing population and a growing economy intensify these interactions.1 Each sector is directly impacted by the others and by climate change, and each sector is a target for adaptation and mitigation efforts. Better understanding of the connections between and among energy, water, and land systems can improve our capacity to predict, prepare for, and mitigate climate change.\n\nEnergy, Water, Land, and Climate Interactions\n\nChallenges from climate change will arise from long-term, gradual changes, such as sea level rise, as well as from projected changes in weather extremes that have more sudden impacts. The independent implications of climate change for the energy, water, and land sectors have been studied extensively (see Ch. 4: Energy, Ch. 3: Water, and Ch. 13: Land Use & Land Cover Change). However, there are few analyses that capture the interactions among and competition for resources within these three sectors.1 Very little information is available to evaluate the implications for decision-making and planning, including legal, social, political, and other decisions.\nClimate change is not the only factor driving changes. Other environmental and socioeconomic stressors interact with climate change and affect vulnerability and response strategies with respect to energy, water, and land systems. The availability and use of energy, water, and land resources and the ways in which they interact vary across the nation. Regions in the United States differ in their 1) energy mix (solar, wind, coal, geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, natural gas, petroleum, ethanol); 2) observed and projected precipitation\n\nFigure 10.1. The interactions between and among the energy, water, land, and climate systems take place within a social and economic context. (Figure source: Skaggs et al. 20121).\nand temperature patterns; 3) sources and quality of available water resources (for example, ground, surface, recycled); 4) technologies for storing, transporting, treating and using water; and 5) land use and land cover (see Ch. 13: Land Use & Land Cover Change). Decision-making processes for each sector also differ, and decisions often transcend scales, from local to state to federal, meaning that mitigation and adaptation options differ widely.\nGiven the many mitigation and adaptation opportunities available through the energy sector, a focus on energy is a useful\n\n258\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\n\nway to highlight the interactions among energy, water, and land as well as intersections with climate and other stressors. For example, energy production already competes for water resources with agriculture, direct human uses, and natural systems. Climate-driven changes in land cover and land use are projected to further affect water quality and availability, increasing the competition for water needed for energy produc-\n\ntion. In turn, diminishing water quality and availability means that there will be a need for more energy to purify water and more infrastructure on land to store and distribute water. Stakeholders need to understand the interconnected nature of climate change impacts, and the value of assessments would be improved if risks and vulnerabilities were evaluated from a cross-sector standpoint.2\n\nKey Message 1: Cascading Events\n\nEnergy, water, and land systems interact in many ways. Climate change affects the individual sectors and their interactions; the combination of these factors affects climate change\nvulnerability as well as adaptation and mitigation options for different regions of the country.\n\nEnergy production, land use, and water resources are linked in increasingly complex ways. In some parts of the country, electric utilities and energy companies compete with farmers and ranchers, other industries, and municipalities for water rights and availability, which are also constrained by interstate and international commitments. Private and public sector decision-makers must consider the impacts of strained water supplies on agricultural, ecological, industrial, urban, and public health needs. Across the country, these intertwined sectors\nCoast-to-Coast 100-degree Days in 2011\n\nwill witness increased stresses due to climate changes that are projected to lower water quality and/or quantity in many regions and change heating and cooling electricity demands.\nThe links between and among energy, water, and land sectors mean that they are susceptible to cascading effects from one sector to the next. An example is found in the drought and heat waves experienced across much of the U.S. during the summers of 2011 and 2012. In 2011, drought spread across the south-central U.S., causing a series of energy, water, and land impacts that demonstrate the connections among these sectors. Texans, for example, experienced the hottest and driest summer on record. Summer average temperatures were 5.2\u00b0F higher than normal, and precipitation was lower than previous records set in 1956. The associated heat wave, with temperatures above 100\u00b0F for 40 consecutive days, together with drought, strained the region's energy and water resources.3,4,5\n\nFigure 10.2. Map shows numbers of days with temperatures above 100\u00b0F during 2011. The black circles denote the location of observing stations recording 100\u00b0F days. The number of days with temperatures exceeding 100\u00b0F is expected to increase. The record temperatures and drought during the summer of 2011 represent conditions that will be more likely in the U.S. as climate change continues. When outdoor temperatures increase, electricity demands for cooling increase, water availability decreases, and water temperatures increase. Alternative energy technologies may require little water (for example, solar and wind) and can enhance resilience of the electricity sector, but still face land-use and habitat considerations. The projected increases in drought and heat waves provide an example of the ways climate changes will challenge energy, water, and land systems. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC, 2012).\n\nThese extreme climate events resulted in cascading effects across energy, water, and land systems. High temperatures caused increased demand for electricity for air conditioning, which corresponded to increased water withdrawal and consumption for electricity generation. Heat, increased evaporation, drier soils, and lack of rain led to higher irrigation demands, which added stress on water resources required for energy production. At the same time, low-flowing and warmer rivers threatened to suspend power plant production in several locations, reducing the options for dealing with the concurrent increase in electricity demand.\nThe impacts on land resources and land use were dramatic. Drought reduced crop yields and affected livestock, costing Texas farmers and ranchers more than $5 billion, a 28% loss compared to average revenues of the previous four years.6 With increased feed costs, ranchers were forced to sell livestock at lower profit. Drought increased tree mortality,7 providing more fuel for record wildfires that burned 3.8 million acres (an area about the size of Connecticut) and destroyed 2,763 homes.8\n\n259\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\n\nTexas Summer 2011: Record Heat and Drought\n\nregional managers rationed water to farms and urban areas, and in some instances, water was trucked to communities that lacked sufficient supplies.11 As late as January 2012, customers of 1,010 Texas water systems were being asked to restrict water use; mandatory water restrictions were in place in 647 water systems.12 At the same time, changing vegetation attributes, grazing, cropping, and wildfire compromised water quality and availability, increasing the amount of power required for water pumping and purification.\n\nThe Texas example shows how energy, land, water,\n\nand weather interacted in one region. Extreme\n\nweather events may affect other regions differently,\n\nbecause of the relative vulnerability of energy, water,\n\nand land resources, linkages, and infrastructure.\n\nFor example, sustained droughts in the Northwest\n\nFigure 10.3. Graph shows average summer temperature and total rainfall in Texas from 1895 through 2012. The red dots illustrate the range of temperatures and rainfall observed over time. The record temperatures and drought during the summer of 2011 (large red dot) represent conditions far outside those that have occurred since the instrumental record began.4 An analysis has shown that the probability of such an event has more than doubled as a result of human-induced climate change3. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nwill affect how water managers release water from reservoirs, which in turn will affect water deliveries for ecosystem services, irrigation, recreation, and hydropower. Further complicating matters, hydropower is increasingly being used to balance variable wind generation in the Northwest, and seasonal hydroelectric restrictions have already created challenges to fulfilling this role.

In some situations, land and water confluenced and will continue to influence selection and operation straints also pose challenges to technology options for reducing\nWater Use for Electricity Generation by Fuel and Cooling Technology\n\nFigure 10.5. Technology choices can significantly affect water and land use. These two panels show a selection of technologies. Ranges in water withdrawal/consumption reflect minimum and maximum amounts of water used for selected technologies. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is not included in the figures, but is discussed in the text. The top panel shows water withdrawals for various electricity production methods. Some methods, like most conventional nuclear power plants that use \"once-through\" cooling systems, require large water withdrawals but return most of that water to the source (usually rivers and streams). For nuclear plants, utilizing cooling ponds can dramatically reduce water withdrawal from streams and rivers, but increases the total amount of water consumed. Beyond large withdrawals, once-through cooling systems also affect the environment by trapping aquatic life in intake structures and by increasing the temperature of streams.18 Alternatively, once-through systems tend to operate at slightly better efficiencies than plants using other cooling systems. The bottom panel shows water consumption for various electricity production methods. Coal-powered plants using recirculating water systems have relatively low requirements for water withdrawals, but consume much more of that water, as it is turned into steam. Water consumption is much smaller for various dry-cooled electricity generation technologies, including for coal, which is not shown. Although small in relation to cooling water needs, water consumption also occurs throughout the fuel and power cycle.19 (Figure source: Averyt et al. 201120).\n\n265\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions. For example, with the Southwest having most of the potential for deployment of concentrating solar technologies, facilities will need to be extremely water-efficient in order to compete for limited water resources. While wind farms avoid impacts on water resources, issues concerning land use, wildlife impacts, the environment, and aesthetics are often encountered. Raising crops to produce biofuels uses arable land and water that might otherwise be available for food production. This fact came into stark focus during the summer of 2012, when drought caused poor corn harvests, intensifying concerns about allocation of the harvest for food versus ethanol.16\n\nProjected Land-use Intensity in 2030\n\nCompetition for water supplies is encouraging deployment of technologies that are less water-intensive than coal or nuclear power with once-through cooling. For example, wind, natural gas, photovoltaic (solar electric), and even thermoelectric generation with dry cooling use less water. Challenges in siting land- and water-intensive energy facilities are likely to intensify over time as competition for these resources grows. Considering the interactions among energy, water, and land systems presents opportunities for further identification and implementation of energy options that can reduce emissions, promote resilience, and improve sustainability.\n\n\u00a9John Epperson/The Denver Post via Getty Image\n\nFigure 10.6. The figure shows illustrative projections for 2030 of the total land-use intensity associated with various electricity production methods. Estimates consider both the footprint of the power plant as well as land affected by energy extraction. There is a relatively large range in impacts across technologies. For example, a change from nuclear to wind power could mean a significant change in associated land use. For each electricity production method, the figure shows the average of a most-compact and least-compact estimate for how much land will be needed per unit of energy. The figure uses projections from the Energy Information Administration Reference scenario for the year 2030, based on energy consumption by fuel type and power plant \"capacity factors\" (the ratio of total power generation to maximum possible power generation). The most-compact and least-compact estimates of biofuel land-use intensities reflect differences between current yield and production efficiency levels and those that are projected for 2030 assuming technology improvements.21 (Figure source: adapted from McDonald et al. 200921).\nEvery option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions involves tradeoffs that affect natural resources, socioeconomic systems,\nand the built environment. Energy system technologies vary widely in their carbon emissions and their use of water and land. As such, there are energy-water-land tradeoffs and synergies with respect to adaptation and mitigation. Each choice involves assessing the relative importance of the tradeoffs related to these resources in the context of both short- and long-term risks (see \"Examples of Energy, Water, and Land Linkages\" that describes four technologies that could play key roles). Figure 10.5 provides a systematic comparison of water withdrawals and consumptive use, illustrating the wide variation across both electric generation technologies and the accompanying cooling technologies. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is not included in the chart, but coal-fired\n\n266\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\n\nTable 10.1.

Blue means consideration of energy extraction and power plant processes. It is important to keep in mind that this table only reflects physical synergies and tradeoffs. There are, of course, economic tradeoffs as well in the form of technology costs and societal concerns, such as energy security, food security, and water quality. Expansion of hybrid or dry-cooled solar technologies, versus wet, could help reduce water risks. For a more detailed description of the entries in the table, see Skaggs et al. 2012.1 Additional considerations regarding energy extraction, power plant processes, and energy use associated with irrigation were added to those reflected in Skaggs et al. 20121 (Adapted from Skaggs et al. 20121).\n\nMitigation measures Switch from coal to natural gas fueled power plants Expand CCS to fossil-fueled power plant Expansion of nuclear power Expansion of wind Expansion of solar thermal technologies (wet cooled) Expansion of commercial scale photovoltaic Expansion of hydropower Expansion of biomass production for energy Adaptation measures Switch from once-through to recirculating cooling in thermoelectric power plants Switch from wet to dry cooling at thermoelectric power plants Desalinization New storage and conveyance of water Switch to drought-tolerant crops in drought vulnerable regions Increase transmission capacity to urban areas to reduce power outages during high demand periods\n\nWater + and \u00ad\n\u00ad \u00ad + \u00ad + + and \u00ad + and \u00ad Water + and \u00ad + + and \u00ad + and \u00ad +\n\nLand + and \u00ad\n\u00ad\n\u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad + and \u00ad Land\n+ \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\n\nEnergy\n+ Energy\n+ and \u00ad \u00ad + +\n\npower plants (both evaporative cooling and dry cooling) fitted with CCS would consume twice as much water per unit of electricity generated as similar coal-fired facilities without CCS.17 Figure 10.6 shows projected land-use intensity in 2030 for various electricity production methods. Describing land use with a single number is valuable, but must be considered with care. For example, while wind generation can require significant amounts of land, it can co-exist with other activities such as farming and grazing, while other technologies may not be compatible with other land uses. Land and water influences on energy production capacity are expected to get stronger in the future, and greater resource scarcity will shape investment decisions.\nEvery adaptation and mitigation option involves tradeoffs in how it increases or decreases stress on energy systems and water and land resources. For a selected set of mitigation and adaptation measures, Table 10.1 provides a summary illustrating qualitatively how different technologies relate to energy, water, and land.1\n\npotential part of a future decarbonized energy system.22,23 Both are also potentially water intensive and therefore have vulnerabilities related to climate impacts and competing water uses. Alternatively, renewable generation and combined cycle gas and coal have relatively modest water withdrawals (see also EPRI 201124). Overall, energy, water, and land sector vulnerabilities are important factors to weigh in considering alternative electricity generation options and cooling systems.\nBioenergy also presents opportunities for mitigation, but some potential bioenergy feedstocks are land and water intensive. Where land and water resources are limited, bioenergy may therefore be at risk of competing with other uses of land and water, and climate changes present additional challenges. Other mitigation options, such as afforestation (re-establishment of forests), forest management, agricultural soil management, and fertilizer management are also tied intimately into the interfaces among land availability, land management, and water resource quantity and quality.25\n\nParticularly relevant to climate change mitigation are the energy, water, and land risks associated with low-carbon electricity generation. For example, expansion of nuclear power and coal power with CCS are two measures that have been discussed as a\n\nSome sector-specific mitigation and adaptation measures can provide opportunities to enhance climate mitigation or adaptation objectives in the other sectors. However, other measures may have negative impacts on mitigation or adaptation\n\n267\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\n\n\u00a9 Michael DeYoung/ Corbis\n\npotential in other sectors. If such crosssector impacts are not considered, they can diminish the effectiveness of climate mitigation and adaptation actions.\n\nFor example, switching from coal- to natural-gas-fired electricity generation reduces the emissions associated with power generation. Depending on the situation, the switch to natural gas in the energy sector can either improve or reduce adaptive capacity in the water sector. Natural gas can reduce water use for thermoelectric cooling (gas-fired plants require less cooling water), but natural gas extraction techniques consume water, so water availability must be considered. In addition, gas production has the potential to affect land-based ecosystems by, for example, fragmenting habitat and inhibiting wildlife migration. Future improvements in natural gas technologies and water reuse may reduce the possibility of negative impacts on water supplies and enhance the synergies across the energy, water, and land interface. Incorporating consideration of such cross-sector interactions in planning and policy could affect sectoral decisions and decisions related to climate mitigation and adaptation.\nChanges in the availability of water and land due to climate change and other effects of human activities will affect location, design, choice, and operations of energy technologies in the future and, in some cases, constrain their deployment.\n\nEnergy, water, and land linkages represent constraints, risks, and opportunities for private/public planning and investment decisions. \"Examples of Energy, Water, and Land Linkages\" below discusses four energy sector technologies that could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases and increasing energy security \u00ad natural gas from shale, solar power, biofuels, and CCS. These technologies were chosen to illustrate energy, water, and land linkages and other complexities for the design, planning, and deployment of our energy future.\n\n268\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\nExamples of energy, water, and land linkages\n\nShale Natural Gas and Hydraulic Fracturing\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration projects a 29% increase\n\nHydraulic Fracturing and Water Use\n\nin U.S. natural gas production by\n\n2035, driven primarily by the eco-\n\nnomics of shale gas.13 As an energy\n\nsource, natural gas (methane) can\n\nhave a major advantage over coal\n\nand oil: when combusted, it emits\n\nless carbon dioxide per unit energy\n\nthan other fossil fuels, and fewer pol-\n\nlutants like black carbon (soot) and\n\nmercury (see Ch. 27: Mitigation). An\n\nincrease in natural gas consumption\n\ncould lead to a reduction in U.S.\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions compared\n\nto continued use of other fossil fuels.\n\nDisadvantages include the possibil-\n\nity that low-cost gas could supplant\n\ndeployment of low-carbon generation\n\ntechnologies, such as nuclear power\n\nand renewable energy. In addition,\n\nthe U.S. Environmental Protec-\n\ntion Agency estimates that 6.9 mil-\n\nlion megatons of methane \u00ad with a\n\nglobal warming potential equivalent\n\nto 144.7 million megatons of CO2 \u00ad\n\nis emitted from the U.S. natural gas\n\nsystem through uncontrolled venting\n\nand leaks from drilling operations,\n\npipelines, and storage tanks (see Ch.\n\n15: Biogeochemical Cycles; Ch. 27:\n\nMitigation).26 There is considerable\n\nuncertainty about these estimates,\n\nand it is an active area of research.\nWhile technological improvements may reduce this leakage rate,26 leak-\nage makes the comparison between\nnatural gas and coal more complex from a climate perspective.27 For ex-\n\nFigure 10.7. Hydraulic fracturing, a drilling method used to retrieve deep reservoirs of natural gas, uses large quantities of water, sand, and chemicals that are injected at high pressure into horizontally-drilled wells as deep as 10,000 feet below Earth's surface. The pressurized mixture causes the rock layer to crack. Sand particles hold the fissures open so that natural gas from the shale can flow into the well. Questions about the water quantity necessary for this extraction method as well as the potential to affect water quality have produced national debate. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC).\n\nample, methane is a stronger green-\n\nhouse gas than carbon dioxide but has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime (see Ch. 15: Biogeochemical Cycles; Ch. 27:\n\nMitigation; Appendix 3: Climate Science; Appendix 4: FAQs).\n\nRecent reductions in natural gas prices are largely due to advances in hydraulic fracturing, which is a drilling method used to retrieve deep reservoirs of natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing injects large quantities of water, sand, and chemicals at high pressure into horizontally-drilled wells as deep as 10,000 feet below the surface in order to break the shale and extract natural gas.28 Questions about the water quantity necessary and the potential to affect water quality have produced national\n\nContinued\n\n269\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\nExamples of energy, water, and land linkages (continued)\n\ndebate about this method. Federal government and state-led efforts are underway to identify, characterize, and if necessary, find approaches to address these issues (for example, EPA 2011; FracFocus 201229).\n\nA typical shale gas well requires from two to four million gallons of water to drill and fracture (equivalent to the annual water use of 20 to 40 people in the U.S, or three to six Olympic-size swimming pools).28 The gas extraction industry has begun\nreusing water in order to lower this demand. However, with current technology, recycling water can require energy-intensive treatment, and becomes more difficult as salts and other contaminants build up in the water with each reuse.30 In regions\nwhere climate change leads to drier conditions, hydraulic fracturing could be vulnerable to climate change related reductions\nin water supply.\n\nShale gas development also requires land. To support the drilling and hydraulic fracturing process, a pad, which may be greater than five acres in size, is constructed.31 Land for new roads, compressor stations, pipelines, and water storage ponds\nare also required.\n\nThe competition for water is expected to increase in the future. State and local water managers will need to assess how gas\n\nextraction competes with other priorities for water use, including electricity generation, irrigation, municipal supply, industry\n\nuse, and livestock production. Collectively, such interactions between the energy and water resource sectors increase vulner-\n\nability to climate change, particularly in water-limited regions\n\nthat are projected to, or become, significantly drier. Solar Power Generation\n\nRenewable Energy and Land Use\n\nSolar energy technologies have the potential to satisfy a sig-\n\nnificant portion of U.S. electricity demand and reduce green-\n\nhouse gas emissions. The land and water requirements for\n\nsolar power generation depend on the mix of solar technolo-\n\ngies deployed. Small-scale (such as rooftop) installations are\n\nintegrated into current land use and have minimal water re-\n\nquirements. In contrast, utility-scale solar technologies have\n\nsignificant land requirements and can \u00ad depending upon the\n\nspecific generation and cooling technologies \u00ad also require\n\nsignificant water resources. For instance, utility-scale photo- Figure 10.8. Photovoltaic panels convert sunlight directly\n\nvoltaic systems can require three to ten acres per megawatt (MW) of generating capacity32 and consume as much as five gallons of water per megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity production.

A recent U.S. Department of Energy study concluded\n\nthat 14% of the U.S. demand for electricity could be met with solar power by 2030.34 To generate that amount of solar power\n\nwould require rooftop installations plus about 0.9 million to 2.7 million acres, equivalent to about 1% to 4% of the land area of Arizona, for utility-scale solar power systems and concentrating solar power (CSP).34\n\nRecognizing water limitations, most large-scale solar power systems now in planning or development are designed with dry cooling that relies on molten salt or other materials for heat transfer. However, while dry cooling systems reduce the need for water, they have lower plant thermal efficiencies, and therefore reduced production on hot days.35 Overall, as with other generation technologies, plant designs will have to carefully balance cost, operating issues, and water availability.\n\nBiofuels\n\nBiomass-based energy is currently the largest renewable energy source in the U.S., and biofuels from crops, grass, and trees are the fastest growing renewable domestic bioenergy sector.13 In 2011, approximately 40 million acres of cropland in the U.S. were used for ethanol production, roughly 16% of the land planted for the eight major field crops.37 The long-term\nenvironmental and social effects of biofuel production and use depend on many factors: the type of feedstock, manage-\n\nContinued\n\n270\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\nExamples of energy, water, and land linkages (continued)\nment practices used to produce them, fuel production and conversion technologies, prior land use, and land- and water-use changes caused by their production and use.38,39 Biofuels potentially can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by displacing fossil fuel consumption. Biofuels that comply with the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 are required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to fossil fuels. In addition, biofuels also have the potential to provide net environmental benefits compared to fossil fuels. For example, ethanol is used as a gasoline additive to meet air quality standards, replacing a previous additive that leaked from storage tanks and contaminated groundwater.40 However, increases in corn production for biofuel has been cited as contributing to harmful algal blooms.38\nCurrently, most U.S. biofuels, primarily ethanol (from corn) and biodiesel (mainly from soy), are produced from edible parts of crops grown on rain-fed land. Consumptive water use over the life cycle of corn-grain ethanol varies widely, from 15 gallons of water per gallon of gasoline equivalent for rain-fed corn-based ethanol in Ohio, to 1,500 gallons of water per gallon of gasoline equivalent for irrigated corn-based ethanol in New Mexico. In comparison, producing and refining petroleum-based fuels uses 1.9 to 6.6 gallons of water per gallon of gasoline.38,41\nThe U.S. Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) aims to expand production of cellulosic ethanol to at least 16 billion gallons per year by 2022. Cellulosic biofuels, derived from the entire plant rather than just the food portions, potentially have several advantages, such as fewer water quality impacts,42 less water consumption, and the use of forest-derived feedstocks.38 Cellulosic biofuels have not yet been produced in large volumes in the United States. The RFS target could require up to an additional 30 to 60 million acres of land, or alternatively be sourced from other feedstocks, such as forest and agricultural residues and municipal solid waste, but such supplies are projected to be inadequate for meeting the full cellulosic biofuel standard.38\nConversion of land not in cropland to crops for biofuel production may increase water consumption and runoff of fertilizers, herbicides, and sediment.43 The impacts of climate change, particularly in areas where water availability may decrease (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Ch. 3: Water, and Ch. 6: Agriculture), however, may make it increasingly difficult to raise crops in arid regions of the country. The use of crops that are better suited to arid conditions and are efficient in recycling nutrients, such as switchgrass for cellulosic ethanol, could lower the vulnerability of biofuel production to climate change.44 Another potential source of biomass for biofuel production is microalgae, but the existing technologies are still not carbon neutral, nor commercially viable.45\nCarbon Capture and Storage\nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies have the potential to capture 90% of CO2 emissions from coal and natural gas combustion by industrial and electric sector facilities and thus allow continued use of low-cost fossil fuels in a carbonconstrained future.46 CCS captures CO2 post- or pre-fuel combustion and injects the CO2 into geologic formations for longterm storage. In addition, combining CCS with bioenergy applications represents one of a few potential options for actually removing CO2 from the atmosphere47 because carbon that was recently in the atmosphere and accumulated by growing plants can be captured and stored.\nCCS substantially increases the cost of building and operating a power plant, both through up-front costs and additional energy use during operation (referred to as \"parasitic loads\" or an energy penalty).46 Substantial amounts of water are also used to separate CO2 from emissions and to generate the required parasitic energy. With current technologies, CCS can increase water consumption 30% to 100%.48 Gasification technologies, where coal or biomass are converted to gases and CO2 is separated before combustion, reduce the energy penalty and water requirements, but currently at higher capital costs.49 As with other technologies, technology and design choices for CCS need to be balanced with water requirements and water availability. Climate change will influence the former via effects on energy demand and the latter via precipitation changes. CCS facilities themselves have relatively modest land demands compared to some other generation options. However, bioenergy use with CCS would imply a much stronger land linkage.\nCCS facilities for electric power plants are currently operating at pilot scale, and a commercial scale demonstration project is under construction.50 Although the potential opportunities are large, many uncertainties remain, including cost, demonstration at scale, environmental impacts, and what constitutes a safe, long-term geologic repository for sequestering carbon dioxide.51\n\n271\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\n\nKey Message 3: Challenges to Reducing Vulnerabilities\n\nJointly considering risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities associated with energy, water, and land use is challenging, but can improve the identification and evaluation of options\nfor reducing climate change impacts.\n\nThe complex nature of interactions among energy, water, and land systems, particularly in the context of climate change, does not lend itself to simple solutions. The energy, water, and land interactions themselves create vulnerabilities to competing resource demands. Climate change is an additional stressor. However, resource management decisions are often focused on just one of these sectors. Where the three sectors are tightly coupled, options for mitigating or adapting to climate change and consideration of the tradeoffs associated with technological or resource availability may be limited. The complex nature of water and energy systems are also highlighted in Chapter 3 (Water), which discusses water constraints in many areas of the U.S., and in Chapter 4 (Energy), where it is noted that there will be challenges across the nation\n\nfor water quality to comply with thermal regulatory needs for energy production.\nA changing climate, particularly in areas projected to be warmer and drier, is expected to lead to drought and stresses on water supply, affecting energy, water, and land sectors in the United States. As the Texas drought of 2011 and 2012 illustrates, impacts to a particular sector, such as energy production, generate consequences for the others, such as water resource availability. Similarly, new energy development and production will require careful consideration of land and water sector resources. As a result, vulnerability to climate change depends on energy, water, and land linkages and on climate risks across all sectors, and decision-making is complex.\n\nWater Stress in the U.S.\n\nFigure 10.9. In many parts of the country, competing demands for water create stress in local and regional watersheds. Map shows a \"water supply stress index\" for the U.S. based on observations, with widespread stress in much of the Southwest, western Great Plains, and parts of the Northwest. Watersheds are considered stressed when water demand (from power plants, agriculture, and municipalities) exceeds 40% (water supply stress index of 0.4) of available supply. (Figure source: Averyt et al. 201120).\n\n272\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\nThe Columbia River Basin Land Use and Land Cover\n\nFigure 10.10. Agriculture is in yellow, forests are shades of green, shrublands are gray, and urban areas are in red. The river is used for hydropower generation, flood control, agriculture irrigation, recreation, support of forest and shrubland ecosystems, and fish and wildlife habitat. Climate change may impact the timing and supply of the water resources, affecting the multiple uses of this river system. (Figure source: Northwest Habitat Institute 1999).\n\nThe Columbia River Basin is one example of an area where risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities are being jointly considered by a wide range of stakeholders and decision-makers (see Ch. 28: Adaptation). The Columbia River, which crosses the U.S.Canada border, is the fourth largest river on the continent by volume, and it drives the production of more electricity than any other river in North America. Approximately 15% of the Columbia River Basin lies within British Columbia (Figure 10.10), but an average of 30% of the total average discharge originates from the Canadian portion of the watershed.52 To provide flood control for the U.S. and predicted releases for hydropower generation, the Columbia River system is managed through a treaty that established a cooperative agreement between the United States and Canada to regulate the river for these two uses.53 The basin also supports a range of other uses, such as navigation, tribal uses, irrigation, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, and water resources for agricultural, industrial, and individual use. For all multi-use river basins, understanding\n\nthe combined vulnerability of energy, water, and land use to climate change is essential to planning for water management and climate change adaptation.\nA recent report projects a warmer annual, and drier summer, climate for the Northwest (Ch. 21: Northwest; Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figures 2.14 and 2.15; Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement, Figures 21 and 22),54 potentially affecting both the timing and amounts of water availability. For example, if climate change reduces streamflow at certain times, fish and wildlife, as well as recreation, may be vulnerable.55 Climate change stressors will also increase the vulnerability of the region's vast natural ecosystems and forests in multiple ways (see Ch. 7: Forests and Ch. 8: Ecosystems). Currently, only 30% of annual Columbia River Basin runoff can be stored in reservoirs.56 Longer growing seasons might provide opportunities for greater agricultural production, but the projected warmer and drier summers could increase demand for water for irrigation,\n\n273\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\n\n\u00a9 James Christensen/ Foto Natura/Corbis\n\nperhaps at the expense of other water uses due to storage limitations. Wetter winters might offset increased summer demands. However, the storage capacities of many water reservoirs with multiple purposes, including hydropower, were not designed to accommodate significant increases in winter precipitation. Regulations and operational requirements also constrain the ability to accommodate changing precipitation patterns (see Ch. 3: Water).\n\nBecause of the complexity of interactions among energy, water, and land systems, considering the complete picture of climate impacts and potential adaptations can help provide better solutions. Adaptation to climate change occurs in large part locally or regionally, and conflicting stakeholder priorities, institutional commitments, and international agreements have the potential to complicate or even compromise adaption strategies with regard to energy, water, and land resources (see also Ch. 28: Adaptation). Effective adaptation to the impacts of climate change requires a better understanding of the interactions among the energy, water, and land resource sectors. Whether managing for water availability and quality in the context of energy systems, or land restrictions, or both, an improved dialog between the scientific and decision-making\n\ncommunities will be necessary to evaluate tradeoffs and compromises needed to manage and understand this complex system. This will require not only integrated and quantitative analyses of the processes that underlie the climate and natural systems, but also an understanding of decision criteria and risk analyses to communicate effectively with stakeholders and decision-makers.\n\n274\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f10: ENERGY, WATER, AND LAND USE\n\nReferences\n\n1.

They considered a variety of technical input documents, including a Technical Input Report prepared through an interagency process,1 and 59 other reports submitted through the Federal Register Notice request for public input. The key messages were selected based on expert judgment, derived from the set of examples assembled to demonstrate the character and consequences of interactions among the energy, water, and land resource sectors.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nEnergy, water, and land systems interact in many ways. Climate change affects the individual sectors and their interactions; the combination of these factors affects climate change vulnerability as well as adaptation and mitigation options for different regions of the country.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Technical Input Report (TIR): Climate and Energy-Water-Land System Interactions: Technical Report to the U.S. Department of Energy in Support of the National Climate Assessment.1 Technical input reports (59) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nThe TIR1 incorporates the findings of a workshop, convened by the author team, of experts and stakeholders. The TIR summarizes numerous examples of interactions between specific sectors, such as energy and water or water and land use. A synthesis of these examples provides insight into how climate change impacts the interactions between these sectors.\nThe TIR1 shows that the character and significance of interactions among the energy, water, and land resource sectors vary regionally. Additionally, the influence of impacts on one sector for the other sectors will depend on the specific impacts involved. Climate change impacts will affect the interactions among sectors, but this may not occur in all circumstances.\n\nThe key message is supported by the National Climate Assessment Climate Scenarios (for example, Kunkel et al. 201354). Many of the historic trends included in the Climate Scenarios are based on data assembled by the Cooperative Observer Network of the National Weather Service (http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/coop/). Regional climate outlooks are based on the appropriate regional chapter.\nThe Texas drought of 2011 and 2012 provides a clear example of cascading impacts through interactions among the energy, water, and land resource sectors.3,4,5,7,8,9 The U.S. Drought Monitor (http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) provides relevant historical data. Evidence also includes articles appearing in the public press11 and Internet media.6\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The Texas drought of 2011 and 2012 demonstrates the occurrence of cascading impacts involving the energy, land, and water sectors; however, the Texas example cannot be generalized to all parts of the country or to all impacts of climate change (for example, see Chapter 3 for flooding and energy system impacts). The Technical Input Report1 provides numerous additional examples and a general description of interactions that underlie cascading impacts between these resource sectors.\nThere are no major uncertainties regarding this key message. There are major uncertainties, however, in the magnitude of impacts in how decisions in one sector might affect another.

There are evolving water and land requirements for four energy technologies: natural gas from shale,13 solar power,34 biofuels,38,39 and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS).47 Each\n\nof these four technologies could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases. These technologies illustrate energy, water, and land linkages and other complexities for the design, planning, and deployment of our energy future.\nEvidence for energy production and use are derived from U.S. government reports.58 The contributions of hydraulic fracturing to natural gas production are based on a brief article by the Energy Information Administration13 and a primer by the U.S. Department of Energy.28 Information about water and energy demands for utility-scale solar power facilities is derived from two major DOE reports.34,59 Distribution of U.S. solar energy resources is from Web-based products of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (http://www.nrel.gov/gis/).

Progress in development and deployment of the energy technologies described has tended to follow a pattern: potential constraints arise because of dependence on water and land resources, but then these constraints motivate advances in technology to reduced dependence or result in adjustments of societal priorities. There are uncertainties in how energy systems' dependence on water will be limited by other resources, such as land; uncertainties about the effects on emissions and the development and deployment of future energy technologies; and uncertainties about the impacts of climate change on energy systems.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is high. The primary limitation on confidence assigned to this key message is with respect to its generality and dependence on technological advances. Energy technology development has the potential to reduce water and land requirements, and to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts. It is difficult to forecast success in this regard for technologies such as CCS that are still in early phases of development.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nJointly considering risks, vulnerabilities, and opportunities associated with energy, water, and land use is challenging, but can improve the identification and evaluation of options for reducing climate change impacts.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Technical Input Report (TIR): Climate and Energy-Water-Land System Interactions: Technical Report to the U.S. Department of Energy in Support of the National Climate Assessment.1 Technical input reports (59) on a wide range of top-\n\n280\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nInteractions among energy, water, and land resource sectors can lead to stakeholder concerns that shape options for reducing vulnerability and thus for adapting to climate change.

Climate change and its impacts threaten the well-being of urban residents in all U.S. regions. Essential infrastructure systems such as water, energy supply, and transportation will  increasingly be compromised by interrelated climate change impacts. The nation's economy, security, and culture all depend on the resilience of urban infrastructure systems.\n2. In urban settings, climate-related disruptions of services in one infrastructure system will almost always result in disruptions in one or more other infrastructure systems.\n3. Climate vulnerability and adaptive capacity of urban residents and communities are influenced by pronounced social inequalities that reflect age, ethnicity, gender, income, health, and (dis)ability differences.\n4. City government agencies and organizations have started adaptation plans that focus on  infrastructure systems and public health. To be successful, these adaptation efforts require cooperative private sector and governmental activities, but institutions face many barriers to implementing coordinated efforts.\n\nClimate change poses a series of interrelated challenges to the country's most densely populated places: its cities. The United States is highly urbanized, with about 80% of its population living in cities and metropolitan areas. Many cities depend on infrastructure, like water and sewage systems, roads, bridges, and power plants, that is aging and in need of repair or replacement. Rising sea levels, storm surges, heat waves, and extreme weather events will compound these issues, stressing or even overwhelming these essential services.\n\nCities have become early responders to climate change challenges and opportunities due to two simple facts: first, urban areas have large and growing populations that are vulnerable for many reasons to climate variability and change; and second, cities depend on extensive infrastructure systems and the resources that support them. These systems are often connected to rural locations at great distances from urban centers.\nThe term infrastructure is used broadly and includes systems and assets that are essential for national and economic se-\ncurity, national public health or safety, or to the overall well-being of residents. These include energy, water and wastewater, transportation, public health, banking and finance, telecommunications, food and agriculture, and information technology, among others.\n\nUrban dwellers are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in essential infrastructure services, in part because many of these infrastructure systems are reliant on each other. For example, electricity is essential to multiple systems, and a failure in the electrical grid can affect water treatment, transportation services, and public health. These infrastructure systems \u00ad lifelines to millions \u00ad will continue to be affected by various climate-related events and processes.\n\n\u00a9 FRANK POLICH/epa/Corbis\n\nAs climate change impacts increase, climate-related\n\nHeavy snowfalls during winter storms affect transportation systems and events will have large consequences for significant num-\n\nother urban infrastructure.\n\nbers of people living in cities or suburbs.

Vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning efforts could also include these irreplaceable resources. Changing conditions also create\n\nopportunities and challenges for urban climate adaptation (Ch. 28: Adaptation), and many cities have begun planning to address these changes.\n\nKey Message 1: Urbanization and Infrastructure Systems\n\nClimate change and its impacts threaten the well-being of urban residents in all U.S. regions. Essential infrastructure systems such as water, energy supply, and transportation will\nincreasingly be compromised by interrelated climate change impacts. The nation's economy, security, and culture all depend on the resilience of urban infrastructure systems.\n\nDirect and interacting effects of climate change will expose people who live in cities across the United States to multiple threats. Climate changes affect the built, natural, and social infrastructure of cities, from storm drains to urban waterways to the capacity of emergency responders. Climate change increases the risk, frequency, and intensity of certain extreme events like intense heat waves, heavy downpours, flooding from intense precipitation and coastal storm surges, and disease incidence related to temperature and precipitation changes. The vulnerability of urban dwellers multiplies when the effects of climate change interact with pre-existing urban stressors, such as deteriorating infrastructure, areas of intense poverty, and high population density.\nThree fundamental conditions define the key connections among urban systems, residents, and infrastructure.1,2 First, cities are dynamic, and are constantly being built and rebuilt through cycles of investment and innovation. Second, infrastructure in many cities has exceeded its design life and continues to age, resulting in an increasingly fragile system. At both local and national levels, infrastructure requires ongoing maintenance and investment to avoid a decline in service. Third, urban areas present tremendous social challenges, given widely divergent socioeconomic conditions and dynamic residence patterns that vary in different parts of each city. Heightened vulnerability of coastal cities and other metropolitan areas that are subject to storm surge, flooding, and other extreme weather or climate events will exacerbate impacts on populations and infrastructure systems.\n\n(such as buildings, energy, transportation, water, and sanitation systems) is expected to become more stressed in the next decades \u00ad especially when the impacts of climate change are added to the equation.4 As infrastructure is highly interdependent, failure in particular sectors is expected to have cascading effects on most aspects of affected urban economies. Further expansion of the U.S. urban landscape into suburban and exurban spaces is expected, and new climate adaptation and resiliency plans will need to account for this (Ch. 28: Adaptation).5 Significant increases in the costs of infrastructure investments also are expected as population density becomes more diffuse.6\nThe vulnerability of different urban populations to hazards and risks associated with climate change depends on three characteristics: their exposure to particular stressors, their sensitivity to impacts, and their ability to adapt to changing conditions.8,9 Many major U.S. metropolitan areas, for example, are located on or near the coast and face higher exposure to particular climate impacts like sea level rise and storm surge, and thus may face complex and costly adaptation demands (Ch. 25: Coasts; Ch. 28: Adaptation). But as people begin to respond to new\n\nApproximately 245 million people live in\nU.S. urban areas, a number expected to grow to 364 million by 2050.3 Paradoxi-\ncally, as the economy and population\nof urban areas grew in past decades,\nthe built infrastructure within cities\nand connected to cities deteriorated,\nbecoming increasingly fragile and deficient.1,2 Existing built infrastructure\n\nCoastal cities are vulnerable to sea level rise, storm surge, and related impacts.\n\n\u00a9Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\n284\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f11: URBAN SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND VULNERABILITY\nBlackout in New York and New Jersey after Hurricane Sandy\n\nFigure 11.1. Extreme weather events can affect multiple systems that provide services for millions of people in urban settings. The satellite images depict city lights on a normal night (left) and immediately following Hurricane Sandy (right). Approximately five million customers in the New York metropolitan region lost power. (Figure source: NASA Earth Observatory7).\n\ninformation about climate change through the urban develop-\nment process, social and infrastructure vulnerabilities can be altered.10 For example, the City of New York conducted a com-\nprehensive review of select building and construction codes\nand standards in response to increased climate change risk in\n\norder to identify adjustments that could be made to increase\nclimate resilience. Climate change stressors will bundle with\nother socioeconomic and engineering stressors already connected to urban and infrastructure systems.1\n\nKey Message 2: Essential Services are Interdependent\n\nIn urban settings, climate-related disruptions of services in one infrastructure system will almost always result in disruptions in one or more other infrastructure systems.\n\nUrban areas rely on links to multiple jurisdictions through a complex set of infrastructure systems.11 For example, cities\ndepend on other areas for supplies of food, materi-\nals, water, energy, and other inputs, and surround-\ning areas are destinations for products, services,\nand wastes from cities. If infrastructure and other\nconnections among source areas and cities are dis-\nrupted by climate change, then the dependent urban area also will be affected.12 Moreover, the eco-\nnomic base of an urban area depends on regional\ncomparative advantage; therefore, if competitors,\nmarkets, and/or trade flows are affected by climate change, a particular urban area is also affected.2\n\nthat the greatest losses from disruptive events may be distant from where damages started.2 In another example, Hurricane\n\n\u00a9Iwan Baan/Getty Images\n\nUrban vulnerabilities to climate change impacts are directly related to clusters of supporting resources and infrastructures located in other regions. For example, about half of the nation's oil refineries are located in only four states.13 Experience over the past decade with major infrastructure disruptions, such as the 2011 San Diego blackout, the 2003 Northeast blackout, and Hurricane Irene in 2011, has shown\n\nA failure of the electrical grid can affect everything from water treatment to public health.\n\n285\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f11: URBAN SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND VULNERABILITY\n\nKatrina disrupted oil terminal operations in southern Louisiana, not because of direct damage to port facilities, but because workers could not reach work locations through surface transportation routes and could not be housed locally because of disruption to potable water supplies, housing, and food shipments.14\n\nUrban Support Systems are Interconnected\n\nAlthough infrastructures and urban systems are often considered individually \u00ad for example, transportation or water supply or wastewater/ drainage \u00ad they are usually highly interactive and interdependent.15\n\nSuch interdependencies can lead to\n\ncascading disruptions throughout\n\nurban infrastructures. These disrup-\n\ntions, in turn, can result in unexpected impacts on communication, water, and public health sectors, at least in the short term. On August 8, 2007, New York City experienced an intense rainfall and thunderstorm\n\nFigure 11.2. In urban settings, climate-related disruptions of services in one infrastructure system will almost always result in disruptions in one or more other systems. When power supplies that serve urban areas are interrupted after a major weather event, for example, public health, transportation, and banking systems may all be affected. This schematic drawing illustrates some of these connections.

Similar cascad-\n\ning impacts have been observed from\n\nextreme weather events such as Hurricanes Katrina and Irene.2 In fact, as\n\nurban infrastructures become more\n\ninterconnected and more complex,\n\nthe likelihood of large-scale cascad-\n\ning impacts will increase as risks to Storm surges reach farther inland as they ride on top of sea levels that are higher due to infrastructure increase.19 warming.\n\n286\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fCourtesy of NOAA\n\n11: URBAN SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND VULNERABILITY\nHurricane sandy: urban systems, infrastructure, and vulnerability\nSandy made landfall on the New Jersey shore just south of Atlantic City on October 29, 2012, and became one of the most damaging storms to strike the continental United States. Sandy affected cities throughout the Atlantic seaboard, extending across the eastern United States to Chicago, Illinois, where it generated 20-foot waves on Lake Michigan and flooded the city's Lake Shore Drive. The storm's strength and resulting impact has been correlated with Atlantic Ocean water temperatures near the coast that were roughly 5\u00b0F above normal, and with sea level rise along the region's coastline as a result of a warming climate.\nSandy caused significant loss of life as well as tremendous destruction of property and critical infrastructure. It disrupted daily life for millions of coastal zone residents across the New York-New Jersey metropolitan area, despite this being one of the best disaster-prepared coastal regions in the country. The death toll from Sandy in the metropolitan region exceeded 100, and the damage was estimated to be at least $65 billion.20,21 At its peak, the storm cut electrical power to more than 8.5 million customers.21\nThe death and injury, physical devastation, multi-day power, heat, and water outages, gasoline shortages, and cascade of problems from Sandy's impact reveal what happens when the complex, integrated systems upon which urban life depends are stressed and fail. One example is what occurred after a Consolidated Edison electricity distribution substation in lower Manhattan ceased operation at approximately 9 PM Monday evening, when its flood protection barrier (designed to be 1.5 feet above the 10-foot storm surge of record) was overtopped by Sandy's 14-foot storm surge. As the substation stopped functioning, it immediately caused a system-wide loss of power for more than 200,000 customers. Residents in numerous high-rise apartment buildings were left without heat and lights, and also without elevator service and water (which must be pumped to upper floors).\nSandy also highlighted the vast differences in vulnerabilities across the extended metropolitan region. Communities and neighborhoods on the coast were most vulnerable to the physical impact of the record storm surge. Many low- to moderate-income residents live in these areas and suffered damage to or loss of their homes, leaving tens of thousands of people displaced or homeless. As a specific sub-population, the elderly and infirm were highly vulnerable, especially those living in the coastal evacuation zone and those on upper floors of apartment buildings left without elevator service. These individuals had limited adaptive capacity because they could not easily leave their residences.\nEven with the extensive devastation, the effects of the storm would have been far worse if local climate resilience strategies had not been in place. For example, the City of New York and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority worked aggressively to protect life and property by stopping the operation of the city's subway before the storm hit and moving the train cars out of low-lying, flood-prone areas. At the height of the storm surge, all seven of the city's East River subway tunnels flooded. Catastrophic loss of life would have resulted if there had been subway trains operating in the tunnels when the storm struck. The storm also fostered vigorous debate among local and state politicians, other decision-makers, and stakeholders about how best to prepare the region for future storms. Planning is especially important given the expectation of increases in flood frequency resulting from more numerous extreme precipitation events and riverine and street level flooding, and coastal storm surge flooding associated with accelerated sea level rise and more intense (yet not necessarily more numerous) tropical storms.\n\n287\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f11: URBAN SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND VULNERABILITY\n\nKey Message 3: Social Vulnerability and Human Well-Being\n\nClimate vulnerability and adaptive capacity of urban residents and communities are influenced by pronounced social inequalities that reflect age, ethnicity, gender, income, health, and (dis)ability differences.\n\n\"Social vulnerability\" describes characteristics of populations that influence their capacity to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazards and disasters.22,23,24 Social vulnerability also refers to the sensitivity of a population to climate change impacts and how different people or groups are more or less vulnerable to those impacts.25 Those characteristics that most often influence differential impacts include socioeconomic status (wealth or poverty), age, gender, special needs, race, and ethnicity.26 Further, inequalities reflecting differences in gender, age, wealth, class, ethnicity, health, and disabilities also influence coping and adaptive capacity, especially to climate change and climate-sensitive hazards.27\nThe urban elderly are particularly sensitive to heat waves. They are often physically frail, have limited financial resources,\n\nand live in relative isolation in their apartments. They may not have adequate cooling (or heating), or may be unable to temporarily relocate to cooling stations. This combination led to a significant number of elderly deaths during the 1995 Chicago heat wave.28 Similarly, the impacts of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans illustrated profound differences based on race, gender, and class where these social inequalities strongly influenced the capacity of residents to prepare for and respond to the events.29 It is difficult to assess the specific nature of vulnerability for particular groups of people. Urban areas are not homogeneous in terms of the social structures that influence inequalities. Also, the nature of the vulnerability is context specific, with both temporal and geographic determinants, and these also vary between and within urban areas.\n\nKey Message 4: Trends in Urban Adaptation \u00ad Lessons from Current Adopters\n\nCity government agencies and organizations have started adaptation plans that focus on infrastructure systems and public health. To be successful, these adaptation efforts require cooperative private sector and governmental activities, but institutions face many barriers to implementing coordinated efforts.\n\nCity preparation efforts for climate change include planning for ways in which the infrastructure systems and buildings, ecosystem and municipal services, and residents will be affected. In the first large-scale analysis of U.S. cities, a 2011 survey showed that 58% of respondents are moving forward on climate adaptation (Ch. 28: Adaptation), defined as any activity to address impacts that climate change could have on a community. Cities are engaged in activities ranging from education and outreach to assessment, planning, and implementation, with 48% reporting that they are in the preliminary planning and discussion phases.30\nCities either develop separate strategic adaptation plans30,32 or integrate adaptation into community or general plans (as have Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Berkeley, California; and Homer, Alaska) (Ch. 28: Adaptation).1 Some climate action plans target certain sectors like critical infrastructure,24,33 and these have been effective in diverse contexts ranging from hazard mitigation and public-health planning to coastal-zone management and economic development.\nCities have employed several strategies for managing adaptation efforts. For example, some approaches to climate adaptation planning require both intra- and inter-governmental agency and department coordination (\"New York City Climate Action\") (Ch. 28: Adaptation). As a result, many cities focus on\n\nsharing information and examining what aspects of government operations will be affected by climate change impacts in order to gain support from municipal agency stakeholders and other local officials.34 Some cities also have shared climate change action experiences, both within the United States and internationally, as is the case with ongoing communication between decision-makers in New York City and London, England.\nNational, state, and local policies play an important role in fostering and sustaining adaptation. There are no national regulations specifically designed to promote urban adaptation. However, existing federal policies, like the National Historic Preservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act \u00ad particularly through its impact assessment provision and evaluation criteria process \u00ad can provide incentives for adaptation strategies for managing federal property in urban areas.1,35 In addition, recent activities of federal agencies focused on promoting adaptation and resilience have been developed in partnership with cities like Miami and New York.36 Policies and planning measures at the local level, such as building codes, zoning regulations, land-use plans, water supply management, green infrastructure initiatives, health care planning, and disaster mitigation efforts, can support adaptation.1,2,37\nEngaging the public in adaptation planning and implementation has helped to inform and educate the community at large\n\n288\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f11: URBAN SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND VULNERABILITY\n\nNew York City and Sea Level Rise\n\nplanning process (Ch. 26: Decision Support; Ch. 28: Adaptation).43 This means that climate projections and impact assessment data must be available, but most U.S. cities are unable to access suitable data or perform desired analyses.36 To address technical aspects of adaptation, cities are promoting cooperation with local experts, such as the New York City Panel on Climate Change, which brings together experts from academia and the public and private sectors to consider how the region's critical infrastructure will be affected by, and can be protected from, future climate change.10,44 A further illustration comes from Chicago, where multi-departmental groups are focusing on specific areas identified in Chicago's Climate Action Plan.45\n\nPrivate sector involvement can be\n\ninfluential in promoting city-level\n\nadaptation (Ch. 28: Adaptation).\n\nMany utilities, for example, have as-\n\nset management programs that ad-\n\ndress risk and vulnerabilities, which\n\ncould also serve to address climate\n\nFigure 11.3. Map shows areas in New York's five boroughs that are projected to face increased flooding over the next 70 years, assuming an increased rate of sea level rise from the past century's average.

Instances where\ncooperation has taken place include property insurance companies1,46\n\nand engineering firms that provide\n\nconsulting services to cities.

Pursuing low-cost, no-regrets options is a particularly attractive short-term strategy for many cities.39,46\nOver the long term, responses to severe climate change impacts, such as sea level rise and greater frequency and intensity of other climate-related hazards, are of a scale and complexity that will likely require major expenditures and structural changes,1,46 especially in urban areas. When major infrastructure decisions must be made in order to protect human lives and urban assets, cities need access to the best available science, decision support tools, funding, and guidance. The Federal Government is seen by local officials to have an important\n\nAdvancing climate adaptation in a\nmetropolitan region\nCoordinating efforts across many jurisdictional boundaries is a major challenge for adaptation planning and practice in extended metropolitan regions and associated regional systems (Ch. 28: Adaptation). Regional government institutions may be well suited to address this challenge, as they cover a larger geographic scope than individual cities, and have potential to coordinate the efforts of multiple jurisdictions.1 California already requires metropolitan planning organizations to prepare Sustainable Communities Strategies (SCS) as part of the Regional Transportation Plan process.51 While its focus is on reducing emissions, SCS plans prepared to date have also introduced topics related to climate change impacts and adaptation.52 Examples of climate change vulnerabilities that could benefit from a regional perspective include water shortages, transportation infrastructure maintenance, loss of native plant and animal species, and energy demand.\nrole here by providing adaptation leadership and financial and technical resources, and by conducting and disseminating research (Ch. 28: Adaptation).36,39,46\n\nNew york city climate action\nNew York City leaders recognized that climate change represents a serious threat to critical infrastructure and responded with a comprehensive program to address climate change impacts and increase resilience.1,2 The 2010 \"Climate Change Adaptation in New York City: Building a Risk Management Response\" report was prepared by the New York City Panel on Climate Change as a part of the city's long-term sustainability plan.10 Major components of the process and program include:\n\u00b7 establishing multiple participatory processes to obtain broad public input, including a Climate Change Adaptation Task Force that included private and public stakeholders;46\n\u00b7 forming an expert technical advisory body, the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC), to support the Task Force;\n\u00b7 developing a Climate Change Assessment and Action Plan that helps improve responses to present-day climate variability as well as projected future conditions;\n\u00b7 defining \"Climate Protection Levels\" to address the effectiveness of current regulations and design standards to respond to climate change impacts; and\n\u00b7 producing adaptation assessment guidelines that recognize the need for flexibility to reassess and adjust strategies over time. The guidelines include a risk matrix and prioritization framework intended to become integral parts of ongoing risk management and agency operations.\n\n290\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f11: URBAN SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND VULNERABILITY\n\nReferences\n\n1.

A consensus process was used to determine the final set of key messages, which are supported by extensive evidence documented in two Technical Report Inputs to the National Climate Assessment on urban systems, infrastructure, and vulnerability: 1) Climate Change and Infrastructure, Urban Systems, and Vulnerabilities: Technical Report for the U.S. Department of Energy in Support of the National Climate Assessment,2 and 2) U.S. Cities and Climate Change: Urban, Infrastructure, and Vulnerability Issues.1 Other Technical Input reports (56) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nKey message 1 Traceable Account\nClimate change and its impacts threaten the wellbeing of urban residents in all U.S. regions. Essential infrastructure systems such as water, energy supply, and transportation will increasingly be compromised by interrelated climate change impacts. The nation's economy, security, and culture all depend on the resilience of urban infrastructure systems.\nDescription of evidence base Recent studies have reported that population and economic growth have made urban infrastructure more fragile and deficient,1,2 with work projecting increased stresses due to climate change4 and increased costs of adaptation plans due to more extensive urban development.6 Additionally, a few publications have assessed the main drivers of vulnerability8,9 and the effects of the amalgamation of climate change stresses with other urban and infrastructure stressors.1\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Given that population trends and infrastructure assessments are well established and documented, the largest uncertainties are associated with the rate and extent of potential climate change.\nSince the 2009 National Climate Assessment,53 recent publications have explored the driving factors of vulnerability in urban systems8,9 and the effects of the combined effect of climate change and existing urban stressors.1\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that climate change and its impacts threaten the wellbeing of urban residents in all regions of the U.S.\nGiven the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that essential local and regional infrastructure systems such as water, energy supply, and transportation will increasingly be compromised by interrelated climate change impacts.\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.),\nhigh consensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium\nconsensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing\nschools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts\nKey message 2 Traceable Account\nIn urban settings, climate-related disruptions of services in one infrastructure system will almost always result in disruptions in one or more other infrastructure systems.\n\n295\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f11: URBAN SYSTEMS, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND VULNERABILITY Traceable Accounts\n\nDescription of evidence base The interconnections among urban systems and infrastructures have been noted in the past,19 with recent work expanding on this principle to assess the risks this interconnectivity poses. One study15 explored the misconception of independent systems, and stressed instead the interactive and interdependent nature of systems. The effects of climate change on one system ultimately affect systems that are dependent upon it.12 One of the foundational Technical Input Reports examined the economic effects from climate change and how they will affect urban areas.2 Noted examples of this interconnectivity can be found in a number of publications concerning Hurricane Katrina,14 intense weather in New York City,16,17 and the vulnerability of U.S. oil refineries and electric power plants.2,13\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Recent work has delved deeper into the interconnectivity of urban systems and infrastructure,2,12 and has expressed the importance of understanding these interactions when adapting to climate change.\n\nRecent work has addressed the social vulnerabilities to climate change at a more detailed level than in the past,23,25 providing information on the constraints that social vulnerabilities can have on climate change adaptation.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that the climate vulnerability and adaptive capacity of urban residents and communities are influenced by pronounced social inequalities that reflect age, ethnicity, gender, income, health, and (dis)ability differences.\nKey message 4 Traceable Account\nCity government agencies and organizations have started adaptation plans that focus on infrastructure systems and public health. To be successful, these adaptation efforts require cooperative private sector and governmental activities, but institutions face many barriers to implementing coordinated efforts.\n\nThe extensive number of infrastructure assessments has resulted in system interdependencies and cascade effects being well documented. Therefore, the most significant uncertainties are associated with the rate and extent of potential climate change.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that in urban settings, climate-related disruptions of services in one infrastructure system will almost always result in disruptions in one or more other infrastructure systems.\nKey message 3 Traceable Account\nClimate vulnerability and adaptive capacity of urban residents and communities are influenced by pronounced social inequalities that reflect age, ethnicity, gender, income, health, and (dis)ability differences.\nDescription of evidence base The topic of social vulnerability has been extensively studied,22,23,24 with some work detailing the social characteristics that are the most influential.26 More recent work has addressed the vulnerability of populations to climate change25 and how social inequalities influence capacity to adapt to climate change.27 Some empirical studies of U.S. urban areas were explored concerning these issues.9\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Given that population trends and socioeconomic factors associated with vulnerability and adaptive capacity are well established and documented, the largest uncertainties are associated with the rate and extent of potential climate change.\n\nDescription of evidence base Urban adaptation is already underway with a number of cities developing plans at the city30,32,33 and state levels,30 with some integrating adaptation into community plans1 and sharing information and assessing potential impacts.34 Some recent publications have explored how incentives and administrative and financial support can benefit climate adaptation through policy planning at the local level1,2,37 and by engaging the public.38,39,40 Barriers exist that can hinder the adaptation process, which has been demonstrated through publications assessing the availability of scientific data30,36 that is integral to the evaluation and planning process,43 uncertainty in the climate system and modeling techniques,49 and the challenges of gaining support and commitment from local officials.30,46\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Besides uncertainties associated with the rate and extent of potential climate change, uncertainties emerge from the fact that, to date, there have been few extended case studies examining how U.S. cities are responding to climate change (<10 studies). Furthermore, only one large-scale survey of U.S. cites has been conducted for which results have been published and widely available.30\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that city government agencies and organizations have started urban adaptation efforts that focus on infrastructure systems and public health.\n\n296\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 12\nINDIGENOUS PEOPLES,\nLAND, AND RESOURCES\nConvening Lead Authors\nT.M.

Observed and future impacts from climate change threaten Native Peoples' access to traditional foods such as fish, game, and wild and cultivated crops, which have provided sustenance as well as cultural, economic, medicinal, and community health for generations.\n2. A significant decrease in water quality and quantity due to a variety of factors, including  climate change, is affecting drinking water, food, and cultures. Native communities'  vulnerabilities and limited capacity to adapt to water-related challenges are exacerbated by historical and contemporary government policies and poor socioeconomic conditions.\n3. Declining sea ice in Alaska is causing significant impacts to Native communities, including increasingly risky travel and hunting conditions, damage and loss to settlements, food insecurity, and socioeconomic and health impacts from loss of cultures, traditional knowledge, and  homelands.\n4. Alaska Native communities are increasingly exposed to health and livelihood hazards from increasing temperatures and thawing permafrost, which are damaging critical infrastructure, adding to other stressors on traditional lifestyles.\n5. Climate change related impacts are forcing relocation of tribal and indigenous communities, especially in coastal locations. These relocations, and the lack of governance mechanisms or funding to support them, are causing loss of community and culture, health impacts, and  economic decline, further exacerbating tribal impoverishment.\n\nWe humbly ask permission from all our relatives; our elders, our families, our children, the winged and the insects, the four-legged, the swimmers, and all the plant and animal nations, to speak. Our Mother has cried out to us. She is in pain. We are called to answer her cries. Msit No'Kmaq \u00ad All my relations!\n-- Indigenous Prayer\n\nThe peoples, lands, and resources of indigenous communities in the United States, including Alaska and the Pacific Rim, face an array of climate change impacts and vulnerabilities that threaten many Native communities. The consequences of observed and projected climate change have and will undermine indigenous ways of life that have persisted for thousands of years. Key vulnerabilities include the loss of traditional knowledge in the face of rapidly changing ecological conditions, increased food insecurity due to reduced availability of traditional foods, changing water availability, Arctic sea ice loss, permafrost thaw, and relocation from historic homelands.1,2,3,4\nClimate change impacts on many of the 566 federally recognized tribes and other tribal and indigenous groups in the U.S. are projected to be especially severe, since these impacts are compounded by a number of persistent social and economic\n\nproblems.6,7 The adaptive responses to multiple social and ecological challenges arising from climate impacts on indigenous communities will occur against a complex backdrop of centuries-old cultures already stressed by historical events and contemporary conditions.8 Individual tribal responses will be grounded in the particular cultural and environmental heritage of each community, their social and geographical history, spiritual values, traditional ecological knowledge, and worldview. Furthermore, these responses will be informed by each group's distinct political and legal status, which includes the legacy of more than two centuries of non-Native social and governmental institutional arrangements, relationships, policies, and practices. Response options will be informed by the often limited economic resources available to meet these challenges, as well as these cultures' deeply ingrained relationships with the natural world.9,10,11,12\n\n298\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f12: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, LANDS, AND RESOURCES\n\nThe history and culture of many tribes and indigenous peoples are critical to understand before assessing additional climate change impacts. Most U.S. Native populations already face adverse socioeconomic factors such as extreme poverty; substandard and inadequate housing; a lack of health and community services, food, infrastructure, transportation, and education; low employment; and high fuel costs; as well as historical and current institutional and policy issues related to Native resources.7,11,12,13 The overwhelming driver of these adverse social indicators is pervasive poverty on reservations and in Native communities, as illustrated by an overall 28.4% poverty rate (36% for families with children) on reservations, compared with 15.3% nationally.13 Some reservations are far worse off, with more than 60% poverty rates and, in some cases, extremely low income levels (for example, Pine Ridge Reservation has the lowest per capita income in the U.S. at $1,535 per year).14\nThese poverty levels result in problems such as: a critical housing shortage of well over two hundred thousand safe, healthy, and affordable homes;15 a homeless rate of more than 10% on reservations;16 a lack of electricity (more than 14% of reservation homes are without power, ten times the national average, and, on the Navajo Reservation, about 40% of homes have no electricity17); lack of running water in one-fifth of all\n\nreservation homes and for about one-third of people on the Navajo Reservation (compared with 1% of U.S. national households);18,19,20 and an almost complete lack of modern telecommunications \u00ad fewer than 50% of homes have phone service, fewer than 10% of residents have Internet access, and many reservations have no cell phone reception.21 In addition, Native populations are also vulnerable because their physical, mental, intellectual, social, and cultural well-being is traditionally tied to a close relationship with the natural world, and because of their dependence on the land and resources for basic needs such as medicine, shelter, and food.22,23 Climate changes will exacerbate many existing barriers to providing for these human needs, and in many cases will make adaptive responses more difficult.\nOf the 5.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives registered in the U.S. Census, approximately 1.1 million live on or near reservations or Native lands, located mostly in the Northwest, Southwest, Great Plains, and Alaska. Tribal lands include approximately 56 million acres (about 3% of U.S. lands) in the 48 contiguous states and 44 million acres (about 42% of Alaska's land base) held by Alaska Native corporations.5 Most reservations are small and often remote or isolated, with a few larger exceptions such as the Navajo Reservation in Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico, which has 175,000 residents.5\n\nIndigenous Populations Extend beyond Reservation Lands\n\nFigure 12.1. Census data show that American Indian and Alaska Native populations are concentrated around, but are not limited to, reservation lands like the Hopi and Navajo in Arizona and New Mexico, the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee in Oklahoma, and various Sioux tribes in the Dakotas and Montana. Not depicted in this graphic is the proportion of Native Americans who live off-reservation and in and around urban centers (such as Chicago, Minneapolis, Denver, Albuquerque, and Los Angeles) yet still maintain strong family ties to their tribes, tribal lands, and cultural resources.

The map shows only those initiatives by federally recognized tribes that are funded through the Department of Energy. (Figure source: U.S. Department of Energy 201126).\n\n300\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f12: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, LANDS, AND RESOURCES\n\nNative American, Alaska Native, and other indigenous communities across the U.S. share unique historical and cultural relationships with tribal or ancestral lands, significantly shaping their identities and adaptive opportunities.11 Some climate change adaptation opportunities exist on Native lands, and traditional knowledge can enhance adaptation and sustainability strategies. In many cases, however, adaptation options are limited by poverty, lack of resources, or \u00ad for some Native communities, such as those along the northern coast of Alaska\n\nconstrained by public lands or on certain low-lying Pacific Islands \u00ad because there may be no land left to call their own. Conversely, for these same reasons, Native communities \u00ad especially in the Arctic \u00ad are also increasingly working to identify new economic opportunities associated with climate change and development activities (for example, oil and gas, mining, shipping, and tourism) and to optimize employment opportunities.1,27,28\n\nClimate Change and Traditional Knowledge\n\nIndigenous traditional knowledge has emerged in national and international arenas as a source of rich information for indigenous and non-indigenous climate assessments, policies, and adaptation strategies. Working Group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report recognized traditional knowledge as an important information source for improving the understanding of climate change and other changes over time, and for developing comprehensive natural resource management and climate adaptation strategies.29\nTraditional knowledge is essential to the economic and cultural survival of indigenous peoples, and, arguably, cultures throughout the world.30,31 Traditional knowledge has been defined as \"a cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief, evolving by adaptive processes and handed down through generations by cultural transmission, about the relationship of living beings (including humans) with one another and with their environment.\"1,12,32 From an indigenous perspective, traditional knowledge encompasses all that is known about the world around us and how to apply that knowledge in relation to those beings that share the world.12,33 As the elders of these communities \u00ad the \"knowledge keepers\" \u00ad pass away, the continued existence and viability of traditional knowledge is threatened. Programs are needed to help preserve the diverse traditional teachings and employ them to strive for balance among the physical, the spiritual, emotional, and intellectual \u00ad all things that encompass \"wolakota,\" meaning to be a complete human being.34\nMany, if not all, indigenous resource managers believe their cultures already possess sufficient knowledge to respond to climate variation and change.30,35 However, there are elements of traditional knowledge that are increasingly vulnerable with changing climatic conditions,4 including cultural identities, ceremonies, and traditional ways of life.36 The use of indigenous and traditional knowledge to address climate change issues in Indian country has been called \"indigenuity\" \u00ad indigenous knowledge plus ingenuity.33\n\nthan resources. Language, ceremonies, cultures, practices, and food sources evolved in concert with the inhabitants, human and non-human, of specific homelands.1,33 The wisdom and knowledge of Native people resides in songs, dances, art, language, and music that reflect these places. By regarding all things as relatives, not resources, natural laws dictate that people care for their relatives in responsible ways. \"When you say, `my mother is in pain,' it's very different from saying `the earth is experiencing climate change.'\"38,39 As climate change increasingly threatens these Native places, cultural identities, and practices, documenting the impacts on traditional lifestyles would strengthen adaptive strategies.\nTraditional knowledge has developed tangible and reliable methods for recording historic weather and climate variability and their impacts on native societies.40 For example, tribal community historians (winter count keepers) on the northern Great Plains recorded pictographs on buffalo hides to remember the sequence of events that marked each year, dating back to the 1600s. These once-reliable methods are becoming increasingly more difficult to maintain and less reliable as time passes.41\nThere are recent examples, however, where traditional knowledge and western-based approaches are used together to address climate change and related impacts. For example, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium chronicles climate change impacts on the landscape and on human health and also develops adaptation strategies.1 This Consortium employs western science, traditional ecological knowledge, and a vast network of \"Local Environmental Observers\" to develop comprehensive, community-scaled climate change health assessments.42 During a recent drought on the Navajo Reservation, traditional knowledge and western approaches were also applied together, as researchers worked with Navajo elders to observe meteorological and hydrological changes and other phenomena in an effort to assess and reduce disaster risks.43\n\nNative cultures are directly tied to Native places and homelands,\nreflecting the indigenous perspective that includes the \"power of place.\"6,36,37 Many indigenous peoples regard all people,\nplants, and animals that share our world as relatives rather\n\n301\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f12: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, LANDS, AND RESOURCES\n\nKey Message 1: Forests, Fires, and Food\n\nObserved and future impacts from climate change threaten Native Peoples' access to traditional foods such as fish, game, and wild and cultivated crops, which have provided sustenance as well as cultural, economic, medicinal, and community health for generations.\n\nClimate change impacts on forests and ecosystems are expected to have direct effects on culturally important plant and animal species, which will affect tribal sovereignty, culture, and economies.2,4 Warmer temperatures and more frequent drought are expected to cause dieback and tree loss of several tree and plant species (such as birch, brown ash, and sweet grass) important for Native artistic, cultural, and economic purposes, including tourism.22 Tribal access to valued resources is threatened by climate change impacts causing habitat degradation, forest conversion, and extreme changes in ecosystem processes.44\nObserved impacts from both the causes and consequences of climate change, and added stressors such as extractive industry practices on or near Native lands, include species loss and shifts in species range.1,45,46,47 There have also been observed changes in the distribution and population density of wildlife species, contraction or expansion of some plant species' range, and the northward migration of some temperate forest species.4,48 For example, moose populations in Maine and similar locations are expected to decline because of loss of preferred habitat and increased winter temperatures, which are enabling ticks to survive through the winter and causing damage from significant infestation of the moose.22\n\nLoss of biodiversity, changes in ranges and abundance of culturally important native plants and animals, increases in invasive species, bark beetle damage to forests, and increased risk of forest fires have been observed in the Southwest, across much of the West, and in Alaska (see also Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement, Figure 31; Ch. 7: Forests; Ch. 8: Ecosystems).4,30,48,49 Changes in ocean temperature and acidity affect distribution and abundance of important food sources, like fish and shellfish (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate; Ch. 24: Oceans).\nRising temperatures and hotter, drier summers are projected to increase the frequency and intensity of large wildfires (see Ch. 7: Forests).44 Warmer, drier, and longer fire seasons and increased forest fuel load will lead to insect outbreaks and the spread of invasive species, dry grasses, and other fuel sources (see Ch. 7: Forests). Wildfire threatens Native and tribal homes, safety, economies, culturally important species, medicinal plants, traditional foods, and cultural sites. \"Fire affects the plants, which affect the water, which affects the fish, which affect terrestrial plants and animals, all of which the Karuk rely on for cultural perpetuity.\"50\nIn interior Alaska, rural Native communities are experiencing new risks associated with climate change related wildfires in boreal forests and Arctic tundra (see also Ch. 22: Alaska).1,51 Reliance on local, wild foods and the isolated nature of these communities, coupled with their varied preparedness and limited ability to deal with wildfires, leaves many communities at an increased risk of devastation brought on by fires. While efforts are being made to better coordinate rural responses to wildfires in Alaska, current responses are limited by organization and geographic isolation.48\n\nIndigenous peoples have historically depended on the gather-\ning and preparation of a wide variety of local plant and animal\nspecies for food (frequently referred to as traditional foods),\nmedicines, ceremonies, community cohesion, and economic health for countless generations.2,52 These include corn, beans,\nsquash, seals, fish, shellfish, bison, bear, caribou, walrus,\nmoose, deer, wild rice, cottonwood trees, and a multitude of native flora and fauna.2,45,47,49,52,53,54,55,56,57 A changing climate\naffects the availability, tribal access to, and health of these resources.1,2,4,47,57,58,59,60 This in turn threatens tribal customs,\ncultures, and identity.\n\n\u00a9Phil Schermeister/Corbis\n\nHarvesting traditional foods is important to Native Peoples' culture, health, and economic well being. In the Great Lakes region, wild rice is unable to grow in its traditional range due to warming winters and changing water levels.\n\nMedicinal and food plants are becoming increasingly difficult to find or are no longer found in historical ranges.2,56 For ex-\nample, climate change and other environmental stressors are\naffecting the range, quality, and quantity of berry resources\n\n302\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f12: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, LANDS, AND RESOURCES\n\nfor the Wabanaki tribes in the Northeast.2,61 The Karuk people\nin California have experienced a near elimination of both sal-\nmonids and acorns, which comprise 50% of a traditional Karuk diet.62 In the Great Lakes region, wild rice is unable to grow in\nits traditional range due to warming winters and changing wa-\nter levels, affecting the Anishinaabe peoples' culture, health, and well-being.54\n\n\u00a9David McLain/Aurora Photos\n\nSubsequent shifts from traditional lifestyles and diet, com-\npounded by persistent poverty, food insecurity, the cost of\nnon-traditional foods, and poor housing conditions have led to\nincreasing health problems in communities, also increasing the risk to food and resource security.1,2,16 Climate change is likely\nto amplify other indirect effects to traditional foods and re-\nsources, including limited access to gathering places and hunting grounds and environmental pollution.4,57,59\n\nHuman-caused stresses such as dam building have greatly reduced salmon on the Klamath River.\n\nKey Message 2: Water Quality and Quantity\n\nA significant decrease in water quality and quantity due to a variety of factors, including climate change, is affecting drinking water, food, and cultures. Native communities'\nvulnerabilities and limited capacity to adapt to water-related challenges are exacerbated by historical and contemporary government policies and poor socioeconomic conditions.\n\nNative communities and tribes in different parts of the U.S.\nhave observed changes in precipitation affecting their water\nresources. On the Colorado Plateau, tribes have been experiencing drought for more than a decade.63,64 Navajo elders have\nobserved long-term decreases in annual snowfall over the past\ncentury, a transition from wet to dry conditions in the 1940s, and a decline in surface water features.20 Changes in long-term\naverage temperature and precipitation have produced changes\nin the physical and hydrologic environment, making the Navajo\nNation more susceptible to drought impacts, and some springs and shallow water wells on the Navajo Nation have gone dry.43\nSouthwest tribes have observed damage to their agriculture\nand livestock, the loss of springs and medicinal and culturally\n\nimportant plants and animals, and impacts on drinking water supplies.63,64,65,66 In the Northwest, tribal treaty rights to traditional territories and resources are being affected by the reduction of rainfall and snowmelt in the mountains, melting glaciers, rising temperatures, and shifts in ocean currents.52,58,67 In Hawai`i, Native peoples have observed a shortening of the rainy season, increasing intensity of storms and flooding, and a rainfall pattern that has become unpredictable.38 In Alaska, water availability, quality, and quantity are threatened by the consequences of permafrost thaw, which has damaged community water infrastructure, as well as by the northward extension of diseases such as those caused by the Giardia parasite, a result of disease-carriers like beavers moving northward in\nresponse to rising temperatures.68 The impact of historical federal policies, such as the late 1800s allotment policy and practices regarding Native access to treaty-protected resources,69 reverberate in current practices, such as states and the government permitting oil drilling and hydraulic fracturing on lands in and around reservations but outside of tribal jurisdiction (for example, a 2013 pipeline spill upstream of tribal reservations in Western North Dakota, and others). Such policies and practices exacerbate the threat to water quality and quantity for Native communities.\n\n\u00a9Ted Wood Photography\n\nCoal plant and fishermen, Navajo Reservation\n\nNative American tribes have unique and signifi-\ncant adaptation needs related to climate impacts on water.66 There is little available data to\nestablish baseline climatic conditions on tribal\n\n303\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f12: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, LANDS, AND RESOURCES\n\nlands, and many tribes do not have sufficient capacity to monitor changing conditions.63 Without scientific monitoring, tribal decision-makers lack the data needed to quantify and evaluate current conditions and emerging trends in precipitation, streamflow, and soil moisture, and to plan and manage resources accordingly.10,64,66 However, some existing efforts to document climate impacts on water resources could be replicated in other regions to assess hydrologic vulnerabilities.58\nWater infrastructure is in disrepair or lacking on some reservations.43,70 Approximately 30% of people on the Navajo Nation are not served by municipal systems and must haul water to meet their daily needs.19,43 Longer-term impacts of this lack of control over water access are projected to include loss of traditional agricultural crops.19,43 Furthermore, there is an overall lack of financial resources to support basic water infrastructure on tribal lands.63 Uncertainty associated with undefined tribal water rights make it difficult to determine strategies to deal with water resource issues.70 Potential impacts to treaty rights and water resources exist, such as a reduction of groundwater and drinking water availability and water quality decline, including impacts from oil and natural gas extraction and sea level rise-induced saltwater intrusion into coastal freshwater aquifers (see also Ch. 3: Water).7 New datasets on climate impacts on water in many locations throughout Indian Country, such as the need to quantify available water and aquifer monitoring, will be important for improved adaptive planning.\n\nSand Dune Expansion\nFigure 12.3. On the Arizona portion of the Navajo Nation, recurring drought and rising temperatures have accelerated growth and movement of sand dunes. Map above shows range and movement of Great Falls Dune Field from 1953 to 2010. Moving and/or growing dunes can threaten roads, homes, traditional grazing areas, and other tribal assets. (Figure source: Redsteer et al. 201155).\n\nKey Message 3: Declining Sea Ice\n\nDeclining sea ice in Alaska is causing significant impacts to Native communities, including increasingly risky travel and hunting conditions, damage and loss to settlements, food insecurity, and socioeconomic and health impacts from loss of cultures, traditional knowledge, and homelands.\n\n\"...since the late 1970s, communities along the coast of the northern Bering and Chukchi Seas have noticed substantial changes in the ocean and the animals that live there. While we are used to changes from year-to-year in weather, hunting conditions, ice patterns, and animal populations, the past two decades have seen clear trends in many environmental factors. If these trends continue, we can expect major, perhaps irreversible, impacts to our communities....\"\n\u00ad C. Pungowiyi, personal communication71\n\nScientists across the Arctic have documented rising regional temperatures over the past few decades at twice the global rate, and indigenous Arctic communities have observed these changes in their daily lives.1 This temperature increase \u00ad which is expected to continue with future climate change \u00ad is accompanied by significant reductions in sea ice thickness and extent, increased permafrost thaw, more extreme weather and severe storms, and changes in seasonal ice melt/freeze of lakes and rivers, water temperature, sea level rise, flooding patterns, erosion, and snowfall timing and type (see also Ch. 2:\n\n304\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f12: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, LANDS, AND RESOURCES\nSea Ice Cover Reaches Record Low\n\nFigure 12.4. In August and September 2012, sea ice covered less of the Arctic Ocean than any time since the beginning of reliable satellite measurements (1979). The long-term retreat of sea ice has occurred faster than climate models had predicted. The average minimum extent of sea ice for 1979-2000 was 2.59 million square miles. The image on the left shows Arctic minimum sea ice extent in 1984, which was about the average minimum extent for 1979-2000. The image on the right shows that the extent of sea ice had dropped to 1.32 million square miles at the end of summer 2012. Alaska Native coastal communities rely on sea ice for many reasons, including its role as a buffer against coastal erosion from storms.

Dramatic reductions in Arctic sea ice and changes in its timing and composition affect the entire food web, including many Inupiaq communities that continue to rely heavily on subsistence hunting and fishing. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC).\n\nOur Changing Climate).71,72,73,74,75 These climate-driven changes in turn increase the number of serious problems for Alaska Native populations, which include injury from extreme or unpredictable weather and thinning sea ice, which can trap people far from home; changing snow and ice conditions that limit safe hunting, fishing, or herding practices; malnutrition and food insecurity from lack of access to subsistence food; contamination of food and water; increasing economic, mental, and social problems from loss of culture and traditional livelihood; increases in infectious diseases; and the loss of buildings and infrastructure from permafrost erosion and thawing, resulting in the relocation of entire communities (Ch. 22: Alaska).1,68,71,75,76\nAlaska Native Inupiat and Yup'ik experts and scientists have observed stronger winds than in previous decades,71,75,78 observations\n\n305\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f12: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, LANDS, AND RESOURCES\n\nthat are consistent with scientific findings showing changing\nArctic wind patterns, which in turn influence loss of sea ice and shifts in North American and European weather.79 They also\nobserve accelerated melting of ice and snow, and movement\nof ice and marine mammals far beyond accessible range for Native hunters.1 Thinning sea ice, earlier ice break-up, increas-\ning temperatures, and changes in precipitation (for example,\n\nin the timing and amount of snow) also cause changes in criti-\ncal feeding, resting, breeding, and denning habitats for arctic\nmammals important as subsistence foods, like polar bears, walrus, and seals.1,73,75,80\n\nKey Message 4: Permafrost Thaw\n\nAlaska Native communities are increasingly exposed to health and livelihood hazards from increasing temperatures and thawing permafrost, which are damaging critical infrastructure,\nadding to other stressors on traditional lifestyles.\n\nThe increased thawing of permafrost (permanently frozen soil) along the coasts and rivers is an especially potent threat to Alaska Native villages because it causes serious erosion, flooding, and destruction of homes, buildings, and roads from differential settlement, slumping, and/or collapse of underlying base sediments (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate; Ch.22: Alaska, Key Message 3).81 This loss of infrastructure is further exacerbated by loss of land-fast sea ice, sea level rise, and severe storms.1,82,83 At this time, more than 30 Native villages in Alaska (such as Newtok and Shishmaref) are either in need of, or in the process of, relocating their entire village.1,84\n\nThawing Permafrost in Alaska\n\nSerious public health issues arise due to damaged infrastructure caused by these multiple erosion threats. Among them are loss of clean water for drinking and hygiene, saltwater intrusion, and sewage contamination that could cause respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, pneumonia, and skin infections.1,76,82,85 In addition, permafrost thaw is causing food insecurity in Alaska Native communities due to the thawing of ice cellars or ice houses used for subsistence food storage. This in turn leads to food contamination and sickness as well as dependence upon expensive, less healthy, non-traditional \"storebought\" foods.1,85,86\n\nFigure 12.6. The maps show projected ground temperature at a depth of 3.3 feet assuming continued increases in emissions (A2 scenario) and assuming a substantial reduction in emissions (B1 scenario). Blue shades represent areas below freezing at a depth of 3.3 feet and yellow and red shades represent areas above freezing at that depth (see Ch. 22: Alaska for more details). Many Alaska Natives depend on permafrost for ice cellars to store frozen food, and replacing these cellars with electricity-driven freezers is expensive or otherwise infeasible. Permafrost thawing also affects infrastructure like roads and utility lines.

These relocations, and the lack of governance mechanisms or funding to support them, are causing loss of community and culture, health impacts, and\neconomic decline, further exacerbating tribal impoverishment.\n\nNative peoples are no strangers to relocation and its consequences on their communities. Many eastern and southeastern tribal communities were forced to relocate to Canada or the western Great Lakes in the late 1700s and early 1800s and, later, to Oklahoma, compelling them to adjust and adapt to new and unfamiliar landscapes, subsistence resources, and climatic conditions. Forced relocations have continued into more recent times as well.87 Now, many Native peoples in Alaska and other parts of the coastal United States, such as the Southeast and Pacific Northwest, are facing relocation as a consequence of climate change and additional stressors, such as food insecurity and unsustainable development and extractive practices on or near Native lands; such forms of displacement are leading to severe livelihood, health, and socio-cultural impacts on the communities.1,3,23,38,45,88,89,90,91\n\n\u00a9Michael Brubaker\n\nFor example, Newtok, a traditional Yup'ik village in Alaska, is experiencing accelerated rates of erosion caused by the combination of decreased Arctic sea ice, thawing permafrost, and extreme weather events (Ch. 22: Alaska).1,3 As a result, the community has lost critical basic necessities and infrastructure. While progress has been made toward relocation, limitations of existing federal and state statutes and regulations have impeded their efforts, and the absence of legal authority and a governance structure to facilitate relocation are significant barriers to the relocation of Newtok and other Alaska Native villages.3,88,92 Tribal communities in coastal Louisiana are experiencing climate change induced rising sea levels, along with saltwater intrusion, subsidence, and intense erosion and land loss due to oil and gas extraction, levees, dams, and other river management techniques, forcing them to either relocate or try to find ways to save their land.3,45 Tribal communities in Florida are facing potential displacement due to the risk of rising sea levels and saltwater intrusion inundating their reservation lands.93 The Quileute tribe in northern Washington is responding to increased winter storms and flooding connected with increased precipitation by relocating some of their village homes and buildings to higher ground within 772 acres of Olympic National Park that has been transferred to them; the Hoh tribe is also looking at similar options for relocation.90,94,95 Native Pacific Island communities, including those in Hawai`i and the U.S. affiliated Pacific Islands, are also being forced to consider relocation plans due to increasing sea level rise and storm surges.38,96 While many Native communities are not necessarily being forced to relocate, they are experiencing other social and cultural forms of displacement. For example, rising sea levels are expected to damage Native coastal middens (sites reflecting past human activity such as food preparation)\n\nRising temperatures are causing damage in Native villages in Alaska as sea ice declines and permafrost thaws. Resident of Selawik, Alaska, and his granddaughter survey a water line sinking into the thawing permafrost, August 2011.\nas well as Wabanaki coastal petroglyphs, leading to loss of culture and connection to their past for Northeast tribes.22\nCurrently, the U.S. lacks an institutional framework to relocate entire communities. National, state, local, and tribal government agencies lack the legal authority and the technical, organizational, and financial capacity to implement relocation processes for communities forcibly displaced by climate change.3,12 New governance institutions, frameworks, and funding mechanisms are needed to specifically respond to the increasing necessity for climate change induced relocation.3,88 To be effective and culturally appropriate, it is important that such institutional frameworks recognize the sovereignty of tribal governments and that any institutional development stems from significant engagement with tribal representatives.12\n\"In Indigenous cultures, it is understood that ecosystems are chaotic, complex, organic, in a constant state of flux, and filled with diversity. No one part of an ecosystem is considered more important than another part and all parts have synergistic roles to play. Indigenous communities say that `all things are connected' \u00ad the land to the air and water, the earth to the sky, the plants to the animals, the people to the spirit.\"\n\u00ad Patricia Cochran, Inupiat Leader97\n\n307\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f12: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, LANDS, AND RESOURCES\n\nReferences\n\n1.

These meetings included:\nOklahoma Inter-Tribal Meeting on Climate Variability and Change held on December 12, 2011, at the National Weather Center, Norman, OK, attended by 73 people.56\nIndigenous Knowledge and Education (IKE) Hui Climate Change and Indigenous Cultures forum held in January 2012 in Hawai`i and attended by 36 people.38\nAlaska Forum on the Environment held from February 6-10, 2012, at the Dena'ina Convention Center in Anchorage, Alaska, and attended by about 1400 people with approximately 30 to 60 people per session.27\nStories of Change: Coastal Louisiana Tribal Communities' Experiences of a Transforming Environment, a workshop held from January 22-27, 2012, in Pointe-au-Chien, Louisiana, and attended by 47 people.45\nAmerican Indian Alaska Native Climate Change Working Group 2012 Spring Meeting held from April 23\u00ad24, 2012, at the Desert Diamond Hotel-Casino in Tucson, Arizona, and attended by 80 people.98\nFirst Stewards Symposium. First Stewards: Coastal Peoples Address Climate Change. National Museum of the American Indian, Washington DC. July 17-20, 2012.30\nIn developing key messages, the Chapter Author Team engaged in multiple technical discussions via teleconferences from August 2011 to March 2012 as they reviewed more than 200 technical inputs provided by the public, as well as other published literature and professional judgment. Subsequently, the Chapter Author Team teleconferenced weekly between March and July 2012 for expert deliberations of draft key messages by the authors. Each key message was defended by the entire author team before being\n\nselected for inclusion in the chapter report. These discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each message.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nObserved and future impacts from climate change threaten Native Peoples' access to traditional foods such as fish, game, and wild and cultivated crops, which have provided sustenance as well as cultural, economic, medicinal, and community health for generations.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarize extensive evidence documented in more than 200 technical input reports on a wide range of topics that were received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nNumerous peer-reviewed publications describe loss of biodiversity, impacts on culturally important native plants and animals, increases in invasive species, bark beetle damage to forests, and increased risk of forest fires that have been observed across the United States.4,7,22,49,52,58\nClimate drivers associated with this key message are also discussed in Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate.\nThere are also many relevant and recent peer-reviewed publications1,2,4,48,52,58,66 describing the northward migration of the boreal forest and changes in the distribution and density of wildlife species that have been observed.\nObserved impacts on plant and animal species important to traditional foods, ceremonies, medicinal, cultural and economic well-being, including species loss and shifts in species range, are well-documented.1,2,4,6,7,22,45,46,47,52\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key uncertainty is how indigenous people will adapt to climate change, given their reliance on local, wild foods and the isolated nature of some communities, coupled with their varied preparedness and limited ability to deal with wildfires. Increased wildfire\n\n314\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f12: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, LANDS, AND RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\noccurrences may affect tribal homes, safety, economy, culturally important species, medicinal plants, traditional foods, and cultural sites.\nThere is uncertainty as to the extent that climate change will affect Native American and Alaska Natives' access to traditional foods such as salmon, shellfish, crops, and marine mammals, which have provided sustenance as well as cultural, economic, medicinal, and community health for countless generations.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Based on the evidence and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that observed and future impacts from climate change, such as increased frequency and intensity of wildfires, higher temperatures, changes in sea ice, and ecosystem changes, such as forest loss and habitat damage, are threatening Native American and Alaska Natives' access to traditional foods such as salmon, shellfish, crops, and marine mammals, which have provided sustenance as well as cultural, economic, medicinal, and community health for countless generations.\n\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nA significant decrease in water quality and quantity due to a variety of factors, including climate change, is affecting drinking water, food, and cultures. Native communities' vulnerabilities and limited capacity to adapt to water-related challenges are exacerbated by historical and contemporary government policies and poor socioeconomic conditions.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in more than 200 technical input reports on a wide range of topics that were received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nThere are numerous examples of tribal observations of changes in precipitation, rainfall patterns, and storm intensity and impacts on surface water features, agriculture, grazing, medicinal and culturally important plants and animals, and water resources.2,4,6,7,43,52,55,58,63,64,65,66\n\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.),\nhigh consensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium\nconsensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing\nschools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts\n\nExamples of ceremonies are included in the Oklahoma Inter-Tribal Meeting on Climate Variability and Change Meeting Summary Report.56 Water is used for some ceremonies, so it can be problematic when there is not enough at the tribe's disposal.52,56,66 More than one tribe at the meeting also expressed how heat has been a problem during ceremonies because the older citizens cannot go into lodges that lack air conditioning.56\nNew information and remaining uncertainties There is limited data to establish baseline climatic conditions on tribal lands, and many tribes do not have sufficient capacity to monitor changing conditions.10,52,63,66 Without monitoring, tribal decision-makers lack the data needed to quantify and evaluate the current conditions and emerging trends in precipitation, streamflow, and soil moisture, and to plan and manage resources accordingly.10,52,64,66\nWater infrastructure is in disrepair or lacking on some reservations.43,70 There is an overall lack of financial resources to support basic water infrastructure on tribal lands, such as is found in the Southwest.63\nTribes that rely on water resources to maintain their cultures, religions, and life ways are especially vulnerable to climate change. Monitoring data is needed to establish baseline climatic conditions and to monitor changing conditions on tribal lands. Uncertainty associated with undefined tribal water rights makes it difficult to determine strategies to deal with water resource issues.70\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Based on the evidence and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that decreases in water quality and quantity are affect-\n\n315\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f12: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, LANDS, AND RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\ning Native Americans and Alaska Natives' drinking water supplies, food, cultures, ceremonies, and traditional ways of life. Based upon extensive evidence, there is very high confidence that Native communities' vulnerabilities and lack of capacity to adapt to climate change are exacerbated by historical and contemporary federal and state land-use policies and practices, political marginalization, legal issues associated with tribal water rights, water infrastructure deficiencies, and poor socioeconomic conditions.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nDeclining sea ice in Alaska is causing significant impacts to Native communities, including increasingly risky travel and hunting conditions, damage and loss to settlements, food insecurity, and socioeconomic and health impacts from loss of cultures, traditional knowledge, and homelands.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in more than 200 technical input reports on a wide range of topics that were received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nEvidence that summer sea ice is rapidly declining is based on satellite data and other observational data and is incontrovertible. The seasonal pattern of observed loss of Arctic sea ice is generally consistent with simulations by global climate models, in which the extent of sea ice decreases more rapidly in summer than in winter (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). Projections by these models indicate that the Arctic Ocean is projected to become virtually ice-free in summer before mid-century, and models that best match historical trends project a nearly sea ice-free Arctic in summer by the 2030s.74 Extrapolation of the present observed trends suggests an even earlier ice-free Arctic in summer. (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate and Ch. 22: Alaska).\nSea ice loss is altering marine ecosystems; allowing for greater ship access and new development; increasing Native community vulnerabilities due to changes in sea ice thickness and extent; destroying housing, village sanitation and other infrastructure (including entire villages); and increasing food insecurity due to lack of access to subsistence food and loss of cultural traditions. Evidence for all these impacts of sea ice loss is well-documented in field studies, indigenous knowledge, and scientific literature.1,2,3,71,73,75,78\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key uncertainty is how indigenous peoples will be able to maintain historical subsistence ways of life, which include hunting, fishing, harvesting, and sharing, and sustain the traditional relationship with the environment given the impacts from sea ice decline and changes. Increased sea ice changes and declines are already causing increasingly hazardous hunting and traveling conditions along ice edges; damage to homes and infrastructure from\n\nerosion; changes in habitat for subsistence foods and species, with overall impacts on food insecurity and for species necessary for medicines, ceremonies, and other traditions.1 The effects of sea ice loss are exacerbated by other climate change driven impacts such as changes in snow and ice, weather, in-migration of people, poverty, lack of resources to respond to changes, and contamination of subsistence foods.1,2\nAdditional observations and monitoring are needed to more adequately document ice and weather changes.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Based on the evidence and remaining uncertainties, there is very high confidence that loss of sea ice is affecting the traditional life ways of Native communities in a number of important ways, such as more hazardous travel and hunting conditions along the ice edge; erosion damage to homes, infrastructure, and sanitation facilities (including loss of entire villages); changes in ecosystem habitats and, therefore, impacts on food security; and socioeconomic and health impacts from cultural and homeland losses.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nAlaska Native communities are increasingly exposed to health and livelihood hazards from increasing temperatures and thawing permafrost, which are damaging critical infrastructure, adding to other stressors on traditional lifestyles.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in more than 200 technical input reports on a wide range of topics that were received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nGiven the evidence base and uncertainties, confidence is high that rising temperatures are thawing permafrost and that this thawing is expected to continue (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate) Permafrost temperatures are increasing over Alaska and much of the Arctic. Regions of discontinuous permafrost (where annual average soil temperatures of already close to 32\u00b0F) are highly vulnerable to thaw (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).81\nThere are also many relevant and recent peer-reviewed publications1,3,82,83 describing the impact of permafrost thaw on Alaska Native villages. Over 30 Native villages in Alaska are in need of relocation or are in the process of being moved. Recent work1,84,85 documents public health issues such as contamination of clean water for drinking and hygiene and food insecurity through thawing of ice cellars for subsistence food storage.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Improved models and observational data (see Ch. 22: Alaska) confirmed many of the findings from the prior 2009 Alaska as-\n\n316\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f12: INDIGENOUS PEOPLES, LANDS, AND RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\nsessment chapter, which informed the 2009 National Climate Assessment.99\nA key uncertainty is how indigenous peoples in Alaska will be able to sustain traditional subsistence life ways when their communities and settlements on the historical lands of their ancestors are collapsing due to permafrost thawing, flooding, and erosion combined with loss of shore-fast ice, sea level rise, and severe storms, especially along the coasts and rivers.1\nAnother uncertainty is how indigenous communities can protect the health and welfare of the villagers from permafrost-thawcaused public health issues of drinking water contamination, loss of traditional food storage, and potential food contamination.1\n\ntense erosion and land loss due to oil and gas extraction and river management, forcing them to either relocate or try to find ways to save their land (see also Ch. 25: Coasts and Ch. 17 Southeast).3,45 Tribal communities in Florida are facing potential displacement due to the risk of rising sea levels and saltwater intrusion inundating their reservation lands.93 The Quileute tribe in northern Washington is relocating some of their village homes and buildings to Olympic National Park in response to increased winter storms and flooding connected with increased precipitation; the Hoh tribe is also considering similar options.90,94\nNative Pacific Island communities are being forced to consider relocation plans due to increasing sea level rise and storm surges (see also Ch. 23: Hawai`i and Pacific Islands).38\n\nIt is uncertain how Native communities will be able to effectively relocate and maintain their culture, particularly because there are no institutional frameworks, legal authorities, or funding to implement relocation for communities forced to relocate.1,3,12\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Based on the evidence and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that Alaska Native communities are increasingly exposed to health and livelihood hazards from permafrost thawing and increasing temperatures, which are causing damage to roads, water supply and sanitation systems, homes, schools, ice cellars, and ice roads, and threatening traditional lifestyles.\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nClimate change related impacts are forcing relocation of tribal and indigenous communities, especially in coastal locations. These relocations, and the lack of governance mechanisms or funding to support them, are causing loss of community and culture, health impacts, and economic decline, further exacerbating tribal impoverishment.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarizes extensive evidence documented in more than 200 technical input reports on a wide range of topics that were received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key uncertainty is the extent to which the combination of other impacts (for example, erosion caused by dredging for oil pipelines or second-order effects from adaptation-related development projects) will coincide with sea level rise and other climate-related issues to increase the rate at which communities will need to relocate.1,3,38\nAnother key uncertainty is how communities will be able to effectively relocate, maintain their communities and culture, and reduce the impoverishment risks that often go along with relocation.1,3,38 The United States lacks an institutional framework to relocate entire communities, and national, state, local, and tribal government agencies lack the legal authority and the technical, organizational, and financial capacity to implement relocation processes for communities forcibly displaced by climate change.3,12\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Based on the evidence, there is very high confidence that tribal communities in Alaska, coastal Louisiana, Pacific Islands, and other coastal locations are being forced to relocate due to sea level rise, coastal erosion, melting permafrost, and/or extreme weather events. There is very high confidence that these relocations and the lack of governance mechanisms or funding to support them are causing loss of community and culture, health impacts, and economic decline, further exacerbating tribal impoverishment.\n\nThere is well-documented evidence that tribal communities are vulnerable to coastal erosion that could force them to relocate.1,3,23,38,88,89 For example, tribal communities in Alaska, such as Newtok, Kivalina, and Shishmaref, are experiencing accelerated rates of erosion caused by the combination of decreased Arctic sea ice, thawing permafrost, and extreme weather events, resulting in loss of basic necessities and infrastructure (see also Ch. 22: Alaska).1,3,88,91\n\nTribal communities in coastal Louisiana are experiencing climateinduced rising sea levels, along with saltwater intrusion and in-\n\n317\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 13\nLAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGE\nConvening Lead Authors\nDaniel G.

Choices about land-use and land-cover patterns have affected and will continue to affect how vulnerable or resilient human communities and ecosystems are to the effects of climate change.\n2. Land-use and land-cover changes affect local, regional, and global climate processes.\n3. Individuals, businesses, non-profits, and governments have the capacity to make land-use decisions to adapt to the effects of climate change.\n4. Choices about land use and land management may provide a means of reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels.\n\nIn addition to emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases from energy, industrial, agricultural, and other activities, humans also affect climate through changes in land use (activities taking place on land, like growing food, cutting trees, or building cities) and land cover (the physical characteristics of the land surface, including grain crops, trees, or concrete).1 For example, cities are warmer than the surrounding countryside because the greater extent of paved areas in cities affects how water and energy are exchanged between the land and the atmosphere. This increases the exposure of urban populations to the effects of extreme heat events. Decisions about land use and land cover can therefore affect, positively or negatively, how much our climate will change and what kind of vulnerabilities humans and natural systems will face as a result.\nThe impacts of changes in land use and land cover cut across all regions and sectors of the National Climate Assessment. Chapters addressing each region discuss land-use and land-cover topics of particular concern to specific regions. Similarly, chapters addressing sectors examine specific land-use matters. In particular, land cover and land use are a major focus for sectors such as agriculture, forests, rural and urban communities, and\n\nNative American lands. By contrast, the key messages of this chapter are national in scope and synthesize the findings of other chapters regarding land cover and land use.\nLand uses and land covers change over time in response to evolving economic, social, and biophysical conditions.2 Many of these changes are set in motion by individual landowners and land managers and can be quantified from satellite measurements, aerial photographs, on-the-ground observations, and reports from landowners and users.3,4 Over the past few decades, the most prominent land changes within the U.S. have been changes in the amount and kind of forest cover due to logging practices and development in the Southeast and Northwest and to urban expansion in the Northeast and Southwest.\nBecause humans control land use and, to a large extent, land cover, individuals, businesses, non-profit organizations, and governments can make land decisions to adapt to and/or reduce the effects of climate change. Often the same land-use decision can serve both aims. Adaptation options (those aimed at coping with the effects of climate change) include varying the local mix of vegetation and concrete to reduce heat in cities or elevating homes to reduce exposure to sea level rise or flooding. Land-use and land-cover-related options for mitigating climate change (reducing the speed and amount of climate change) include expanding forests to accelerate removal of carbon from the atmosphere, modifying the way cities are built and organized to reduce energy and motorized transportation demands, and altering agricultural management practices to increase carbon storage in soil.\n\n\u00a9Ted Wood Photography\n\nLand-use and land-cover changes affect climate processes: Above, development along Colorado's Front Range.\n\nDespite this range of climate change response options, there are three main reasons why private and public landowners may choose not to modify land uses and land covers for climate adaptation or mitigation purposes. First, land decisions\n\n319\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f13: LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGE\n\nare influenced not only by climate but also by economic, cultural, legal, or other considerations. In many cases, climatebased land-change efforts to adapt to or reduce climate change meet with resistance because current practices are too costly to modify and/or too deeply entrenched in local societies and cultures. Second, certain land uses and land covers are simply difficult to modify, regardless of desire or intent. For instance, the number of homes constructed in floodplains or the amount of irrigated agriculture can be so deeply rooted that\n\nthey are difficult to change, no matter how much those practices might impede our ability to respond to climate change. Finally, the benefits of land-use decisions made by individual landowners with specific adaptation or mitigation goals do not always accrue to those landowners or even to their communities. Therefore, without some institutional intervention (such as incentives or penalties), the motivations for such decisions can be weak.\n\nRecent Trends\nIn terms of land area, the U.S. remains a predominantly rural and exurban areas), which are not well-represented in com-\ncountry, especially as its population increasingly gravitates monly used satellite measurements, have rapidly expanded towards urban areas.

In terms of area, the Northwest has wide range of environmental impacts and thus represent a\n\nthe smallest projected increase in urban area (approximately key means by which developed lands modify the movement of\n\n4.2 million acres) and the Southeast the largest (approximately water, energy, and living things.

In general, scenarios that assume continued high growth produce more rapid increases in developed areas of all densities and in areas covered by impervious surfaces (paved areas and buildings) by 2050.12,13\n\nFigure 13.2. Projected percentages in each housing-unit density category for 2050 compared with 2010, assuming demographic and economic growth consistent with the high-growth emissions scenario (A2). (Data from U.S. EPA Integrated Climate and Land Use Scenarios).\n\nLand-use scenarios project that exurban and suburban areas will expand nationally by 15% to 20% between 2000 and 2050,13 based on high- and low-growth scenarios respectively. Landcover projections by Wear12 show that both cropland and forest are projected to decline most relative to 1997 (by 6% to 7%, respectively, by 2050) under a scenario of high population and economic growth\n\n322\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fand least (by 4% and 6%, respectively) under lowergrowth scenarios. More forest than cropland is projected to be lost in the Northeast and Southeast, whereas more cropland than forest is projected to be lost in the Midwest and Great Plains.14 Some of these regional differences are due to the current mix of land uses, others to the differential rates of urbanization in these different regions.\n\n13: LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGE\nProjected Land Covers (2010-2050)\n\nFigure 13.3. Projected percentages in each land-cover category for 2050 compared with 2010, assuming demographic and economic growth consistent with the high-growth emissions scenario (A2) (Data from USDA).\n\nKey Message 1: Effects on Communities and Ecosystems\n\nChoices about land-use and land-cover patterns have affected and will continue to affect how vulnerable or resilient human communities and ecosystems are to the effects of climate change.\n\nDecisions about land-use and land-cover change by individual landowners and land managers are influenced by demographic and economic trends and social preferences, which unfold at global, national, regional, and local scales. Policymakers can directly affect land use and land cover. For example, Congress can declare an area as federally protected wilderness, or local officials can set aside portions of a town for industrial development and create tax benefits for companies to build there. Climate factors typically play a secondary role in land decisions, if they are considered at all. Nonetheless, land-change decisions may affect the vulnerabilities of individuals, households, communities, businesses, non-profit organizations, and ecosystems to the effects of climate change.15 A farmer's choice of crop rotation in response to price signals affects his or her farm income's susceptibility to drought, for example. Such choices, along with changes in climate can also affect the farm's demand for water for irrigation. Similarly, a developer's decision to build new homes in a floodplain may affect the new homeowners' vulnerabilities to flooding events. A decision to\n\ninclude culverts underneath a coastal roadway may facilitate migration of a salt marsh inland as sea level rises.\nThe combination of residential location choices with wildfire occurrence dramatically illustrates how the interactions between land use and climate processes can affect climate change impacts and vulnerabilities. Low-density (suburban and exurban) housing patterns in the U.S. have expanded and are projected to continue to expand.13 One result is a rise in the amount of construction in forests and other wildlands16 that in turn has increased the exposure of houses, other structures, and people to damages from wildfires, which are increasing. The number of buildings lost in the 25 most destructive fires in California history increased significantly in the 1990s and 2000s compared to the previous three decades.17 These losses are one example of how changing development patterns can interact with a changing climate to create dramatic new risks. In the western United States, increasing frequencies of large wildfires and longer wildfire durations are strongly associated with increased spring and summer temperatures and an earlier\n\n323\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fBuilding Loss by Fires at California Wildland-Urban Interfaces\n\n13: LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGE\n\n\u00a9Elmer Frederick Fischer/Corbis\n\nFigure 13.4. Many forested areas in the U.S. have experienced a recent building boom in what is known as the \"wildland-urban interface.\" This figure shows the number of buildings lost from the 25 most destructive wildland-urban interface fires in California history from 1960 to 2007 (Figure source: Stephens et al. 200917).\n\nConstruction near forests and wildlands is growing. Here, wildfire approaches a housing development.\n\nspring snowmelt.18 The effects on property loss of increases in the frequency and sizes of fires under climate change are also projected to increase in the coming decades because so many\n\nmore people will have moved into increasingly fire-prone places (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate; Ch. 7: Forests).\n\nKey Message 2: Effects on Climate Processes\n\nLand-use and land-cover changes affect local, regional, and global climate processes.\n\nLand use and land cover play critical roles in the interaction\nbetween the land and the atmosphere, influencing climate at local, regional, and global scales.19 There is growing evidence\n\nNortheast following regrowth of forests due to abandonment of agriculture.25\n\nthat land use, land cover, and land management affect the U.S. \u00b7 Conversion of rain-fed cropland to irrigated agriculture\n\nclimate in several ways:\n\nfurther intensifies the impacts of agricultural conversion\n\non temperature.

Urban landscapes are also affecting formation of convective storms and changing the location and amounts of precipitation compared to pre-urbanization.32,33\n\u00b7 Land-use and land-cover changes are affecting global atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. The impact is expected to be most significant in areas with forest loss or gain, where the amount of carbon that can\n\nbe transferred from the atmosphere to the land (or from the land to the atmosphere) is modified. Even in relatively un-forested areas, this effect can be significant. A recent USGS report suggests that from 2001 to 2005 in the Great Plains between 22 to 106 million metric tons of carbon were stored in the biosphere due to changes in land use and climate.34 Even with these seemingly large numbers, U.S. forests absorb only 7% to 24% (with a best estimate of 16%) of fossil fuel CO2 emissions (see Ch. 15: Biogeochemical Cycles, \"Estimating the U.S. Carbon Sink\").\n\nKey Message 3: Adapting to Climate Change\n\nIndividuals, businesses, non-profits, and governments have the capacity to make land-use decisions to adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\nLand-use and land-cover patterns may be modified to adapt to anticipated or observed effects of a changed climate. These changes may be either encouraged or mandated by government (whether at federal or other levels), or undertaken by private initiative. In the U.S., even though land-use decisions are highly decentralized and strongly influenced by Constitutional protection of private property, the Supreme Court has also defined a role for government input into some land-use decisions.35 Thus on the one hand farmers may make private decisions to plant different crops in response to changing growing conditions and/or market prices. On the other hand, homeowners may be compelled to respond to policies, zoning, or regulations (at national, state, county, or municipal levels) by elevating their houses to reduce flood impacts associated with more intense rainfall events and/or increased impervious surfaces.\nLand-use and land-cover changes are thus rarely the product of a single factor. Land-use decision processes are influenced not only by the biophysical environment, but also by markets, laws, technology, politics, perceptions, and culture. Yet there is evidence that climate adaptation considerations are playing an increasingly large role in land decisions, even in the absence\n\nof a formal federal climate policy. Motivations typically include avoiding or reducing negative impacts from extreme weather events (such as storms or heat waves) or from slow-onset hazards (such as sea level rise) (see Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples).\nFor example, New Orleans has, through a collection of private and public initiatives, rebuilt some of the neighborhoods damaged by Hurricane Katrina with housing elevated six feet or even higher above the ground and with roofs specially designed to facilitate evacuation.36 San Francisco has produced a land-use plan to reduce impacts from a rising San Francisco Bay.37 A similar concern has prompted collective action in four Miami-area counties and an array of San Diego jurisdictions, to name just two locales, to shape future land uses to comply with regulations linked to sea level rise projections.36,38 Chicago has produced a plan for limiting the number of casualties, especially among the elderly and homeless, during heat waves (Ch. 9: Human Health).36 Deeper discussion of the factors commonly influencing adaptation decisions at household, municipal, state, and federal levels is provided in Chapter 28 (Ch. 28: Adaptation) of this report; Chapters 26 (Ch. 26: Decision Support) and 27 (Ch. 27: Mitigation) treat the related topics of Decision Support and Mitigation, respectively.\n\nKey Message 4: Reducing Greenhouse Gas Levels\n\nChoices about land use and land management may provide a means of reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels.\n\nChoices about land use and land management affect the amount of greenhouse gases entering and leaving the atmosphere and, therefore, provide opportunities to reduce climate change (Ch. 15: Biogeochemical Cycles; Ch. 27: Mitigation).39 Such choices can affect the balance of these gases directly, through decisions to preserve or restore carbon in standing vegetation (like forests) and soils, and indirectly, in the form of land-use policies that affect fossil fuel emissions by influencing energy consumption for transportation and in buildings.\n\nAdditionally, as crops are increasingly used to make fuel, the potential for reducing net carbon emissions through replacement of fossil fuels represents a possible land-based carbon emissions reduction strategy, albeit one that is complicated by many natural and economic interactions that will determine the ultimate effect of these strategies on emissions (Ch. 7: Forests; Ch. 6: Agriculture).\n\n325\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f13: LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGE\n\nLand-cover change and management accounts for about onethird of all carbon released into the atmosphere by people globally since 1850. The primary source related to land use has been the conversion of native vegetation like forests and grasslands to croplands, which in turn has released carbon from vegetation and soil into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2).40 Currently, an estimated 16% of CO2 going into the atmosphere is due to land-related activities globally, with the remainder coming from fossil fuel burning and cement manufacturing.40 In the United States, activities related to land use are effectively balanced with respect to CO2: as much CO2 is released to the atmosphere by land-use activities as is taken up by and stored in, for example, vegetation and soil. The regrowth of forests and increases of conservation-related forest and crop management practices have also increased carbon storage. Overall, setting aside emissions due to burning fossil fuels, in the U.S. and the rest of North America, land cover takes up more carbon than it releases. This has happened as a result of more efficient forest and agricultural management practices, but it is not clear if this rate of uptake can be increased or if it will persist into the future. The projected declines in forest area (Figure 13.3) put these carbon stores at risk. Additionally, the rate of carbon uptake on a given acre of forest can vary with weather, making it potentially sensitive to climate changes.41\nOpportunities to increase the net uptake of carbon from the atmosphere by the land include42 increasing the amount of area in ecosystems with high carbon content (by converting farms to forests or grasslands); increasing the rate of carbon uptake in existing ecosystems (through fertilization); and reducing carbon loss from existing ecosystems (for example, through no-till farming).43 Because of these effects, policies specifically aimed at increasing carbon storage, either directly through mandates or indirectly through a market for carbon offsets, may be used to encourage more land-based carbon storage.44\n\nThe following uncertainties deserve further investigation: 1) the effects of these policies or actions on the balance of other greenhouse gases, like methane and nitrous oxide; 2) the degree of permanence these carbon stores will have in a changing climate (especially through the effects of disturbances like fires and plant pests45); 3) the degree to which increases in carbon storage can be attributed to any specific policy, or whether or not they may have occurred without any policy change; and 4) the possibility that increased carbon storage in one location might be partially offset by releases in another. All of these specific mitigation options present implementation challenges, as the decisions must be weighed against competing objectives. For example, retiring farmland to sequester carbon may be difficult to achieve if crop prices rise,46 such as has occurred in recent years in response to the fast-growing market for biofuels. Agricultural research and development that increases the productivity of the sector presents the possibility of reducing demand for agricultural land and may serve as a powerful greenhouse gas mitigation strategy, although the ultimate net effect on greenhouse gas emissions is uncertain.47\nLand-use decisions in urban areas also present carbon reduction options. Carbon storage in urban areas can reach densities as high as those found in tropical forests, with most of that carbon found in soils, but also in vegetation, landfills, and the structures and contents of buildings.48 Urban and suburban areas tend to be net sources of carbon to the atmosphere, whereas exurban and rural areas tend to be net sinks.49 Effects of urban development patterns on carbon storage and emissions due to land and fossil fuel use are topics of current research and can be affected by land-use planning choices. Many cities have adopted land-use plans with explicit carbon goals, typically targeted at reducing carbon emissions from the often intertwined activities of transportation and energy use. This trend, which includes major cities such as Los Angeles,50 Chicago,51 and New York City52 as well as small towns, such as Homer, Alaska,53 has occurred even in the absence of a formal federal climate policy.\n\n326\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f13: LAND USE & LAND COVER CHANGE\n\nReferences\n\n1.

One report described the findings of a three-day workshop held from November 29 to December 1, 2011, in Salt Lake City, in which a number of the chapter authors participated.2 Findings of the workshop provided a review of current issues and topics as well as the availability and quality of relevant data. In addition, from December 2011 through June 2012 the author team held biweekly teleconferences. Key messages were identified during this period and discussed in two phases, associated with major chapter drafts. An early draft identified a number of issues and key messages. Based on discussions with National Climate Assessment (NCA) leadership and other chapter authors, the Land Use and Land Cover Change authors identified and reached consensus on a final set of four key messages and organized most of the chapter to directly address these messages. The authors selected key messages based on the consequences and likelihood of impacts, the implied vulnerability, and available evidence. Relevance to decision support, mitigation, and adaptation was also an important criterion for the selection of key messages for the cross-cutting and foundational topic of this chapter.\nThe U.S. acquires, produces, and distributes substantial data that characterize the nation's land cover and land use. Satellite observations, with near complete coverage over the landscape and consistency for estimating change and trends, are particularly valuable. Field inventories, especially of agriculture and forestry, provide very reliable data products that describe land cover as well as land-use change. Together, remote sensing and field inventory data, as well as related ecological and socioeconomic data, allow many conclusions about land-use and land-cover change with very high confidence.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nChoices about land-use and land-cover patterns have affected and will continue to affect how vulnerable or resilient human communities and ecosystems are to the effects of climate change.\nDescription of evidence base The influences of climate on vegetation and soils, and thus on land cover and land use, are relatively well understood, and a number\n\nof well-validated mathematical models are used to investigate potential consequences of climate change for ecosystem processes, structure, and function. Given scenarios about socioeconomic factors or relevant models, some aspects of land-use and landcover change can also be analyzed and projected into the future based on assumed climate change. During a workshop convened to review land-use and land-cover change for the NCA, participants summarized various studies from different perspectives, including agriculture and forestry as well as socioeconomic issues such as flood insurance.2\nResidential exposure to wildfire is an excellent example supporting this key message and is well documented in the literature.16,17,18\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Steadily accumulating field and remote sensing observations as well as inventories continue to increase confidence in this key message. A recent study by the EPA13 provides relevant projections of housing density and impervious surface under alternative scenarios of climate change.\nWhile there is little uncertainty about the general applicability of this key message, the actual character and consequences of climate change as well as its interactions with land cover and land use vary significantly between locations and circumstances. Thus the specific vulnerabilities resulting from the specific ways in which people, both as individuals and as collectives, will respond to anticipated or observed climate change impacts are less well understood than the biophysical dimensions of this problem.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Very High. Observed weather and climate impacts and consequences for land cover and land use, basic understanding of processes and analyses using models of those processes, as well as substantial literature are consistent in supporting this key message.\nKey message#2 Traceable Account\nLand-use and land-cover changes affect local, regional, and global climate processes.\n\n330\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f13: LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGE Traceable Accounts\n\nDescription of evidence base The dependence of weather and climate processes on land surface properties is reasonably well understood in terms of the biophysical processes involved. Most climate models represent land-surface conditions and processes, though only recently have they begun to incorporate these conditions dynamically to represent changes in the land surface within a model run. Regional weather models are increasingly incorporating land surface characteristics. Extensive literature \u00ad as well as textbooks \u00ad documents this understanding, as do models of land surface processes and properties. A Technical Input report to the National Climate Assessment1 summarizes the literature and basic understanding of interactions between the atmosphere and land surface that influence climate.\nExamples are provided within the chapter to demonstrate that land-use and land-cover change are affecting U.S. climate.20,24,25,27,31,32,33,34\nNew information and remaining uncertainties While there is little uncertainty about this key message in general, the heterogeneity of the U.S. landscape and associated processes, as well as regional and local variations in atmospheric processes, make it difficult to analyze or predict the character of land use and land cover influences on atmospheric processes at all scales.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Very High. The basic processes underlying the biophysics of interactions between the land surface and atmosphere are well understood. A number of examples and field studies are consistent in demonstrating effects of land use and land-cover change on the climate of the United States.\n\nAlthough there is little uncertainty that land-use decisions can enable adaptation to climate change, the information about climate change, at scales where such decisions are made, is generally lacking.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Very High. The aspects of land-use planning that can enable climate change adaptation are well understood and examples demonstrate where actions are being taken.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nChoices about land use and land management provide a means of reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels.\nDescription of evidence base The evidence base for this key message includes scientific studies on the carbon cycle at both global and local scales (summarized in Izzauralde et al. 2013; Hurteau 2013; and Cambardella and Hatfield 2013).42,43,45 The evidence base also includes policy studies on the costs and benefits and feasibilities of various actions to reduce carbon emissions from land-based activities and/or to increase carbon storage in the biosphere through landbased activities (summarized in Jones et al. 2013; and Pearson and Brown 2013).44 Foundational studies are summarized in the NCA Technical Input documents.1,2\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A major study by the U.S. Geological Survey is estimating carbon stocks in vegetation and soils of the U.S., and this inventory will\n\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nIndividuals, businesses, non-profits, and governments have the capacity to make land-use decisions to adapt to the effects of climate change.\nDescription of evidence base The key message is supported by well-understood aspects of land-use planning and management, including the legal roles of government and citizens and management practices such as zoning and taxation. Participants in the NCA workshop (Nov 29-Dec 1, 2011, in Salt Lake City) on land use and land cover presented and discussed a number of examples showing the influences of landuse decisions on climate change adaptation options.2 The chapter describes specific examples of measures to adapt to climate change, further supporting this key message.36,37,38\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Experience with climate change adaptation measures involving land-use decisions is accumulating rapidly.36,37,38\n\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent\nresults, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods\nvary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\n\n331\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f13: LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGE Traceable Accounts\nclarify the potential for capturing greenhouse gasses by land-use change (an early result is reported in Sohl et al. 201214).\nThere is little uncertainty behind the premise that specific land uses affect the carbon cycle. There are, however, scientific uncertainties regarding the magnitudes of effects resulting from specific actions designed to leverage this linkage for mitigation. For example, uncertainties are introduced regarding the permanence of specific land-based stores of carbon, the incremental value of specific management or policy decisions to increase terrestrial carbon stocks beyond changes that would have occurred in the absence of management, and the possibility for decreases in carbon storage in another location that offset increases resulting from specific actions at a given location. Also, we do not yet know how natural processes might alter the amount of carbon storage expected to occur with management actions. There are further uncertainties regarding the political feasibilities and economic efficacy of policy options to use land-based activities to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and uncertainties, there is medium confidence that land use and land management choices can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\n332\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 14 RURAL COMMUNITIES\nConvening Lead Authors\nDavid Hales, Second Nature William Hohenstein, U.S. Department of Agriculture\nLead Authors\nMarcie D.

Rural communities are highly dependent upon natural resources for their livelihoods and social structures. Climate change related impacts are currently affecting rural communities. These impacts will progressively increase over this century and will shift the locations where rural economic activities (like agriculture, forestry, and recreation) can thrive.\n2. Rural communities face particular geographic and demographic obstacles in responding to and preparing for climate change risks. In particular, physical isolation, limited economic  diversity, and higher poverty rates, combined with an aging population, increase the vulnerability of rural communities. Systems of fundamental importance to rural populations are already stressed by remoteness and limited access.\n3. Responding to additional challenges from climate change impacts will require significant  adaptation within rural transportation and infrastructure systems, as well as health and  emergency response systems. Governments in rural communities have limited institutional capacity to respond to, plan for, and anticipate climate change impacts.\n\nMore than 95% of U.S. land area is classified as rural, but is home to just 19% of the population (see also Ch. 13: Land Use & Land Cover Change).1 Rural America's importance to the country's economic and social well-being is disproportionate to its population, as rural areas provide natural resources that much of the rest of the United States depends on for food, energy, water, forests, recreation, national character, and quality of life.2 Rural economic foundations and community cohesion are intricately linked to these natural systems, which are inherently vulnerable to climate change. Urban areas that depend on goods and services from rural areas will also be affected by climate change driven impacts across the countryside.\nWarming trends, climate volatility, extreme weather events, and environmental change are already affecting the economies and cultures of rural areas. Many rural communities face considerable risk to their infrastructure, livelihoods, and quality of life from observed and projected climate shifts (Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples). These changes will progressively increase volatility in food commodity markets, shift the ranges of plant and animal species, and, depending on the region, increase water scarcity, exacerbate flooding and coastal erosion, and increase the intensity and frequency of wildfires across the rural landscape.\n\nties are best suited. Because many rural communities are less diverse than urban areas in their economic activities, changes in the viability of one traditional economic sector will place disproportionate stresses on community stability.\nClimate change impacts will not be uniform or consistent across rural areas, and some communities may benefit from climate change. In the short term, the U.S. agricultural system is expected to be fairly resilient to climate change due to the system's flexibility to engage in adaptive behaviors such as expansion of irrigated acreage, regional shifts in acreage for specific crops, crop rotations, changes to management decisions (such as choice and timing of inputs and cultivation practices), and altered trade patterns compensating for yield changes (Ch.\n\nClimate changes will severely challenge many rural communities, shifting locations where particular economic activities are capable of thriving.

Although the majority of the U.S. population lives in urban areas, most of the country is still classified as rural. In this map, counties are classified as rural if they do not include any cities with populations of 50,000 or more. (Figure source: USDA Economic Research Service 20133).\nEconomic Dependence Varies by Region\n\nNegative impacts from projected climate changes, however, will ripple throughout rural America. Agricultural systems in some areas may need to undergo more transformative changes to keep pace with future climate change (Ch. 6: Agriculture, Key Message 5). In lakes and riparian areas, warming is projected to increase the growth of algae and invasive species, particularly in areas already facing water quality impairments.5 Mountain species and cold water fish, such as salmon, are expected to face decreasing range sizes due to warming, while ranges could expand for some warm water fish, such as bass.6 Alaska, with its reliance on commercial and subsistence fishing catch, is particularly vulnerable. Warmer weather and higher water temperatures will reduce salmon harvests, creating hardships for the rural communities and tribes that depend upon these catches (Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples, Key Message 1).7 Communities in Guam and American Samoa, which depend on fish for 25% to 69% of their protein, are expected to be particularly hard hit as climate change alters the composition of coral reef ecosystems.8\n\nFigure 14.2. Much of the rural United States depends on agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. Climate changes will affect each region and each economic sector in complex and interrelated ways. The economic dependence classification used in the map indicates the largest share of earnings and employment in each county. (Figure source: USDA Economic Research Service 20133).\n\nAcross the United States, rural areas provide ecosystem services \u00ad like carbon absorption in forests, water filtration in wetlands, wildlife habitat in prairies, and environmental flows in rivers and streams \u00ad whose value tends to be overlooked. Preserving these ecosystem services sustains the quality of life in rural communities and also benefits those who come to rural communities for second homes, tourism, and other amenities. They also provide urban residents with vital resources \u00ad like food, energy, and fresh water \u00ad that meet essential needs. This layered connection between rural areas and populous urban centers suggests that maintaining the health of rural areas is a national, and not simply a local, concern.\n\n335\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f14: RURAL COMMUNITIES\n\nKey Message 1: Rural Economies\n\nRural communities are highly dependent upon natural resources for their livelihoods and social structures. Climate change related impacts are currently affecting rural communities. These impacts will progressively increase over this century and will shift the locations where\nrural economic activities (like agriculture, forestry, and recreation) can thrive.\n\nRural America has already experienced some of the\nimpacts of climate change related weather effects, in-\ncluding crop and livestock loss from severe drought and flooding,9 infrastructure damage to levees and roads from extreme storms,10 shifts in planting and harvesting times in farming communities,11 and large-scale losses from fires and other weather-related disasters.12 These\nimpacts have profound effects, often significantly affect-\ning the health and well-being of rural residents as well\nas their communities, and are amplified by the essential\neconomic link that many of these communities have to\ntheir natural resource base.\n\n\u00a9 STR/Reuters/Corbis\n\nRural communities are often characterized by their\n\nnatural resources and associated economic activity.\n\nDominant economic drivers include agriculture, forestry, River flood waters illustrate threats rural areas face in a changing climate. mining, energy, outdoor recreation, and tourism.

The left map shows that if emissions continue to increase (A2 scenario), the U.S. growing season (or frost-free season) will lengthen by as much as 30 to 80 days by the end of the century (2070-2099 as compared to 1971-2000). The right map shows a reduction in the number of frost days (days with minimum temperatures below freezing) by 20 to 80 days in much of the United States in the same time period. While changes in the growing season may have positive effects for some crops, reductions in the number of frost days can result in early bud-bursts or blooms, consequently damaging some perennial crops grown in the United States (See also Ch. 6: Agriculture). White areas are projected to experience no freezes for 2070-2099, and gray areas are projected to experience more than 10 freeze-free years during the same period.

Increasing heat and humidity \u00ad projected for summers in the Midwest, Southeast, and parts of the Southwest by mid-century (compared to the period 1961-1990) \u00ad is likely to create unfavorable conditions for summertime outdoor recreation and tourism activity. The figures illustrate projected changes in climatic attractiveness (based on maximum daily temperature and minimum daily relative humidity, average daily temperature and relative humidity, precipitation, sunshine, and wind speed) in July for much of North America. In the coming century, the distribution of these conditions is projected to shift from acceptable to unfavorable across most of the southern Midwest and a por-\n\ntion of the Southeast, and from very good or good to acceptable conditions in northern portions of the Midwest, under a high emissions scenario (A2a). (Figure source: Nicholls et al. 200524).\n\n337\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f14: RURAL COMMUNITIES\n\nClimate change will also influence the distribution and composition of plants and animals across the United States. Hunting, fishing, bird watching, and other wildlife-related activities will be affected as habitats shift and relationships among species change.25 Cold-weather recreation and tourism will be adversely affected by climate change. Snow accumulation in the western United States has decreased, and is expected to continue to decrease, as a result of observed and projected warming. Reduced snow accumulation also reduces the amount of spring snowmelt, decreasing warm-season runoff in mid- to high-latitude regions.\nSimilar changes to snowpack are expected in the Northeast.26 Adverse impacts on winter sports are projected to be more pronounced in the Northeast and Southwest regions of the United States.8 Coastal areas will be adversely affected by sea\n\nlevel rise and increased severity of storms.22,27 Changing environmental conditions, such as wetland loss and beach erosion in coastal areas28 and increased risk of natural hazards such as wildfire, flash flooding, storm surge, river flooding, drought, and extremely high temperatures can alter the character and attraction of rural areas as tourist destinations.\nThe implications of climate change on communities that are dependent on resource extraction (coal, oil, natural gas, and mining) have not been well studied. Attributes of economic development in these communities, such as cyclical growth, transient workforce, rapid development, pressure on infrastructure, and lack of economic diversification suggest that these communities could face challenges in adapting to climate change.13,29,30\n\nKey Message 2: Responding to Risks\n\nRural communities face particular geographic and demographic obstacles in responding to and preparing for climate change risks. In particular, physical isolation, limited economic\ndiversity, and higher poverty rates, combined with an aging population, increase the vulnerability of rural communities. Systems of fundamental importance to rural populations\nare already stressed by remoteness and limited access.\n\nRelatively rapid changes in demographics, economic activity, and climate are particularly challenging in rural communities, where local, agrarian values often run generations deep. Changing rural demographics, influenced by new immigration\nMany Rural Areas are Losing Population\n\npatterns, fluctuating economic conditions, and evolving community values add to these challenges \u00ad especially with regard to climate changes.\nModern rural populations are generally older, less affluent, and less educated than their urban counterparts. Rural areas are characterized by higher unemployment, more dependence on government transfer payments, less diversified economies, and fewer social and economic resources needed for resilience in the face of major changes.8,31 In particular, the combination of an aging population and poverty increases the vulnerability of rural communities to climate fluctuations.\n\nFigure 14.5. Census data show significant population decreases in many rural areas, notably in the Great Plains. Many rural communities' existing vulnerabilities to climate change, including physical isolation, reduced services like health care, and an aging population, are projected to increase as population decreases. (Figure source: USDA Economic Research Service 20133).\n\nThere has been a trend away from\nmanufacturing, resource extraction,\nand farming to amenity-based eco-\nnomic activity in many rural areas of the United States.32 Expanding ameni-\nty-based economic activities in rural\nareas include recreation and leisure,\ne-commuting residents, tourism, and\nsecond home and retirement home\ndevelopment. This shift has stressed traditional cultural values33 and put pressure on infrastructure34 and natu-\n\n338\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f14: RURAL COMMUNITIES\n\nral amenities35 that draw people to rural areas. Changes in climate and weather are likely to increase these stresses. Rural components of transportation systems are particularly vulnerable to risks from flooding and sea level rise.36 Since rural areas often have fewer transportation options and fewer infrastructure redundancies, any disruptions in road, rail, or air transport will deeply affect rural communities.\nPower and communication outages resulting from extreme events often take longer to repair in rural areas, contributing to the isolation and vulnerability of elderly residents who may not have cell phones. The lack of cellular coverage in some rural areas can create problems for emergency response during power failures.37\nIn some parts of the country there has been a recent trend in Hispanic population growth in rural regions that have not been traditional migrant destinations. New Hispanic immigrants are often highly segregated residentially and isolated from mainstream institutions,38 making them more vulnerable to changes in climate. Low wages, unstable work, language barriers, and inadequate housing are critical obstacles to managing climate risk.\nRural communities rely on various transportation modes, both for export and import of critical goods (Ch. 5: Transportation). Climate changes will result in increased erosion and maintenance costs for local road and rail systems, as well as changes in streamflows and predictability that will result in increased maintenance costs for waterways. More frequent disruption of shipping is projected, with serious economic consequences. For example, in 2010, about 40 million tons of cereal grains were shipped by water to Louisiana, while less than 4 million tons traveled by rail.10 While rail can help ameliorate smallscale or off-peak capacity limitations on the Mississippi River, it seems unlikely that the rail system can fully replace the river system in the event of a prolonged harvest-time disruption. Events that affect both rail and barge traffic would be particularly damaging to rural communities that depend upon these systems to get commodities to market.\nHealth and emergency response systems also face additional demands from substantial direct and indirect health risks associated with global climate changes. Indirect risks, particularly those posed by emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, are more difficult to assess, but pose looming threats to economically challenged communities where health services are limited. Direct threats (such as extreme heat, storm events, and coastal and riparian flooding) tend to be more associated with specific local vulnerabilities, so the risks are somewhat easier to assess.39\n\nThe socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of rural areas interact with climate change to create health concerns that differ from those of urban and suburban communities. Older populations with lower income and educational levels in rural areas spend a larger proportion of their income on health care than their urban counterparts. Moreover, health care access declines as geographic isolation increases. Overall, rural residents already have higher rates of age-adjusted mortality, disability, and chronic disease than do urban populations.40 These trends are likely to be exacerbated by climate change (Ch. 9: Human Health).\nGovernments in rural areas are generally ill-prepared to respond quickly and effectively to large-scale events, although individuals and voluntary associations often show significant resilience. Health risks are exacerbated by limitations in the health service systems characteristic of rural areas, including the distance between rural residents and health care providers and the reduced availability of medical specialists.\nThe effects of climate change on mental health merit special consideration. Rural residents are already at a heightened risk from mental health issues because of the lack of access to mental health providers. The adverse impact of severe weather disasters on mental health is well established,41 and there is emerging evidence that climate change in the form of increasing heat waves and droughts has harmful effects on mental health (Ch. 9: Human Health, Key Message 1). Droughts often result in people relocating to seek other employment, causing a loss of home and social networks. Studies have shown that springtime droughts in rural areas cause a decrease in life satisfaction.42 The primary care physicians who form the backbone of rural health care often have heavy caseloads and lack specialized training in mental health issues.40 Additionally, patients referred to mental health specialists often experience significant delays.43\nThe frequency and distribution of infectious diseases is also projected to increase with rising temperatures and associated seasonal shifts. Increased rates of mutation and increased resistance to drugs and other treatments are already evident in the behavior of infectious disease-causing bacteria and viruses.44 In addition, changes in temperature, surface water, humidity, and precipitation affect the distribution and abundance of disease-carriers and intermediate hosts, and result in larger distributions for many parasites and diseases. Rural residents who spend significant time outdoors have an increased risk of exposure to these disease-carriers, like ticks and mosquitoes (Ch. 9: Human Health).\n\n339\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f14: RURAL COMMUNITIES\n\nKey Message 3: Adaptation\n\nResponding to additional challenges from climate change impacts will require significant adaptation within rural transportation and infrastructure systems, as well as health and emergency response systems. Governments in rural communities have limited institutional\ncapacity to respond to, plan for, and anticipate climate change impacts.\n\nClimate variability and increases in temperature, extreme events (such as storms, floods, heat waves, and droughts), and sea level rise are expected to have widespread impacts on the provision of services from state, regional, local, and tribal governments. Emergency management, energy use and distribution systems, transportation and infrastructure planning, and public health will all be affected.\nRural governments often depend heavily on volunteers to meet community challenges like fire protection or flood response. In addition, rural communities have limited locally available financial resources to help deal with the effects of climate change. Small community size tends to make services expensive or available only by traveling some distance.\nLocal governance structures tend to de-emphasize planning capacity, compared to urban areas. While 73% of metropolitan counties have land-use planners, only 29% of rural counties not adjacent to a metropolitan county had one or more planners. Moreover, rural communities are not equipped to deal with major infrastructure expenses.45\nCommunities across the United States are experiencing infrastructure losses, water scarcity, unpredictable water availability, and increased frequency and intensity of wildfires. However, local authorities often do not explicitly associate these observed changes with climate, and responses rarely take climate disruption into account. Even in communities where there is increasing awareness of climate change and interest in comprehensive adaptation planning, lack of funding, human resources, access to information, training, and expertise provide significant barriers for many rural communities.46\nIf rural communities are to respond adequately to future climate changes, they will likely need help assessing their risks and vulnerabilities, prioritizing and coordinating projects, funding and allocating financial and human resources, and deploying information-sharing and decision support tools (Ch. 26: Decision Support). There is still little systematic research on the vulnerability of rural communities and there is a need for additional empirical research in this area. Impacts due to climate change will cross community and regional lines, making solutions dependent upon meaningful participation of numerous stakeholders from federal, state, local, and tribal governments, science and academia, the private sector, non-profit\n\norganizations, and the general public (Ch. 28: Adaptation, Key Message 3).\nEffective adaptation measures are closely tied to specific local conditions and needs and take into account existing social networks.47,48 The economic and social diversity of rural communities affects the ability of both individuals and communities to adapt to climate changes, and underscores the need to assess climate change impacts on a local basis. The quality and availability of natural resources, legacies of past use, and changing industrial needs affect the economic, environmental, and social conditions of rural places and are critical factors to be assessed.13,30,49 Successful adaptation to climate change requires balancing immediate needs with long-term development goals, as well as development of local-level capacities to deal with climate change.48,50\nPotential national climate change mitigation responses (Ch. 27: Mitigation) \u00ad especially those that require extensive use of land, such as permanent reforestation, constructing large solar or wind arrays, hydroelectric generation, and biofuel cropping \u00ad are also likely to significantly affect rural communities, with both positive and negative effects.51 As with the development of rural resource-intensive economic activities, where national or multi-national companies tend to wield ownership and control, local residents and communities are unlikely to be the primary investors in or beneficiaries of this kind of new economic activity. For example, mitigation policies that affect coal production could have a substantial economic impact on many rural communities, as could policies to promote production of non-fossil-fuel energy such as wind.\nDecisions regarding adaptation responses for both urban and rural populations can occur at various scales (federal, state, local, tribal, private sector, and individual) but need to take interdependencies into account. Many decisions that significantly affect rural communities may not be under the control of local governments or rural residents. Given that timing is a critical aspect of adaptation, as well as mitigation, engaging rural residents early in decision processes about investments in public infrastructure, protection of shorelines, changes in insurance provision, or new management initiatives can influence individual behavior and choice in ways that enhance positive outcomes of adaptation and mitigation.\n\nBox: Local Responses to Climate Change in the San Juan Mountains\n\n340\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f14: RURAL COMMUNITIES\n\nLocal responses to climate change in the san juan mountains\n\nThe San Juan Mountains region straddles the southern edge of the Southern Rocky Mountains and the northeastern tip of the arid Southwest. The high mountain headwaters of the Rio Grande, San Juan, and major tributaries of the Upper Colorado River are critical water towers for five states: Texas, Nevada, California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The diversity of the landforms, high plateaus, steep mountains, deep canyons, and foothills leads to a complex and diverse mix of coniferous and deciduous forested landscapes.52 County populations in the area range from 700 to 51,000 people. Population changes between 2000 and 2010 ranged from a 25% decline to an 86% increase. Public lands account for 69% of the land base.53 Over half of the local economies are dependent upon natural resources to support tourism, minerals and natural gas extraction, and second home development.\nAverage annual temperatures in the San Juan Mountains have risen 1.1\u00baF in only three decades,54 a rate of warming greater than any other region of the United States except Alaska.55 The timing of snowmelt has shifted two weeks earlier between 1978 and 2007, and this earlier seasonal release of water resources is of particular concern to all western states.56 Current challenges for the region include changes in forests due to pests and diseases, intensive recreation use, fire management for natural and prescribed fires, and increasing development in the wildland-urban interface. Communities are vulnerable to changes from a warmer and drier climate that would affect the frequency\n\nand intensity of wildfires, shift vegetation and range of forest types, and increase pressures on water supplies.\nIn response, the San Juan Climate Initiative drew together stakeholders, including natural resource managers, community planners, elected officials, industry representatives, resource users, citizens, non-profit organizations, and scientists. By combining resources and capabilities, stakeholders have been able to accomplish much more together than if they had worked independently. For example, local governments developed a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and identify strategies for adaptation, signing the U.S. Mayor's Climate Protection Agreement in 2009. Climate modelers at University of Colorado and National Center for Atmospheric Research analyzed regional trends in temperature, precipitation, snowpack, and streamflow. Researchers at Mountain Studies Institute, University of Colorado, and Fort Lewis College are partnering with San Juan National Forest to monitor alpine plant communities and changes in climate across the region, and to document carbon resources. San Juan National Forest is developing strategies for adapting to climate changes in the region related to drought, wildfire, and other potential effects. La Plata County is leading an effort to plan for sustainable transportation and food networks that will be less dependent upon carbon-based fuels, while the Mountain Studies Institute is leading citizen science programs to monitor changes to sensitive species like the American pika.\n\n\u00a9 Cody Duncan/Aurora Open/Corbis\n\nHiker in the San Juan mountains, Colorado.\n\n341\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f14: RURAL COMMUNITIES\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This initial discussion was supported by a series of conference calls from March through June, 2012. These ensuing discussions were held after a thorough review of the technical inputs and associated literature, including the Rural Communities Workshop Report prepared for the NCA57 and additional technical inputs on a variety of topics.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nRural communities are highly dependent upon natural resources for their livelihoods and social structures. Climate change related impacts are currently affecting rural communities. These impacts will progressively increase over this century and will shift the locations where rural economic activities (like agriculture, forestry, and recreation) can thrive.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Rural Communities Workshop Report.57 Thirty one technical input reports on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nin the Everglades and Florida Keys are threatened.21 Meanwhile, Maine's tourism could increase,22 which coincides with a projected northern shift in outdoor recreation.23 Hunting, fishing, and bird watching will be affected by beach erosion and wetland loss,28 and changing plant and animal habitats and inter-species relationships (see also Ch. 8: Ecosystems). Outdoor recreation and tourism in many areas in the U.S. are affected by early snowpack melt.8,26\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Key remaining uncertainties relate to the precise magnitude, timing, and location of impacts at regional and local scales.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence (See confidence level key on next page)\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is very high confidence that rural communities are highly dependent on natural resources that are expected to be affected by climate change, especially the many communities that rely on farming, forestry or tourism for their livelihoods.\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence that climate change is currently affecting rural communities.\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is very high confidence that impacts will increase (see Ch 2: Our Changing Climate).\n\nEvidence that the impacts of climate change are increasing is compelling and widespread. This evidence is based on historical records and observations and on global climate models, including those driven by B1 (substantial emissions reduction) and A2 (continued increases in global emissions) scenarios. This evidence is clearly summarized and persuasively referenced in the \"Our Changing Climate\" chapter of this Assessment and in the Scenarios developed for the NCA.58\nThe dependency of rural communities on their natural resources has been demonstrated,13 with a number of studies showing that climate change results in crop and livestock loss,9 infrastructure damage to levees and roads,10 shifts in agriculture practices,11 and losses due to disasters.12 A number of publications project these impacts to increase, with effects on the natural environment8,15,20 and increased competition for water between agriculture and energy.19 Studies have projected that tourism locations\n\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence about shifts in locations of economic activities.\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nRural communities face particular geographic and demographic obstacles in responding to and preparing for climate change risks. In particular, physical isolation, limited economic diversity, and higher poverty rates, combined with an aging population, increase the vulnerability of rural communities. Systems of fundamental importance to rural populations are already stressed by remoteness and limited access.\n\n347\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f14: RURAL COMMUNITIES Traceable Accounts\n\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Rural Communities Workshop Report.57 Thirty one technical input reports on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nWith studies showing that rural communities are already stressed,33,34,35 a number of publications have explored the barriers of rural communities to preparing and responding to climate change.8,31 Some studies provide in-depth looks at the obstacles created by limited economic diversity32 and an aging population.40\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Projecting the interactions of these variables with each other and applying this analysis to local or regional realities is complex at best, with uncertainties at every level of analysis.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence that the obstacle of physical isolation will hamper some communities' ability to adapt or have an adequate response during extreme events.\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence that the obstacle of limited economic diversity will hinder rural communities' ability to adapt.\n\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence that the obstacle of higher poverty rates will significantly increase vulnerability of many communities from adapting properly.\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence that the obstacle of an aging population will hinder some rural communities and prevent them from having an adequate response.\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence that fundamental systems in rural communities are already stressed by remoteness and limited access.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nResponding to additional challenges from climate change impacts will require significant adaptation within rural transportation and infrastructure systems, as well as health and emergency response systems. Governments in rural communities have limited institutional capacity to respond to, plan for, and anticipate climate change impacts.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Rural Communities Workshop Report.57 Thirty one technical input reports on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.),\nhigh consensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium\nconsensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing\nschools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts\n\nRural communities are not equipped to deal with major infrastructure expenses.45 Work has been performed illustrating the need to tie adaptation measures to specific local conditions and needs and take into account existing social networks.47,48 Publications have shown that there are a number of critical factors to be assessed, including the quality and availability of natural resources, legacies of past use of resources, and changing industrial needs that affect economic, environmental, and social conditions.13,30,49 Additionally, studies have expressed the requirement of accounting for both near- and long-term needs for climate change adaptation to be successful.50\nNew information and remaining uncertainties It is difficult to fully capture the complex interactions of the entire socioeconomic-ecological system within which the effects of climate change will interact, especially in regard to local and regional impacts. Impact assessments and adaptation strategies require improved understanding of capacity and resilience at every level, international to local. The policy context in which individuals and communities will react to climate effects is vague and uncertain. Identification of informational needs alone indicates that adaptation will be expensive.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence that rural communities have limited capacity to respond to im-\n\n348\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fpacts, because of their remoteness, age, lack of diversity, and other reasons described in the text.\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence that rural communities have limited capacity to plan for impacts, as explained in the text.\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence that rural communities will have limited capacity to anticipate impacts because of the lack of infrastructure and expertise available in rural communities.\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence that significant climate change adaptation is needed for transportation in rural communities.\nGiven the evidence and uncertainties, there is high confidence that significant climate change adaptation is needed for health care and emergency response in rural communities, so that rural communities can handle climate change impacts.\n\n14: RURAL COMMUNITIES Traceable Accounts\n\n349\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 15\nBIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES\nConvening Lead Authors\nJames N.

Human activities have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 40% over pre-industrial levels and more than doubled the amount of nitrogen available to ecosystems. Similar trends have been observed for phosphorus and other elements, and these changes have major consequences for biogeochemical cycles and climate change.\n2. In total, land in the United States absorbs and stores an amount of carbon equivalent to about 17% of annual U.S. fossil fuel emissions. U.S. forests and associated wood products account for most of this land sink. The effect of this carbon storage is to partially offset warming from emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.\n3. Altered biogeochemical cycles together with climate change increase the vulnerability of  biodiversity, food security, human health, and water quality to changing climate. However, natural and managed shifts in major biogeochemical cycles can help limit rates of climate change.\n\nBiogeochemical cycles involve the fluxes of chemical elements among different parts of the Earth: from living to non-living, from atmosphere to land to sea, and from soils to plants. They are called \"cycles\" because matter is always conserved and because elements move to and from major pools via a variety of two-way fluxes, although some elements are stored in locations or in forms that are differentially accessible to living things. Human activities have mobilized Earth elements and accelerated their cycles \u00ad for example, more than doubling the amount of reactive nitrogen that has been added to the biosphere since pre-industrial times.1,2 Reactive nitrogen is any nitrogen compound that is biologically, chemically, or radiatively active, like nitrous oxide and ammonia, but not nitrogen gas (N2). Global-scale alterations of biogeochemical cycles are oc-\n\ncurring, from human activities both in the U.S. and elsewhere, with impacts and implications now and into the future. Global carbon dioxide emissions are the most significant driver of human-caused climate change. But human-accelerated cycles of other elements, especially nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, also influence climate. These elements can affect climate directly or act as indirect factors that alter the carbon cycle, amplifying or reducing the impacts of climate change.\nClimate change is having, and will continue to have, impacts on biogeochemical cycles, which will alter future impacts on climate and affect our capacity to cope with coupled changes in climate, biogeochemistry, and other factors.\n\nKey Message 1: Human-Induced Changes\n\nHuman activities have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 40% over pre-industrial levels and more than doubled the amount of nitrogen available to ecosystems. Similar trends\nhave been observed for phosphorus and other elements, and these changes have major consequences for biogeochemical cycles and climate change.\n\nThe human mobilization of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus\nfrom the Earth's crust and atmosphere into the environment\nhas increased 36, 9, and 13 times, respectively, compared to geological sources over pre-industrial times.3 Fossil fuel\nburning, land-cover change, cement production, and the\nextraction and production of fertilizer to support agriculture are major causes of these increases.4 Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant of the heat-trapping greenhouse gases\nthat are increasing due to human activities, and its production\n\ndominates atmospheric forcing of global climate change.5 However, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) have higher greenhouse-warming potential per molecule than CO2, and both are also increasing in the atmosphere. In the U.S. and Europe, sulfur emissions have declined over the past three decades, especially since the mid-1990s, because of efforts to reduce air pollution.6 Changes in biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other elements \u00ad and the coupling of those cycles \u00ad can influence climate. In turn, this\n\n351\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f15: BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES\n\ncan change atmospheric composition in other ways that affect by creating small particles known as aerosols that can reflect how the planet absorbs and reflects sunlight (for example, sunlight).\n\nState of the Carbon Cycle\n\nThe U.S. was the world's largest producer of human-caused recovery from past forest harvest, net increases in forest area,\n\nCO2 emissions from 1950 until 2007, when it was surpassed by\nChina. U.S. emissions account for approximately 85% of North American emissions of CO27 and 18% of global emissions.8,9\nEcosystems represent potential \"sinks\" for CO2, which are\nplaces where carbon can be stored over the short or long term\n(see \"Estimating the U.S. Carbon Sink\"). At the continental\nscale, there has been a large and relatively consistent increase in forest carbon stocks over the last two decades,10 due to\n\nimproved forest management regimes, and faster growth driven by climate or fertilization by CO2 and nitrogen.7,11 The largest\nrates of disturbance and \"regrowth sinks\" are in southeastern, south central, and Pacific northwestern regions.11 However,\nemissions of CO2 from human activities in the U.S. continue\nto increase and exceed ecosystem CO2 uptake by more than\nthree times. As a result, North America remains a net source of CO2 into the atmosphere7 by a substantial margin.\n\nMajor North American Carbon Dioxide Sources and Sinks\n\nFigure 15.1. The release of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning in North America (shown here for 2010) vastly exceeds the amount that is taken up and temporarily stored in forests, crops, and other ecosystems (shown here is the annual average for 2000-2006). (Figure source: King et al. 20127).\n\nSources and Fates of Reactive Nitrogen\n\nThe nitrogen cycle has been dramatically altered by human sometimes via the atmosphere), contributing to environmental\n\nactivity, especially by the use of nitrogen fertilizers, which problems such as the formation of coastal low-oxygen \"dead\n\nhave increased agricultural production over the past half century.1,2 Although fertilizer nitrogen inputs have begun to level off in the U.S. since 1980,12 human-caused reactive\nnitrogen inputs are now at least five times greater than those from natural sources.13,14,15,16 At least some of the added\n\nzones\" in marine ecosystems in summer. These problems\npersist until the reactive nitrogen is either captured and stored\nin a long-term pool, like the mineral layers of soil or deep ocean sediments, or converted back to nitrogen gas.17,18 The nitrogen\ncycle affects atmospheric concentrations of the three most\n\nnitrogen is converted to nitrous oxide (N2O), which adds to the important human-caused greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide,\n\ngreenhouse effect in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nmethane, and nitrous oxide.

Once created, a molecule of reactive nitrogen has a cascading impact on people and ecosystems as it contributes to a number of environmental issues. Molecular terms represent oxidized forms of nitrogen primarily from fossil fuel combustion (such as nitrogen oxides, NOx), reduced forms of nitrogen primarily from agriculture (such as ammonia, NH3), and organic forms of nitrogen (Norg) from various processes. NOy is all nitrogen-containing atmospheric gases that have both nitrogen and oxygen, other than nitrous oxide (N2O). NHx is the sum of ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4). (Figure source: adapted from EPA 2011;13 Galloway et al. 2003;17 with input from USDA. USDA contributors were Adam Chambers and Margaret Walsh).\n\nPhosphorus and other elements\n\nThe phosphorus cycle has been greatly transformed in the United States,19 primarily from the use of phosphorus fertilizers\nin agriculture. Phosphorus has no direct effects on climate,\n\nby fertilizing plants. Emissions of sulfur, as sulfur dioxide, can\nreduce the growth of plants and stimulate the leaching of soil nutrients needed by plants.20\n\nbut does have indirect effects, such as increasing carbon sinks\n\nKey Message 2: Sinks and Cycles\n\nIn total, land in the United States absorbs and stores an amount of carbon equivalent to about 17% of annual U.S. fossil fuel emissions. U.S. forests and associated wood products\naccount for most of this land sink. The effect of this carbon storage is to partially offset warming from emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.\n\nConsidering the entire atmospheric CO2 budget, the temporary net storage on land is small compared to the sources: more\nCO2 is emitted than can be taken up (see \"Estimating the U.S. Carbon Sink\").7,21,22,23 Other elements and compounds\naffect that balance by direct and indirect means (for example,\nnitrogen stimulates carbon uptake [direct] and nitrogen\n\ndecreases the soil methane sink [indirect]). The net effect on Earth's energy balance from changes in major biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus) depends upon processes that directly affect how the planet absorbs or reflects sunlight, as well as those that indirectly affect concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\n353\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f15: BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES\n\nCarbon\n\nIn addition to the CO2 effects described above, other car- Methane also has direct and indirect effects on climate bebon-containing compounds affect climate change, such as cause of its influences on atmospheric chemistry.

(Figure source: adapted from Pinder et al. 201228).\n\n354\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f15: BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES\n\nThe strongest direct effect of an altered nitrogen cycle is through emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a long-lived and potent greenhouse gas that is increasing steadily in the atmosphere.25,26 Globally, agriculture has accounted for most of the atmospheric rise in N2O.32,33 Roughly 60% of agricultural N2O derives from elevated soil emissions resulting from the use of nitrogen fertilizer. Animal waste treatment accounts for about 30%, and the remaining 10% comes from crop-residue burning.34 The U.S. reflects this global trend: around 75% to 80% of U.S. human-caused N2O emissions are due to agricultural activities, with the majority being emissions from fertilized soil. The remaining 20% is derived from a variety of industrial and energy sectors.35,36 While N2O currently accounts for about 6% of human-caused warming,26 its long lifetime in the atmosphere and rising concentrations will increase N2O-based climate forcing over a 100-year time scale.33,37,38\nExcess reactive nitrogen indirectly exacerbates changes in climate by several mechanisms. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) increase the production of tropospheric ozone, which is a greenhouse gas.39 Elevated tropospheric ozone may reduce CO2 uptake by plants and thereby reduce the terrestrial CO2 sink.40 Nitrogen deposition to ecosystems can also stimulate the release of nitrous oxide and methane and decrease methane uptake by soil microbes.41\nHowever, excess reactive nitrogen also mitigates changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and climate through several intersecting pathways. Over short time scales, NOx and ammonia emissions lead to the formation of atmospheric aerosols, which cool the climate by scattering or absorbing incoming radiation and by affecting cloud cover.26,42 In addition, the presence of NOx in the lower atmosphere increases the formation of sulfate and organic aerosols.43 At longer time scales, NOx can increase rates of methane oxidation, thereby reducing the lifetime of this important greenhouse gas.\nOne of the dominant effects of reactive nitrogen on climate stems from how it interacts with ecosystem carbon capture and storage, and thus, the carbon sink. As mentioned previously, addition of reactive nitrogen to natural ecosystems can increase carbon storage as long as other factors are not limiting plant growth, such as water and nutrient availability.44 Nitrogen deposition from human sources is estimated to contribute to a global net carbon sink in land ecosystems of 917 to 1,830 million metric tons (1,010 to 2,020 million tons) of CO2 per year. These are model-based estimates, as comprehensive, observationally-based estimates at large spatial scales are hindered by the limited number of field experiments. This net land sink represents two components: 1) an increase in vegetation growth as nitrogen limitation is alleviated by human-caused\n\nnitrogen deposition, and 2) a contribution from the influence of increased reactive nitrogen availability on decomposition. While the former generally increases with increased reactive nitrogen, the net effect on decomposition in soils is not clear. The net effect on total ecosystem carbon storage was an average of 37 metric tons (41 tons) of carbon stored per metric ton of nitrogen added in forests in the U.S. and Europe.45\nWhen all direct and indirect links between reactive nitrogen and climate in the U.S. are added up, a recent estimate suggests a modest reduction in the rate of warming in the near term (next several decades), but a progressive switch to greater net warming over a 100-year timescale.28,29 That switch is due to a reduction in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, which provide modest cooling effects, a reduction in the nitrogen-stimulated CO2 storage in forests, and a rising importance of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions. Current policies tend to reinforce this switch. For example, policies that reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions have large public health benefits, but also reduce the indirect climate mitigation co-benefits by reducing carbon storage and aerosol formation.\nChanges in the phosphorus cycle have no direct effects on climate, but phosphorus availability constrains plant and microbial activity in a wide variety of land- and water-based ecosystems.46,47 Changes in phosphorus availability due to human activity can therefore have indirect impacts on climate and the emissions of greenhouse gases in a variety of ways. For example, in land-based ecosystems, phosphorus availability can limit both CO2 storage and decomposition46,48 as well as the rate of nitrogen accumulation.49 In turn, higher nitrogen inputs can alter phosphorus cycling via changes in the production and activity of enzymes that release phosphorus from decaying organic matter,50 creating another mechanism by which rising nitrogen inputs can stimulate carbon uptake.\n\n355\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f15: BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES\n\nOther Effects: Sulfate Aerosols In addition to the aerosol effects from nitrogen mentioned osols by half or more.42 Continued declines in sulfate aerosol above, there are both direct and indirect effects on climate cooling are projected for the future,42 particularly if coal confrom other aerosol sources. Components of the sulfur cycle tinues to be replaced by natural gas (which contains far fewer exert a cooling effect through the formation of sulfate aerosols sulfur impurities) for electricity generation. Here, as with nicreated from the oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions.26 trogen oxide emissions, the environmental and socioeconomic In the United States, the dominant source of sulfur dioxide is tradeoffs are important to recognize: lower sulfur dioxide and coal combustion. Sulfur dioxide emissions rose until 1980, but nitrogen oxide emissions remove some climate cooling agents, have since decreased by more than 50% following a series of but improve ecosystem health and save lives.16,31,52 air-quality regulations and incentives focused on improving human health and the environment, as well as reductions in the Three low-concentration industrial gases are particularly podelivered price of low-sulfur coal.51 That decrease in emissions tent for trapping heat: nitrogen trifluoride (NF3), sulfur hexafluhas had a marked effect on U.S. climate forcing: between 1970 oride (SF6), and trifluoromethyl sulfur pentafluoride (SF5CF3). and 1990, sulfate aerosols caused cooling, primarily over the None currently makes a major contribution to climate forcing, eastern U.S., but since 1990, further reductions in sulfur diox- but since their emissions are increasing and their effects last ide emissions have reduced the cooling effect of sulfate aer- for millennia, continued monitoring is important.\nKey Message 3: Impacts and Options\n\nAltered biogeochemical cycles together with climate change increase the vulnerability of biodiversity, food security, human health, and water quality to changing climate. However, natural and managed shifts in major biogeochemical cycles can help limit rates of climate change.\n\nClimate change alters key aspects of biogeochemical cycling, creating the potential for feedbacks that alter both warming and cooling processes into the future. For example, as soils warm, the rate of decomposition will increase, adding more CO2 to the atmosphere. In addition, both climate and biogeochemistry interact strongly with environmental and ecological concerns, such as biodiversity loss, freshwater and marine eutrophication (unintended fertilization of aquatic\n\necosystems that leads to water quality problems), air pollution, human health, food security, and water resources. Many of the latter connections are addressed in other sections of this assessment, but we summarize some of them here because consideration of mitigation and adaptation options for changes in climate and biogeochemistry often requires this broader context.\n\nClimate-Biogeochemistry Feedbacks\n\nBoth rising temperatures and changes in water availability can tion).

Warming and changes in water availability have been shown to interact with nitrogen in additive or synergistic ways to exacerbate biodiversity loss.59 Unfortunately, very few multi-factorial studies have been done to address this gap.\nHuman induced acceleration of the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles already causes widespread freshwater and marine eutrophication,60,61 a problem that is expected to worsen under a warming climate.61,62 Without efforts to reduce future climate change and to slow the acceleration of biogeochemical cycles, existing climate changes will combine with increasing inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus into freshwater and estuarine ecosystems. This combination of changes is projected to have substantial negative effects on water quality, human health, inland and coastal fisheries, and greenhouse gas emissions.18,61\nSimilar concerns \u00ad and opportunities for the simultaneous reduction of multiple environmental problems (known as \"co-benefits\") \u00ad exist in the realms of air pollution, human health, and food security. For example, methane, volatile or-\n\nganic compounds, and nitrogen oxide emissions all contribute\nto the formation of tropospheric ozone, which is a greenhouse\ngas and has negative consequences for human health and crop and forest productivity.37,63,64 Rates of ozone formation are ac-\ncelerated by higher temperatures, creating a reinforcing cycle\nbetween rising temperatures and continued human alteration of the nitrogen and carbon cycles.65 Rising temperatures also work against some of the benefits of air pollution control.64\nSome changes will trade gains in one arena for declines in oth-\ners. For example, lowered NOx, NHx, and SOx emissions remove cooling agents from the atmosphere, but improve air quality.16,31 Recent analyses suggest that targeting reductions in\ncompounds like methane and black carbon aerosols that have\nboth climate and air-pollution consequences can achieve sig-\nnificant improvements in not only the rate of climate change, but also in human health.31 Finally, reductions in excess nitro-\ngen and phosphorus from agricultural and industrial activities\ncan potentially reduce the rate and impacts of climate change,\nwhile simultaneously addressing concerns in biodiversity, water quality, food security, and human health.66\n\nMany Factors Combine to Affect Biogeochemical Cycles\n\nFigure 15.4. Top panel shows the impact of the alteration of the carbon cycle alone on radiative forcing. The bottom panel shows the impacts of the alteration of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles on radiative forcing. SO2 and NH3 increase aerosols and decrease radiative forcing. NH3 is likely to increase plant biomass, and consequently decrease forcing. NOx is likely to increase the formation of tropospheric ozone (O3) and increase radiative forcing.  Ozone has a negative effect on plant growth/biomass, which might increase radiative forcing. CO2 and NH3 act synergistically to increase plant growth, and therefore decrease radiative forcing. SO2 is likely to reduce plant growth, perhaps through the leaching of soil nutrients, and consequently increase radiative forcing. NOx is likely to reduce plant growth directly and through the leaching of soil nutrients, therefore increasing radiative forcing. However, it could act as a fertilizer that would have the opposite effect.\n\n357\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f15: BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES\n\nEstimating the u.s. carbon sink\n\nAny natural or engineered process that temporarily or permanently removes and stores carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere is considered a carbon \"sink.\" Temporary (10 to 100 years) CO2 sinks at the global scale include absorption by plants as they photosynthesize, as well as CO2 dissolution into the ocean. Forest biomass and soils in North America offer large temporary carbon sinks in the global carbon budget; however, the spatial distribution, longevity, and mechanisms controlling these sinks are less certain.67 Understanding these processes is critical for predicting how ecosystem carbon sinks will change in the future, and potentially for managing the carbon sink as a mitigation strategy for climate change.\n\nTable 15.1. Carbon (C) sinks and uncertainty estimated by Pacala et al. for the first State of the Carbon Cycle Report.23 Forests take up the highest percentage of carbon of all land-based carbon sinks. Due to a number of factors, there are high degrees of uncertainty in carbon sink estimates.\n\nLand Area\n\nC sink (Tg C/y) (95% CI)\n\nMethod\n\nForest\n\n-256 (+/- 50%)\n\ninventory, modeled\n\nWood products\n\n-57 (+/- 50%)\n\ninventory\n\nWoody encroachment -120 (+/- >100%)\n\ninventory\n\nAgricultural soils\n\n-8 (+/- 50%)\n\nmodeled\n\nWetlands\n\n-23 (+/- >100%)\n\ninventory\n\nRivers and reservoirs\n\n-25 (+/- 100%)\n\ninventory\n\nNet Land Sink\n\n-489 (+/- 50%)\n\ninventory\n\nBoth inventory (measurement) and modeling techniques have been used to estimate land-based carbon sinks at a\n\nrange of scales in both time and space. For inventory methods, carbon stocks are measured at a location at two points\n\nin time, and the amount of carbon stored or lost can be estimated over the intervening time period. This method is\n\nwidely used to estimate the amount of carbon stored in forests in the United States over timescales of years to de-\n\ncades. Terrestrial biosphere models estimate carbon sinks by modeling a suite of processes that control carbon cycling\n\ndynamics, such as photosynthesis (CO2 uptake by plants) and respiration (CO2 release by plants, animals, and micro-\n\norganisms in soil and water). Field-\n\nbased data and/or remotely sensed data are used as inputs and also to\n\nU.S. Carbon Sinks Absorb a Fraction of CO2 Emissions\n\nvalidate these models. Estimates of\n\nthe land-based carbon sink can vary\n\ndepending on the data inputs and\n\nhow different processes are modeled.22 Atmospheric inverse models\n\nuse information about atmospheric\n\nCO2 concentrations and atmospheric\n\ntransport (like air currents) to esti-\n\nmate the terrestrial carbon sink.68\n\nThis approach can provide detailed\n\ninformation about carbon sinks over\n\ntime. However, because atmospheric\n\nCO2 is well-mixed and monitoring\n\nsites are widely dispersed, these\n\nmodels estimate fluxes over large ar-\n\neas and it is difficult to identify pro-\n\ncesses responsible for the sink from\n\nthese data.22 Recent estimates using\n\natmospheric inverse models show\n\nthat global land and ocean carbon\nsinks are stable or even increasing globally.69\n\nFigure 15.5. Figure shows growth in fossil fuel CO2 emissions (black line) and forest and total land carbon sinks in the U.S. for 1990\u00ad2010 (green and orange lines; from EPA 201221) and for 2003 (symbols; from the first State of the Carbon Cycle Report67). Carbon emissions are significantly higher than the total land sink's capacity to absorb and store them. (Data from EPA 2012 and CCSP 200721,67).\n\nContinued\n\n358\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fEstimating the u.s. carbon sink (continued)\n\n15: BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES\n\nU.S. Carbon Sources and Sinks from 1991 to 2000 and 2001 to 2010\n\nFigure 15.6. Changes in CO2 emissions and land-based sinks in two recent decades, showing amongyear variation (vertical lines: minimum and maximum estimates among years; boxes: 25th and 75th quartiles; horizontal line: median). Total CO2 emissions, as well as total CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, have risen; land-based carbon sinks have increased slightly, but at a much slower pace. (Data from EPA 2012 and CCSP 200721,67).\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducts an annual inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks as part of the nation's commitments under the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Estimates are based on inventory studies and models validated with field-based data (such as the CENTURY model) in accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) best practices.70 An additional comprehensive assessment, The First State of the Carbon Cycle Report (SOCCR), provides estimates for carbon sources and sinks in the U.S. and North America around 2003.67 This assessment also utilized inventory and field-based terrestrial biosphere models, and incorporated additional land sinks not explicitly included in EPA assessments.\nData from these assessments suggest that the U.S. carbon sink has been variable over the last two decades, but still absorbs and stores a small fraction of CO2 emissions. The forest sink comprises the largest fraction of the total land sink in the United States, annually absorbing 7% to 24% (with a best estimate of 16%) of fossil fuel CO2 emissions during the last two decades. Because the U.S. Forest Service has conducted detailed forest carbon inventory studies, the uncertainty surrounding the estimate for the forest sink is lower than for most other components (see Pacala et al. 2007, Table 223). The role of lakes, reservoirs, and rivers in the carbon budget, in particular, has been difficult to quantify and is rarely included in national budgets.71 The IPCC guidelines for estimating greenhouse gas sources or sinks from lakes, reservoirs, or rivers are included in the \"wetlands\" category, but only for lands converted to wetlands. These ecosystems are not included in the EPA's estimates of the total land sink. Rivers and reservoirs were estimated to be a sink in the State of the Carbon Cycle analysis,23 but recent studies suggest that inland waters may actually be an important source of CO2 to the atmosphere.72 It is important to note that these two methods use different datasets, different models, and different methodologies to estimate land-based carbon sinks in the United States. In particular, we note that the EPA Inventory, consistent with IPCC Guidelines for national inventories, includes only carbon sinks designated as humancaused, while the SOCCR analysis does not make this distinction.\n\n359\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f15: BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES\nReferences\n\n1.

A workshop held in July 2011 at the USGS John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis in Fort Collins, CO, focused on climate-nitrogen actions and was summarized in the second primary source.4 An additional 15 technical input reports on various topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nThe entire author team for this chapter conducted its deliberations by teleconference from April to June 2012, with three major meetings resulting in an outline and a set of key messages. The team came to expert consensus on all of the key messages based on their reading of the technical inputs, other published literature, and professional judgment. Several original key messages were later combined into a broader set of statements while retaining most of the original content of the chapter. Major revisions to the key messages, chapter, and traceable accounts were approved by authors; further minor revisions were consistent with the messages intended by the authors.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nHuman activities have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 40% over pre-industrial levels and more than doubled the amount of nitrogen available to ecosystems. Similar trends have\n\nbeen observed for phosphorus and other elements, and these changes have major consequences for biogeochemical cycles and climate change.\nDescription of evidence base The author team evaluated technical input reports (17) on biogeochemical cycles, including the two primary sources.4,31 In particular, one report4 focused on changes in the nitrogen cycle and was comprehensive. Original literature was consulted for changes in other biogeochemical cycles. The foundational report30 updated several aspects of our understanding of the carbon balance in the United States.\nPublications have shown that human activities have altered biogeochemical cycles. A seminal paper comparing increases in the global fluxes of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and phosphorous (P) was published in 200073 and was recently updated.3 Changes observed in the nitrogen cycle1,17,18 show anthropogenic sources to be far greater than natural ones.14,36,47 For phosphorus, the effect of added phosphorus on plants and microbes is well understood.19,46,47 Extensive research shows that increases in CO2 are the strongest human impact forcing climate change, mainly because the concentration of CO2 is so much greater than that of other greenhouse gases.5,7,73\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The sources of C, N, and P are from well-documented processes, such as fossil fuel burning and fertilizer production and application. The flux from some processes is well known, while others have significant remaining uncertainties.\nSome new work has synthesized the assessment of global and national CO2 emissions7 and categorized the major CO2 sources and sinks.4,30 Annual updates of CO2 emissions and sink inventories are done by EPA (for example, EPA 20138).\nAdvances in the knowledge of the nitrogen cycle have quantified that human-caused reactive nitrogen inputs are now at least five times greater than natural inputs.4,13,14\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence High confidence. Evidence for human inputs of C, N, and P come from academic, government, and industry sources. The data show substantial agreement.\n\n366\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f15: BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES Traceable Accounts\n\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.),\nhigh consensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium\nconsensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing\nschools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts\n\nventories.7,22,36 The forest sink has persisted in the U.S. as forests that were previously cut have regrown. Further studies show that carbon uptake can be increased to some extent by a fertilization effect with reactive nitrogen44,45 and phosphorus,46,47,48 both nutrients that can limit the rate of photosynthesis. The carbon sink due to nitrogen fertilization is projected to lessen in the future as controls on nitrogen emissions come into play.28\nWhile carbon uptake by ecosystems has a net cooling effect, trace gases emitted by ecosystems have a warming effect that can offset the cooling effect of the carbon sink.26 The most important of these gases are methane and nitrous oxide (N2O), the concentrations of which are projected to rise.25,26,33,37,38\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The carbon sink estimates have very wide margins of error. The percent of U.S. CO2 emissions that are stored in ecosystems depends on which years are used for emissions and whether inventories, ecosystem process models, atmospheric inverse models, or some combination of these techniques are used to estimate the sink size (see \"Estimating the U.S. Carbon Sink\"). The inventories are continually updated (for example, EPA 20138), but there is a lack of congruence on which of the three techniques is most reliable. A recent paper that uses atmospheric inverse modeling suggests that the global land and ocean carbon sinks are stable or increasing.69\n\nThe likelihood of continued dominance of CO2 over other greenhouse gases as a driver of global climate change is also judged to be high, because its concentration is an order of magnitude higher and its rate of change is well known.\n\nWhile known to be significant, continental-scale fluxes and sources of the greenhouse gases N2O and CH4 are based on limited data and are potentially subject to revision. Recent syntheses28 evaluate the dynamics of these two important gases and project future changes. Uncertainties remain high.\n\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nIn total, land in the United States absorbs and stores an amount of carbon equivalent to about 17% of annual U.S. fossil fuel emissions. U.S. forests and associated wood products account for most of this land sink. The effect of this carbon storage is to partially offset warming from emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.\nDescription of evidence base The author team evaluated technical input reports (17) on biogeochemical cycles, including the two primary sources.4,30 The \"Estimating the U.S. Carbon Sink\" section relies on multiple sources of data that are described therein.\nNumerous studies of the North American and U.S. carbon sink have been published in reports and the scientific literature. Estimates of the percentage of fossil fuel CO2 emissions that are captured by forest, cropland, and other lands vary from a low of 7% to a high of about 24%, when the carbon storage is estimated from carbon in-\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence We have very high confidence that the value of the forest carbon sink lies within the range given, 7% to 24% (with a best estimate of 16%) of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. There is wide acceptance that forests and soils store carbon in North America, and that they will continue to do so into the near future. The exact value of the sink strength is very poorly constrained, however, and knowledge of the projected future sink is low. As forests age, their capacity to store carbon in living biomass will necessarily decrease,10 but if other, unknown sinks are dominant, ecosystems may continue to be a carbon sink.\nWe have high confidence that the combination of ecosystem carbon storage of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and potential warming from other trace gases emitted by ecosystems will ultimately result in a net warming effect. This is based primarily on one recent synthesis,28 which provides ranges for multiple factors and describes the effects of propagating uncertainties. However, the exact amount of warming or cooling produced by various gases is not yet well known, because of the interactions of multiple factors.\n\n367\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f15: BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES Traceable Accounts\n\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nAltered biogeochemical cycles together with climate change increase the vulnerability of biodiversity, food security, human health, and water quality to changing climate. However, natural and managed shifts in major biogeochemical cycles can help limit rates of climate change.\nDescription of evidence base The author team evaluated technical input reports (17) on biogeochemical cycles, including the two primary sources.4,30\nThe climate\u00adbiogeochemical cycle link has been demonstrated through numerous studies on the effects of reactive nitrogen and phosphorus on forest carbon uptake and storage, and decomposition of organic matter;44,53 temperature effects on ecosystem productivity;54 and sensitivity of natural methane emissions to climate variation.55\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Scientists are still investigating the impact of nitrogen deposition on carbon uptake and of sulfur and nitrogen aerosols on radiative forcing.\nRecent work has shown that more than just climate change aspects can benefit from addressing multiple environmental concerns (air/ water quality, biodiversity, food security, human health, and so on)\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence High. We have a high degree of confidence that climate change will affect biogeochemical cycles through its effects on ecosystem structure and function (species composition and productivity). Similarly, there is high confidence that altered biogeochemical cycles will affect climate change, as for example in the increased rates of carbon storage in forests and soils that often accompany excess nitrogen\ndeposition.\n\nWhere the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles are concerned, a number of publications have reported effects of excess loading on ecosystem processes60,61 and have projected these effects to worsen.61,62 Additionally, studies have reported the potential for future climate change and increasing nitrogen and phosphorus loadings to have an additive effect and the need for remediation.18,61 The literature suggests that co-benefits are possible from addressing the environmental concerns of both nutrient loading and climate change.4,31,64,65,66\n\n368\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fREGIONS\n\nFrom the Rocky Mountains to the Shenandoah Valley, the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, our country's landscapes and communities vary dramatically. But amidst our geographical and economic diversity, we share many common attributes and challenges. One common challenge facing every U.S. region is a new and dynamic set of realities resulting from our changing climate.\n\nThe evidence can be found in every region, and impacts are visible in every state.\n\nSome of the most dramatic changes are in Alaska, where average temperatures\n\nhave increased more than twice as fast as the rest of the country. The rapid\n\ndecline of Arctic sea ice cover in the last decade is reshaping that region. In\n\nthe Southwest, a combination of increased temperatures and reductions in\n\nannual precipitation are already affecting forests and diminishing water supplies.\n\nMeanwhile, that region's population continues to grow at double-digit rates,\n\nincreasing the stress on water supplies. In various regions, evidence of climate\n\nchange is apparent in ecosystem changes, such as species moving northward,\n\nincreases in invasive species and insect outbreaks, and changes in the length of\n\nthe growing season. In many cities, impacts to the urban environment are closely\n\nlinked to the changing climate, with increased flooding, greater incidence of heat\n\nwaves, and diminished air\n\nquality. Along most of our\n\ncoastlines, increasing sea\n\nlevels and associated threats to coastal areas and infrastructure\n\nAlaska\n\nare becoming a common\n\nexperience.\n\nFor all U.S. regions, warming in the future is projected\n\nNorthwest\n\nGreat Plains\n\nto be very large compared\n\nto historical variations. Precipitation patterns will be altered as well, with some regions becoming drier and some wetter.

As a result, projected\n\nprecipitation changes in the northernmost states (which will get wetter) and\n\nsouthernmost states (which will get drier) are more certain than those for the\n\ncentral areas of the country. The heaviest precipitation events are projected to\n\nincrease everywhere, and by large amounts. Extended dry spells are also projected\n\nto increase in length.\n\nMidwest\n\nNortheast\nWashington, DC\n\nSoutheast and\nCaribbean\n\nPuerto Rico\nU.S. Virgin Islands\n\n369\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\u00a9iStockPhoto.com/Andrew Johnson\n\n\fREGIONS\nRegional differences in climate change impacts provide opportunities as well as challenges. A changing climate requires alterations in historical agricultural practices, which, if properly anticipated, can have some benefits. Warmer winters mean reductions in heating costs for those in the northern portions of the country. Well-designed adaptation and mitigation actions that take advantage of regional conditions can significantly enhance the nation's resilience in the face of multiple challenges, which include many factors in addition to climate change.\nThe regions defined in this report intentionally follow state lines (see Figure 1 and Table 1), but landscape features such as forests and mountain ranges do not follow these artificial boundaries. The array of distinct landscapes within each region required difficult choices of emphasis for the authors. The chapters that follow provide a summary of changes and impacts that are observed and anticipated in each of the eight regions of the United States, as well as on oceans and coasts.\nFor more information about the regional climate histories and projections1 and sea level rise scenarios2 developed for the National Climate Assessment, and used throughout this report, see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate and Appendix 5: Scenarios and Model\n\nRegion\nNortheast\nSoutheast and Caribbean Midwest Great Plains Northwest Southwest Alaska\nHawai`i and U.S. Pacific Islands\n\nTable 1: Composition of NCA Regions\nComposition\nConnecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, District of Columbia, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Wisconsin Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Wyoming Idaho, Oregon, Washington Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah Alaska Hawai`i, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Republic of Palau, Territory of American Samoa, Territory of Guam\n\n\u00a9iStockPhoto.com/Andrew Johnson\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Heat waves, coastal flooding, and river flooding will pose a growing challenge to the region's environmental, social, and economic systems. This will increase the vulnerability of the region's residents, especially its most disadvantaged populations.\n2. Infrastructure will be increasingly compromised by climate-related hazards, including sea level rise, coastal flooding, and intense precipitation events.\n3. Agriculture, fisheries, and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised over the next century by climate change impacts. Farmers can explore new crop options, but these adaptations are not cost- or risk-free. Moreover, adaptive capacity, which varies throughout the region, could be overwhelmed by a changing climate.\n4. While a majority of states and a rapidly growing number of municipalities have begun to incorporate the risk of climate change into their planning activities, implementation of adaptation measures is still at early stages.\n\nSixty-four million people are concentrated in the Northeast. The high-density urban coastal corridor from Washington, D.C., north to Boston is one of the most developed environments in the world. It contains a massive, complex, and long-standing network of supporting infrastructure. The region is home to one of the world's leading financial centers, the nation's capital, and many defining cultural and historical landmarks.\nThe region has a vital rural component as well. The Northeast includes large expanses of sparsely populated but ecologically and agriculturally important areas. Much of the Northeast landscape is dominated by forest, but the region also has grasslands, coastal zones, beaches and dunes, and wetlands, and it is known for its rich marine and freshwater fisheries. These natural areas are essential to recreation and tourism sectors and support jobs through the sale of timber, maple syrup, and seafood. They also contribute important ecosystem services to broader populations \u00ad protecting water supplies, buffering shorelines, and sequestering carbon in soils and vegetation. The twelve Northeastern states have more than 180,000 farms, with $17 billion in annual sales.1 The region's ecosystems and agricultural systems are tightly interwoven, and both are vulnerable to a changing climate.\n\nas well as coastal and riverine flooding due to a combination of sea level rise, storm surge, and extreme precipitation events.\nThe Northeast is characterized by a diverse climate.2 Average temperatures in the Northeast generally decrease to the north, with distance from the coast, and at higher elevations. Average annual precipitation varies by about 20 inches throughout the Northeast with the highest amounts observed in coastal and select mountainous regions. During winter, frequent storms bring bitter cold and frozen precipitation, especially to the north. Summers are warm and humid, especially to the south. The Northeast is often affected by extreme events such as ice storms, floods, droughts, heat waves, hurricanes, and major storms in the Atlantic Ocean off the northeast coast, referred to as nor'easters. However, variability is large in both space and\n\nAlthough urban and rural regions in the Northeast have profoundly different built and natural environments, both include populations that have been shown to be highly vulnerable to climate hazards and other stresses. Both also depend on aging infrastructure that has already been stressed by climate hazards including heat waves,\n\n\u00a9 Frank Siteman/Science Faction/Corbis\n\n372\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f16: NORTHEAST\n\n\u00a9 ADAM HUNGER/Reuters/Corbis\n\ntime. For example, parts of southern New England that experienced heavy snows in the cold season of 2010-2011 experienced little snow during the cold season of 20112012. Of course, even a season with low totals can feature costly extreme events; snowfall during a 2011 pre-Halloween storm that hit most of the Northeast, when many trees were still in leaf, knocked out power for up to 10 days for thousands of households.\n\nObserved Climate Change\nBetween 1895 and 2011, temperatures in the Northeast increased by almost 2\u00b0F (0.16\u00b0F per decade), and precipitation increased by approximately five inches, or more than 10% (0.4 inches per decade).3 Coastal flooding has increased due to a rise in sea level of approximately 1 foot since 1900. This rate of sea level rise exceeds the global average of approximately 8 inches (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10; Ch. 25: Coasts), due primarily to land subsidence,4 although recent research suggests that changes in ocean circulation in the North Atlantic \u00ad specifically, a weakening of the Gulf Stream \u00ad may also play a role.5\n\nThe Northeast has experienced a greater recent increase in extreme precipitation than any other region in the United States; between 1958 and 2010, the Northeast saw more than a 70% increase in the amount of precipitation falling in very heavy events (defined as the heaviest 1% of all daily events) (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figure 2.18).7\n\nSea Level is Rising\n\nFigure 16.1. (Map) Local sea level trends in the Northeast region. Length of time series for each arrow varies by tide gauge location. (Figure source: NOAA6). (Graph) Observed sea level rise in Philadelphia, PA, has significantly exceeded the global average of 8 inches over the past century, increasing the risk of impacts to critical urban infrastructure in low-lying areas. Over 100 years (1901-2012), sea level increased 1.2 feet (Data from Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level).\n\n373\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f16: NORTHEAST\n\nProjected Climate Change\n\nAs in other areas, the amount of warming in the Northeast The frequency, intensity, and duration of cold air outbreaks is\n\nwill be highly dependent on global emissions of heat-trapping expected to decrease as the century progresses, although some\n\ngases.

Seasonal drought risk is also projected to increase in\n\nsummer and fall as higher temperatures lead to\n\ngreater evaporation and earlier winter and spring snowmelt.11\n\nGlobal sea levels are projected to rise 1 to 4 feet by 2100 (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10),12 depending in large part on the extent to which the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets experience significant melting. Sea level rise along most of the coastal Northeast is expected to exceed the global average rise due to local land subsidence, with the possibility of even greater regional sea level rise if the Gulf Stream weakens as some models suggest.5,13 Sea level rise of two feet, without any changes in storms, would more than triple the frequency of dangerous coastal flooding throughout most of the Northeast.14\n\nAlthough individual hurricanes cannot be directly attributed to climate change, Hurricanes Irene and Sandy nevertheless provided \"teachable moments\" by demonstrating the region's vulnerability to extreme weather events and the potential for adaptation to reduce impacts.\n\nFigure 16.2. Projected number of days per year with a maximum temperature greater than 90\u00b0F averaged between 2041 and 2070, compared to 1971-2000 (Historical Climate), assuming continued increases in global emissions (A2) and substantial reductions in future emissions (B1).

These heavy rains were part of a broader pattern\n\nof wet weather preceding the storm (rainfall totals for August and September exceeded 25 inches across much of\n\nFlooding and Hurricane Irene\n\nthe Northeast) that left the region predisposed to extreme\n\nflooding from Irene; for example, the Schoharie Creek in New York experienced a 500-year flood.15\n\nIn anticipation of Irene, the New York City mass transit\n\nsystem was shut down, and 2.3 million coastal residents\n\nin Delaware, New Jersey, and New York faced mandatory\n\nevacuations. However, it was the inland impacts, espe-\n\ncially in upstate New York and in central and southern\n\nVermont, that were most severe. Ironically, many New\n\nYork City residents fled to inland locations, which were\n\nharder hit. Flash flooding washed out roads and bridg-\n\nes, undermined railroads, brought down trees and pow-\n\ner lines, flooded homes and businesses, and damaged\n\nfloodplain forests. In Vermont, more than 500 miles of\n\nroadways and approximately 200 bridges were damaged,\n\nwith estimated rebuilding costs of $175 to $250 mil-\n\nlion. Hazardous wastes were released in a number of ar-\n\neas, and 17 municipal wastewater treatment plants were\n\nbreached by floodwaters. Agricultural losses included\n\ndamage to barn structures and flooded fields of crops.\n\nMany towns and villages were isolated for days due to\n\ninfrastructure impacts from river flooding (see also Ch. 5: Transportation, \"Tropical Storm Irene Devastates Vermont Transportation in August 2011\").2 Affected residents suffered from increased allergen exposure due to mold growth in flooded homes and other structures and\n\nFigure 16.3. Hurricane Irene over the Northeast on August 28, 2011. The storm, which brought catastrophic flooding rains to parts of the Northeast, took 41 lives in the United States, and the economic cost was estimated at $16 billion.16 (Figure source: MODIS instrument on NASA's Aqua satellite).\n\nwere exposed to potentially harmful chemicals and pathogens in their drinking water. In the state of Vermont, cleaning\n\nup spills from aboveground hazardous waste tanks cost an estimated $1.75 million. Septic systems were also damaged from high groundwater levels and river or stream erosion, including 17 septic system failures in the state of Vermont.17\n\nSandy was responsible for about 150 deaths, approximately half of which occurred in the Northeast.18 Damages, con-\ncentrated in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, were estimated at $60 to $80 billion, making Sandy the second most costly Atlantic Hurricane in history behind Katrina.19 It is also estimated that 650,000 homes were damaged or destroyed, and that 8.5 million people were without power.18 Floodwaters inundated subway tunnels in New York City (see\nalso Ch. 5: Transportation, \"Hurricane Sandy\"). Sandy also caused significant damage to the electrical grid and overwhelmed sewage treatment plants.18 In New Jersey, repairs to damaged power and gas lines are expected to cost about\n$1 billion, and repairs to waste, water, and sewer systems are expected to cost $3 billion.\n\nMany of these vulnerabilities to coastal flooding and sea level rise (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10) and\n\nintensifying storms (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Messages 8 and 9) \u00ad including the projected frequency of flood-\n\ning of tunnels and airports \u00ad were documented as early as 2001 in a report developed in support of the 2000 National\n\nClimate Assessment.20 Despite such reports, the observed vulnerability was a surprise to many coastal residents, which\n\nsuggests improved communication is needed.\n\nContinued\n\n375\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fHurricane vulnerability\n\n16: NORTHEAST\n\nOver the last decade, cities, states, and agencies in the New York metropolitan region took steps to reduce their vulnerability to coastal storms.21 In 2008, New York City convened a scientific body of experts \u00ad the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC) \u00ad and formed a Climate Adaptation Task Force comprised of approximately 40 agencies, private sector companies, and regional groups. A process, approach, and tools for climate change adaptation were developed and documented in New York City11,22 and New York State.23 In 2012, the NPCC and Climate Adaptation Task Force were codified into New York City law, a key step towards institutionalizing climate science, impact, and adaptation assessment into long-term planning.24\nThese initiatives led to adaptation efforts, including elevating infrastructure, restoring green spaces, and developing evacuation plans that helped reduce damage and save lives during Irene and Sandy (also see discussion of Hurricane Sandy in Ch. 11: Urban). As rebuilding and recovery advances,24 decision-making based on current and projected risks from such events by a full set of stakeholders and participants in the entire Northeast could dramatically improve resilience across the region.\n\nCoastal Flooding Along New Jersey's Shore\n\nFigure 16.4. Predictions of coastal erosion prior to Sandy's arrival provided the region's residents and decision-makers with advance warning of potential vulnerability. The map shows three bands: collision of waves with beaches causing erosion on the front of the beach; overwash that occurs when water reaches over the highest point and erodes from the rear, which carries sand inland; and inundation, when the shore is severely eroded and new channels can form that lead to permanent flooding. The probabilities are based on the storm striking at high tide. For New Jersey, the model estimated that 21% of the shoreline had more than a 90% chance of experiencing inundation. These projections were realized, and made the New Jersey coastline even more vulnerable to the nor'easter that followed Hurricane Sandy by only 10 days. (Figure source: ESRI and USGS 201225).\n\n376\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f16: NORTHEAST\nKey Message 1: Climate Risks to People\nHeat waves, coastal flooding, and river flooding will pose a growing challenge to the region's environmental, social, and economic systems. This will increase the vulnerability of the region's residents, especially its most disadvantaged populations.\nUrban residents have unique and multifaceted vulnerabilities to heat extremes. Northeastern cities, with their abundance of concrete and asphalt and relative lack of vegetation, tend to have higher temperatures than surrounding regions (the \"urban heat island\" effect). During extreme heat events, nighttime temperatures in the region's big cities are generally several degrees higher26 than surrounding regions, leading to increased heat-related death among those less able to recover from the heat of the day.27 Since the hottest days in the Northeast are often associated with high concentrations of ground-level ozone and other pollutants,28 the combination of heat stress and poor air quality can pose a major health risk to vulnerable groups: young children, the elderly, and those with preexisting health conditions including asthma.29 Vulnerability is further increased as key infrastructure, including electricity for potentially life-saving air conditioning, is more likely to fail precisely when it is most needed \u00ad when demand exceeds available supply. Significant investments may be required to ensure that power generation keeps up with rising demand associated with rising temperatures.30 Finally, vulnerability to heat\nUrban Heat Island\n\n\u00a9Richard Drew/AP/AP/Corbis\n\nFigure 16.5. Surface temperatures in New York City on a summer's day show the \"urban heat island,\" with temperatures in populous urban areas being approximately 10\u00b0F higher than the forested parts of Central Park. Dark blue reflects the colder waters of the Hudson and East Rivers. (Figure source: Center for Climate Systems Research, Columbia University).\n\nwaves is not evenly distributed throughout urban areas; outdoor versus indoor air temperatures, air quality, baseline health, and access to air conditioning are all dependent on socioeconomic factors.29 Socioeconomic factors that tend to increase vulnerability to such hazards include race and ethnicity (being a minority), age (the elderly and children), gender (female), socioeconomic status (low income, status, or poverty), and education (low educational attainment). The condition of human settlements (type of housing and construction, infrastructure, and access to lifelines) and the built environment are also important determinants of socioeconomic vulnerability, especially given the fact that these characteristics influence potential economic losses, injuries, and mortality.31\nIncreased health-related impacts and costs, such as premature death and hospitalization due to even modest increases in heat, are predicted in the Northeast's urban centers (Ch. 9: Human Health).32 One recent study projected that temperature changes alone would lead to a 50% to 91% increase in heat-related deaths in Manhattan by the 2080s (relative\n\n377\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f16: NORTHEAST\n\nto a 1980s baseline).33 Increased ground-level ozone due to warming is projected to increase emergency department visits for ozone-related asthma in children (0 to 17 years of age) by 7.3% by the 2020s (given the A2 scenario) relative to a 1990 baseline of approximately 650 visits in the New York metropolitan area.34\nHeat wave research has tended to focus on urban areas, but vulnerability to heat may also become a major issue in rural areas and small towns because air conditioning is currently not prevalent in parts of the rural Northeast where heat waves have historically been rare. Some areas of northern New England, near the Canadian border, are projected to shift from having less than five to more than 15 days per year over 90\u00b0F by the 2050s under the higher emissions scenario (A2) of heattrapping gases.3 It should be noted that winter heating needs, a significant expense for many Northeastern residents, are likely to decrease as the century progresses.35\nThe impacts of climate change on public health will extend beyond the direct effects of temperature on human physiology. Changing distributions of temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide could affect the potency of plant allergens,36 and there has been an observed increase of 13 to 27 days in the ragweed pollen season at latitudes above 44\u00b0N.36\nVector-borne diseases are an additional concern. Most occurrences of Lyme disease in United States are in the Northeast, especially Connecticut.37 While it is unclear how climate change will impact Lyme disease,38 several studies in the Northeast have linked tick activity and Lyme disease incidence to climate, specifically abundant late spring and early summer moisture.39 West Nile Virus (WNV) is another vector-borne disease that may be influenced by changes in climate. Suitable habitat for the Asian Tiger Mosquito, which can transmit West Nile and other vector-borne diseases, is expected to increase in the Northeast from the current 5% to 16% in the next two decades and from 43% to 49% by the end of the century, exposing more than 30 million people to the threat of dense infestations by this species.40\nMany Northeast cities, including New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, are served by combined sewer systems that collect\n\nand treat both stormwater and municipal wastewater. During heavy rain events, combined systems can be overwhelmed and untreated water may be released into local water bodies. In Connecticut, the risk for contracting a stomach illness while swimming significantly increased after a one inch precipitation event,41 and studies have found associations between diarrheal illness among children and sewage discharge in Milwaukee.42 More frequent heavy rain events could therefore increase the incidence of waterborne disease.\nHistorical settlement patterns and ongoing investment in coastal areas and along major rivers combine to increase the vulnerabilities of people in the Northeast to sea level rise and coastal storms. Of the Northeast's population of 64 million,43 approximately 1.6 million people live within the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) 100-year coastal flood zone, with the majority \u00ad 63% of those at risk \u00ad residing in New York and New Jersey.44 As sea levels rise, populations in the current 1-in-100-year coastal flood zone (defined as the area with at least a 1% chance of experiencing a coastal flood in a given year) will experience more frequent flooding, and populations that have historically fallen outside the 1-in-100-year flood zone will find themselves in that zone. People living in coastal flood zones are vulnerable to direct loss of life and injury associated with tropical storms and nor'easters. Flood damage to personal property, businesses, and public infrastructure can also result (see Key Message 2).\nThis risk is not limited to the 1-in-100-year flood zone; in the Mid-Atlantic part of the region alone, estimates suggest that between 450,000 and 2.3 million people are at risk from a three foot sea level rise,45 which is in the range of projections for this century.\nThroughout the Northeast, populations are also concentrated along rivers and their flood plains. In mountainous regions, including much of West Virginia and large parts of Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, and New Hampshire, more intense precipitation events (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate)3 will mean greater flood risk, particularly in valleys, where people, infrastructure, and agriculture tend to be concentrated.\n\n378\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f16: NORTHEAST\n\nKey Message 2: Stressed Infrastructure\n\nInfrastructure will be increasingly compromised by climate-related hazards, including sea level rise, coastal flooding, and intense precipitation events.\n\nDisruptions to services provided by public and private infra-\nstructure in the Northeast both interrupt commerce and threaten public health and safety (see also Ch. 11: Urban).46\nIn New York State, two feet of sea level rise is estimated (ab-\nsent adaptation investment) to flood or render unusable 212\nmiles of roads, 77 miles of rail, 3,647 acres of airport facilities, and 539 acres of runways.47 Port facilities, such as in Maryland\n(primarily Baltimore), also have flooding impact estimates: 298 acres, or 32% of the overall port facilities in the state.47 These\nimpacts have potentially significant economic ramifications.\nFor example, in 2006 alone the Port of Baltimore generated\nmore than 50,200 jobs, $3.6 billion in personal income, $1.9\nbillion in business revenues, and $388 million in state, county, and municipal tax.48 The New York City Panel on Climate\nChange highlighted a broader range of climate impacts on infrastructure sectors (see Table 16.1).11 Although this study\nfocused specifically on New York City, these impacts are ap-\n\nplicable throughout the region. Predicted impacts of coastal flooding on infrastructure were largely borne out by Hurricane Sandy; sea level rise will only increase these vulnerabilities.\nThe more southern states within the region, including Delaware and Maryland, have a highly vulnerable land area because of a higher rate of sea level rise and relatively flat coastlines compared to the northern tier. The northern states, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, have less land area exposed to a high inundation risk because of a lower relative sea level rise and because of their relatively steep coastal terrain.49 Still, low-lying coastal metropolitan areas in New England have considerable infrastructure at risk. In Boston alone, cumulative damage to buildings and building contents, as well as the associated emergency costs, could potentially be as high as $94 billion between 2000 and 2100, depending on the sea level rise scenario and which adaptive actions are taken.50\n\nTable 16.1.

Flooded subway tracks in Coney Island after Hurricane Irene. (Photo credit: Metropolitan Transportation Authority of the State of New York 2011).\n\nNOAA\n\nIn the transportation sector (see also Ch. 5: Transportation), many of the region's key highways (including I-95) and rail systems (including Amtrak and commuter rail networks) span areas that are prone to coastal flooding. In addition to temporary service disruptions, storm surge flooding can severely undermine or disable critical infrastructure along coasts, including subway systems, wastewater treatment plants, and electrical\n\nsubstations. Saltwater corrosion can damage sensitive and critical electrical equipment, such as electrical substations for energy distribution and signal equipment for rail systems; corrosion also accelerates rust damage on rail lines. Saltwater also threatens groundwater supplies and damages wastewater treatment plants.\n\nKey Message 3: Agricultural and Ecosystem Impacts\n\nAgriculture, fisheries, and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised over the next century by climate change impacts. Farmers can explore new crop options, but these adaptations are\nnot cost- or risk-free. Moreover, adaptive capacity, which varies throughout the region, could be overwhelmed by a changing climate.\n\nFarmers in the Northeast are already experiencing consequences of climate change. In addition to direct crop damage from increasingly intense precipitation events, wet springs can delay planting for grain and vegetables in New York, for example, and subsequently delay harvest dates and reduce yields.53 This is an issue for agriculture nationally,54 but is particularly acute for the Northeast, where heavy rainfall events have increased more than in any other region of the country (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 6).7 In the future, farmers may also face too little water in summer to meet increased crop water demand as summers become hotter and growing seasons lengthen.55,56 Increased frequency of summer heat stress is also projected, which can negatively affect crop yields and milk production.57\nDespite a trend toward warmer winters, the risk of frost and freeze damage continues, and has paradoxically increased over the past decade (see also Ch. 8: Ecosystems). These risks are exacerbated for perennial crops in years with variable winter temperatures. For example, midwinter-freeze damage cost wine grape growers in the Finger Lakes region of New York millions of dollars in losses in the winters of 2003 and 2004.58 This was likely due to de-hardening of the vines during an unusually\n\nwarm December, which increased susceptibility to cold damage just prior to a subsequent hard freeze. Another avenue for cold damage, even in a relatively warm winter, is when there is an extended warm period in late winter or early spring causing premature leaf-out or bloom, followed by a damaging frost event, as occurred throughout the Northeast in 200759 and again in 2012 when apple, grape, cherry, and other fruit crops were hard hit.60\nIncreased weed and pest pressure associated with longer growing seasons and warmer winters will be an increasingly important challenge; there are already examples of earlier arrival and increased populations of some insect pests such as corn earworm.57 Furthermore, many of the most aggressive weeds, such as kudzu, benefit more than crop plants from higher atmospheric carbon dioxide, and become more resistant to herbicide control.61 Many weeds respond better than most cash crops to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, particularly \"invasive\" weeds with the so-called C3 photosynthetic pathway, and with rapid and expansive growth patterns, including large allocations of below-ground biomass, such as roots.62 Research also suggests that glyphosate (for example, Roundup), the most widely-used herbicide in the United States, loses its\n\n380\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f16: NORTHEAST\n\nefficacy on weeds grown at the increased carbon dioxide levels likely to occur in the coming decades.63 To date, all weed/crop competition studies where the photosynthetic pathway is the same for both species favor weed growth over crop growth as carbon dioxide is increased.61\nEffects of rising temperatures on the Northeast's ecosystems have already been clearly observed (see also Ch. 8: Ecosystems). Further, changes in species distribution by elevation are occurring; a Vermont study found an upslope shift of 299 to 390 feet in the boundary between northern hardwoods and boreal forest on the western slopes of the Green Mountains between 1964 and 2004.64 Wildflowers65 and woody perennials are blooming earlier 66 and migratory birds are arriving sooner.67 Because species differ in their ability to adjust, asynchronies (like a mismatch between key food source availability and migration patterns) can develop, increasing species and ecosystem vulnerability. Several bird species have expanded their ranges northward68 as have some invasive insect species, such as the hemlock woolly adelgid,69 which has devastated hemlock trees. Warmer winters and less snow cover in recent years have contributed to increased deer populations70 that degrade forest understory vegetation.71\nAs ocean temperatures continue to rise, the range of suitable habitat for many commercially important fish and shellfish species is projected to shift northward. For example, cod and lobster fisheries south of Cape Cod are projected to have significant declines.72 Although suitable habitats will be shrinking for some species (such as coldwater fish like brook trout) and expanding for others (such as warmwater fish like bass), it is difficult to predict what proportion of species will be able to\n\nmove or adapt as their optimum climate zones shift.73 As each species responds uniquely to climate change, disruptions of important species interactions (plants and pollinators; predators and prey) can be expected. For example, it is uncertain what forms of vegetation will move into the Adirondack Mountains when the suitable habitat for spruce-fir forests disappears.74 Increased productivity of some northern hardwood trees in the Northeast is projected (due to longer growing seasons and assuming a significant benefit from higher atmospheric carbon dioxide), but summer drought and other extreme events may offset potential productivity increases.75 Range shifts in traditional foods gathered from the forests by Native American communities, such as Wabanaki berries in the Northeast, can have negative health and cultural impacts (Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples).76\nIn contrast, many insect pests, pathogens, and invasive plants like kudzu appear to be highly and positively responsive to recent and projected climate change.77 Their expansion will lead to an overall loss of biodiversity, function, and resilience of some ecosystems.\nThe Northeast's coastal ecosystems and the species that inhabit them are highly vulnerable to rising seas (see also Ch. 25: Coasts, Key Message 4). Beach and dune erosion, both a cause and effect of coastal flooding, is also a major issue in the Northeast.78,79 Since the early 1800s, there has been an estimated 39% decrease in marsh coverage in coastal New England; in the metropolitan Boston area, marsh coverage is estimated to be less than 20% of its late 1700s value.80 Impervious urban surfaces and coastal barriers such as seawalls limit the ability of marshes to expand inland as sea levels rise.81\n\nThe chesapeake bay\nThe Chesapeake Bay is the largest U.S. estuary, with a drainage basin that extends over six states. It is a critical and highly integrated natural and economic system threatened by changing land-use patterns and a changing climate \u00ad including sea level rise, higher temperatures, and more intense precipitation events. The ecosystem has a central role in the economy, including providing sources of food for people and the region's other inhabitants, and cooling water for the energy sector. It also provides critical ecosystem services.\nAs sea levels rise, the Chesapeake Bay region is expected to experience an increase in coastal flooding and drowning of estuarine wetlands. The lower Chesapeake Bay is especially at risk due to high rates of sinking land (known as subsidence).82 Climate change and sea level rise are also likely to cause a number of ecological impacts, including declining water quality and clarity, increases in harmful algae and low oxygen (hypoxia) events, decreases in a number of species including eelgrass and seagrass beds, and changing interactions among trophic levels (positions in the food chain) leading to an increase in subtropical fish and shellfish species in the bay.83\n\n381\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f16: NORTHEAST\n\nKey Message 4: Planning and Adaptation\n\nWhile a majority of states and a rapidly growing number of municipalities have begun to incorporate the risk of climate change into their planning activities, implementation of adaptation measures is still at early stages.\n\nOf the 12 states in the Northeast, 11 have developed adapta- Local and state governments in the Northeast have been\n\ntion plans for several sectors and 10 have released, or plan to leaders and incubators in utilizing legal and regulatory oprelease, statewide adaptation plans.84 Given the interconnect- portunities to foster climate change policies.85 The Regional\n\nedness of climate change impacts and adaptation, multi-state Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) was the first market-based\n\ncoordination could help to ensure that information is shared regulatory program in the U.S. aimed at reducing greenhouse\n\nefficiently and that emissions reduction and adaptation strate- gas emissions; it is a cooperative effort among nine northeast-\n\ngies do not operate at cross-purposes.\n\nern states.86 Massachusetts became the first state to officially\n\nincorporate climate change impacts into its environmental\n\nreview procedures by adopting legislation that directs agen-\n\ncies to \"consider reasonably foreseeable climate\n\nConnecticut Coastline and Expanding Salt Marshes\n\nchange impacts, including additional greenhouse\ngas emissions, and effects, such as predicted sea level rise.\"87 In addition, Maine, Massachusetts,\n\nand Rhode Island have each adopted some form\n\nof \"rolling easement\" to ensure that wetlands or\n\ndunes migrate inland as sea level rises and reduce the risk of loss of life and property.45\n\nNortheast cities have employed a variety of mechanisms to respond to climate change, including land-use planning, provisions to protect infrastructure, regulations related to the design and construction of buildings, and emergency preparation, response, and recovery.91 While significant progress has been made, local governments still face limitations of legal authority, geographic jurisdiction, and resource constraints that could be addressed through effective engagement and support from higher levels of government.\n\nFigure 16.7. The Nature Conservancy's adaptation decision-support tool (www.coastalresilience.org)88 depicts building-level impacts due to inundation (developed land cover, yellow areas) and potential marsh advancement zones (undeveloped land cover \u00ad currently forest, grass, and agriculture \u00ad blue areas) using downscaled sea level rise projections (52 inches by 2080s depicted) along the Connecticut and New York coasts. (Figure source: Ferda\u00f1a et al. 2010,90 Beck et al. 201389).\n\nKeene, New Hampshire, has been a pilot community for ICLEI's Climate Resilient Communities program for adaptation planning92 \u00ad a process implemented through innovative community engagement methods.93 The Cape Cod Commission is another example in New England; the Commission has drafted model ordinances to help communities incorporate climate into zoning decision-making. Farther south, New York City has taken numerous steps to implement PlaNYC, a far-reaching sustainability plan for the city, including amending the construction code and the zoning laws and the implementation of measures focused on developing adaptation strategies to protect the City's public and private infrastructure from the effects of climate change;24 some major investments in protection have even been conceptualized.\n\n382\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fStorm Surge Barrier\n\n16: NORTHEAST\n\nFigure 16.8. Conceptual design of a storm surge barrier in New York City. (Figure source: Jansen and Dircke 2009).\n\nOne widely used adaptation-planning template is the eightstep iterative approach developed by the New York City Panel on Climate Change; it was highlighted in the contribution of the National Academy of Science's Adaptation Panel to America's Climate Choices and adopted by the Committee on America's Climate Choices. It describes a procedure that decision-makers at all levels can use to design a flexible adaptation pathway to address infrastructure and other response issues through inventory and assessment of risk. The key, with respect to infrastructure, is to link adaptation strategies with capital improvement cycles and adjustment of plans to incorporate emerging climate projections11,94 \u00ad but the insights are far more general than that (see the Adaptation Panel Report95).\nIn most cases, adaptation requires information and tools coupled to a decision-support process steered by strong leadership, and there are a growing number of examples in the Northeast. At the smaller, municipal scale, coastal pilot projects in Maryland,96 Delaware,97 New York, and Connecticut90 are underway.\nResearch and outreach efforts are underway in the region to help farmers find ways to cope with a rapidly changing climate,\n\ntake advantage of a longer growing season, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,56,98 but unequal access to capital and information for strategic adaptation and mitigation remain a challenge. Financial barriers can constrain farmer adaptation.99 Even relatively straightforward adaptations such as changing varieties are not always a low-cost option. Seed for new stress-tolerant varieties is sometimes expensive or regionally unavailable, and new varieties often require investments in new planting equipment or require adjustment in a wide range of farming practices. Investment in irrigation and drainage systems are relatively expensive options, and a challenge for farmers will be determining when the frequency of yield losses due to summer water deficits or flooding has or will become frequent enough to warrant such capital investments.\nRegional activities in the Northeast are also being linked to federal efforts. For example, NASA's Agency-wide Climate Adaptation Science Investigator Workgroup (CASI) brings together NASA facilities managers with NASA climate scientists in local Climate Resilience Workshops. This approach was in evidence at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, where scientists helped institutional managers address energy and stormwater management vulnerabilities.\n\n383\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f\u00a9Esperanza Stancioff, UMaine Extension and Maine Sea Grant\n\n16: NORTHEAST\nMaine's culverts: an adaptation case study\nCulverts and the structures they protect are receiving increasing attention, since they are vulnerable to damage during the types of extreme precipitation events that are occurring with increasing frequency in the Northeast (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 6; Ch. 5: Transportation). For instance, severe storms in the Northeast that were projected in the 1950s to occur only once in 100 years, now are projected to occur once every 60 years.100\nThe Maine Department of Transportation manages more than 97,000 culverts, but individual property owners or small towns manage even more; Scarborough, Maine, for example, has 2,127 culverts. When 71 town managers and officials in coastal Maine were surveyed as part of the statewide Sustainability Solutions Initiative, culverts, with their 50 to 65\nyear expected lifespan, emerged atop a wish list for help in adapting to climate change.101\nA research initiative that mapped decisions by town managers in Maine to sources of climate information, engineering design, mandated requirements, and calendars identified the complex, multi-jurisdictional challenges of widespread adaptation for even such seemingly simple actions as using larger culverts to carry water from major storms.101 To help towns adapt culverts to expected climate change over their lifetimes, the Sustainability Solutions Initiative is creating decision tools to map culvert locations, schedule maintenance, estimate needed culvert size, and analyze replacement needs and costs.\n\n384\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f16: NORTHEAST\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The workshop was the beginning of the process that led to the foundational Technical Input Report (TIR).2 That 313page report consisted of seven chapters by 13 lead authors and more than 60 authors in total. Public and private citizens or institutions who service and anticipate a role in maintaining support for vulnerable populations in Northeast cities and communities indicated that they are making plans to judge the demand for adaptation services. These stakeholder interactions were surveyed and engaged in the preparation of this chapter. We are confident that the TIR authors made a vigorous attempt to engage various agencies at the state level and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have broader perspectives.\nThe author team engaged in multiple technical discussions via teleconferences, which included careful review of the foundational TIR2 and approximately 50 additional technical inputs provided by the public, as well as the other published literature and professional judgment. Discussions were followed by expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors and targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each key message.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nHeat waves, coastal flooding, and river flooding will pose a growing challenge to the region's environmental, social, and economic systems. This will increase the vulnerability of the region's residents, especially its most disadvantaged populations.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Northeast Technical Input Report.2 Nearly 50 Technical Input reports, on a wide range of topics, were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nNumerous peer-reviewed publications (including many that are not cited) describe increasing hazards associated with sea level rise and storm surge, heat waves, and intense precipitation and river\n\nflooding for the Northeast. For sea level rise (SLR), the authors relied on the NCA SLR scenario12 and research by the authors on the topic (for example, Horton et al. 201051). Recent work26 summarizes the literature on heat islands and extreme events. For a recent study on climate in the Northeast,3 the authors worked closely with the region's state climatologists on both the climatology and projections.\nThe authors also considered many recent peer-reviewed publications29,32,34,44 that describe how human vulnerabilities to climate hazards in the region can be increased by socioeconomic and other factors. Evaluating coupled multi-system vulnerabilities is an emerging field; as a result, additional sources including white papers3 have informed this key message as well.\nTo capture key issues, concerns, and opportunities in the region, various regional assessments were also consulted, such as PlaNYC (http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030) and Boston's Climate Plan (http://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/A%20Climate%20of%20Progress%20-%20CAP%20Update%202011_ tcm3-25020.pdf).\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence (cited above) confirmed many of the findings from a prior Northeast assessment10 (see http://nca2009. globalchange.gov/northeast).\nThe evidence included results from improved models and updated observational data (for example, Liu et al. 2012; Parris et al. 2012; Sallenger et al. 20125,9,12). The current assessment included insights from stakeholders collected in a series of distributed engagement meetings that confirm its relevance and significance for local decision-makers; examples include a Northeast Listening Session in West Virginia, a kickoff meeting in New York City, and New York City Panel on Climate Change meetings.\nThere is wide diversity of impacts across the region driven by both exposure and sensitivity that are location and socioeconomic context specific. Future vulnerability will be influenced by changes in demography, economics, and policies (development and climate driven) that are difficult to predict and dependent on international and national considerations. Another uncertainty is the potential\n\n392\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f16: NORTHEAST Traceable Accounts\n\nfor adaptation strategies (and to a lesser extent mitigation) to reduce these vulnerabilities.\nThere are also uncertainties associated with the character of the interconnections among systems, and the positive and negative synergies. For example, a key uncertainty is how systems will respond during extreme events and how people will adjust their short- to long-term planning to take account of a dynamic climate. Such events are, by definition, manifestations of historically rare and therefore relatively undocumented climatology which represent uncertainty in the exposure to climate risk. Nonetheless, these events are correlated, when considered holistically, with climate change driven to some degree by human interference with the climate system. There are uncertainties in exposure.\nThere are also uncertainties associated with sensitivity to future changes driven to some (potentially significant) degree by non-climate stressors, including background health of the human population and development decisions. Other uncertainties include how much effort will be put into making systems more resilient and the success of these efforts. Another critical uncertainty is associated with the climate system itself.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is:\nVery high for sea level rise and coastal flooding as well as heat waves.\n\nHigh for intense precipitation events and riverine flooding.\nVery high for both added stresses on environmental, social, and economic systems and for increased vulnerability, especially for populations that are already most disadvantaged.\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nInfrastructure will be increasingly compromised by climaterelated hazards, including sea level rise, coastal flooding, and intense precipitation events.\nDescription of evidence base The key message summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Northeast Technical Input Report (TIR).2 Technical Input reports (48) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nTo capture key issues, concerns and opportunities in the region, various regional assessments were also consulted, such as PlaNYC (http://www.nyc.gov/html/planyc2030) and Boston's Climate Plan (http://www.cityofboston.gov/Images_Documents/A%20Climate%20of%20Progress%20-%20CAP%20Update%202011_ tcm3-25020.pdf).\nIn addition, a report by the U.S. Department of Transportation47 provided extensive documentation that augmented an NGO report.102 Other sources that support this key message include Horton and Rosenzweig, 2010, Rosenzweig et al. 2011, and Zimmerman and Faris, 2010.23,51,52\n\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent\nresults, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods\nvary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence (cited above) confirmed many of the findings from the prior Northeast assessment: (http://nca2009.globalchange.gov/northeast) which informed the prior NCA.10\nThe new sources above relied on improved models that have been calibrated to new observational data across the region.\nIt is important to note, of course, that there is wide diversity across the region because both exposure and sensitivity are location- and socioeconomic-context-specific. The wisdom derived from many previous assessments by the National Academy of Sciences, the New York Panel on Climate Change, and the 2009 National Climate Assessment10,11,95 indicates that future vulnerability at any specific location will be influenced by changes in demography, economics, and policy. These changes are difficult to predict at local scales even as they also depend on international and national considerations. The potential for adaptation strategies (and to a lesser extent mitigation) to reduce these vulnerabilities is yet another source of uncertainty that expands as the future moves into the middle of this century.\n\n393\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f16: NORTHEAST Traceable Accounts\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence We have very high confidence in projected sea level rise and increased coastal flooding, and high confidence for increased intense precipitation events. This assessment of confidence is based on our review of the literature and submitted input and has been defended internally and externally in conversation with local decision-makers and representatives of interested NGOs, as well as the extensive interactions with stakeholders across the region reported in the Northeast TIR.2\nVery high confidence that infrastructure will be increasingly compromised, based on the clear evidence of impacts on current infrastructure from hazards such as Hurricane Irene, and from the huge deficit of needed renewal identified by a diverse engineering community.46\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nAgriculture, fisheries, and ecosystems will be increasingly compromised over the next century by climate change impacts. Farmers can explore new crop options, but these adaptations are not cost- or risk-free. Moreover, adaptive capacity, which varies throughout the region, could be overwhelmed by a changing climate.\nDescription of evidence base The key message summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Northeast Technical Input Report.2 Technical Input reports (48) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input. The Traceable Account for Key Message 1 provides the evidence base on sea level rise, flooding, and precipitation.\nVarious regional assessments were also consulted to capture key issues, concerns and opportunities in the region with particular focus on managed (agriculture and fisheries) and unmanaged (ecosystems) systems (for example, Buonaiuto et al. 2011; Wolfe et al. 201156,70,78).\nSpecies and ecosystem vulnerability have been well documented historically in numerous peer-reviewed papers in addition to the ones cited in the TIR.2 There have also been many examples of impacts on agriculture of climate variability and change in the Northeast (for example, Wolfe et al. 200857). Most note that there is potential for significant benefits associated with climate changes to partially offset expected negative outcomes for these managed systems (for example, Hatfield et al. 201154)\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence (cited above, plus Najjar et. al. 2010,83 for example) confirmed many of the findings from the prior Northeast assessment (http://nca2009.globalchange.gov/northeast) which informed the 2009 NCA.10\n\nThese new sources also relied on improved models that have been calibrated to new observational data across the region.\nAgriculture, fisheries, and ecosystems in the Northeast are strongly linked to climate change and to other changes occurring outside the region and beyond the boundaries of the United States. These changes can influence the price of crops and agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, for example, as well as the abundance of ecosystem and agricultural pests and the abundance and range of fish stocks. Other uncertainties include imprecise understandings of how complex ecosystems will respond to climate- and nonclimate-induced changes and the extent to which organisms may be able to adapt to a changing climate.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Based on our assessment, we have very high confidence for climate impacts (especially sea level rise and storm surge) on ecosystems; and we have high confidence for climate impacts on agriculture (reduced to some degree, compared to our level of confidence about ecosystems, by uncertainty about the efficacy and implementation of adaptation options). Confidence in fisheries changes is high since confidence in both ocean warming and fish sensitivity to temperature is high.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nWhile a majority of states and a rapidly growing number of municipalities have begun to incorporate the risk of climate change into their planning activities, implementation of adaptation measures is still at early stages.\nDescription of evidence base The key message relies heavily on extensive evidence documented in the Northeast Technical Input Report (TIR).2 Technical Input reports (48) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input. Many of the key references cited in the TIR reflected experiences and processes developed in iterative stakeholder engagement concerning risk management94,103 that have been heavily cited and employed in new venues \u00ad local communities like Keane (NH) and New York City, for example.\nVarious regional assessments were also consulted to capture key issues, concerns and opportunities in the region (for example, for Delaware, Maine, Maryland, and Long Island, NY). In addition, there have been agency and government white paper reports describing proposed adaptation strategies based on climate impact assessments.11,90 We discovered that 10 of the 12 states in the Northeast have statewide adaptation plans in place or under development (many plans can be found at: http://georgetownclimate. org/node/3324).\n\n394\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fNew information and remaining uncertainties That most Northeast states have begun to plan for adaptation is a matter of record. That few adaptation plans have been implemented is confirmed in Technical Inputs submitted to the National Climate Assessment process as well as prior assessments (http:// nca2009.globalchange.gov/northeast), which informed the 2009 NCA.10\nKey uncertainties looking forward include: 1) the extent to which proposed adaptation strategies will be implemented given a range of factors including competing demands and limited funding; 2) the role of the private sector and individual action in adaptation, roles which can be difficult to document; 3) the extent of the federal role in adaptation planning and implementation; and 4) how changes in technology and the world economy may change the feasibility of specific adaptation strategies.11\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence This Key Message is simply a statement of observed fact, so confidence language is not applicable.\n\n16: NORTHEAST Traceable Accounts\n\n395\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 17 SOUTHEAST AND THE CARIBBEAN\nConvening Lead Authors\nLynne M.

Sea level rise poses widespread and continuing threats to both natural and built environments  and to the regional economy.\n2. Increasing temperatures and the associated increase in frequency, intensity, and duration of  extreme heat events will affect public health, natural and built environments, energy, agriculture, and forestry.\n3. Decreased water availability, exacerbated by population growth and land-use change, will  continue to increase competition for water and affect the region's economy and unique ecosystems.\n\nThe Southeast and Caribbean are exceptionally vulnerable to\nsea level rise, extreme heat events, hurricanes, and decreased\nwater availability. The geographic distribution of these impacts\nand vulnerabilities is uneven, since the region encompasses\na wide range of natural system types, from the Appalachian\nMountains to the coastal plains.

This map summarizes the number of times each state has been affected by weather and climate events over the past 30 years that have resulted in more than a billion dollars in damages. The Southeast has been affected by more billion-dollar disasters than any other region. The primary disaster type for coastal states such as Florida is hurricanes, while interior and northern states in the region also experience sizeable numbers of tornadoes and winter storms.

Four Native communities in Southeast\n\nLouisiana (Grand Bayou Village, Grand Cail-\n\nlou/Dulac, Isle de Jean Charles, and Pointe-\n\nau-Chien) have already experienced significant\n\nland loss. Management of river flow has de-\n\nprived the coastal wetlands of the freshwater\n\nand sediment that they need to replenish and\n\npersist. Dredging of canals through marshes for\n\noil and gas exploration and pipelines has led to erosion and intense saltwater intrusion, resulting in additional land loss. Due to these and other natural and man-made problems, Louisiana has lost 1,880 square miles of land in the last 80 years.8 This combination of changes has resulted in a cascade of losses of sacred places, healing plants, habitat for important wildlife, food security,9 and in some cases connectivity\n\nFigure 17.2. Aerial photos of Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana taken 45 years apart shows evidence of the effects of rising seas, sinking land, and human development. The wetlands adjacent to the Isle de Jean Charles community (about 60 miles south of New Orleans) have been disappearing rapidly since the photo on the left was taken in 1963. By 2008, after four major hurricanes, significant erosion, and alteration of the surrounding marsh for oil and gas extraction, open water surrounds the greatly reduced dry land.

Additional impacts include\n\nincreased inundation of native lands, further travel to reach traditional fishing grounds, reduced connections among\n\nfamily members as their lands have become more flood-prone and some have had to move, and declining community cohesiveness as heat requires more indoor time.10 (For more specifics, see Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples). Numerous\n\nother impacts from increases in temperature, sea level rise, land loss, erosion, subsidence, and saltwater intrusion\n\namplify these existing problems.\n\nand the Gulf of Mexico. Temperatures generally decrease northward and into mountain areas, while precipitation decreases with distance from the Gulf and Atlantic coasts. The region's climate also varies considerably over seasons, years, and decades, largely due to natural cycles such as the El NinoSouthern Oscillation (ENSO \u00ad periodic changes in ocean surface temperatures in the Tropical Pacific Ocean), the semi-permanent high pressure system over Bermuda, differences in\n\natmospheric pressure over key areas of the globe, and landfalling tropical weather systems.7 These cycles alter the occurrences of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, flooding, freezing winters, and ice storms, contributing to climate and weather disasters in the region that have exceeded the total number of billion dollar disasters experienced in all other regions of the country combined (see Figure 17.1).\n\nObserved and Projected Climate Change\nAverage annual temperature during the last century across the intensities have also increased.5 Also, summers have been eiSoutheast cycled between warm and cool periods (see Figure ther increasingly dry or extremely wet.11 For the Caribbean,\n17.3, black line).

The projections were referenced to observed temperatures for the period 1901-1960. The region warmed during the early part of last century, cooled for a few decades, and is now warming again.

Regional average increases are in the range of 4\u00b0F to 8\u00b0F (combined 25th to 75th percentile range for A2 and B1 emissions\nscenarios) and 2\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F for Puerto Rico.11\n\nProjected Change in Number of Days Over 95\u00b0F\nFigure 17.4. Projected average number of days per year with maximum temperatures above 95\u00b0F for 2041-2070 compared to 1971-2000, assuming emissions continue to grow (A2 scenario). Patterns are similar, but less pronounced, assuming a reduced emissions scenario (B1). (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nProjections of future precipitation patterns are less certain than projections for temperature increases.11 Because the Southeast is located in the transition zone between projected wetter conditions to the north and drier conditions to the southwest, many of the model projections show only small changes relative to natural variations. However, many models do project drier conditions in the far southwest of the region and wetter conditions in the far northeast of the region, consistent with the larger continental-scale pattern of wetness and dryness (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 5).11 For the Caribbean, it is equally difficult to project the magnitude of precipitation changes, although the majority of models show future decreases in precipitation are likely, with a few areas showing increases. In general, annual average decreases are likely to be spread across the entire region.4 Projections further suggest that warming will cause tropical storms to be fewer in number globally, but stronger in force, with more Category 4 and 5 storms (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 8).13 On top of the large increases in extreme precipitation observed during last century and early this century (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figures 2.16, 2.17, and 2.18), substantial further increases are projected as this century progresses (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figure 2.19).\n\n399\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f17: SOUTHEAST AND THE CARIBBEAN\nProjected Change in Number of Nights Below 32\u00b0F\n\nFigure 17.5.

Patterns are similar, but less pronounced, assuming a reduced emissions scenario (B1). (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nKey Message 1: Sea Level Rise Threats\n\nSea level rise poses widespread and continuing threats to both natural and built environments and to the regional economy.\n\nGlobal sea level rise over the past century averaged approximately eight inches (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10),14,15 and that rate is expected to accelerate through the end of this century.16 Portions of the Southeast and Caribbean are highly vulnerable to sea level rise.4,5 How much sea level rise is experienced in any particular place depends on whether and how much the local land is sinking (also called subsidence) or rising, and changes in offshore currents.16,17\nLarge numbers of cities, roads, railways, ports, airports, oil and gas facilities, and water supplies are at low elevations and potentially vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise. New Orleans (with roughly half of its population living below sea level19), Miami, Tampa, Charleston, and Virginia Beach are among those most at risk.20 As a result of current sea level rise, the coastline of Puerto Rico around Rinc\u00f3n is being eroded at a rate of 3.3 feet per year.4\n\nAccording to a recent study co-sponsored by a regional utility, coastal counties and parishes in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, with a population of approximately 12 million, assets of about $2 trillion, and producers of $634 billion in annual gross domestic product, already face significant losses that annually average $14 billion from hurricane winds, land subsidence, and sea level rise. Future losses for the 2030 timeframe could reach $18 billion (with no sea level rise or change in hurricane wind speed) to $23 billion (with a nearly 3% increase in hurricane wind speed and just under 6 inches of sea level rise). Approximately 50% of the increase in the estimated losses is related to climate change. The study identified $7 billion in cost-effective adaptation investments that could reduce estimated annual losses by about 30% in the 2030 timeframe.21\nThe North Carolina Department of Transportation is raising the roadbed of U.S. Highway 64 across the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula by four feet, which includes 18 inches to allow for high-\n\n400\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f17: SOUTHEAST AND THE CARIBBEAN\n\nVulnerability to Sea Level Rise\n\nproblems are already being experienced in many locations during seasonal high tides, heavy rains, and storm surge events. Adaptation options that are being assessed in this region include the redesign and improvement of storm drainage canals, flood control structures, and stormwater pumps.\n\nAs temperatures and sea levels increase, changes in marine and coastal systems are expected to affect the potential for energy resource development in coastal zones and the outer continental shelf. Oil and gas production infrastructure in bays and coves that are protected by barrier islands, for example, are likely to become increasingly vulnerable to storm surge as sea level rises and barrier islands deteriorate along the central Gulf Coast. The capacity for expanding and maintaining onshore and offshore support facilities and transportation networks is also apt to be affected.25\n\nSea level rise and storm surge can have impacts far\n\nFigure 17.6. The map shows the relative risk that physical changes will occur as sea level rises. The Coastal Vulnerability Index used here is calculated based on tidal range, wave height, coastal slope, shoreline change, landform and processes, and historical rate of relative sea level rise. The approach combines a coastal system's susceptibility to change with its natural ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, and yields a relative measure of the system's natural vulnerability to the effects of sea level rise. (Data from Hammar-Klose and Thieler 200118).\n\nbeyond the area directly affected. Homes and infrastructure in low areas are increasingly prone to flooding during tropical storms. As a result, insurance costs may increase or coverage may become unavailable26 and people may move from vulnerable areas, stressing the social and infrastructural capacity of surrounding areas. This migration also\n\nhappens in response to extreme events such as\n\nHurricane Katrina, when more than 200,000 mier future sea levels.22 Louisiana State Highway 1, heavily used grants were temporarily housed in Houston and 42% indicated\n\nfor delivering critical oil and gas resources from Port Fourchon,\nis literally sinking, resulting in more frequent and more severe flooding during high tides and storms.8 The Department\n\nthey would try to remain there (Ch. 9: Human Health, Figure 9.10).27\n\nof Homeland Security estimated that a 90-day shutdown of this road would cost the nation $7.8 billion.23\n\nSea level rise increases pressure on utilities \u00ad such as water and energy \u00ad by contaminating potential freshwater supplies with saltwater. Such problems are amplified during extreme dry periods with little runoff. Uncertainties in the scale, timing, and location of climate change impacts can make decision-making difficult, but response strategies, especially those that try to anticipate possible unintended consequences, can be more effective with early planning. Some utilities in the region are already taking sea level rise into account in the construction of new facilities and are seeking to diversify their water sources.24\n\nThere is an imminent threat of increased inland\nflooding during heavy rain events in low-lying coastal\nareas such as southeast Florida, where just inches of\nsea level rise will impair the capacity of stormwater drainage systems to empty into the ocean.24 Drainage\n\nHomes and infrastructure in low-lying areas are increasingly vulnerable to flooding due to storm surge as sea level rises.\n\n401\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f17: SOUTHEAST AND THE CARIBBEAN\n\nHighway 1 to Port Fourchon: Vulnerability of a Critical Link for U.S. Oil\n\nReduction of wetlands also increases the potential for losses of important fishery habitat. Additionally, ocean warming could support shifts in local species composition, invasive or new locally viable species, changes in species growth rates, shifts in migratory patterns or dates, and alterations to spawning seasons.4,31 Any of these could affect the local or regional seafood output and thus the local economy.\n\nIn some southeastern coastal areas, changes in salinity and water levels due to a number of complex interactions (including subsidence, availability of sediment, precipitation, and sea level rise) can happen so fast that local vegetation cannot adapt quickly enough and those areas become open water.32 Fire, hurricanes, and other disturbances have similar effects, causing ecosystems to cross thresholds at which dramatic changes occur over short time frames.33\n\nThe impacts of sea level rise on agricul-\n\nture derive from decreased freshwater\n\navailability, land loss, and saltwater in-\n\nFigure 17.7.

Sea level rise presents major challenges to South Florida's existing coastal water management system due to a combination of increasingly urbanized areas, aging flood control facilities, flat topography, and porous limestone aquifers. For instance, South Florida's freshwater well field protection areas (left map: pink areas) lie close to the current interface between saltwater and freshwater (red line), which will shift inland with rising sea level, affecting water managers' ability to draw drinking water from current resources. Coastal water control structures (right map: yellow circles) that were originally built about 60 years ago at the ends of drainage canals to keep saltwater out and to provide flood protection to urbanized areas along the coast are now threatened by sea level rise. Even today, residents in some areas such as Miami Beach are experiencing seawater flooding their streets (lower photo). (Maps from The South Florida Water Management District.36 Photo credit: Luis Espinoza, Miami-Dade County Department of Regulatory and Economic Resources).\n\nKey Message 2: Increasing Temperatures\n\nIncreasing temperatures and the associated increase in frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat events will affect public health,\nnatural and built environments, energy, agriculture, and forestry.\n\nThe negative effects of heat on human cardiovascular, cere-\nbral, and respiratory systems are well established (Ch. 9: Hu-\nman Health)(for example: Kovats and Hajat 2008; O'Neill and Ebi 200938). Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, and Tampa have al-\nready had increases in the number of days with temperatures\nexceeding 95\u00b0F, during which the number of deaths is above average.39 Higher temperatures also contribute to the formation of harmful air pollutants and allergens.40 Ground-level\nozone is projected to increase in the 19 largest urban areas of the Southeast, leading to an increase in deaths.41 A rise in hos-\npital admissions due to respiratory illnesses, emergency room visits for asthma, and lost school days is expected.42\n\nLocal Planning\n\nThe climate in many parts of the Southeast and Caribbean is\nsuitable for mosquitoes carrying malaria and yellow and den-\ngue fevers. The small island states in the Caribbean already\nhave a high health burden from climate-sensitive disease, in-\ncluding vector-borne and zoonotic (animal to human) diseases.43 It is still uncertain how regional climate changes will affect\nvector-borne and zoonotic disease transmissions. While higher\ntemperatures are likely to shorten both development and incubation time,44 vectors (like disease-carrying insects) also need\n\nFigure 17.9.

Ground-level ozone is an air pollutant that is harmful to human health and which generally increases with rising temperatures. The map shows projected changes in average annual ground level ozone pollution concentration in 2050 as compared to 2001, using a mid-range emissions scenario (A1B, which assumes gradual reductions from current emissions trends beginning around mid-century). (Figure source: adapted from Tagaris et al. 200942).\nthe right conditions for breeding (water), for dispersal (vegetation and humidity), and access to susceptible vertebrate hosts to complete the disease transmission cycle.5 While these transmission cycles are complex, increasing temperatures have the potential to result in an expanded region with more favorable conditions for transmission of these diseases.45,46\nClimate change is expected to increase harmful algal blooms and several disease-causing agents in inland and coastal waters, which were not previously problems in the region.47,48,49 For instance, higher sea surface temperatures are associated with higher rates of ciguatera fish poisoning,48,50 one of the most common hazards from algal blooms in the region.51 The algae that causes this food-borne illness is moving northward, following increasing sea surface temperatures.52 Certain species of bacteria (Vibrio, for example) that grow in warm coastal waters and are present in Gulf Coast shellfish can cause infections in humans. Infections are now frequently reported both earlier and later by one month than traditionally observed.53\nCoral reefs in the Southeast and Caribbean, as well as worldwide, are susceptible to climate change, especially warming waters and ocean acidification, whose impacts are exacerbated when coupled with other stressors, including disease, runoff, over-exploitation, and invasive species.4,5\n\nSummer heat stress is projected to reduce crop productivity, especially when coupled with increased drought (Ch. 6: Agriculture). The 2007 drought cost the Georgia agriculture industry $339 million in crop losses,59 and the 2002 drought cost the agricultural industry in North Carolina $398 million.5 A 2.2\u00baF increase in temperature would likely reduce overall productivity for corn, soybeans, rice, cotton, and peanuts across the South \u00ad though rising CO2 levels could partially offset these decreases based on a crop yield simulation model.60 In Georgia, climate projections indicate corn yields could decline by 15% and wheat yields by 20% through 2020.61 In addition, many fruit crops from long-lived trees and bushes require chilling periods and may need to be replaced in a warming climate.60\nAdaptation for agriculture involves decisions at many scales, from infrastructure investments (like reservoirs) to management decisions (like cropping patterns).62 Dominant adaptation strategies include altering local planting choices to better match new climate conditions62 and developing heat-tolerant crop varieties and breeds of livestock.5,57 Most critical for effective adaptation is the delivery of climate risk information to decision-makers at appropriate temporal and spatial scales57,62 and a focus on cropping systems that increase water-use efficiency, shifts toward irrigation, and more precise control of irrigation delivery (see also Ch. 28: Adaptation, Table 28.6).5,57\nThe southeastern U.S. (data include Texas and Oklahoma, not Puerto Rico) leads the nation in number of wildfires, averaging 45,000 fires per year,63 and this number continues to increase.64,65 Increasing temperatures contribute to increased fire frequency, intensity, and size,63 though at some level of fire frequency, increased fire frequency would lead to decreased fire intensity. Lightning is a frequent initiator of wildfires,66 and the Southeast currently has the greatest frequency of lightning strikes of any region of the country.67 Increasing temperatures and changing atmospheric patterns may affect the number of lightning strikes in the Southeast, which could influence air quality, direct injury, and wildfires. Drought often correlates with large wildfire events, as seen with the Okeefenokee (2007) and Florida fires (1998). The 1998 Florida fires led to\n\n404\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f17: SOUTHEAST AND THE CARIBBEAN\n\nlosses of more than $600 million.68 Wildfires also affect human health through reduced air quality and direct injuries.68,69,70 Expanding population and associated land-use fragmentation will limit the application of prescribed burning, a useful adaptive strategy.65 Growth management could enhance the ability to pursue future adaptive management of forest fuels.\nForest disturbances caused by insects and pathogens are altered by climate changes due to factors such as increased tree stress, shifting phenology, and altered insect and pathogen lifecycles.71 Current knowledge provides limited insights into specific impacts on epidemics, associated tree growth and mortality, and economic loss in the Southeast, though the overall extent and virulence of some insects and pathogens have been on the rise (for example, Hemlock Woolly Adelgid in the Southern Appalachians), while recent declines in southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmerman) epidemics in Louisiana and East Texas have been attributed to rising temperatures.72 Due to southern forests' vast size and the high cost of management options, adaptation strategies are limited, except through post-epidemic management responses \u00ad for example, sanitation cuts and species replacement.\n\nThe Southeast has the existing power plant capacity to produce 32% of the nation's electricity.73 Energy use is approximately 27% of the U.S. total, more than any other region.5 Net energy demand is projected to increase, largely due to higher temperatures and increased use of air conditioning. This will potentially stress electricity generating capacity, distribution infrastructure, and energy costs. Energy costs are of particular concern for lower income households, the elderly, and other vulnerable communities, such as native tribes.5,10 Long periods of extreme heat could also damage roadways by softening asphalt and cause deformities of railroad tracks, bridge joints, and other transportation infrastructure.74\nIncreasing temperatures will affect many facets of life in the Southeast and Caribbean region. For each impact there could be many possible responses. Many adaptation responses are described in other chapters in this document. For examples, please see the sector chapter of interest and Ch. 28: Adaptation.\n\nKey Message 3: Water Availability\n\nDecreased water availability, exacerbated by population growth and land-use change, will continue to increase competition for water and affect the region's economy and unique ecosystems.\n\nWater resources in the Southeast are abundant and support heavily populated urban areas, rural communities, unique ecosystems, and economies based on agriculture, energy, and tourism. The region also experiences extensive droughts, such as the 2007 drought in Atlanta, Georgia, that created water conflicts among three states.11,75 In northwestern Puerto Rico, water was rationed for more than 200,000 people during the winter and spring of 1997-1998 because of low reservoir levels.76 Droughts are one of the most frequent climate hazards in the Caribbean, resulting in economic losses.77 Water supply and demand in the Southeast and Caribbean are influenced by many changing factors, including climate (for example, temperature increases that contribute to increased transpiration from plants and evaporation from soils and water bodies), population, and land use.4,5 While change in projected precipitation for this region has high uncertainty (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate), there is still a reasonable expectation that there will be reduced water availability due to the increased evaporative losses resulting from rising temperatures alone.\nWith projected increases in population, the conversion of rural areas, forestlands, and wetlands into residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural zones is expected to intensify.54 The continued development of urbanized areas will increase water demand, exacerbate saltwater intrusion into freshwater aqui-\n\nfers, and threaten environmentally sensitive wetlands bordering urban areas.24\nAdditionally, higher sea levels will accelerate saltwater intrusion into freshwater supplies from rivers, streams, and groundwater sources near the coast. The region's aquaculture industry also may be compromised by climate-related stresses on groundwater quality and quantity.78 Porous aquifers in some areas make them particularly vulnerable to saltwater intrusion.36,79 For example, officials in the city of Hallandale Beach, Florida, have already abandoned six of their eight drinking water wells.80\nWith increasing demand for food and rising food prices, irrigated agriculture will expand in some states. Also, population expansion in the region is expected to increase domestic water demand. Such increases in water demand by the energy, agricultural, and urban sectors will increase the competition for water, particularly in situations where environmental water needs conflict with other uses.5\nAs seen from Figure 17.11, the net water supply availability in the Southeast is expected to decline over the next several decades, particularly in the western part of the region.82 Analysis of current and future water resources in the Caribbean shows\n\n405\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f17: SOUTHEAST AND THE CARIBBEAN\nTrends in Water Availability\n\nFigure 17.11. Left: Projected trend in Southeast-wide annual water yield (equivalent to water availability) due to climate change. The green area represents the range in predicted water yield from four climate model projections based on the A1B and B2 emissions scenarios. Right: Spatial pattern of change in water yield for 2010-2060 (decadal trend relative to 2010). The hatched areas are those where the predicted negative trend in water availability associated with the range of climate scenarios is statistically significant (with 95% confidence). As shown on the map, the western part of the Southeast region is expected to see the largest reductions in water availability. (Figure source: adapted from Sun et al. 201382).\n\nmany of the small islands would be exposed to severe water in temperature and precipitation, which ultimately affect\n\nstress under all climate change scenarios.83\n\nwater availability. Changes in land use and land cover, more\n\nrapid in the Southeast and Caribbean than most other areas\n\nNew freshwater well fields may have to be established inland of the country, often interact with and serve to amplify the\n\nto replenish water supply lost from existing wells closer to the effects of climate change on regional ecosystems.\n\nocean once they are compromised by salt-\n\nA Southeast River Basin\n\nwater intrusion. Pro-\n\nUnder Stress\n\ngrams to increase wa-\n\nter-use efficiency, reuse of wastewater, and water storage capacity are options that can help alleviate water supply stress.\n\nFigure 17.12. The Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin in Georgia exemplifies a place where many water uses are in conflict, and future climate change is expected to exacerbate this conflict.84 The basin drains 19,600 square miles in three states and supplies water for\n\nmultiple, often competing, uses, including\n\nThe Southeast and Caribbean, which has a disproportionate number of the fastest-growing metropolitan ar-\n\nirrigation, drinking water and other municipal uses, power plant cooling, navigation, hydropower, recreation, and ecosystems. Under future climate change, this basin is likely to experience more severe water supply shortages, more frequent emptying\n\neas in the country and important economic sectors located in lowlying coastal areas, is particularly vulnerable to some of the expected impacts of climate change. The most severe and widespread impacts are likely to be associated with sea\n\nof reservoirs, violation of environmental flow requirements (with possible impacts to fisheries at the mouth of the Apalachicola), less energy generation, and more competition for remaining water. Adaptation options include changes in reservoir storage and release procedures and possible phased expansion of reservoir capacity.84,85 Additional adaptation options could include water conservation and demand management. (Figure source: Georgakakos et al. 201084).\n\nlevel rise and changes\n\n406\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fWater recycling\nBecause of Clayton County, Georgia's, innovative water recycling project during the 2007-2008 drought, they were able to maintain reservoirs at near capacity and an abundant supply of water while neighboring Lake Lanier, the water supply for Atlanta, was at record lows. Clayton County developed a series of constructed wetlands used to filter treated water that recharges groundwater and supplies surface reservoirs. They have also implemented efficiency and leak detection programs81 (for additional specific information see the Clayton County Water Authority website at: http://www.ccwa.us/).\n\n17: SOUTHEAST AND THE CARIBBEAN\n\n\u00a9Clayton County Water Authority\n\n407\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f17: SOUTHEAST AND THE CARIBBEAN\nReferences\n\n1.

This workshop began the process leading to a foundational Technical Input Report (TIR). That 341-page foundational \"Southeast Region Technical Report to the National Climate Assessment\"5 comprised 14 chapters from over 100 authors, including all levels of government, non-governmental organizations, and business.\nThe writing team held a 2-day meeting in April 2012 in Ft. Lauderdale, engaged in multiple teleconference and webinar technical discussions, which included careful review of the foundational TIR,5 nearly 60 additional technical inputs provided by the public, and other published literature and professional judgment. Discussions were followed by expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors, and targeted consultation with additional experts by the Southeast chapter writing team and lead author of each key message.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nSea level rise poses widespread and continuing threats to both natural and built environments and to the regional economy.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Southeast Technical Input Report.5 A total of 57 technical inputs on a wide range of southeast-relevant topics (including sea level rise) were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nEvidence that the rate of sea level rise has increased is based on satellite altimetry data and direct measurements such as tide gauges (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10). Numerous peer-reviewed publications describe increasing hazards associated with sea level rise and storm surge, heat waves, and intense precipitation for the Southeast.5 For sea level rise, the authors relied on the NCA Sea Level Change Scenario16 and detailed discussion in the foundational TIR.5\n\nEvidence that sea level rise is a threat to natural and human environments is documented in detail within the foundational TIR5 and other technical inputs, as well as considerable peer-reviewed literature (for example, Campanella 2010).19 Field studies document examples of areas that are being flooded more regularly, saltwater intrusion into fresh water wells,80 and changes from fresh to saltwater in coastal ecosystems (for example, freshwater marshes) causing them to die,32 and increases in vulnerability of many communities to coastal erosion. Economic impacts are seen in the cost to avoid flooded roads, buildings, and ports;23 the need to drill new fresh water wells;80 and the loss of coastal ecosystems and their storm surge protection.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Tremendous improvement has been made since the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change evaluation of sea level rise in 2007,86 with strong evidence of mass loss of Greenland icecap and glaciers worldwide (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). Improved analyses of tide gauges, coastal elevations, and circulation changes in offshore waters have also provided new information on accelerating rates of rise (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figure 2.26). These have been documented in the NCA Sea Level Change Scenario publication.16\nUncertainties in the rate of sea level rise through this century stems from a combination of large differences in projections among different climate models, natural climate variability, uncertainties in the melting of land-based glaciers and the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets especially, and uncertainties about future rates of fossil fuel emissions. A further key uncertainty is the rate of vertical land movement at specific locations. The two factors \u00ad sea level rise and subsidence \u00ad when combined, increase the impact of global sea level rise in any specific area. A third area of uncertainty is where and what adaptive plans and actions are being undertaken to avoid flooding and associated impacts on people, communities, facilities, infrastructure, and ecosystems.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Sea level is expected to continue to rise for several centuries, even if greenhouse gas emissions are stabilized, due to the time it takes for the ocean to absorb heat energy from the atmosphere. Because sea levels determine the locations of human activities and\n\n414\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f17: SOUTHEAST AND THE CARIBBEAN Traceable Accounts\n\necosystems along the coasts, increases in sea level and in the rate of rise will nearly certainly have substantial impacts on natural and human systems along the coastal area. What specific locations will be impacted under what specific levels of sea level rise needs to be determined location-by-location. However, given that many locations are already being affected by rising seas, more and more locations will be impacted as sea levels continue to rise. Confidence in this key message is therefore judged to be very high.\n\nogy and projections for temperature and associated heat events. Evidence of rising temperatures and current impacts38,39 is based on an extensive set of field measurements.\nThere is considerable evidence of the effects of high air temperatures across a wide range of natural and managed systems in the Southeast.

Heat stress reduces dairy and livestock production56 and also reduces yields of various crops grown in this region (corn, soybean, peanuts, rice, and cotton).60,61\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Since 2007, studies on impacts of higher temperatures have increased in many areas. Most of the publications cited above concluded that increasing temperatures in the Southeast will result in negative impacts on human health, the natural and built environments, energy, agriculture, and forestry.\n\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nIncreasing temperatures and the associated increase in frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme heat events will affect public health, natural and built environments, energy, agriculture, and forestry.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Southeast Technical Input Report.5 Technical inputs (57) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nA key issue (uncertainty) is the detailed mechanistic responses, including adaptive capacities and/or resilience, of natural and built environments, the public health system, energy systems, agriculture, and forests to increasing temperatures and extreme heat events.\nAnother uncertainty is how combinations of stresses, for example lack of water in addition to extreme heat, will affect outcomes. There is a need for more monitoring to document the extent and location of vulnerable areas (natural and human), and then research to assess how those impacts will affect productivity of key food and forest resources and human well-being. There is also a need for research that develops or identifies more resilient, adapted systems.\n\nNumerous peer-reviewed publications describe increasing hazards\nassociated with heat events and rising temperatures for the Southeast.

Projections for increases in temperature are more certain in the Southeast than projections of changes in precipitation.\nImpacts of increasing temperatures: Rising temperatures and the substantial increase in duration of high temperatures (for either the low [B1] or high [A2] emissions scenarios) above critical thresholds will have significant impacts on the population, agricultural industries, and ecosystems in the region. There is high confidence in documentation that increases in temperature in the Southeast will result in higher risks of negative impacts on human health, agricultural, and forest production; on natural systems; on the built environment; and on energy demand. There is lower confidence in the magnitude of these impacts, partly due to lack of information on how these systems will adapt (without human intervention) or be adapted (by people) to higher temperatures, and partly due to the limited knowledge base on the wide diversity that exists across this region in climates and human and natural systems.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nDecreased water availability, exacerbated by population growth and land-use change, will continue to increase competition for water and affect the region's economy and unique ecosystems.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Southeast Technical Input Report (TIR).5 Technical inputs (57) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nChapter 2, Our Changing Climate, describes evidence for drought and precipitation in its key messages. Numerous salient studies support the key message of decreased water availability, as summarized for the Southeast in the TIR.5\nEvidence for the impacts on the region's economy and unique ecosystems is also detailed in the TIR5 and the broader literature surveyed by the authors.77\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Many studies have been published since 2007 documenting increasing demands for water in the Southeast due to increases in populations and irrigated agriculture, in addition to water shortages due to extensive droughts.5,11 There is also new evidence of losses in fresh water wells near coastlines due to saltwater intrusion79,80 and of continuing conflicts among states for water use, particularly during drought periods.5,84\n\nIt is a virtual certainty that population growth in the Southeast will continue in the future and will be accompanied by a significant change in patterns of land use, which is projected to include a larger fraction of urbanized areas, reduced agricultural areas, and reduced forest cover.54 With increasing population and human demand, competition for water among the agriculture, urban, and environment sectors is projected to continue to increase. However, the projected population increases for the lower (B1) versus higher (A2) emissions scenarios differ significantly (33% versus 151%).11 Consequently, the effect of climate change on urban water demand for the lower emissions scenario is projected to be much lower than for that of the higher emissions scenario. Land-use change will also alter the regional hydrology significantly. Unless measures are adopted to increase water storage, availability of freshwater during dry periods will decrease, partly due to drainage and other human activities.\nProjected increase in temperature will increase evaporation, and in areas (the western part of the region87) where precipitation is projected to decrease in response to climate change, the net amount of water supply for human and environmental uses may decrease significantly.\nAlong the coastline of the Southeast, accelerated intrusion of saltwater due to sea level rise will impact both freshwater well fields and potentially freshwater intakes in rivers and streams connected to the ocean. Although sea level rise (SLR) corresponding to the higher emissions scenario is much higher (twice as much), even the SLR for the lower emissions scenario will increasingly impact water supply availability in low-lying areas of the region, as these areas are already being impacted by SLR and land subsidence.\nProjections of specific spatial and temporal changes in precipitation in the Southeast remain highly uncertain and it is important to know with a reasonable confidence the sign and the magnitude of this change in various parts of the large Southeast region.\nFor the Southeast, there are no reliable projections of evapotranspiration, another major factor that determines water yield. This adds to uncertainty about water availability.\nThere are inadequate regional studies at basin scales to determine the future competition for water supply among sectors (urban, agriculture, and environment).\nThere is a need for more accurate information on future changes in drought magnitude and frequency.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is high confidence in each aspect of the key message: it is virtually certain that the water demand for human consumption in the Southeast will increase as a result of population growth. The past evidence of impacts during droughts and the projected changes in drivers (land-use change, population growth, and\n\n416\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fclimate change) suggest that there is a high confidence of the above assessment of future water availability. However, without additional studies, the resilience and the adaptive capacity of the socioeconomic and environmental systems are not known.\nWater supply is critical for sustainability of the region, particularly in view of increasing population and land-use changes. Climate models' precipitation projections are uncertain. Nonetheless, the combined effects of possible decreases in precipitation, increasing evaporation losses due to warming, and increasing demands for water due to higher populations (under either lower [B1] or higher [A2] emissions scenarios) will have a significant impact on water availability for all sectors.\n\n17: SOUTHEAST AND THE CARIBBEAN Traceable Accounts\n\n417\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 18 MIDWEST\nConvening Lead Authors\nSara C.

In the next few decades, longer growing seasons and rising carbon dioxide levels will increase yields of some crops, though those benefits will be progressively offset by extreme  weather events. Though adaptation options can reduce some of the detrimental effects, in the long term, the combined stresses associated with climate change are expected to decrease  agricultural productivity.\n2. The composition of the region's forests is expected to change as rising temperatures drive habitats for many tree species northward. The role of the region's forests as a net absorber of  carbon is at risk from disruptions to forest ecosystems, in part due to climate change.\n3. Increased heat wave intensity and frequency, increased humidity, degraded air quality, and  reduced water quality will increase public health risks.\n4. The Midwest has a highly energy-intensive economy with per capita emissions of greenhouse gases more than 20% higher than the national average. The region also has a large and  increasingly utilized potential to reduce emissions that cause climate change.\n5. Extreme rainfall events and flooding have increased during the last century, and these trends  are expected to continue, causing erosion, declining water quality, and negative impacts on  transportation, agriculture, human health, and infrastructure.\n6. Climate change will exacerbate a range of risks to the Great Lakes, including changes in the range and distribution of certain fish species, increased invasive species and harmful blooms of algae,  and declining beach health. Ice cover declines will lengthen the commercial navigation season.\n\nThe Midwest has a population of more than 61 million people (about 20% of the national total) and generates a regional gross domestic product of more than $2.6 trillion (about 19% of the national total).1 The Midwest is home to expansive agricultural lands, forests in the north, the Great Lakes, substantial industrial activity, and major urban areas, including eight of the nation's 50 most populous cities. The region has experienced shifts in population, socioeconomic changes, air and water pollution, and landscape changes, and exhibits multiple vulnerabilities to both climate variability and climate change.\nIn general, climate change will tend to amplify existing climaterelated risks from climate to people, ecosystems, and infrastructure in the Midwest (Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land). Direct effects of increased heat stress, flooding, drought, and late spring freezes on natural and managed ecosystems may be multiplied by changes in pests and disease prevalence, increased competition from non-native or opportunistic native species, ecosystem disturbances, land-use change, landscape fragmentation, atmospheric pollutants, and economic shocks such as crop failures or reduced yields due to extreme weather\n\nevents. These added stresses, when taken collectively, are projected to alter the ecosystem and socioeconomic patterns and processes in ways that most people in the region would consider detrimental. Much of the region's fisheries, recreation, tourism, and commerce depend on the Great Lakes and expansive northern forests, which already face pollution and invasive species pressure that will be exacerbated by climate change.\nMost of the region's population lives in cities, which are particularly vulnerable to climate change related flooding and lifethreatening heat waves because of aging infrastructure and other factors. Climate change may also augment or intensify other stresses on vegetation encountered in urban environments, including increased atmospheric pollution, heat island effects, a highly variable water cycle, and frequent exposure to new pests and diseases. Some cities in the region are already engaged in the process of capacity building or are actively building resilience to the threats posed by climate change. The region's highly energy-intensive economy emits a disproportionately large amount of the gases responsible for warming\n\n419\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f18: MIDWEST\n\nTemperatures are Rising in the Midwest\n\nerage Midwest air temperature increased by more than 1.5\u00b0F\n(Figure 18.1). However, between 1950 and 2010, the average\ntemperature increased twice as quickly, and between 1980 and\n2010, it increased three times as quickly as it did from 1900 to 2010.1 Warming has been more rapid at night and during win-\nter. These trends are consistent with expectations of increased\nconcentrations of heat-trapping gases and observed changes in concentrations of certain particles in the atmosphere.1,2\n\nFigure 18.1. Annual average temperatures (red line) across the Midwest show a trend towards increasing temperature. The trend (dashed line) calculated over the period 1895-2012 is equal to an increase of 1.5\u00b0F. (Figure source: updated from Kunkel et al. 20134).\nthe climate (called greenhouse gases or heat-trapping gases). But as discussed below, it also has a large and increasingly realized potential to reduce these emissions.\nThe rate of warming in the Midwest has markedly accelerated over the past few decades. Between 1900 and 2010, the av-\n\nThe amount of future warming will depend on changes in the atmospheric concentration of heat-trapping gases. Projections for regionally averaged temperature increases by the middle of the century (2046-2065) relative to 1979-2000 are approximately 3.8\u00b0F for a scenario with substantial emissions reductions (B1) and 4.9\u00b0F with continued growth in global emissions (A2). The projections for the end of the century (2081-2100) are approximately 5.6\u00b0F for the lower emissions scenario and 8.5\u00b0F for the higher emissions scenario (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 3).3\nIn 2011, 11 of the 14 U.S. weather-related disasters with damages of more than $1 billion affected the Midwest.5 Several types of extreme weather events have already increased in frequency and/or intensity due to climate change, and further increases are projected (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 7).6\n\nKey Message 1: Impacts to Agriculture\n\nIn the next few decades, longer growing seasons and rising carbon dioxide levels will increase yields of some crops, though those benefits will be progressively offset by extreme weather events. Though adaptation options can reduce some of the detrimental\neffects, in the long term, the combined stresses associated with climate change are expected to decrease agricultural productivity.\n\nAgriculture dominates Midwest land use, with more than twothirds of land designated as farmland.3 The region accounts for about 65% of U.S. corn and soybean production,7 mostly from non-irrigated lands.1 Corn and soybeans constitute 85% of Midwest crop receipts, with high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables making up most of the remainder.8 Corn and soybean yields increased markedly (by a factor of more than 5) over the last century largely due to technological innovation, but are still vulnerable to year-to-year variations in weather conditions.9\nThe Midwest growing season lengthened by almost two weeks since 1950, due in large part to earlier occurrence of the last spring freeze.10 This trend is expected to continue,3,11 though the potential agricultural consequences are complex and vary by crop. For corn, small long-term average temperature increases will shorten the duration of reproductive development, leading to yield declines,12 even when offset by carbon dioxide (CO2) stimulation.13 For soybeans, yields have a two in\n\nthree chance of increasing early in this century due to CO2 fertilization, but these increases are projected to be offset later in the century by higher temperature stress14 (see Figure 18.2 for projections of increases in the frost-free season length and the number of summer days with temperatures over 95\u00b0F).\nFuture crop yields will be more strongly influenced by anomalous weather events than by changes in average temperature or annual precipitation (Ch. 6: Agriculture). Cold injury due to a freeze event after plant budding can decimate fruit crop production,15 as happened in 2002, and again in 2012, to Michigan's $60 million tart cherry crop. Springtime cold air outbreaks (at least two consecutive days during which the daily average surface air temperature is below 95% of the simulated average wintertime surface air temperature) are projected to continue to occur throughout this century.16 As a result, increased productivity of some crops due to higher temperatures, longer growing seasons, and elevated CO2 concentrations could be offset by increased freeze damage.17 Heat waves during pol-\n\n420\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f18: MIDWEST\n\nProjected Mid-Century Temperature Changes in the Midwest\n\nlination of field crops such as corn and soybean also reduce yields (Figure 18.3).12 Wetter springs may reduce crop yields and profits,18 especially if growers\nare forced to switch to late-planted, shorter-season\nvarieties. A recent study suggests the volatility of\nU.S. corn prices is more sensitive to near-term cli-\nmate change than to energy policy influences or to\nuse of agricultural products for energy production, such as biofuel.19\n\nFigure 18.2. Projected increase in annual average temperatures (top left) by mid-century (2041-2070) as compared to the 1971-2000 period tell only part of the climate change story. Maps also show annual projected increases in the number of the hottest days (days over 95\u00b0F, top right), longer frost-free seasons (bottom left), and an increase in cooling degree days (bottom right), defined as the number of degrees that a day's average temperature is above 65\u00b0F, which generally leads to an increase in energy use for air conditioning. Projections are from global climate models that assume emissions of heat-trapping gases continue to rise (A2 scenario). (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nAgriculture is responsible for about 8% of U.S. heattrapping gas emissions,20 and there is tremendous\npotential for farming practices to reduce emissions or store more carbon in soil.21 Although large-scale\nagriculture in the Midwest historically led to de-\ncreased carbon in soils, higher crop residue inputs\nand adoption of different soil management tech-\nniques have reversed this trend. Other techniques,\nsuch as planting cover crops and no-till soil manage-\nment, can further increase CO2 uptake and reduce energy use.22,23 Use of agricultural best manage-\nment practices can also improve water quality by\nreducing the loss of sediments and nutrients from\nfarm fields. Methane released from animals and\ntheir wastes can be reduced by altered diets and\nmethane capture systems, and nitrous oxide production can be reduced by judicious fertilizer use24 and improved waste handling.21 In addition, if biofuel crops are grown sustainably,25 they offer emis-\nsions reduction opportunities by substituting for\nfossil fuel-based energy (Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and\nLand).\n\nCrop Yields Decline under Higher Temperatures\n\nFigure 18.3. Crop yields are very sensitive to temperature and rainfall. They are especially sensitive to high temperatures during the pollination and grain filling period. For example, corn (left) and soybean (right) harvests in Illinois and Indiana, two major producers, were lower in years with average maximum summer (June, July, and August) temperatures higher than the average from 1980 to 2007. Most years with below-average yields are both warmer and drier than normal.26,27 There is high correlation between warm and dry conditions during Midwest summers28 due to similar meteorological conditions and drought-caused changes.29 (Figure source: Mishra and Cherkauer 201026).\n\n421\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f18: MIDWEST\n\nKey Message 2: Forest Composition\n\nThe composition of the region's forests is expected to change as rising temperatures drive habitats for many tree species northward. The role of the region's forests as a net absorber\nof carbon is at risk from disruptions to forest ecosystems, in part due to climate change.\n\nThe Midwest is characterized by a rich diversity of native species juxtaposed on one of the world's most productive agricultural systems.30 The remnants of intact natural ecosystems in the region,31 including prairies, forests, streams, and wetlands, are rich with varied species.32 The combined effects of climate change, land-use change, and increasing numbers of invasive species are the primary threats to Midwest natural ecosystems.33 Species most vulnerable to climate change include those that occur in isolated habitats; live near their physiological tolerance limits; have specific habitat requirements, low reproductive rates, or limited dispersal capability; are dependent on interactions with specific other species; and/or have low genetic variability.34\nAmong the varied ecosystems of the region, forest systems are particularly vulnerable to multiple stresses. The habitat ranges of many iconic tree species such as paper birch, quaking aspen, balsam fir, and black spruce are projected to decline substantially across the northern Midwest as they shift northward, while species that are common farther south, including several oaks and pines, expand their ranges northward into the region (Figure 18.4).35,36 There is considerable variability in the likelihood of a species' habitat changing and the adaptabil-\n\nity of the species with regard to climate change.37 Migration to accommodate changed habitat is expected to be slow for many Midwest species, due to relatively flat topography, high latitudes, and fragmented habitats including the Great Lakes barrier. To reach areas that are 1.8\u00b0F cooler, species in mountainous terrains need to shift 550 feet higher in altitude (which can be achieved in only a few miles), whereas species in flat terrain like the Midwest must move as much as 90 miles north to reach a similarly cooler habitat.38\nAlthough global forests currently capture and store more carbon each year than they emit,39 the ability of forests to act as large, global carbon absorbers (\"sinks\") may be reduced by projected increased disturbances from insect outbreaks,40 forest fire,41 and drought,42 leading to increases in tree mortality and carbon emissions. Some regions may even shift from being a carbon sink to being an atmospheric carbon dioxide source,43,44 though large uncertainties exist, such as whether projected disturbances to forests will be chronic or episodic.45 Midwest forests are more resilient to forest carbon losses than most western forests because of relatively high moisture availability, greater nitrogen deposition (which tends to act as a fertilizer), and lower wildfire risk.43,46\n\nForest Composition Shifts\n\nFigure 18.4. As climate changes, species can often adapt by changing their ranges. Maps show current and projected future distribution of habitats for forest types in the Midwest under two emissions scenarios, a lower scenario that assumes reductions in heat-trapping gas emissions (B1), and a very high scenario that assumes continued increases in emissions (A1FI). Habitats for white/red/jack pine, maple/beech/birch, spruce/fir, and aspen/birch forests are projected to greatly decline from the northern forests, especially under higher emissions scenarios, while various oak forest types are projected to expand.37 While some forest types may not remain dominant, they will still be present in reduced quantities. Therefore, it is more appropriate to assess changes on an individual species basis, since all species within a forest type will not exhibit equal responses to climate change. (Figure source: Prasad et al. 200737).\n\n422\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f18: MIDWEST\n\nKey Message 3: Public Health Risks\n\nIncreased heat wave intensity and frequency, increased humidity, degraded air quality, and reduced water quality will increase public health risks.\n\nThe frequency of major heat waves in the Midwest has increased over the last six decades.47 For the United States, mor-\ntality increases 4% during heat waves compared with non-heat wave days.48 During July 2011, 132 million people across the\nU.S. were under a heat alert \u00ad and on July 20 of that year, the\nmajority of the Midwest experienced temperatures in excess\nof 100\u00b0F. Heat stress is projected to increase as a result of both increased summer temperatures and humidity.49,50 One study\nprojected an increase of between 166 and 2,217 excess deaths\nper year from heat wave-related mortality in Chicago alone by 2081-2100.51 The lower number assumes a climate scenario\nwith significant reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases\n(B1), while the upper number assumes a scenario under which\nemissions continue to increase (A2). These projections are sig-\nnificant when compared to recent Chicago heat waves, where\n114 people died from the heat wave of 1999 and about 700 died from the heat wave of 1995.52 Heat response plans and\nearly warning systems save lives, and from 1975 to 2004, mor-\n\ntality rates per heat event declined.53 However, many municipalities lack such plans.54\nMore than 20 million people in the Midwest experience air quality that fails to meet national ambient air quality standards.1 Degraded air quality due to human-induced emissions55 and increased pollen season duration56 are projected to be amplified with higher temperatures,57 and pollution and pollen exposures, in addition to heat waves, can harm human health (Ch. 9: Human Health). Policy options exist (for example, see \"Alternative Transportation Options Create Multiple Benefits\") that could reduce emissions of both heat-trapping gases and other air pollutants, yielding benefits for human health and fitness. Increased temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns could also increase the vulnerability of Midwest residents to diseases carried by insects and rodents (Ch. 9: Human Health).58\n\nAlternative transportation options create multiple benefits\nThe transportation sector produces one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and automobile exhaust also contains precursors to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ground-level ozone (O3), which pose threats to public health. Adopting a low-carbon transportation system with fewer automobiles, therefore, could have immediate health \"co-benefits\" of both reducing climate change and improving human health via both improved air quality and physical fitness.\nReducing Emissions, Improving Health\n\nFigure 18.5. Annual reduction in the number of premature deaths (left) and annual change in the number of cases with acute respiratory symptoms (right) due to reductions in particulate matter and ozone caused by reducing automobile exhaust. The maps project health benefits if automobile trips shorter than five miles (round-trip) were eliminated for the 11 largest metropolitan areas in the Midwest. Making 50% of these trips by bicycle just during four summer months would save 1,295 lives and yield savings of more than $8 billion per year from improved air quality, avoided mortality, and reduced health care costs for the upper Midwest alone.

The region also has a large and increasingly utilized potential to reduce emissions that cause climate change.\n\nThe Midwest is a major exporter of electricity to other U.S. regions and has a highly energy-intensive economy (Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land, Figure 10.4). Energy use per dollar of gross domestic product is approximately 20% above the national average, and per capita greenhouse gas emissions are 22% higher than the national average due, in part, to the reliance on fossil fuels, particularly coal for electricity generation.1 A large range in seasonal air temperature causes energy demand for both heating and cooling, with the highest demand for winter heating. The demand for heating in major midwestern cities is typically five to seven times that for cooling,1 although this is expected to shift as a result of longer summers, more frequent heat waves, and higher humidity, leading to an increase in the number of cooling degree days. This increased demand for cooling by the middle of this century is projected to exceed 10 gigawatts (equivalent to at least five large conventional power plants), requiring more than $6 billion in infrastructure investments.60 Further, approximately 95% of the electrical generating infrastructure in the Midwest is susceptible to decreased efficiency due to higher temperatures.60\n\nClimate change presents the Midwest's energy sector with a number of challenges, in part because of its current reliance on coal-based electricity1 and an aging, less-reliable electric distribution grid61 that will require significant reinvestment even without additional adaptations to climate change.62\nIncreased use of natural gas in the Midwest has the potential to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The Midwest also has potential to produce energy from zero- and low-carbon sources, given its wind, solar, and biomass resources, and potential for expanded nuclear power. The Midwest does not have the highest solar potential in the country (that is found in the Southwest), but its potential is nonetheless vast, with some parts of the Midwest having as good a solar resource as Florida.63 More than one-quarter of national installed wind energy capacity, one-third of biodiesel capacity, and more than two-thirds of ethanol production are located in the Midwest (see also Ch. 4: Energy and Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land).1 Progress toward increasing renewable energy is hampered by electricity prices that are distorted through a mix of direct and indirect subsidies and unaccounted-for costs for conventional energy sources.64\n\nKey Message 5: Increased Rainfall and Flooding\n\nExtreme rainfall events and flooding have increased during the last century, and these trends are expected to continue, causing erosion, declining water quality, and negative impacts on transportation, agriculture, human health, and infrastructure.\n\nPrecipitation in the Midwest is greatest in the east, declining towards the west. Precipitation occurs about once every seven days in the western part of the region and once every three days in the southeastern part.65 The 10 rainiest days can contribute as much as 40% of total precipitation in a given year.65 Generally, annual precipitation increased during the past century (by up to 20% in some locations), with much of the increase driven by intensification of the heaviest rainfalls.65,66 This tendency towards more intense precipitation events is projected to continue in the future.67\nModel projections for precipitation changes are less certain than those for temperature.3,4 Under a higher emissions scenario (A2), global climate models (GCMs) project average winter and spring precipitation by late this century (2071-2099) to increase 10% to 20% relative to 1971-2000, while changes in summer and fall are not expected to be larger than natural variations. Projected changes in annual precipitation show increases larger than natural variations in the north and smaller in the south (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 5).4 Regional\n\nclimate models (RCMs) using the same emissions scenario also project increased spring precipitation (9% in 2041-2062 relative to 1979-2000) and decreased summer precipitation (by an average of about 8% in 2041-2062 relative to 1979-2000) particularly in the southern portions of the Midwest.3 Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation are projected across the entire region in both GCM and RCM simulations (Figure 18.6), and these increases are generally larger than the projected changes in average precipitation.3,4\nFlooding can affect the integrity and diversity of aquatic ecosystems. Flooding also causes major human and economic consequences by inundating urban and agricultural land and by disrupting navigation in the region's roads, rivers, and reservoirs (see Ch. 5: Transportation, Ch. 9: Human Health, and Ch. 11: Urban). For example, the 2008 flooding in the Midwest caused 24 deaths, $15 billion in losses via reduced agricultural yields, and closure of key transportation routes.1 Water infrastructure for flood control, navigation, and other purposes is susceptible to climate change impacts and other forces because the de-\n\n424\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f18: MIDWEST\n\nWhen it Rains, it Pours\n\nperatures make overall projections of regional impacts of the associated snowmelt extremely difficult. Large-scale flooding can also occur due to extreme precipitation in the absence of snowmelt (for example, Rush Creek and the Root River, Minnesota, in August 2007 and multiple rivers in southern Minnesota in September 2010).72 These warm-season events are projected to increase in magnitude. Such events tend to be more regional and less likely to cover as large an area as those that occur in spring, in part because soil water storage capacity is typically much greater during the summer.\n\nChanging land use and the expansion of\n\nurban areas are reducing water infiltra-\n\ntion into the soil and increasing surface\n\nrunoff. These changes exacerbate impacts\n\ncaused by increased precipitation intensity.\n\nMany major Midwest cities are served by\n\ncombined storm and sewage drainage sys-\n\ntems. As surface area has been increasingly\n\nconverted to impervious surfaces (such as\n\nasphalt) and extreme precipitation events\n\nhave intensified, combined sewer overflow\n\nhas degraded water quality, a phenomenon\n\nFigure 18.6.

In June 2008, a record flood event exceeded the once-in-500-year flood level by more than 5 feet, causing $5 to $6 billion in damages from flooding, or more than $40,000 per resident of the city of Cedar Rapids.73 The flood inundated much of the downtown, damaging more than 4,000 structures, including 80% of government offices, and displacing 25,000 people.74 The record flood at Cedar Rapids was the result of low reservoir capacity and extreme rainfall on soil already saturated from unusually wet conditions. Rainfall amounts comparable to those in 1993 (8 inches over two weeks) overwhelmed a flood control system designed largely for a once-in-100-year flood event. Such events are consistent with observations and projections of wetter springs and more intense precipitation events (see Figure 18.6). With the help of more than $3 billion in funding from the federal and state government, Cedar Rapids is recovering and has taken significant steps to reduce future flood damage, with buyouts of more than 1,000 properties, and numerous buildings adapted with flood protection measures.\n\n\u00a9American Red Cross/Flickr\n\nhave increased non-point source pollution problems in recent years.78 This has led to increased phosphorus and nitrogen loading, which in turn is contributing to more and prolonged occurrences of low-oxygen \"dead zones\" and to harmful, lengthy, and dense algae growth in the Great Lakes and other Midwest water bodies.79 (Such zones and their causes are also discussed in Ch. 25: Coasts, Ch. 15: Biogeochemical Cycles, and Ch. 3: Water, Key Message 6). Watershed planning can be used to reduce water quantity and quality problems due to changing climate and land use.\n\nWhile there was no apparent change in drought duration in the Midwest region as a whole over the past century,80 the average\nnumber of days without precipitation is projected to increase\nin the future. This could lead to agricultural drought and suppressed crop yields.9 This would also increase thermoelectric\npower plant cooling water temperatures and decrease cooling\nefficiency and plant capacity because of the need to avoid dis-\ncharging excessively warm water (see also Ch. 4: Energy, and Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land).60\n\nKey Message 6: Increased Risks to the Great Lakes\n\nClimate change will exacerbate a range of risks to the Great Lakes, including changes in the range and distribution of certain fish species, increased invasive species and harmful blooms of algae, and declining beach health. Ice cover declines will lengthen the commercial navigation season.\n\nThe Great Lakes, North America's largest freshwater feature,\nhave recently recorded higher water temperatures and less\nice cover as a result of changes in regional climate (see also\nCh. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 11). Summer sur-\nface water temperatures in Lakes Huron increased 5.2\u00b0F and in Lake Ontario, 2.7\u00b0F, between 1968 and 2002,81 with smaller increases in Lake Erie.81,82 Due to the reduction in ice cover,\nthe temperature of surface waters in Lake Superior during the\nsummer increased 4.5\u00b0F, twice the rate of increase in air temperature.83 These lake surface temperatures are projected to rise by as much as 7\u00b0F by 2050 and 12.1\u00b0F by 2100.84,85 Higher\ntemperatures, increases in precipitation, and lengthened\ngrowing seasons favor production of blue-green and toxic al-\ngae that can harm fish, water quality, habitats, and aesthetics,79,84,86 and could heighten the impact of invasive species already present.87\n\nIn the Great Lakes, the average annual maximum ice coverage\nduring 2003-2013 was less than 43% compared to the 19622013 average of 52%,88 lower than any other decade during\nthe period of measurements (Figure 18.7), although there is\nsubstantial variability from year to year. During the 1970s,\nwhich included several extremely cold winters, maximum ice\ncoverage averaged 67%. Less ice, coupled with more frequent\nand intense storms (as indicated by some analyses of historical wind speeds),89 leaves shores vulnerable to erosion and flooding and could harm property and fish habitat.84,90 Reduced ice cover also has the potential to lengthen the shipping season.91\nThe navigation season increased by an average of eight days\nbetween 1994 and 2011, and the Welland Canal in the St. Law-\nrence River remained open nearly two weeks longer. Increased\nshipping days benefit commerce but could also increase shoreline scouring and bring in more invasive species.91,92\n\n426\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f18: MIDWEST\n\nChanges in lake levels can also influence the amount of cargo that can be carried on ships. On average, a 1000-foot ship sinks into the water by one inch per 270 tons of cargo;93 thus if a ship is currently limited by water depth, any lowering of lake levels will result in a proportional reduction in the amount of cargo that it can transport to Great Lakes ports. However, current estimates of lake level changes are uncertain, even for continued increases in global greenhouse gas emissions (A2 scenario). The most recent projections suggest a slight decrease or even a small rise in levels.94 Recent studies have also indicated that earlier approaches to computing evapotranspiration estimates from temperature may have overestimated evaporation losses.94,95,96,97 The recent studies, along with the large spread in existing modeling results, indicate that projections of Great Lakes water levels represent evolving research and are still subject to considerable uncertainty (see Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplemental Message 8).\n\nIce Cover in the Great Lakes\nFigure 18.7. Bars show decade averages of annual maximum Great Lakes ice coverage from the winter of 1962-1963, when reliable coverage of the entire Great Lakes began, to the winter of 2012-2013. Bar labels indicate the end year of the winter; for example, 1963-1972 indicates the winter of 1962-1963 through the winter of 1971-1972. The most recent period includes the eleven years from 2003 to 2013.

Ten participants discussed the scope and authors for a foundational Technical Input Report (TIR) report entitled \"Midwest Technical Input Report.\"98 The report, which consisted of nearly 240 pages of text organized into 13 chapters, was assembled by 23 authors representing governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), tribes, and other entities.\nThe Chapter Author Team engaged in multiple technical discussions via teleconferences that permitted a careful review of the foundational TIR98 and of approximately 45 additional technical inputs provided by the public, as well as the other published literature, and professional judgment. The Chapter Author Team convened teleconferences and exchanged extensive emails to define the scope of the chapter for their expert deliberation of input materials and to generate the chapter text and figures. Each expert drafted key messages, initial text and figure drafts and traceable accounts that pertained to their individual fields of expertise. These materials were then extensively discussed by the team and were approved by the team members.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nIn the next few decades, longer growing seasons and rising carbon dioxide levels will increase yields of some crops, though those benefits will be progressively offset by extreme weather events. Though adaptation options can reduce some of the detrimental effects, in the long term, the combined stresses associated with climate change are expected to decrease agricultural productivity.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Technical Input Report.98 Technical input reports on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nEvidence for altered growing seasons across the U.S. are discussed in Chapter 2 (Our Changing Climate, Key Message 4) and its Traceable Accounts. \"Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment\"4 and its references provide specific details for the Midwest. Evidence for longer growing seasons in the Midwest is based on regional temperature records and is incontrovertible, as is evidence for increasing carbon dioxide concentrations.\nU.S. Department of Agriculture data tables provide evidence for the importance of the eight Midwest states for U.S. agricultural production.8 Evidence for the effect of future elevated carbon dioxide concentrations on crop yields is based on scores of greenhouse and field experiments that show a strong fertilization response for C3 plants such as soybeans and wheat and a positive but not as strong a response for C4 plants such as corn. Observational data, evidence from field experiments, and quantitative modeling are the evidence base of the negative effects of extreme weather events on crop yield: early spring heat waves followed by normal frost events have been shown to decimate Midwest fruit crops; heat waves during flowering, pollination, and grain filling have been shown to significantly reduce corn and wheat yields; more variable and intense spring rainfall has delayed spring planting in some years and can be expected to increase erosion and runoff; and floods have led to crop losses.12,13,14\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Key issues (uncertainties) are: a) the rate at which grain yield improvements will continue to occur, which could help to offset the overall negative effect of extreme events at least for grain crops (though not for individual farmers); and b) the degree to which genetic improvements could make some future crops more tolerant of extreme events such as drought and heat stress. Additional uncertainties are: c) the degree to which accelerated soil carbon loss will occur as a result of warmer winters and the resulting effects on soil fertility and soil water availability; and d) the potential for increased pest and disease pressure as southern pests such as soybean rust move northward and existing pests better survive milder Midwest winters.\n\n435\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f18: MIDWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Because nearly all studies published to date in the peer-reviewed literature agree that Midwest crops benefit from CO2 fertilization and some benefit from a longer growing season, there is very high confidence in this component of the key message.\n\nDescription of evidence The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Technical Input Report.98 Technical inputs on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nStudies also agree that full benefits of climate change will be offset partly or fully by more frequent heat waves, early spring thaws followed by freezing temperatures, more variable and intense rainfall events, and floods. Again, there is very high confidence in this aspect.\nThere is less certainty (high) about pest effects and about the potential for adaptation actions to significantly mitigate the risk of crop loss.\nConfidence Level\nVery High Strong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.),\nhigh consensus\nHigh Moderate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium\nconsensus\nMedium Suggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing\nschools of thought\nLow Inconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts\nKey Message #2 Traceable Account The composition of the region's forests is expect-\ned to change as rising temperatures drive habitats for many tree species northward. The role of the region's forests as a net absorber of carbon is at risk from disruptions to forest ecosystems, in part due to climate change.\n\nEvidence for increased temperatures and altered growing seasons across the U.S. is discussed in Chapter 2 (Our Changing Climate, Key Messages 3 and 4) and its Traceable Accounts. \"Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment,\"4 with its references, provides specific details for the Midwest. Evidence that species have been shifting northward or ascending in altitude has been mounting for numerous species, though less so for long-lived trees. Nearly all studies to date published in the peer-reviewed literature agree that many of the boreal species of the north will eventually retreat northward. The question is when. Multiple models and paleoecological evidence show these trends have occurred in the past and are projected to continue in the future.36\nThe forests of the eastern United States (including the Midwest) have been accumulating large quantities of carbon over the past century,23 but evidence shows this trend is slowing in recent decades. There is a large amount of forest inventory data supporting the gradual decline in carbon accumulation throughout the eastern United States,99 as well as evidence of increasing disturbances and disturbance agents that are reducing overall net productivity in many of the forests.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key issue (uncertainty) is the rate of change of habitats and for organisms adapting or moving as habitats move. The key questions are: How much will the habitats change (what scenarios and model predictions will be most correct)? As primary habitats move north, which species will be able to keep up with changing habitats on their own or with human intervention through assisted migration, management of migration corridors, or construction or maintenance of protected habitats within species' current landscapes?\nViable avenues to improving the information base are determining which climate models exhibit the best ability to reproduce the historical and potential future change in habitats, and determining how, how fast, and how far various species can move or adapt.\nAn additional key source of uncertainty is whether projected disturbances to forests are chronic or episodic in nature.45\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is very high confidence in this key message, given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties.\n\n436\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f18: MIDWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nKey Message #3 Traceable Account\nIncreased heat wave intensity and frequency, increased humidity, degraded air quality, and reduced water quality will increase public health risks.\nDescription of evidence The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Technical Input Report.98 Technical inputs on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nEvidence for extreme weather such as heat waves across the U.S. are discussed in Chapter 2 (Our Changing Climate, Key Message 7) and its Traceable Accounts. Specific details for the Midwest are in \"Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment\"4 with its references. A recent book100 also contains chapters detailing the most current evidence for the region.\nHeat waves: The occurrence of heat waves in the recent past has been well-documented,1,15,49 as have health outcomes (particularly with regards to mortality). Projections of thermal regimes indicate increased frequency of periods with high air temperatures (and high apparent temperatures, which are a function of both air temperature and humidity). These projections are relatively robust and consistent between studies.\nHumidity: Evidence on observed and projected increased humidity can be found in a recent study.49\nAir quality: In 2008, in the region containing North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio, over 26 million people lived in counties that failed the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5 (particles with diameter below 2.5 microns), and over 24 million lived in counties that failed the NAAQS for ozone (O3).1 Because not all counties have air quality measurement stations in place, these data must be considered a lower bound on the actual number of counties that violate the NAAQS. Given that the NAAQS were designed principally with the goal of protecting human health, failure to meet these standards implies a significant fraction of the population live in counties characterized by air quality that is harmful to human health. While only relatively few studies have sought to make detailed air quality projections for the future, those that have1 generally indicate declining air quality (see uncertainties below).\nWater quality: The EPA estimates there are more than 800 billion gallons of untreated combined sewage released into the nation's waters annually.76 Combined sewers are designed to capture both sanitary sewage and stormwater. Combined sewer overflows lead to discharge of untreated sewage as a result of precipitation events, and can threaten human health. While not all urban areas within the Midwest have combined sewers for delivery to\n\nwastewater treatment plants, many do (for example, Chicago and Milwaukee), and such systems are vulnerable to combined sewer overflows during extreme precipitation events. Given projected increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events in the Midwest (Chapter 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 6),75 it appears that sewer overflow will continue to constitute a significant current health threat and a critical source of climate change vulnerability for major urban areas within the Midwest.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Key issues (uncertainties) are: Human health outcomes are contingent on a large number of non-climate variables. For example, morbidity and mortality outcomes of extreme heat are strongly determined by a) housing stock and access to air-conditioning in residences; b) existence and efficacy of heat wave warning and response plans (for example, foreign-language-appropriate communications and transit plans to public cooling centers, especially for the elderly); and c) co-stressors (for example, air pollution). Further, heat stress is dictated by apparent temperature, which is a function of both air temperature and humidity. Urban heat islands tend to exacerbate elevated temperatures and are largely determined by urban land use and human-caused heat emissions. Urban heat island reduction plans (for example, planted green roofs) represent one ongoing intervention. Nevertheless, the occurrence of extreme heat indices will increase under all climate scenarios. Thus, in the absence of policies to reduce heat-related illness/death, these impacts will increase in the future.\nAir quality is a complex function not only of physical meteorology but emissions of air pollutants and precursor species. However, since most chemical reactions are enhanced by warmer temperatures, as are many air pollutant emissions, warmer temperatures may lead to worsening of air quality, particularly with respect to tropospheric ozone (see Ch. 9: Human Health). Changes in humidity are more difficult to project but may amplify the increase in heat stress due to rising temperatures alone.49\nCombined sewer overflow is a major threat to water quality in some midwestern cities now. The tendency towards increased magnitude of extreme rain events (documented in the historical record and projected to continue in downscaling analyses) will cause an increased risk of waterborne disease outbreaks in the absence of infrastructure overhaul. However, mitigation actions are available, and the changing structure of cities (for example, reducing impervious surfaces) may offset the impact of the changing climate.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence In the absence of concerted efforts to reduce the threats posed by heat waves, increased humidity, degraded air quality and degraded water quality, climate change will increase the health risks associated with these phenomena. However, these projections are contingent on underlying assumptions regarding socioeconomic conditions and demographic trends in the region. Confidence is therefore high regarding this key message.\n\n437\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f18: MIDWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nKey Message #4 Traceable Account\nThe Midwest has a highly energy-intensive economy with per capita emissions of greenhouse gases more than 20% higher than the national average. The region also has a large and increasingly utilized potential to reduce emissions that cause climate change.\nDescription of evidence The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Technical Input Report.98 Technical inputs on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nThe Midwest's disproportionately large reliance on coal for electricity generation and the energy intensity of its agricultural and manufacturing sectors are all well documented in both government and industry records, as is the Midwest's contribution to greenhouse gases.1 The region's potential for zero- and lowercarbon energy production is also well documented by government and private assessments. Official and regular reporting by state agencies and non-governmental organizations demonstrates the Midwest's progress toward a decarbonized energy mix (Ch. 4: Energy; Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land).1\nThere is evidence that the Midwest is steadily decarbonizing its electricity generation through a combination of new state-level policies (for example, energy efficiency and renewable energy standards) and will continue to do so in response to low natural gas prices, falling prices for renewable electricity (for example, wind and solar), greater market demand for lower-carbon energy from consumers, and new EPA regulations governing new power plants. Several midwestern states have established Renewable Portfolio Standards (see https://www.misoenergy.org/WhatWeDo/ StrategicInitiatives/Pages/RenewablePortfolioStandards.aspx).\nNew information and remaining uncertainties There are four key uncertainties. The first uncertainty is the net effect of emerging EPA regulations on the future energy mix of the Midwest. Assessments to date suggest a significant number of coal plants will be closed or repowered with lower-carbon natural gas; and even coal plants that are currently thought of as \"must run\" (to maintain the electric grid's reliability) may be able to be replaced in some circumstances with the right combination of energy efficiency, new transmission lines, demand response, and distributed generation. A second key uncertainty is whether or not natural gas prices will remain at their historically low levels. Given that there are really only five options for meeting electricity demand \u00ad energy efficiency, renewables, coal, nuclear, and natural gas \u00ad the replacement of coal with natural gas for electricity production would have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions in the region. Third is the uncertain future for federal policies that have spurred renewable energy development to date,\n\nsuch as the Production Tax Credit for wind. While prices for both wind and solar continue to fall, the potential loss of tax credits may dampen additional market penetration of these technologies. A fourth uncertainty is the net effect of climate change on energy demand, and the cost of meeting that new demand profile. Research to date suggests the potential for a significant swing from the historically larger demand for heating in the winter to more demand in the summer instead, due to a warmer, more humid climate.3\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is no dispute about the energy intensity of the midwestern economy, nor its disproportionately large contribution of greenhouse gas emissions. Similarly, there is broad agreement about the Midwest's potential for--and progress toward--lower-carbon electricity production. There is therefore very high confidence in this statement.\nKey Message #5 Traceable Account\nExtreme rainfall events and flooding have increased during the last century, and these trends are expected to continue, causing erosion, declining water quality, and negative impacts on transportation, agriculture, human health, and infrastructure.\nDescription of evidence The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Technical Input Report.98 Technical inputs on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nEvidence for extreme weather and increased precipitation across the U.S. are discussed in Chapter 2 (Our Changing Climate, Key Messages 5, 6, and 7) and its Traceable Accounts. Specific details for the Midwest are detailed in \"Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment\"4 with its references. A recent book100 also contains chapters detailing the most current evidence for the region.\nThere is compelling evidence that annual total precipitation has been increasing in the region, with wetter winters and springs, drier summers, an increase in extreme precipitation events, and changes in snowfall patterns. These observations are consistent with climate model projections. Both the observed trends and climate models suggest these trends will increase in the future.\nRecent records also indicate evidence of a number of high-impact flood events in the region. Heavy precipitation events cause increased kinetic energy of surface water and thus increase erosion. Heavy precipitation events in the historical records have been shown to be associated with discharge of partially or completely untreated sewage due to the volumes of water overwhelming combined sewer systems that are designed to capture both domestic sewage and stormwater.\n\n438\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f18: MIDWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nClimate downscaling projections tend to indicate an increase in the frequency and duration of extreme events (both heavy precipitation and meteorological drought) in the future.\nAn extensive literature survey and synthetic analysis is presented in chapters in a recent book100 for impacts on water quality, transportation, agriculture, health, and infrastructure.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Precipitation is much less readily measured or modeled than air temperature.3 Thus both historical tendencies and projections for precipitation are inherently less certain than for temperature. Most regional climate models still have a positive bias in precipitation frequency but a negative bias in terms of precipitation amount in extreme events.\nFlood records are very heterogeneous and there is some ambiguity about the degree to which flooding is a result of atmospheric conditions.69 Flooding is not solely the result of incident precipitation but is also a complex function of the preceding conditions such as soil moisture content and extent of landscape infiltration. A key issue (uncertainty) is the future distribution of snowfall. Records indicate that snowfall is decreasing in the southern parts of the region, along with increasing lake effect snow. Climate models predict these trends will increase. There is insufficient knowledge about how this change in snowfall patterns will affect flooding and associated problems, but it is projected to affect the very large spring floods that typically cause the worst flooding in the region. In addition, recent data and climate predictions indicate drier summer conditions, which could tend to offset the effects of higher intensity summer storms by providing increased water storage in the soils. The relative effects of these offsetting trends need to be assessed. To determine future flooding risks, hydrologic modeling is needed that includes the effects of the increase in extreme events, changing snow patterns, and shifts in rainfall patterns. Adaptation measures to reduce soil erosion and combined sewer overflow (CSO) events are available and could be widely adopted.\nThe impacts of increased magnitude of heavy precipitation events on water quality, agriculture, human health, transportation, and infrastructure will be strongly determined by the degree to which the resilience of such systems is enhanced (for example, some cities are already implementing enhanced water removal systems).\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There have been improvements in agreement between observed precipitation patterns and model simulations. Also an increase in extreme precipitation events is consistent with first-order reasoning and increased atmospheric water burdens due to increased air temperature. Recent data suggest an increase in flooding in the region but there is uncertainty about how changing snow patterns will affect flood events in the future. Thus there is high confidence in increases in high-magnitude rainfall events and extreme precipitation events, and that these trends are expected to continue.\n\nThere is medium confidence that, in the absence of substantial adaptation actions, the enhancement in extreme precipitation and other tendencies in land use and land cover result in a projected increase in flooding. There is medium confidence that, in the absence of major adaptation actions, the enhancement in extreme precipitation will tend to increase the risk of erosion, declines in water quality, and negative impacts on transportation, agriculture, human health, and infrastructure.3\nKey Message #6 Traceable Account\nClimate change will exacerbate a range of risks to the Great Lakes, including changes in the range and distribution of certain fish species, increased invasive species and harmful blooms of algae, and declining beach health. Ice cover declines will lengthen the commercial navigation season.\nDescription of evidence The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Technical Input Report.98 Technical inputs on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nEvidence for changes in ice cover due to increased temperatures across the U.S. are discussed in Chapter 2 (Our Changing Climate, Key Message 11) and its Traceable Accounts. Specific details for the Midwest are detailed in \"Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment\"4 with its references. A recent book100 also contains chapters detailing the most current evidence for the region.\nAltered fish communities: Warmer lakes and streams will certainly provide more habitat for warmwater species as conditions in northern reaches of the basin become more suitable for warmwater fish and as lakes and streams are vacated by cool- and coldwater species.84 Habitat for coldwater fish, though not expected to disappear, will shrink substantially, though it could also expand in some areas, such as Lake Superior. Whether climate change expands the range of any type of fish is dependent on the availability of forage fish, as higher temperatures also necessitate greater food intake.\nIncreased abundances of invasive species: As climate change alters water temperatures, habitat, and fish communities, conditions that once were barriers to alien species become conduits for establishment and spread.84 This migration will alter drastically the fish communities of the Great Lakes basin. Climate change is also projected to heighten the impact of invasive species already present in the Great Lakes basin. Warmer winter conditions, for instance, have the potential to benefit alewife, round gobies, ruffe, sea lamprey, rainbow smelt, and other non-native species. These species have spread rapidly throughout the basin and have already inflicted significant ecological and economic harm.\n\n439\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f18: MIDWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nDeclining beach health and harmful algal blooms: Extreme events increase runoff, adding sediments, pollutants, and nutrients to the Great Lakes. The Midwest has experienced rising trends in precipitation and runoff. Agricultural runoff, in combination with increased water temperatures, has caused considerable non-point source pollution problems in recent years, with increased phosphorus and nitrogen loadings from farms contributing to more frequent and prolonged occurrences of anoxic \"dead zones\" and harmful, dense algae growth for long periods. Stormwater runoff that overloads urban sewer systems during extreme events adds to increased levels of toxic substances, sewage, and bacteria in the Great Lakes, affecting water quality, beach health, and human well-being. Increased storm events caused by climate change will lead to an increase in combined sewer overflows.84\nDecreased ice cover: Increasingly mild winters have shortened the time between when a lake freezes and when it thaws.101 Scientists have documented a relatively constant decrease in Great Lakes ice cover since the 1970s, particularly for Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Ontario. The loss of ice cover on the Great Lakes has both ecological and economic implications. Ice serves to protect shorelines and habitat from storms and wave power. Less ice-- coupled with more frequent and intense storms--leaves shores vulnerable to erosion and flooding and could harm property and fish habitat.\nWater levels: The 2009 NCA102 included predictions of a significant drop in Great Lakes levels by the end of the century, based on methods of linking climate models to hydrologic models. These methods have been significantly improved by fully coupling the hydrologic cycle among land, lake, and atmosphere.97 Without accounting for that cycle of interactions, a study96 concluded that increases in precipitation would be negated by increases in winter evaporation from less ice cover and by increases in summer evaporation and evapotranspiration from warmer air temperatures, under a scenario of continued increases in global emissions (SRES A2 scenario). Declines of 8 inches to 2 feet have been projected by the end of this century, depending on the specific lake in question.96 A recent comprehensive assessment,94 however, has concluded that with a continuation of current rising emissions trends (A2), the lakes will experience a slight decrease or even a rise in water levels; the difference from earlier studies is because earlier studies tended to overstress the amount of evapotranspiration expected to occur. The range of potential future lake levels remains large and includes the earlier projected decline. Overall, however, scientists project an increase in precipitation in the Great Lakes region (with extreme events projected to contribute to this increase), which will contribute to maintenance of or an increase in Great Lakes water levels. However, water level changes are not predicted to be uniform throughout the basin.\nShipping: Ice cover is expected to decrease dramatically by the end of the century, possibly lengthening the shipping season and, thus, facilitating more shipping activity. Current science suggests\n\nwater levels in the Great Lakes are projected to fall slightly or might even rise over the short run. However, by causing even a small drop in water levels, climate change could make the costs of shipping increase substantially. For instance, for every inch of draft a 1000-foot ship gives up, its capacity is reduced by 270 tons.93 Lightened loads today already add about $200,000 in costs to each voyage.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Key issues (uncertainties) are: Water levels are influenced by the amount of evaporation from decreased ice cover and warmer air temperatures, by evapotranspiration from warmer air temperatures, and by potential increases in inflow from more precipitation. Uncertainties about Great Lakes water levels are high, though most models suggest that the decrease in ice cover will lead to slightly lower water levels, beyond natural fluctuations.\nThe spread of invasive species into the system is near-certain (given the rate of introductions over the previous 50 years) without major policy and regulatory changes. However, the changes in Great Lakes fish communities are based on extrapolation from known fishery responses to projected responses to expected changing conditions in the basin. Moreover, many variables beyond water temperature and condition affect fisheries, not the least of which is the availability of forage fish. Higher water temperatures necessitate greater food intake, yet the forage base is changing rapidly in many parts of the Great Lakes basin, thus making the projected impact of climate change on fisheries difficult to discern with very high certainty.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Peer-reviewed literature about the effects of climate change are in broad agreement that air and surface water temperatures are rising and will continue to do so, that ice cover is declining steadily, and that precipitation and extreme events are on the rise. For large lake ecosystems, these changes have well-documented effects, such as effects on algal production, stratification (change in water temperature with depth), beach health, and fisheries. Key uncertainties exist about Great Lakes water levels and the impact of climate change on fisheries.\nA qualitative summary of climate stressors and coastal margin vulnerabilities for the Great Lakes is given in a technical input report.84 We have high confidence that the sum of these stressors will exceed the risk posed by any individual stressor. However, quantifying the cumulative impacts of those stressors is very challenging.\nGiven the evidence and remaining uncertainties, there is very high confidence in this key message, except high confidence for lake levels changing, and high confidence that declines in ice cover will continue to lengthen the commercial navigation season. There is limited information regarding exactly how invasive species may respond to changes in the regional climate, resulting in medium confidence for that part of the key message.\n\n440\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 19 GREAT PLAINS\nConvening Lead Authors\nDennis Ojima, Colorado State University Mark Shafer, Oklahoma Climatological Survey\nLead Authors\nJohn M.

Rising temperatures are leading to increased demand for water and energy. In parts of the region, this will constrain development, stress natural resources, and increase competition for water  among communities, agriculture, energy production, and ecological needs.\n2. Changes to crop growth cycles due to warming winters and alterations in the timing and magnitude of rainfall events have already been observed; as these trends continue, they will require new  agriculture and livestock management practices.\n3. Landscape fragmentation is increasing, for example, in the context of energy development  activities in the northern Great Plains. A highly fragmented landscape will hinder adaptation of species when climate change alters habitat composition and timing of plant development cycles.\n4. Communities that are already the most vulnerable to weather and climate extremes will be stressed even further by more frequent extreme events occurring within an already highly variable climate system.\n5. The magnitude of expected changes will exceed those experienced in the last century. Existing  adaptation and planning efforts are inadequate to respond to these projected impacts.\n\nThe Great Plains is a diverse region where climate and water are woven into the fabric of life. Day-to-day, month-to-month, and year-to-year changes in the weather can be dramatic and challenging for communities and their commerce. The region experiences multiple climate and weather hazards, including floods, droughts, severe storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and winter storms. In much of the Great Plains, too little precipitation falls to replace that needed by humans, plants, and animals. These variable conditions in the Great Plains already stress communities and cause billions of dollars in damage; climate change will add to both stress and costs.\n\nto reduce the speed and amount of climate change) choices can be locally driven, cost effective, and beneficial for local economies and ecosystem services.\n\nThe people of the Great Plains historically have adapted to this challenging climate. Although projections suggest more frequent and more intense droughts, severe rainfall events, and heat waves, communities and individuals can reduce vulnerabilities through the use of new technologies, community-driven policies, and the judicious use of resources. Adaptation (means of coping with changed conditions) and mitigation (reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases\n\nUSFWS\n\n442\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f19: GREAT PLAINS\nTemperature and Precipitation Distribution in the Great Plains\n\nFigure 19.1. The region has a distinct north-south gradient in average temperature patterns (left), with a hotter south and colder north. For precipitation (right), the regional gradient runs west-east, with a wetter east and a much drier west. Averages shown here are for the period 1981-2010. (Figure source: adapted from Kunkel et al. 20134).\n\nSignificant climate-related challenges are expected to involve 1) resolving increasing competition among land, water, and energy resources; 2) developing and maintaining sustainable agricultural systems; 3) conserving vibrant and diverse ecological systems; and 4) enhancing the resilience of the region's people to the impacts of climate extremes. These growing challenges will unfold against a changing backdrop that includes a growing urban population and declining rural population, new economic factors that drive incentives for crop and energy production, advances in technology, and shifting policies such as those related to farm and energy subsidies.\nThe Great Plains region features relatively flat plains that increase in elevation from sea level to more than 5,000 feet at the base of mountain ranges along the Continental Divide. Forested mountains cover western Montana and Wyoming, extensive rangelands spread throughout the Plains, marshes extend along Texas' Gulf Coast, and desert landscapes distinguish far west Texas.1 A highly diverse climate results from the region's large north-south extent and change of elevation. This regional diversity also means that climate change impacts will vary across the region.\nGreat Plains residents already must contend with weather challenges from winter storms, extreme heat and cold, severe thunderstorms, drought, and flood-producing rainfall. Texas'\n\nGulf Coast averages about three tropical storms or hurricanes every four years,2 generating coastal storm surge and sometimes bringing heavy rainfall and damaging winds hundreds of miles inland. The expected rise in sea level will result in the potential for greater damage from storm surge along the Gulf Coast of Texas (see Ch. 25: Coasts).\nAnnual average temperatures range from less than 40\u00b0F in the mountains of Wyoming and Montana to more than 70\u00b0F in South Texas, with extremes ranging from -70\u00b0F in Montana to 121\u00b0F in North Dakota and Kansas.3 Summers are long and hot in the south; winters are long and often severe in the north. North Dakota's increase in annual temperature over the past 130 years is the fastest in the contiguous U.S. and is mainly driven by warming winters.4\nThe region has a distinct north-south gradient in average temperature patterns, with a hotter south and colder north (Figure 19.1). Average annual precipitation greater than 50 inches supports lush vegetation in eastern Texas and Oklahoma. For most places, however, average rainfall is less than 30 inches, with some of Montana, Wyoming, and far west Texas receiving less than 15 inches a year. Across much of the region, annual water loss from transpiration by plants and from evaporation is higher than annual precipitation, making these areas particularly susceptible to droughts.\n\nProjected climate change For an average of seven days per year, maximum temperatures in the Northern Plains (Figure 19.2). These high temperatures reach more than 100\u00b0F in the Southern Plains and about 95\u00b0F are projected to occur much more frequently, even under a\n\n443\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f19: GREAT PLAINS\n\nscenario of substantial reductions in heat-trapping gas (also called greenhouse gas) emissions (B1), with days over 100\u00b0F projected to double in number in the north and quadruple in the south by mid-century (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 7).4 Similar increases are expected in the number of nights with minimum temperatures higher than 80\u00b0F in the south and 60\u00b0F in the north (cooler in mountain regions; see Figure 19.3). These increases in extreme heat will have many\n\nnegative consequences, including increases in surface water losses, heat stress, and demand for air conditioning.5 These\nnegative consequences will more than offset the benefits of\nwarmer winters, such as lower winter heating demand, less\ncold stress on humans and animals, and a longer growing sea-\nson, which will be extended by mid-century an average of 24 days relative to the 1971-2000 average.4,5 More overwintering insect populations are also expected.5\n\nHistorical Temperature on the 7 Hottest Days of the Year\n\nHistorical Temperature on the 7 Warmest Nights of the Year\n\nThe historical (1971-2000) distribution of temperature for the hottest 2% of days (about seven days a year) echoes the distinct north-south gradient in average temperatures.\nProjected Change in Number of Hot Days\n\nThe historical (1971-2000) distribution of temperature for the warmest 2% of nights (about seven days a year) echoes the distinct north-south gradient in average temperatures.\nProjected Change in Number of Warm Nights\n\nFigure 19.2. The number of days with the hottest temperatures is projected to increase dramatically. By mid-century (20412070), the projected change in the number of days exceeding those hottest temperatures is greatest in the western areas and Gulf Coast for both the lower emissions scenario (B1) and for the higher emissions scenario (A2).

In central areas, changes are projected to be small relative to natural variations (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 5).4 Projected changes in summer and fall precipitation are small except for summer drying in the central Great Plains, although the exact locations\n\nof this drying are uncertain. The number of days with heavy precipitation is expected to increase by mid-century, especially in the north (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 6). Large parts of Texas and Oklahoma are projected to see longer dry spells (up to 5 more days on average by mid-century). By contrast, changes are projected to be minimal in the north (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 7).4\n\nHistorical Amount of Precipitation on the 7 Wettest Days of the Year\n\nProjected Change in Number of Consecutive Dry Days\n\nThe historical (1971-2000) distribution of the greatest 2% of daily precipitation (about seven days a year) echoes the regional west-east gradient in average precipitation.\nProjected Change in Number of Heavy Precipitation Days\n\nFigure 19.4.

(Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nFigure 19.5.

The southeastern Great Plains, which is the wettest portion of the region, is projected to experience large increases in the number of consecutive dry days. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n445\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f19: GREAT PLAINS\n\nKey Message 1: Energy, Water and Land Use\n\nRising temperatures are leading to increased demand for water and energy. In parts of the region, this will constrain development, stress natural resources, and increase competition for\nwater among communities, agriculture, energy production, and ecological needs.\n\nEnergy, water, and land use are inherently interconnected,6 and climate change is creating a new set of challenges for these critical sectors (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate; Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land).7,8,9 The Great Plains is rich with energy resources, primarily from coal, oil, and natural gas, with growing wind and biofuel industries.10 Texas produces 16% of U.S. energy (mostly from crude oil and natural gas), and Wyoming provides an additional 14% (mostly from coal). North Dakota is the second largest producer of oil in the Great Plains, behind Texas. Nebraska and South Dakota rank third and fifth in biofuel production, and five of the eight Great Plains states have more than 1,000 megawatts of installed wind generation capacity, with Texas topping the list.11 More than 80% of the region's land area is used for agriculture, primarily cropland, pastures, and rangeland. Other land uses include forests, urban and rural development, transportation, conservation, and industry.\n\nintense droughts (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Messages 5 and 6).16 Winter and spring precipitation and very heavy precipitation events are both projected to increase in the northern portions of the area, leading to increased runoff and flooding that will reduce water quality and erode soils. Increased snowfall, rapid spring warming, and intense rainfall can combine to produce devastating floods, as is already common along the Red River of the North. More intense rains will also contribute to urban flooding.\nIncreased drought frequency and intensity can turn marginal lands into deserts. Reduced per capita water storage will continue to increase vulnerability to water shortages.17 Federal and state legal requirements mandating water allocations for ecosystems and endangered species add further competition for water resources.\n\nSignificant amounts of water are used to produce energy7,12 and to cool power plants.13 Electricity is consumed to collect,\npurify, and pump water. Although hydraulic fracturing to re-\nlease oil and natural gas is a small component of total water use,14 it can be a significant proportion of water use in local\nand rural groundwater systems. Energy facilities, transmission\nlines, and wind turbines can fragment both natural habitats and agriculture lands (Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land).5\n\nDiminishing water supplies and rapid population growth are critical issues in Texas. Because reservoirs are limited and have high evaporation rates, San Antonio has turned to the Edwards Aquifer as a major source of groundwater storage. Nineteen water districts joined to form a Regional Water Alliance for sustainable water development through 2060. The alliance creates a competitive market for buying and selling water rights and simplifies transfer of water rights.\n\nThe trend toward more dry days and higher temperatures across the south will increase evaporation, decrease water supplies, reduce electricity transmission capacity, and increase cooling demands. These changes will add stress to limited water resources and affect management choices related to irrigation, municipal use, and energy generation.15 In the Northern Plains, warmer winters may lead to reduced heating demand while hotter summers will increase demand for air conditioning, with the summer increase in demand outweighing the winter decrease (Ch. 4: Energy, Key Message 2).15\n\n\u00a9 Jim West/imagebroker/Corbis\n\nChanging extremes in precipitation are\nprojected across all seasons, including\nhigher likelihoods of both increasing heavy rain and snow events4 and more\n\n446\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f19: GREAT PLAINS\n\nKey Message 2: Sustaining Agriculture\n\nChanges to crop growth cycles due to warming winters and alterations in the timing and magnitude of rainfall events have already been observed; as these trends continue, they will require new agriculture and livestock management practices\n\nThe important agricultural sector in the Great Plains, with a agricultural productivity. Increased water withdrawals from\n\ntotal market value of about $92 billion (the most important being crops at 43% and livestock at 46%),18 already contends with\nsignificant climate variability (Ch. 6: Agriculture). Projected\n\nthe Ogallala Aquifer and High Plains Aquifer would accelerate\nongoing depletion in the southern parts of the aquifers and limit the ability to irrigate.21,29 Holding other aspects of produc-\n\nchanges in climate, and human responses to it, will affect as- tion constant, the climate impacts of shifting from irrigated to\n\npects of the region's agriculture, from the many crops that rely dryland agriculture would reduce crop yields by about a facsolely on rainfall, to the water and land required for increased tor of two.30 Under these climate-induced changes, adaptation\n\nenergy production from plants, such as fuels made from corn of agricultural practices will be needed, however, there may\n\nor switchgrass (see Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land).\n\nbe constraints on social-ecological adaptive capacity to make\n\nthese adjustments (see also Ch. 28: Adaptation).\n\nWater is central to the region's productivity. The High Plains\n\nAquifer, including the Ogallala, is a primary source for irrigation.19 In the Northern Plains, rain recharges\n\nthis aquifer quickly, but little recharge occurs in the Southern Plains.20,21\n\nIncreases in Irrigated Farmland in the Great Plains\n\nProjected changes in precipitation and temperature have both positive and negative consequences to agricultural productivity in the Northern Plains. Projected increases in winter and spring precipitation in the Northern Plains will benefit agricultural productivity by increasing water availability through soil moisture reserves during the early growing season, but this can be offset by fields too wet to plant. Rising temperatures will lengthen the growing season, possibly allowing a second annual crop in some places and some years. Warmer winters pose challenges.22,23,24 For example, some pests and invasive weeds will be able to survive the warmer winters.25 Winter crops that leave dormancy earlier are susceptible to spring freezes.26 Rainfall events already have become more intense,27 increasing erosion and nutrient runoff, and projections are that the frequency and severity of these heavy rainfall events will increase.4,28 The Northern Plains will remain vulnerable to periodic drought because much of the projected increase in precipitation is expected to occur in the cooler months while increasing temperatures will result in additional evapotranspiration.\nIn the Central and Southern Plains, projected declines in precipitation in the south and greater evaporation everywhere due to higher temperatures will increase irrigation demand and exacerbate current stresses on\n\nFigure 19.6. Irrigation in western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas supports crop development in semiarid areas. Declining aquifer levels threaten the ability to maintain production. Some aquifer-dependent regions, like southeastern Nebraska, have seen steep rises in irrigated farmland, from around 5% to more than 40%, during the period shown.

Climate change may thus result in a northward shift of crop and livestock production in the region. In areas projected to be hotter and drier in the future, maintaining agriculture on marginal lands may become too costly.\nAdding to climate change related stresses, growing water demands from large urban areas are also placing stresses on limited water supplies. Options considered in some areas include\n\ngroundwater development and purchasing water rights from agricultural areas for transfer to cities.32\nDuring the droughts of 2011 and 2012, ranchers liquidated large herds due to lack of food and water. Many cattle were sold to slaughterhouses; others were relocated to other pastures through sale or lease. As herds are being rebuilt, there is an opportunity to improve genetic stock, as those least adapted to the drought conditions were the first to be sold or relocated. Some ranchers also used the drought as an opportunity to diversify their portfolio, managing herds in both Texas and Montana.\n\nKey Message 3: Conservation and Adaptation\n\nLandscape fragmentation is increasing, for example, in the context of energy development activities in the northern Great Plains. A highly fragmented landscape will hinder adaptation of species when climate change alters habitat composition and timing of plant development cycles.\n\nLand development for energy production, land transformations on the fringes of urban areas, and economic pressures to remove lands from conservation easements pose threats to natural systems in the Great Plains.34 Habitat fragmentation is already a serious issue that inhibits the ability of species to migrate as climate variability and change alter local habitats.35 Lands that remain out of production are susceptible to invasion from non-native plant species.\nMany plant and animal species are responding to rising temperatures by adjusting their ranges at increasingly greater rates.36 These adjustments may also require movement of species that have evolved to live in very specific habitats, which may prove increasingly difficult for these species. The historic bison herds migrated to adapt to climate, disturbance, and associated habitat variability,37 but modern land-use patterns, roads, agriculture, and structures inhibit similar largescale migration.38 In the playa regions of the southern Great Plains, agricultural practices have modified more than 70% of seasonal lakes larger than 10 acres, and these lakes will be further altered under warming conditions.39,40 These changes in seasonal lakes will further affect bird populations41 and fish populations42 in the region.\nObserved climate-induced changes have been linked to changing timing of flowering, increases in wildfire activity and pest outbreaks, shifts in species distributions, declines in the abundance of native species, and the spread of invasive species (Ch. 8: Ecosystems). From Texas to Montana, altered flowering patterns due to more frost-free days have increased the length of pollen season for ragweed by as many as 16 days over the period from 1995 to 2009.43 Earlier snowmelt in Wyoming from\n\n1961 to 2002 has been related to the American pipit songbird laying eggs about 5 days earlier.44 During the past 70 years, observations indicate that winter wheat is flowering 6 to 10 days earlier as spring temperatures have risen.23 Some species may be less sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation, causing first flowering dates to change for some species but not for others.22 Even small shifts in timing, however, can disrupt the integrated balance of ecosystem functions like predator-prey relationships, mating behavior, or food availability for migrating birds.\nIn addition to climate changes, the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may offset the drying effects from warming by considerable improvements in plant water-use efficiency, which occur as CO2 concentrations increase.45 However, nutrient content of the grassland communities may be decreased under enriched CO2 environments, affecting nutritional quality of the grasses and leaves eaten by animals.\nThe interaction of climate and land-use changes across the Great Plains promises to be challenging and contentious. Opportunities for conservation of native grasslands, including species and processes, depend primarily and most immediately on managing a fragmented network of untilled prairie. Restoration of natural processes, conservation of remnant species and habitats, and consolidation/connection of fragmented areas will facilitate conservation of species and ecosystem services across the Great Plains. However, climate change will complicate current conservation efforts as land fragmentation continues to reduce habitat connectivity. The implementation of adaptive management approaches provides robust options for multiple solutions.\n\n448\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f19: GREAT PLAINS\nSage grouse and climate change\nHabitat fragmentation inhibits the ability of species such as the Greater Sage Grouse, a candidate for Endangered Species Act protections, to migrate in response to climate change. Its current habitat is threatened by energy development, agricultural practices, and urban development. Rapid expansion of oil and gas fields in North Dakota, Wyoming, and Montana and development of wind farms from North Dakota through Texas are opening new lands to development and contributing to habitat fragmentation of important core Sage Grouse habitat.46 The health of Sage Grouse habitat is associated with other species' health as well.47 Climate change projections also suggest a shift in preferred habitat locations and increased susceptibility to West Nile Virus.48\nHistorical and Current Range of Sage Grouse Habitat\n\nFigure 19.7. Comparing estimates of Greater Sage Grouse distribution from before settlement of the area (light green: prior to about 1800) with the current range (dark green: 2000) shows fragmentation of the sagebrush habitat required by this species. Over the last century, the sagebrush ecosystem has been altered by fire, invasion by new plant species, and conversion of land to agriculture, causing a decline in Sage Grouse populations.

For rural and tribal communities, their remote locations, sparse development, limited local services, and language barriers present greater challenges in responding to climate extremes. Working-age people are moving to urban areas, leaving a growing percentage of elderly people in rural communities (see also Ch. 14: Rural Communities).\n\nland, fragment habitat, and are at a greater risk of wildfire \u00ad all factors that interplay with climate.\nPopulations such as the elderly, low-income, and non-native English speakers face heightened climate vulnerability.

Demographic shifts continue to reshape communities in the Great Plains, with many central Great Plains communities losing residents. Rural and tribal communities will face additional challenges in dealing with climate change impacts due to demographic changes in the region (Ch. 14: Rural Communities; Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples). Figure shows population change from 2000 to 2010. (Figure source: U.S. Census Bureau 201057).\n\nFigure 19.9. Tribal populations in the Great Plains are concentrated near large reservations, like various Sioux tribes in South Dakota and Blackfeet and Crow reservations in Montana; and in Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and other tribal lands in Oklahoma (Figure source: reproduced from Atlas of the Great Plains by Stephen J. Lavin, Clark J. Archer, and Fred M. Shelley by permission of the University of Nebraska.

While tribal communities\nhave adapted to climate change for centuries, they are now constrained by physical and political boundaries.54 Traditional\necosystems and native resources no longer provide the support they used to.55 Tribal members have reported the de-\ncline or disappearance of culturally important animal species,\nchanges in the timing of cultural ceremonies due to earlier\nonset of spring, and the inability to locate certain types of ceremonial wild plants.56\n\nKey Message 5: Opportunities to Build Resilience\n\nThe magnitude of expected changes will exceed those experienced in the last century. Existing adaptation and planning efforts are inadequate to respond to these projected impacts.\n\nThe Great Plains is an integrated system. Changes in one part, whether driven by climate or by human decisions, affect other parts. Some of these changes are already underway, and many pieces of independent evidence project that ongoing climaterelated changes will ripple throughout the region.\nMany of these challenges will cut across sectors: water, land use, agriculture, energy, conservation, and livelihoods. Com-\n\npetition for water resources will increase within alreadystressed human and ecological systems, particularly in the Southern Plains, affecting crops, energy production, and how well people, animals, and plants can thrive. The region's ecosystems, economies, and communities will be further strained by increasing intensity and frequency of floods, droughts, and heat waves that will penetrate into the lives and livelihoods of Great Plains residents. Although some communities and\n\nOglala lakota respond to climate change\nThe Oglala Lakota tribe in South Dakota is incorporating climate change adaptation and mitigation planning as they consider long-term sustainable development planning. Their Oyate Omniciye plan is a partnership built around six livability principles related to transportation, housing, economic competitiveness, existing communities, federal investments, and local values. Interwoven with this is a vision that incorporates plans to reduce future climate change and adapt to future climate change, while protecting cultural resources.58\n\n\u00a9Aaron Huey\n\n451\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f19: GREAT PLAINS\n\nstates have made efforts to plan for these projected changes, the magnitude of the adaptation and planning efforts do not match the magnitude of the expected changes.\nSuccessful adaptation of human and natural systems to climate change would benefit from:\n\u00b7 recognition of and commitment to addressing these challenges;\n\u00b7 regional-scale planning and local-to-regional implementation;8,59\n\u00b7 mainstreaming climate planning into existing natural resource, public health, and emergency management processes;60\n\u00b7 renewed emphasis on restoration of ecological systems and processes;61\n\u00b7 recognition of the value of natural systems to sustaining life;62,63\n\u00b7 sharing information among decision-makers; and \u00b7 enhanced alignment of social and ecological goals.64\nCommunities already face tradeoffs in efforts to make efficient and sustainable use of their resources. Jobs, infrastructure, and tax dollars that come with fossil fuel extraction or renewable energy production are important, especially for rural communities. There is also economic value in the conversion of native grasslands to agriculture. Yet the tradeoffs among this development, the increased pressure on water resources, and the effects on conservation need to be considered if the region is to develop climate-resilient communities.\nUntilled prairies used for livestock grazing provide excellent targets for native grassland conservation. Partnerships among\n\nmany different tribal, federal, state, local, and private landowners can decrease landscape fragmentation and help manage the connection between agriculture and native habitats. Soil and wetland restoration enhances soil stability and health, water conservation, aquifer recharge, and food sources for wildlife and cattle. Healthy species and ecosystem services support social and economic systems where local products, tourism, and culturally significant species accompany largescale agriculture, industry, and international trade as fundamental components of society.\nAlthough there is tremendous adaptive potential among the diverse communities of the Great Plains, many local government officials do not yet recognize climate change as a problem that requires proactive planning.60,65 Positive steps toward greater community resilience have been achieved through local and regional collaboration and increased two-way communication between scientists and local decision-makers (see Ch. 28: Adaptation). For example, the Institute for Sustainable Communities conducts Climate Leadership Academies that promote peer learning and provides direct technical assistance to communities in a five-state region in the Southwest as part of their support of the Western Adaptation Alliance.66 Other regions have collaborated to share information, like the Southeast Florida Regional Compact 2012. Programs such as NOAA's Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) support scientists working directly with communities to help build capacity to prepare for and adapt to both climate variability and climate change.67 Climate-related challenges can be addressed with creative local engagement and prudent use of community assets.68 These assets include social networks, social capital, indigenous and local knowledge, and informal institutions.\n\n452\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fThe summer of 2011\n\n19: GREAT PLAINS\n\nFuture climate change projections include more precipitation in the Northern Great Plains and less in the Southern Great Plains. In 2011, such a pattern was strongly manifest, with exceptional drought and recording-setting temperatures in Texas and Oklahoma and flooding in the Northern Great Plains.\n\nDays Above 100\u00baF in Summer 2011\n\nMany locations in Texas and Oklahoma experienced more than 100 days over 100\u00baF. Both states set new records for the hottest summer since record keeping began in 1895. Rates of water loss due in part to evaporation were double the long-term average. The heat and drought depleted water resources and contributed to more than $10 billion in direct losses to agriculture alone. These severe water constraints strained the ability to meet electricity demands in Texas during 2011 and into 2012, a problem exacerbated by the fact that Texas is nearly isolated from the national electricity grid.\n\nThese recent temperature extremes were attributable in part to human-induced climate change (approximately 20% of the heat wave magnitude and a doubling of the chance that it would occur).69 In the future, average temperatures in this region are expected to increase and will continue to contribute to the intensity of heat waves (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Messages 3 and 7).\n\nFigure 19.10. In 2011, cities including Houston, Dallas, Austin, Oklahoma City, and Wichita, among others, all set records for the highest number of days recording temperatures of 100\u00baF or higher in those cities' recorded history. The black circles denote the location of observing stations recording 100\u00baF days. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC 20123).\n\nBy contrast to the drought in the Southern Plains, the Northern Plains were exceptionally wet in 2011, with Montana and Wyoming recording all-time wettest springs and the Dakotas and Nebraska not far behind. Record rainfall and snowmelt combined to push the Missouri River and its tributaries beyond their banks and leave much of the Crow Reservation in Montana underwater. The Souris River near Minot, North Dakota, crested at four feet above its previous record, with a flow five times greater than any in the past 30 years. Losses from the flooding were estimated at $2 billion.\n\n\u00a9 Tony Gutierrez/ /AP/Corbis \u00a9 LANE HICKENBOTTOM/Reuters/Corbis\n\nA Texas State Park police officer walks across a cracked lakebed in August 2011.

The workshop began the process leading to a foundational Technical Input Report (TIR), the Great Plains Regional Climate Assessment Technical Report.5 The TIR consists of 18 chapters assembled by 37 authors representing a wide range of inputs including governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, tribes, and other entities.\n\nSpecific details for the Great Plains are provided in the Regional Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment4 with its references.\nRising temperatures impact energy and water (Ch.10: Energy, Water, and Land; Ch. 4: Energy). Publications have explored the projected increase in water competition and stress for natural resources7,13,14,17 and the fragmentation of natural habitats and agricultural lands.8 These sources provided numerous references that were drawn from to lead to this key message.\n\nThe chapter author team engaged in multiple technical discussions via regular teleconferences. These included careful review of the foundational TIR8 and of approximately 50 additional technical inputs provided by the public, as well as the other published literature, and professional judgment. These discussions were followed by expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors during an in-person meeting in Kansas City in April 2012, wherein each message was defended before the entire author team prior to the key message being selected for inclusion in the report. These discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each message, and they were based on criteria that help define \"key vulnerabilities\".\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nRising temperatures are leading to increased demand for water and energy. In parts of the region, this will constrain development, stress natural resources, and increase competition for water among communities, agriculture, energy production, and ecological needs.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Technical Input Report.5 Technical inputs (47) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nTemperatures are rising across the United States (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 3 and its Traceable Account).\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key uncertainty is the exact rate and magnitude of the projected changes in precipitation, because high inter-annual variability may either obscure or highlight the long-term trends over the next few years.\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.),\nhigh consensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium\nconsensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing\nschools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts\n\n459\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f19: GREAT PLAINS Traceable Accounts\n\nAlso unknown is ecological demand for water. Water use by native and invasive species under current climate needs to be quantified so that it can be modeled under future scenarios to map out potential impact envelopes. There is also uncertainty over the projections of changes in precipitation due to difficulty of modeling projections of convective precipitation, which is the primary source of water for most of the Great Plains.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Very High for all aspects of the key message. The relationship between increased temperatures and higher evapotranspiration is well established. Model projections of higher temperatures are robust. Confidence is highest for the southern Great Plains, where competition among sectors, cities, and states for future supply is already readily apparent, and where population growth (demandside) and projected increases in precipitation deficits are greatest.\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nChanges to crop growth cycles due to warming winters and alterations in the timing and magnitude of rainfall events have already been observed; as these trends continue, they will require new agriculture and livestock management practices.\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence The general pattern of precipitation changes and overall increases in temperature are robust. The implications of these changes are enormous, although assessing changes in more specific locations is more uncertain. Our assessment is based on the climate projections and known relationships to crops (for example, corn not being able to \"rest\" at night due to high minimum temperatures), but pinpointing where these impacts will occur is difficult. Additionally, other factors that influence productivity, such as genetics, technological change, economic incentives, and federal and state policies, can alter or accelerate the impacts. Given the evidence and remaining uncertainties, agriculture and livestock management practices will need to adjust to these changes in climate and derived aspects although specific changes are yet to be determined. Overall, confidence is high.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nLandscape fragmentation is increasing, for example, in the context of energy development activities in the northern Great Plains. A highly fragmented landscape will hinder adaptation of species when climate change alters habitat composition and timing of plant development cycles.\n\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Great Plains Technical Input Report.5 Technical inputs (47) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Great Plains Technical Input Report.5 Technical inputs (47) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nEvidence for altered precipitation across the U.S. is discussed in Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 5 and 6 and their Traceable Accounts. Specific details for the Great Plains, such as warming winters and altered rainfall events are in the Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment4 with its references.\nLimitations of irrigation options in the High Plains aquifer have been detailed.21 The impacts of shifting from irrigated to rain-fed agriculture have also been detailed.30 Studies document negative impacts on livestock production through the Great Plains.31\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key issue (uncertainty) is rainfall patterns. Although models show a general increase in the northern Great Plains and a decrease in the southern Great Plains, the diffuse gradient between the two leaves uncertain the location of greatest impacts on the hydrologic cycle. Timing of precipitation is critical to crop planting, development and harvesting; shifts in seasonality of precipitation therefore need to be quantified. Rainfall patterns will similarly affect forage production, particularly winter wheat that is essential to cattle production in the southern Great Plains.\n\nA number of publications have explored the changes in habitat composition,39 plant distribution and development cycles 22,23,43 and animal distributions.36,38,44\nNew information and remaining uncertainties In general, the anticipated carbon dioxide enrichment, warming, and increase in precipitation variability influence vegetation primarily by affecting soil-water availability to plants. This is especially important as the transition between water surplus and water deficit (based on precipitation minus evapotranspiration) occurs across the Great Plains, with eastern areas supporting more biomass than western areas, especially given the current east-to-west difference in precipitation and the vegetation it supports.1 These effects are evident in experiments with each of the individual aspects of climate change.45 It is difficult to project, however, all of the interactions with all of the vegetative species of the Great Plains, so as to better manage ecosystems.\nSeveral native species have been in decline due to habitat fragmentation, including quail, ocelots, and lesser prairie chickens.46 Traditional adaptation methods of migration common to the Great Plains, such as bison herds had historically done, are less of an option as animals are confined to particular locations due to habitat fragmentation. As habitats change due to invasive species of\n\n460\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f19: GREAT PLAINS Traceable Accounts\n\nplant and animals and as climate change reduces viability of native vegetation, the current landscapes may be incapable of supporting these wildlife populations.38\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Confidence is very high that landscape is already fragmented and will continue to become more fragmented as energy exploration expands into less suitable agriculture lands that have not been developed as extensively. The effects of carbon dioxide and water availability on individual species are well known, but there is less published research on the interaction among different species. Evidence for the impact of climate change on species is very high, but specific adaptation strategies used by these species are less certain. Because of the more limited knowledge on adaptation strategies, we rate this key message overall has having high confidence. Our assessment is based upon historical methods, such as migration, used by species across the Great Plains to adapt to previous changes in climate and habitats and the incompatibility of those methods with current land-use practices.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nCommunities that are already the most vulnerable to weather and climate extremes will be stressed even further by more frequent extreme events occurring within an already highly variable climate system.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Technical Input Report.5 Technical inputs (47) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nExtreme events are documented for the nation (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 7), and for the region in the Climate Trends and Scenarios for the U.S. National Climate Assessment.4\nThere are a few studies documenting the vulnerability of communities in remote locations with sparse infrastructure, limited local services, and aging populations (Ch. 14: Rural Communities),51 with some areas inhibited by language barriers.53 Changes in the tribal communities have been documented on a number of issues.54,55,56,58\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key issue (uncertainty) is how limited financial resources will be dedicated to adaptation actions and the amount of will and attention that will be paid to decreasing vulnerability and increasing resilience throughout the region. Should the awareness of damage grow great enough, it may overcome the economic incentives for development and change perspectives, allowing for increased adaptive response. But if current trends continue, more vulnerable lands may be lost. Thus the outcome on rural and vulnerable populations is largely unknown.\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Extensive literature exists on vulnerable populations, limited resources and ability to respond to change. However, because the expected magnitude of changes is beyond previous experience and societal response is unknown, so the overall confidence is high.\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nThe magnitude of expected changes will exceed those experienced in the last century. Existing adaptation and planning efforts are inadequate to respond to these projected impacts.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Great Plains Technical Input Report.5 Technical inputs (47) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nA number of publications have looked at the requirements for adaptation of human and natural systems to climate change. These requirements include large- and small-scale planning,8,59,62 emphasis on restoring ecological systems and processes,61 realizing the importance of natural systems,62,63 and aligning the social and ecological goals.64\nNew information and remaining uncertainties No clear catalog of ongoing adaptation activities exists for the Great Plains region. Initial steps towards such a catalog have been supported by the National Climate Assessment in association with NOAA's Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments teams. The short-term nature of many planning activities has been described.65 Until a systematic assessment is conducted, most examples of adaptation are anecdotal. However, stresses in physical and social systems are readily apparent, as described in the other key messages. How communities, economic sectors, and social groups will respond to these stresses needs further study.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Climate trends over the past century, such as North Dakota warming more than any other state in the contiguous U.S., coupled with evidence of ecological changes and projections for further warming indicates very high confidence that climate patterns will be substantially different than those of the preceding century. While systematic evidence is currently lacking, emerging studies point toward a proclivity toward short-term planning and incremental adjustment rather than long-term strategies for evolving agricultural production systems, habitat management, water resources and societal changes. Evidence suggests that adaptation is ad hoc and isolated and will likely be inadequate to address the magnitude of social, economic, and environmental challenges that face the region. Overall confidence is medium.\n\n461\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 20 SOUTHWEST\nConvening Lead Authors\nGregg Garfin, University of Arizona Guido Franco, California Energy Commission\nLead Authors\nHilda Blanco, University of Southern California Andrew Comrie, University of Arizona Patrick Gonzalez, National Park Service Thomas Piechota, University of Nevada, Las Vegas Rebecca Smyth, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Reagan Waskom, Colorado State University\nRecommended Citation for Chapter\nGarfin, G., G.

Snowpack and streamflow amounts are projected to decline in parts of the Southwest, decreasing surface water supply reliability for cities, agriculture, and ecosystems.\n2. The Southwest produces more than half of the nation's high-value specialty crops, which are irrigation-dependent and particularly vulnerable to extremes of moisture, cold, and heat. Reduced yields from increasing temperatures and increasing competition for scarce water supplies will displace jobs in some rural communities.\n3. Increased warming, drought, and insect outbreaks, all caused by or linked to climate change, have increased wildfires and impacts to people and ecosystems in the Southwest. Fire models project more wildfire and increased risks to communities across extensive areas.\n4. Flooding and erosion in coastal areas are already occurring even at existing sea levels and damaging some California coastal areas during storms and extreme high tides. Sea level rise is projected to increase as Earth continues to warm, resulting in major damage as wind-driven waves ride upon higher seas and reach farther inland.\n5. Projected regional temperature increases, combined with the way cities amplify heat, will pose increased threats and costs to public health in southwestern cities, which are home to more than 90% of the region's population. Disruptions to urban electricity and water supplies will exacerbate these health problems.\n\nThe Southwest is the hottest and driest region in the United States, where the availability of water has defined its landscapes, history of human settlement, and modern economy. Climate changes pose challenges for an already parched region that is expected to get hotter and, in its southern half, significantly drier. Increased heat and changes to rain and snowpack will send ripple effects throughout the region's critical agriculture sector, affecting the lives and economies of 56 million people \u00ad a population that is expected to increase 68% by 2050, to 94 million.1 Severe and sustained drought will stress water sources, already over-utilized in many areas, forcing increasing competition among farmers, energy producers, urban dwellers, and plant and animal life for the region's most precious resource.\n\nthan half of the nation's high-value specialty crops, including certain vegetables, fruits, and nuts. The severity of future impacts will depend upon the complex interaction of pests, water supply, reduced chilling periods, and more rapid changes in the seasonal timing of crop development due to projected warming and extreme events.\nClimate changes will increase stress on the region's rich diversity of plant and animal species. Widespread tree death\n\nThe region's populous coastal cities face rising sea levels, extreme high tides, and storm surges, which pose particular risks to highways, bridges, power plants, and sewage treatment plants. Climate-related challenges also increase risks to critical port cities, which handle half of the nation's incoming shipping containers.\n\nAgriculture, a mainstay of the regional and national economies, faces uncertainty and change. The Southwest produces more\n\n\u00a9 Momatiuk - Eastcott/Corbis\n\n463\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST\n\nand fires, which already have caused billions of dollars in economic losses, are projected to increase, forcing wholesale changes to forest types, landscapes, and the communities that depend on them (see also Ch. 7: Forests).\nTourism and recreation, generated by the Southwest's winding canyons, snow-capped peaks, and Pacific Ocean\n\nbeaches, provide a significant economic force that also faces climate change challenges. The recreational economy will be increasingly affected by reduced streamflow and a shorter snow season, influencing everything from the ski industry to lake and river recreation.\n\nObserved and Projected Climate Change\n\nThe Southwest is already experiencing the impacts of climate Regional annual average temperatures are projected to rise\n\nchange. The region has heated up markedly in recent decades, by 2.5\u00b0F to 5.5\u00b0F by 2041-2070 and by 5.5\u00b0F to 9.5\u00b0F by 2070-\n\nand the period since 1950 has been hotter than any comparably 2099 with continued growth in global emissions (A2 emissions\n\nlong period in at least 600 years (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, scenario), with the greatest increases in the summer and fall Key Message 3).2,3,4 The decade 2001-2010 was the warmest in (Figure 20.1). If global emissions are substantially reduced (as\n\nthe 110-year instrumental record, with temperatures almost in the B1 emissions scenario), projected temperature increases\n\n2\u00b0F higher than historic averages, with fewer cold air outbreaks are 2.5\u00b0F to 4.5\u00b0F (2041-2070), and 3.5\u00b0F to 5.5\u00b0F (2070-2099). and more heat waves.4 Compared to relatively uniform regional Summertime heat waves are projected to become longer\n\ntemperature increases, precipitation trends vary considerably and hotter, whereas the trend of decreasing wintertime cold\n\nacross the region, with portions experiencing decreases and\nothers experiencing increases (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 5).4 There is mounting evidence that the combination\n\nair outbreaks is projected to continue (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 7).11,12 These changes will directly affect\nurban public health through increased risk of heat stress, and\n\nof human-caused temperature increases and recent drought has influenced widespread tree mortality,6,7 increased fire occurrence and area burned,8 and forest insect outbreaks (Ch. 7: Forests).9 Human-caused temperature increases and\n\nurban infrastructure through increased risk of disruptions to electric power generation.13,14,15,16 Rising temperatures also\nhave direct impacts on crop yields and productivity of key\nregional crops, such as fruit trees.\n\ndrought have also caused earlier spring snowmelt and shifted runoff to earlier in the year.10\n\nProjected Temperature Increases\n\nFigure 20.1. Maps show projected changes in average, as compared to 1971-1999. Top row shows projections assuming heat-trapping gas emissions continue to rise (A2). Bottom row shows projections assuming substantial reductions in emissions (B1). (Figure source: adapted from Kunkel et al. 201317).\n\n464\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST\n\nProjections of precipitation changes are less certain than those for temperature.17,18 Under a continuation of current rising\nemissions trends (A2), reduced winter and spring precipitation\nis consistently projected for the southern part of the South-\nwest by 2100 as part of the general global precipitation reduc-\ntion in subtropical areas. In the northern part of the region,\nprojected winter and spring precipitation changes are smaller\nthan natural variations. Summer and fall changes are also\nsmaller than natural variations throughout the region (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 5).17 An increase in winter\nflood hazard risk in rivers is projected due to increases in flows\nof atmospheric moisture into California's coastal ranges and the Sierra Nevada (Ch. 3: Water).19 These \"atmospheric rivers\" have contributed to the largest floods in California history20\nand can penetrate inland as far as Utah and New Mexico.\n\nThe Southwest is prone to drought. Southwest paleoclimate records show severe mega-droughts at least 50 years long.21 Future droughts are projected to be substantially hotter, and for major river basins such as the Colorado River Basin, drought is projected to become more frequent, intense, and longer lasting than in the historical record.18 These drought conditions present a huge challenge for regional management of water resources and natural hazards such as wildfire. In light of climate change and water resources treaties with Mexico, discussions will need to continue into the future to address demand pressures and vulnerabilities of groundwater and surface water systems that are shared along the border.\n\nVulnerabilities of native nations and border cities\nThe Southwest's 182 federally recognized tribes and communities in its U.S.-Mexico border region share particularly high vulnerabilities to climate changes such as high temperatures, drought, and severe storms. Tribes may face loss of traditional foods, medicines, and water supplies due to declining snowpack, increasing temperatures, and increasing drought (see also Ch 12: Indigenous Peoples).22 Historic land settlements and high rates of poverty \u00ad more than double that of the general U.S. population23 \u00ad constrain tribes' abilities to respond effectively to climate challenges.\nMost of the Southwest border population is concentrated in eight pairs of fast-growing, adjacent cities on either side of the U.S.-Mexico border (like El Paso and Ju\u00e1rez) with shared problems. If the 24 U.S. counties along the entire border were aggregated as a 51st state, they would rank near the bottom in per capita income, employment rate, insurance coverage for children and adults, and high school completion.24 Lack of financial resources and low tax bases for generating resources have resulted in a lack of roads and safe drinking water infrastructure, which makes it more daunting for tribes and border populations to address climate change issues. These economic pressures increase vulnerabilities to climate-related health and safety risks, such as air pollution, inadequate erosion and flood control, and insufficient safe drinking water.25\n\nKey Message 1: Reduced Snowpack and Streamflows\n\nSnowpack and streamflow amounts are projected to decline in parts of the Southwest, decreasing surface water supply reliability for cities, agriculture, and ecosystems.\n\nWinter snowpack, which slowly melts and releases water in spring and summer, when both natural ecosystems and people have the greatest needs for water, is key to the Southwest's hydrology and water supplies. Over the past 50 years across most of the Southwest, there has been less late-winter precipitation falling as snow, earlier snowmelt, and earlier arrival of most of the year's streamflow.26,27 Streamflow totals in the Sacramento-San Joaquin, the Colorado, the Rio Grande, and in the Great Basin were 5% to 37% lower between 2001 and 2010 than the 20th century average flows.4 Projections of further reduction of late-winter and spring snowpack and subsequent reductions in runoff and soil moisture28,29 pose increased risks to the water supplies needed to maintain the Southwest's cities, agriculture, and ecosystems.\n\nTemperature-driven reductions in snowpack are compounded by dust and soot accumulation on the surface of snowpack. This layer of dust and soot, transported by winds from lowland regions, increases the amount of the sun's energy absorbed by the snow. This leads to earlier snowmelt and evaporation \u00ad both of which have negative implications for water supply, alpine vegetation, and forests.30,31 The prospect of more lowland soil drying out from drought and human disturbances (like agriculture and development) makes regional dust a potent future risk to snow and water supplies.\nIn California, drinking water infrastructure needs are estimated at $4.6 billion annually over the next 10 years, even without considering the effects of climate change.32 Climate change will increase the cost of maintaining and improving drinking\n\n465\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST\nProjected Snow Water Equivalent\nFigure 20.2. Snow water equivalent (SWE) refers to the amount of water held in a volume of snow, which depends on the density of the snow and other factors. Figure shows projected snow water equivalent for the Southwest, as a percentage of 1971-2000, assuming continued increases in global emissions (A2 scenario). The size of bars is in proportion to the amount of snow each state contributes to the regional total; thus, the bars for Arizona are much smaller than those for Colorado, which contributes the most to region-wide snowpack. Declines in peak SWE are strongly correlated with early timing of runoff and decreases in total runoff. For watersheds that depend on snowpack to provide the majority of the annual runoff, such as in the Sierra Nevada and in the Upper Colorado and Upper Rio Grande River Basins, lower SWE generally translates to reduced reservoir water storage. (Data from Scripps Institution of Oceanography).\nwater infrastructure, because expanded wastewater treatment and desalinating water for drinking are among the key strategies for supplementing water supplies.\nConservation efforts have proven to reduce water use, but are not projected to be sufficient if current trends for water supply and demand continue.41 Large water utilities are currently attempting to understand how water supply and demand may change in conjunction with climate changes, and which adaptation options are most viable.42,43\n\n\u00a9 Peter Essick/Getty Images\n\nThe southwest's renewable potential to produce energy with less water\nThe Southwest's abundant geothermal, wind, and solar power-generation resources could help transform the region's electric generating system into one that uses substantially more renewable energy. This transformation has already started, driven in part by renewable energy portfolio standards adopted by five of six Southwest states, and renewable energy goals in Utah. California's law limits imports of baseload electricity generation from coal and oil and mandates reduction of heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.33\nAs the regional climate becomes hotter and, in parts of the Southwest, drier, there will be less water available for the cooling of thermal power plants (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate),34 which use about 40% of the surface water withdrawn in the United States.35 The projected warming of water in rivers and lakes will reduce the capacity of thermal power plants, especially during summer when electricity demand skyrockets.36 Wind and solar photovoltaic installations could substantially reduce water withdrawals. A large increase in the portion of power generated by renewable energy sources may be feasible at reasonable costs,37,38 and could substantially reduce water withdrawals (Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land).39\n\n466\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST\nScenario for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions in the Electricity Sector\n\nFigure 20.3. Major shifts in how electricity is produced can lead to large reductions in heat-trapping gas emissions. Shown is an illustrative scenario in which different energy combinations could, by 2050, achieve an 80% reduction of heat-trapping gas emissions from 1990 levels in the electricity sector in the Southwest. For each state, that mix varies, with the circle representing the average hourly generation in megawatts (the number above each circle) from 10 potential energy sources. CCS refers to carbon capture and storage. (Data from Wei et al. 2012, 201338,40).\n\nKey Message 2: Threats to Agriculture\n\nThe Southwest produces more than half of the nation's high-value specialty crops, which are irrigation-dependent and particularly vulnerable to extremes of moisture, cold, and heat.\nReduced yields from increasing temperatures and increasing competition for scarce water supplies will displace jobs in some rural communities.\n\nFarmers are renowned for adapting to yearly changes in the weather, but climate change in the Southwest could happen faster and more extensively than farmers' ability to adapt. The region's pastures are rain-fed (non-irrigated) and highly susceptible to projected drought. Excluding Colorado, more than 92% of the region's cropland is irrigated, and agricultural uses account for 79% of all water withdrawals in the region.44,45,46 A warmer, drier climate is projected to accelerate current trends of large transfers of irrigation water to urban areas,47,48,49 which would affect local agriculturally dependent economies.\nCalifornia produces about 95% of U.S. apricots, almonds, artichokes, figs, kiwis, raisins, olives, cling peaches, dried plums, persimmons, pistachios, olives, and walnuts, in addition to other high-value crops.50 Drought and extreme weather affect the market value of fruits and vegetables more than other crops because they have high water content and because sales depend on good visual appearance.51 The\n\ncombination of a longer frost-free season, less frequent cold air outbreaks, and more frequent heat waves accelerates crop ripening and maturity, reduces yields of corn, tree fruit, and wine grapes, stresses livestock, and increases agricultural water consumption.52,53 This combination of climate changes is projected to continue and intensify, possibly requiring a northward shift in crop production, displacing existing growers and affecting farming communities.54,55\nWinter chill periods are projected to fall below the duration necessary for many California trees to bear nuts and fruits, which will result in lower yields.56 Warm-season vegetable crops grown in Yolo County, one of California's biggest producers, may not be viable under hotter climate conditions.54,57 Once temperatures increase beyond optimum growing thresholds, further increases in temperature, like those projected for the decades beyond 2050, can cause large decreases in crop yields and hurt the region's agricultural economy.\n\n467\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST\nLonger Frost-Free Season Increases Stress on Crops\nFigure 20.4. The frost-free season is defined as the period between the last occurrence of 32\u00b0F in spring and the first occurrence of 32\u00b0F in the subsequent fall. The chart shows significant increases in the number of consecutive frostfree days per year in the past three decades compared to the 1901-2010 average. Increased frost-free season length, especially in already hot and moisture-stressed regions like the Southwest, is projected to lead to further heat stress on plants and increased water demands for crops. Higher temperatures and more frostfree days during winter can lead to early bud burst or bloom of some perennial plants, resulting in frost damage when cold conditions occur in late spring (see Ch. 6: Agriculture); in addition, with higher winter temperatures, some agricultural pests can persist year-round, and new pests and diseases may become established.47 (Figure source: Hoerling et al. 20134).\n\nKey Message 3: Increased Wildfire\n\nIncreased warming, drought, and insect outbreaks, all caused by or linked to climate change, have increased wildfires and impacts to people and ecosystems in the Southwest. Fire models project more wildfire and increased risks to communities across extensive areas.\n\nFire naturally shapes southwestern landscapes. Indeed, many Southwest ecosystems depend on periodic wildfire to maintain healthy tree densities, enable seeds to germinate, and reduce pests.58 Excessive wildfire destroys homes, exposes slopes to erosion and landslides, threatens public health, and causes economic damage.59,60 The $1.2 billion in damages from the 2003 Grand Prix fire in southern California illustrates the high cost of wildfires.60\nBeginning in the 1910s, the Federal Government developed a national policy of attempting to extinguish every fire, which allowed wood and other fuels to over-accumulate61 and urban development to encroach on fire-prone areas. These changes have also contributed to increasing fire risk.\n\nIncreased warming due to climate change,3 drought, insect infestations,62 and accumulation of woody fuels and nonnative grasses63,64 make the Southwest vulnerable to increased wildfire. Climate outweighed other factors in determining burned area in the western U.S. from 1916 to 2003,65 a finding confirmed by 3000-year long reconstructions of southwestern fire history.66,67,68 Between 1970 and 2003, warmer and drier conditions increased burned area in western U.S. mid-elevation conifer forests by 650% (Ch. 7: Forests, Key Message 1).8\nDrought and increased temperatures due to climate change have caused extensive tree death across the Southwest.7,69 In addition, winter warming due to climate change has exacerbated bark beetle outbreaks by allowing more beetles, which normally die in cold weather, to survive and reproduce.70 Wildfire and bark beetles killed trees across 20% of Arizona and New Mexico forests from 1984 to 2008.62\n\nNumerous fire models project more wildfire as climate change continues.64,71,72,73,74 Models project a doubling of burned area in the southern Rockies,73 and up to a 74% increase in burned area in California,74 with northern California potentially\nexperiencing a doubling under a high emissions scenario\ntoward the end of the century. Fire contributes to upslope\nshifting of vegetation, spread of invasive plants after extensive\nand intense fire, and conversion of forests to woodland or grassland.63,75\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo/The Press-Enterprise, Terry Pierson\n\n468\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST\n\nHistorical and projected climate change makes two-fifths (40%)\nof the region vulnerable to these shifts of major vegetation\ntypes or biomes; notably threatened are the conifer forests of southern California and sky islands of Arizona.71\n\nPrescribed burning, mechanical thinning, and retention of large\ntrees can help some southwestern forest ecosystems adapt to climate change.68,76 These adaptation measures also reduce\nemissions of the gases that cause climate change because\nlong-term storage of carbon in large trees can outweigh shortterm emissions from prescribed burning.61,77\n\nKey Message 4: Sea Level Rise and Coastal Damage\n\nFlooding and erosion in coastal areas are already occurring even at existing sea levels and damaging some California coastal areas during storms and extreme high tides. Sea level rise\nis projected to increase as Earth continues to warm, resulting in major damage as wind-driven waves ride upon higher seas and reach farther inland.\n\nIn the last 100 years, sea level has risen along the California coast by 6.7 to 7.9 inches.78 In the last decade, high tides on\ntop of this sea level rise have contributed to new damage to\n\nmore wave energy to reach farther inland and extend high tide\nperiods, worsening coastal erosion on bluffs and beaches and increasing flooding potential.18,81,82,83,84\n\ninfrastructure, such as the inundation of Highway 101 near San\n\nFrancisco and backup of seawater into the San Francisco Bay The result will be impacts to the nation's largest ocean-based\n\nArea sewage systems.\n\neconomy, which is estimated at $46 billion annually.85,86 If\n\nadaptive action is not taken, coastal highways, bridges, and\n\nAlthough sea level along the California coast has been relatively other transportation infrastructure (such as the San Francisco\n\nconstant since 1980, both global and relative Southwest sea and Oakland airports) are at increased risk of flooding with levels are expected to increase at accelerated rates.78,79,80 a 16-inch rise in sea level in the next 50 years,5 an amount\n\nDuring the next 30 years, the greatest impacts will be seen consistent with the 1 to 4 feet of expected global increase in\n\nduring high tides and storm events. Rising sea level will allow sea level (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10).\n\nIn Los Angeles, sea level rise\n\nCoastal Risks Posed by Sea Level Rise and High Tides\n\nposes a threat to groundwater supplies and estuaries,82,87\n\nby potentially contaminating\n\ngroundwater with seawater,\n\nor increasing the costs to\n\nFigure 20.5. King tides, which typically happen twice a year as a result of a gravitational alignment of the sun,\n\nprotect coastal freshwater aquifers.88\n\nmoon, and Earth, provide a preview of the risks rising sea levels may present along California coasts in the future. While king tides are the\n\nProjected increases in extreme coastal flooding as a result of sea level rise will\n\nextreme high tides today, with projected increase human vulnerability\n\nfuture sea level rise, this level of water and flooding will occur during regular monthly high tides. During storms and future king tides, more coastal flooding and damage will occur. The King Tide Photo Initiative encourages the public to visually document the impact of\n\nto coastal flooding events. Currently, 260,000 people in California are at risk from what is considered a oncein-100-year flood.82 With a sea level rise of about\n\nrising waters on the California coast, as exemplified during current king tide events. Photos show water levels along the Embarcadero in San Francisco, California during relatively normal tides (top), and during an extreme high tide or \"king tide\" (bottom). (Photo credit:\n\nthree feet (in the range of projections for this century \u00ad Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10)78,80 and at current population densities, 420,000 people would be at\n\nMark Johnsson).\n\nrisk from the same kind of 100-year flood event,85 based\n\non existing exposure levels.\n\nHighly vulnerable populations\n\n469\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST\n\n\u00ad people less able to prepare, respond, or recover from natural disaster due to age, race, or income \u00ad make up approximately 18% of the at-risk population (Ch. 25: Coasts).85,89\nThe California state government, through its Ocean and Coastal Resources Adaptation Strategy, along with local governments,\n\nis using new sea level mapping and information about social vulnerability to undertake coastal adaptation planning. NOAA has created an interactive map showing areas that would be affected by sea level rise (http://www.csc.noaa.gov/slr/ viewer/#).\n\nKey Message 5: Heat Threats to Health\n\nProjected regional temperature increases, combined with the way cities amplify heat, will pose increased threats and costs to public health in southwestern cities, which are home to\nmore than 90% of the region's population. Disruptions to urban electricity and water supplies will exacerbate these health problems.\n\nThe Southwest has the highest percentage of its population living in cities of any U.S. region. Its urban population rate, 92.7%, is 12% greater than the national average.90 Increasing metropolitan populations already pose challenges to providing adequate domestic water supplies, and the combination of increased population growth and projected increased risks to surface water supplies will add further challenges.91,92 Tradeoffs are inevitable between conserving water to help meet the demands of an increasing population and providing adequate water for urban greenery to reduce increasing urban temperatures.\n\nUrban infrastructures are especially vulnerable because of\ntheir interdependencies; strains in one system can cause\ndisruptions in another (Ch. 11: Urban, Key Message 2; Ch. 9: Human Health).16,93 For example, an 11-minute power system\ndisturbance in September 2011 cascaded into outages that left 1.5 million San Diego residents without power for 12 hours;94\nthe outage disrupted pumps and water service, causing 1.9 million gallons of sewage to spill near beaches.95 Extensive use\nof air conditioning to deal with high temperatures can quickly\nincrease electricity demand and trigger cascading energy system failures, resulting in blackouts or brownouts.14,15\n\nUrban Heat and Public Health\n\nFigure 20.6. The projected increase in heat waves in Southwest cities (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 7) increases the chances that a chain of escalating effects could lead to serious increases in illness and death due to heat stress. The top of the figure provides some of the links in that chain, while the bottom of the figure provides adaptation and improved governance options that can reduce this vulnerability and improve the resilience of urban infrastructure and community residents.\n\n470\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST\n\nHeat stress, a recurrent health problem for urban residents, has\nbeen the leading weather-related cause of death in the United States since 1986, when record keeping began96 \u00ad and the highest rates nationally are found in Arizona.97 The effects of\nheat stress are greatest during heat waves lasting several days\nor more, and heat waves are projected to increase in frequency, duration, and intensity,11,13,98 become more humid,11 and cause a greater number of deaths.99 Already, severe heat waves, such\nas the 2006 ten-day California event, have resulted in high mortality, especially among elderly populations.100 In addition,\nevidence indicates a greater likelihood of impacts in less\naffluent neighborhoods, which typically lack shade trees and other greenery and have reduced access to air conditioning.101\n\nExposure to excessive heat can also aggravate existing human\nhealth conditions, like for those who suffer from respiratory or heart disease.99 Increased temperatures can reduce air quality,\nbecause atmospheric chemical reactions proceed faster in\nwarmer conditions. The outcome is that heat waves are often accompanied by increased ground-level ozone,102 which can\ncause respiratory distress. Increased temperatures and longer\nwarm seasons will also lead to shifts in the distribution of\ndisease-transmitting mosquitoes (Ch. 9: Human Health, Key Message 1).97\n\n471\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The workshop began the process leading to a foundational Technical Input Report (TIR) report.103 The TIR consists of nearly 800 pages organized into 20 chapters that were assembled by 122 authors representing a wide range of inputs, including governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, tribes, and other entities. The report findings were described in a town hall meeting at the American Geophysical Union's annual fall meeting in 2011, and feedback was collected and incorporated into the draft.\nThe chapter author team engaged in multiple technical discussions through more than 15 biweekly teleconferences that permitted a careful review of the foundational TIR103 and of approximately 125 additional technical inputs provided by the public, as well as the other published literature and professional judgment. The chapter author team then met at the University of Southern California on March 27-28, 2012, for expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors. Each key message was defended before the entire author team prior to the key message being selected for inclusion. These discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each message, and they were based on criteria that help define \"key vulnerabilities, which include magnitude, timing, persistence and reversibility, likelihood and confidence, potential for adaptation, distribution, and importance of the vulnerable system.\"104\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nSnowpack and streamflow amounts are projected to decline in parts of the Southwest, decreasing surface water supply reliability for cities, agriculture, and ecosystems.\nDescription of evidence base The key message was chosen based on input from the extensive evidence documented in the Southwest Technical Input Report103 and additional technical input reports received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, as well as stakeholder engagement leading up to drafting the chapter.\n\nKey Message 5 in Chapter 2, Our Changing Climate, also provides evidence for declining precipitation across the United States, and a regional study17 discusses regional trends and scenarios for the Southwest.\nOver the past 50 years, there has been a reduction in the amount of snow measured on April 1 as a proportion of the precipitation falling in the corresponding water-year (October to September), which affects the timing of snowfed rivers. The implication of this finding is that the lower the proportion of April 1 snow water equivalent in the water-year-to-date precipitation, the more rapid the runoff, and the earlier the timing of center-of-mass of streamflow in snowfed rivers.26,27 For the \"recent decade\" (2001 to 2010), snowpack evidence is from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service snow course data, updated through 2010. One study4 has analyzed streamflow amounts for the region's four major river basins, the Colorado, Sacramento-San Joaquin, Great Basin (Humboldt River, NV), and the Rio Grande; data are from the U.S. Department of the Interior \u00ad Bureau of Reclamation, California Department of Water Resources, U.S. Geological Survey, and the International Boundary and Water Commission (U.S. Section), respectively. These data are backed by a rigorous detection and attribution study.10 Projected trends18 make use of downscaled climate parameters for 16 global climate models (GCMs), and hydrologic projections for the Colorado River, Rio Grande, and SacramentoSan Joaquin River System.\nBased on GCM projections, downscaled and run through the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological model,105 there are projected reductions in spring snow accumulation and total annual runoff, leading to reduced surface water supply reliability for much of the Southwest, with greater impacts occurring during the second half of this century.18,28\nFuture flows in the four major Southwest rivers are projected to decline as a result of a combination of increased temperatures, increased evaporation, less snow, and less persistent snowpack. These changes have been projected to result in decreased surface water supplies, which will have impacts for allocation of water resources to major uses, such as urban drinking water, agriculture, and ecosystem flows.\n\n482\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Different model simulations predict different levels of snow loss. These differences arise because of uncertainty in climate change warming and precipitation projections due to differences among GCMs, uncertainty in regional downscaling, uncertainty in hydrological modeling, differences in emissions, aerosols, and other forcings, and because differences in the hemispheric and regional-scale atmospheric circulation patterns produced by different GCMs produce different levels of snow loss in different model simulations.\nIn addition to the aforementioned uncertainties in regional climate and hydrology projections, projection of future surface water supply reliability includes at least the following additional uncertainties: 1) changes in water management, which depend on agency resources and leadership and cooperation of review boards and the public;106 2) management responses to non-stationarity;107 3) legal, economic, and institutional options for augmenting existing water supplies, adding underground water storage and recovery infrastructure, and fostering further water conservation (for example, Udall 2013108); 4) adjudication of unresolved water rights; and 5) local, state, regional, and national policies related to the balance of agricultural, ecosystem, and urban water use (for example, Reclamation 201143).\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is high confidence in the continued trend of declining snowpack and streamflow in parts of the Southwest given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties.\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent\nresults, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods\nvary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\n\nFor the impacts on water supply, there is high confidence that reduced surface water supply reliability will affect the region's cities, agriculture, and ecosystems.\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nThe Southwest produces more than half of the nation's high-value specialty crops, which are irrigation-dependent and particularly vulnerable to extremes of moisture, cold, and heat. Reduced yields from increasing temperatures and increasing competition for scarce water supplies will displace jobs in some rural communities.\nDescription of evidence base Increased competition for scarce water was presented in the first key message and in the foundational Technical Input Report (TIR).103 U.S. temperatures, including those for the Southwest region, have increased and are expected to continue to rise (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 3). Heat waves have become more frequent and intense and droughts are expected to become more intense in the Southwest (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 7). The length of the frost-free season in the Southwest has been increasing, and frost-free season length is projected to increase (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 4). A regional study17 discusses the trends and scenarios in the Southwest for moisture, cold, heat, and their extremes.\nThere is abundant evidence of irrigation dependence and vulnerability of high-value specialty crops to extremes of moisture, cold, and heat, including, prominently, the 2009 National Climate Assessment109 and the foundational TIR.103 Southwest agricultural production statistics and irrigation dependence of that production is delineated in the USDA 2007 Census of Agriculture45 and the USDA Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey.46\nReduced Yields. Even under the most conservative emissions scenarios evaluated (the combination of SRES B1emissions scenario with statistically downscaled winter chill projections from the HADCM3 climate model), one study56 projected that required winter chill periods will fall below the number of hours that are necessary for many of the nut- and fruit-bearing trees of California, and yields are projected to decline as a result. A second study54 found that California wheat acreage and walnut acreage will decline due to increased temperatures. Drought and extreme weather may have more effect on the market value of fruits and vegetables, as opposed to other crops, because fruits and vegetables have high water content and because consumers expect good visual appearance and flavor.51 Extreme daytime and nighttime temperatures have been shown to accelerate crop ripening and maturity, reduce yield of crops such as corn, fruit trees, and vineyards, cause livestock to be stressed, and increase water consumption in agriculture.53\n\n483\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nIrrigation water transfers to urban. Warmer, drier future scenarios portend large transfers of irrigation water to urban areas even though agriculture will need additional water to meet crop demands, affecting local agriculturally-dependent economies.55 In particular areas of the Southwest (most notably lower-central Arizona), a significant reduction in irrigated agriculture is already underway as land conversion occurs near urban centers.48 Functioning water markets, which may require legal and institutional changes, can enable such transfers and reduce the social and economic impacts of water shortages to urban areas.47 The economic impacts of climate change on Southwest fruit and nut growers are projected to be substantial and will result in a northward shift in production of these crops, displacing growers and affecting communities.\n\nwater from northern to southern California.47 Other studies, using projections of a dry, warmer future for California, and an assumption that water will flow from lower- to higher-valued uses (such as urban water use), generated a 15% decrease in irrigated acreage and a shift from lower- to higher-valued crops.49\nBecause net reductions in the costs of water shortages depend on multiple institutional responses, it is difficult as yet to locate a best estimate of water transfers between zero and the upper bound. Water scarcity may also be a function of tradeoffs between economic returns from agricultural production and returns for selling off property or selling water to urban areas (for example, Imperial Valley transfers to San Diego).\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Competition for water is an uncertainty. The extent to which water transfers take place depends on whether complementary investments in conveyance or storage infrastructure are made. Currently, there are legal and institutional restrictions limiting water transfers across state and local jurisdictions. It is uncertain whether infrastructure investments will be made or whether institutional innovations facilitating transfers will develop. Institutional barriers will be greater if negative third-party effects of transfers are not adequately addressed. Research that would improve the information base to inform future water transfer debates includes: 1) estimates of third party impacts, 2) assessment of institutional mechanisms to reduce those impacts, 3) environmental impacts of water infrastructure projects, and 4) options and costs of mitigating those environmental impacts.\nExtremes and phenology. A key uncertainty is the timing of extreme events during the phenological stage of the plant or the growth cycle of the animal. For example, plants are more sensitive to extreme high temperatures and drought during the pollination stage compared to vegetative growth stages.\nGenetic improvement potential. Crop and livestock reduction studies by necessity depend on assumptions about adaptive actions by farmers and ranchers. However, agriculture has proven to be highly adaptive in the past. A particularly high uncertainty is the ability of conventional breeding and biotechnology to keep pace with the crop plant and animal genetic improvements needed for adaptation to climate-induced biotic and abiotic stresses.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Although evidence includes studies of observed climate and weather impacts on agriculture, projections of future changes using climate and crop yield models and econometric models show varying results depending on the choice of crop and assumptions regarding water availability. For example, projections of 2050 California crop yields show reductions in field crop yields, based on assumptions of a 21% decline in agricultural water use, shifts away from water-intensive crops to high-value specialty crops, and development of a more economical means of transferring\n\nGiven the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is high in this key message.\nKey Message #3 Traceable Account\nIncreased warming, drought, and insect outbreaks, all caused by or linked to climate change, have increased wildfires and impacts to people and ecosystems in the Southwest. Fire models project more wildfire and increased risks to communities across extensive areas.\nDescription of evidence base Increased warming and drought are extensively described in the foundational Technical Input Report (TIR).103 U.S. temperatures have increased and are expected to continue to rise (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 3). There have been regional changes in droughts, and there are observed and projected changes in cold and heat waves and droughts (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 7) for the nation. A study for the Southwest17 discusses trends and scenarios in both cold waves and heat waves.\nAnalyses of weather station data from the Southwest have detected changes from 1950 to 2005 that favor wildfire, and statistical analyses have attributed the changes to anthropogenic climate change. The changes include increased temperatures,3 reduced snowpack,27 earlier spring warmth,30 and streamflow.10 These climate changes have increased background tree mortality rates from 1955 to 2007 in old-growth conifer forests in California, Colorado, Utah, and the northwestern states7 and caused extensive pi\u00f1on pine mortality in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah between 1989 and 2003.69\nClimate factors contributed to increases in wildfire in the previous century. In mid-elevation conifer forests of the western United States, increases in spring and summer temperatures, earlier snowmelt, and longer summers increased fire frequency by 400% and burned area by 650% from 1970 to 2003.8 Multivariate analysis of wildfire across the western U.S. from 1916 to 2003\n\n484\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nindicates that climate was the dominant factor controlling burned area, even during periods of human fire suppression.65\nReconstruction of fires of the past 400 to 3000 years in the western U.S.66 and in Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks in California67,68 confirm that temperature and drought are the\ndominant factors explaining fire occurrence.\n\nstudies document potential coastal flooding, erosion, and winddriven wave damages in coastal areas of California due to sea level rise (for example, Bromirski et al. 2012; Heberger et al. 2011, and Revell et al. 201181,82). Global sea level has risen, and further rise of 1 to 4 feet is projected by 2100 (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10).\n\nFour different fire models project increases in fire frequency across extensive areas of the Southwest in this century.71,72,73,74 Multivariate statistical generalized additive models64,72 project extensive increases across the Southwest, but the models project decreases when assuming that climate alters patterns of net primary productivity. Logistic regressions74 project increases across most of California, except for some southern parts of the state, with average fire frequency increasing 37% to 74%. Linear regression models project up to a doubling of burned area in the southern Rockies by 2070 under emissions scenarios B1 or A2.73 The MC1 dynamic global vegetation model projects increases in fire frequencies on 40% of the area of the Southwest from 2000 to 2100 and decreases on 50% of the areas for emissions scenarios B1 and A2.71\nExcessive wildfire destroys homes, exposes slopes to erosion and landslides, and threatens public health, causing economic damage.59,60 Further impacts to communities and various economies (local, state, and national) have been projected.74\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Uncertainties in future projections derive from the inability of models to accurately simulate all past fire patterns, and from the different GCMs, emissions scenarios, and spatial resolutions used by different fire model projections. Fire projections depend highly on the spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation projections, which vary widely across GCMs. Although models generally project future increases in wildfire, uncertainty remains on the exact locations. Research groups continue to refine the fire models.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is high confidence in this key message given the extensive evidence base and discussed uncertainties.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nFlooding and erosion in coastal areas are already occurring even at existing sea levels and damaging some California coastal areas during storms and extreme high tides. Sea level rise is projected to increase as Earth continues to warm, resulting in major damage as wind-driven waves ride upon higher seas and reach farther inland.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the Technical Input Report.103 Several\n\nAll of the scientific approaches to detecting sea level rise come to the conclusion that a warming planet will result in higher sea levels. In addition, numerous recent studies78,80 produce much higher sea level rise projections for the rest of this century as compared to the projections in the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change83 for the rest of this century.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties There is strong recent evidence from satellites such as GRACE110 and from direct observations that glaciers and ice caps worldwide are losing mass relatively rapidly, contributing to the recent increase in the observed rate of sea level rise.\nMajor uncertainties are associated with sea level rise projections, such as the behavior of ice sheets with global warming and the actual level of global warming that the Earth will experience in the future.78,80 Regional sea level rise projections are even more uncertain than the projections for global averages because local factors such as the steric component (changes in the volume of water with changes in temperature and salinity) of sea level rise at regional levels and the vertical movement of land have large uncertainties.78 However, it is virtually certain that sea levels will go up with a warming planet as demonstrated in the paleoclimatic record, modeling, and from basic physical arguments.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence, especially since the last IPCC report,83 there is very high confidence the sea level will continue to rise and that this will entail major damage to coastal regions in the Southwest. There is also very high confidence that flooding and erosion in coastal areas are already occurring even at existing sea levels and damaging some areas of the California coast during storms and extreme high tides.\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nProjected regional temperature increases, combined with the way cities amplify heat, will pose increased threats and costs to public health in southwestern cities, which are home to more than 90% of the region's population. Disruptions to urban electricity and water supplies will exacerbate these health problems.\nDescription of evidence base There is excellent agreement regarding the urban heat island effect and exacerbation of heat island temperatures by increases in regional temperatures caused by climate change. There is\n\n485\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f20: SOUTHWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nabundant evidence of urban heat island effect for some Southwest cities (for example, Sheridan et al.98), as well as several studies, some from outside the region, of the public health threats of urban heat to residents (for example, Ch. 9: Human Health, Ostro et al. 2009, 200199,100). Evidence includes observed urban heat island studies and modeling of future climates, including some climate change modeling studies for individual urban areas (for example, Phoenix and Los Angeles). There is wide agreement in Southwest states that increasing temperatures combined with projected population growth will stress urban water supplies and require continued water conservation and investment in new water supply options. There is substantial agreement that disruption to urban electricity may cause cascading impacts, such as loss of water, and that projected diminished supplies will pose challenges for urban cooling (for example, the need for supplemental irrigation for vegetation-based cooling). However, there are no studies on urban power disruption induced by climate change.\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence The urban heat island effect is well demonstrated and hence projected climate-induced increases to heat will increase exposure to heat-related illness. Electricity disruptions are a key uncertain factor, and potential reductions in water supply not only may reduce hydropower generation, but also availability of water for cooling of thermal power plants.\nBased on the substantial evidence and the remaining uncertainties, confidence in each aspect of the key message is high.\n\nWith projected surface water losses, and increasing water demand\ndue to increasing temperatures and population, water supply\nin Southwest cities will require greater conservation efforts and capital investment in new water supply sources.92 Several\nsouthwestern states, including California, New Mexico, and\nColorado have begun to study climate impacts to water resources, including impacts in urban areas.91\n\nThe interdependence of infrastructure systems is well established, especially the dependence of systems on electricity and communications and control infrastructures, and the potential cascading effects of breakdowns in infrastructure systems.16 The concentration of infrastructures in urban areas adds to the vulnerability of urban populations to infrastructure breakdowns. This has been documented in descriptions for major power outages such as the Northeast power blackout of 2003, or the recent September 2011 San Diego blackout.94\n\nA few references point to the role of urban power outages in threatening public health due to loss of air conditioning14 and disruption to water supplies.94\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Key uncertainties include the intensity and spatial extent of drought and heat waves. Uncertainty is also associated with quantification of the impact of temperature and water availability on energy generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption \u00ad all of which have an impact on possible disruptions to urban electricity. Major disruptions are contingent on a lack of operator response and/or adaptive actions such as installation of adequate electricity-generating capacity to serve the expected enhanced peak electricity demand. Thus a further uncertainty is the extent to which adaptation actions are taken.\n\n486\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 21 NORTHWEST\nConvening Lead Authors\nPhilip Mote, Oregon State University Amy K.

Changes in the timing of streamflow related to changing snowmelt are already observed and will continue, reducing the supply of water for many competing demands and causing far-reaching ecological and socioeconomic consequences.\n2. In the coastal zone, the effects of sea level rise, erosion, inundation, threats to infrastructure and habitat, and increasing ocean acidity collectively pose a major threat to the region.\n3. The combined impacts of increasing wildfire, insect outbreaks, and tree diseases are already causing widespread tree die-off and are virtually certain to cause additional forest mortality by the 2040s and long-term transformation of forest landscapes. Under higher emissions scenarios, extensive conversion of subalpine forests to other forest types is projected by the 2080s.\n4. While the agriculture sector's technical ability to adapt to changing conditions can offset some adverse impacts of a changing climate, there remain critical concerns for agriculture with respect to costs of adaptation, development of more climate resilient technologies and management, and availability and timing of water.\n\nWith craggy shorelines, volcanic mountains, and high sage deserts, the Northwest's complex and varied topography contributes to the region's rich climatic, geographic, social, and ecologic diversity. Abundant natural resources \u00ad timber, fisheries, productive soils, and plentiful water \u00ad remain important to the region's economy.\nSnow accumulates in mountains, melting in spring to power both the region's rivers and economy, creating enough hydropower (40% of national total)1 to export 2 to 6 million megawatt hours per month.2 Snowmelt waters crops in the dry interior, helping the region produce tree fruit (number one in the world) and almost $17 billion worth of agricultural commodities, including 55% of potato, 15% of wheat, and 11% of milk production in the United States.3\nSeasonal water patterns shape the life cycles of the region's flora and fauna, including iconic salmon and steelhead, and forested ecosystems, which cover 47% of the landscape.4 Along more than 4,400 miles of coastline, regional economic centers are juxtaposed with diverse habitats and ecosystems that support thousands of species of fish and wildlife, including commercial fish and shellfish resources valued at $480 million in 2011.5\nAdding to the influence of climate, human activities have altered natural habitats, threatened species, and extracted so much water that there are already conflicts among multiple\n\nusers in dry years. More recently, efforts have multiplied to balance environmental restoration and economic growth while evaluating climate risks. As conflicts and tradeoffs increase, the region's population continues to grow, and the regional consequences of climate change continue to unfold. The need to seek solutions to these conflicts is becoming increasingly urgent.\nThe Northwest's economy, infrastructure, natural systems, public health, and vitally important agriculture sector all face important climate change related risks. Those risks \u00ad and possible adaptive responses \u00ad will vary significantly across the region.6 Impacts on infrastructure, natural systems, human health, and economic sectors, combined with issues of social and ecological vulnerability, will play out quite differently in largely natural areas, like the Cascade Range or Crater Lake National Park, than in urban areas like Seattle and Portland (Ch. 11: Urban),7 or among the region's many Native American tribes, like the Umatilla or the Quinault (Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples).8\nAs climatic conditions diverge from those that determined patterns of development and resource use in the last century, and as demographic, economic, and technological changes also stress local systems, efforts to cope with climate change would benefit from an evolving, iterative risk management approach.9\n\n488\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST\n\nObserved Climate Change Temperatures increased across the region from 1895 to 2011, none find statistically significant changes in the Northwest.11 with a regionally averaged warming of about 1.3\u00b0F.10 While These and other climate trends include contributions from precipitation has generally increased, trends are small as both human influences (chiefly heat-trapping gas emissions) compared to natural variability. Both increasing and decreasing and natural climate variability, and consequently are not trends are observed among various locations, seasons, and projected to be uniform or smooth across the country or over time periods of analysis (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figure time (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 3). They are 2.12). Studies of observed changes in extreme precipitation also consistent with expected changes due to human activities use different time periods and definitions of \"extreme,\" but (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 1).\n\nProjected Climate Change\n\nAn increase in average annual temperature of 3.3\u00b0F to 9.7\u00b0F emissions, summer precipitation is projected to decrease by\n\nis projected by 2070 to 2099 (compared to the period 1970 as much as 30% by the end of the century (Ch. 2: Our Changing to 1999), depending largely on total global emissions of heat- Climate).10,12 Northwest summers are already dry and although\n\ntrapping gases. The increases are projected to be largest in a 10% reduction (the average projected change for summer) is\n\nsummer. This chapter examines a range of scenarios, including a small amount of precipitation, unusually dry summers have\n\nones where emissions increase and then decline, leading to lower (B1 and RCP 4.5) and medium (A1B) total emissions, and scenarios where emissions continue to rise with higher\n\nmany noticeable consequences, including low streamflow west of the Cascades13 and greater extent of wildfires throughout the region.14 Note that while projected temperature increases\n\ntotals (A2, A1FI, and RCP 8.5 scenarios). Change in annual are large relative to natural variability, the relatively small\n\naverage precipitation in the Northwest is projected to be projected changes in precipitation are likely to be masked by within a range of an 11% decrease to a 12% increase for 2030 natural variability for much of the century.15\n\nto 2059 and a 10% decrease to an 18% increase for 2070 to 209912 for the B1, A1B, and A2 scenarios (Ch. 2: Our Changing Ongoing research on the implications of these and other\n\nClimate). For every season, some models project decreases changes largely confirms projections and analyses made over\n\nand some project increases (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, the last decade, while providing more information about how Key Message 5),10,12 yet one aspect of seasonal changes in climate impacts are likely to vary from place to place within\n\nprecipitation is largely consistent across climate models: for the region. In addition, new areas of concern, such as ocean\n\nscenarios of continued growth in global heat-trapping gas acidification, have arisen.\n\nKey Message 1: Water-related Challenges\n\nChanges in the timing of streamflow related to changing snowmelt have been observed and will continue, reducing the supply of water for many competing demands and causing farreaching ecological and socioeconomic consequences.\n\nDescription of Observed and Projected Changes\nObserved regional warming has been linked to changes in the\ntiming and amount of water availability in basins with significant\nsnowmelt contributions to streamflow. Since around 1950,\narea-averaged snowpack on April 1 in the Cascade Mountains decreased about 20%,16 spring snowmelt occurred 0 to 30 days earlier depending on location,17 late winter/early spring\nstreamflow increases ranged from 0% to greater than 20% as a fraction of annual flow,18,19 and summer flow decreased 0% to 15% as a fraction of annual flow,17 with exceptions in smaller areas and shorter time periods.20\n\n\u00a9 Dan Sherwood/Design Pics/Corbis\n\nHydrologic response to climate change will depend upon the\ndominant form of precipitation in a particular watershed, as\nwell as other local characteristics including elevation, aspect, geology, vegetation, and changing land use.22 The largest re-\nsponses are expected to occur in basins with significant snow\naccumulation, where warming increases winter flows and advances the timing of spring melt.18,23 By 2050, snowmelt is pro-\n\n489\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST\n\njected to shift three to four weeks earlier than the 20th century average, and summer flows\nare projected to be substantially lower, even\nfor an emissions scenario that assumes substantial emissions reductions (B1).24 In some\nNorth Cascade rivers, a significant fraction\n(10% to 30%) of late summer flow originates as glacier melt;25 the consequences of eventual\nglacial disappearance are not well quantified.\nBasins with a significant groundwater compo-\nnent may be less responsive to climate change than indicated here.26\n\nObserved Shifts in Streamflow Timing\n\nChanges in river-related flood risk depends on many factors, but warming is projected to increase flood risk the most in mixed basins (those with both winter rainfall and late spring snowmelt-related runoff peaks) and remain largely unchanged in snow-dominant basins.27 Regional climate models project increases of 0% to 20% in extreme daily precipitation, depending on location and definition of \"extreme\" (for example, annual wettest day).\n\nFigure 21.1. Reduced June flows in many Northwest snow-fed rivers is a signature of warming in basins that have a significant snowmelt contribution. The fraction of annual flow occurring in June increased slightly in rain-dominated coastal basins and decreased in mixed rain-snow basins and snowmeltdominated basins over the period 1948 to 2008.21 The high flow period is in June for most Northwest river basins; decreases in summer flows can make it more difficult to meet a variety of competing human and natural demands for water. (Figure source: adapted from Fritze et al. 201121).\n\nFuture Shift in Timing of Stream Flows\n\nReduced Summer Flows\n\nFigure 21.2. (Left) Projected increased winter flows and decreased summer flows in many Northwest rivers will cause widespread impacts. Mixed rain-snow watersheds, such as the Yakima River basin, an important agricultural area in eastern Washington, will see increased winter flows, earlier spring peak flows, and decreased summer flows in a warming climate. Changes in average monthly streamflow by the 2020s, 2040s, and 2080s (as compared to the period 1916 to 2006) indicate that the Yakima River basin could change from a snow-dominant to a rain-dominant basin by the 2080s under the A1B emissions scenario (with eventual reductions from current rising emissions trends). (Figure source: adapted from Elsner et al. 2010)24.\n(Right) Natural surface water availability during the already dry late summer period is projected to decrease across most of the Northwest. The map shows projected changes in local runoff (shading) and streamflow (colored circles) for the 2040s (compared to the period 1915 to 2006) under the same scenario as the left figure (A1B).29 Streamflow reductions such as these would stress freshwater fish species (for instance, endangered salmon and bull trout) and necessitate increasing tradeoffs among conflicting uses of summer water. Watersheds with significant groundwater contributions to summer streamflow may be less responsive to climate change than indicated here.26\n\n490\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST\n\nNOAA\n\nAveraged over the region, the number of days with more\nthan one inch of precipitation is projected to increase 13% in\n2041 to 2070 compared with 1971 to 2000 under a scenario\nthat assumes a continuation of current rising emissions trends (A2),10 though these projections are not consistent across models.28 This increase in heavy downpours could increase\nflood risk in mixed rain-snow and rain-dominant basins, and\ncould also increase stormwater management challenges in\nurban areas.\n\nConsequences and Likelihoods of Changes\nReservoir systems have multiple objectives, including irrigation, municipal and industrial use, hydropower production, flood control, and preservation of habitat for aquatic species. Modeling studies indicate, with near 100% likelihood and for all emissions scenarios, that reductions in summer flow will occur by 2050 in basins with significant snowmelt (for example, Elsner et al. 201024). These reduced flows will require more tradeoffs among objectives of the whole system of reservoirs,30 especially with the added challenges of summer increases in electric power demand for cooling31 and additional water consumption by crops and forests.10,32 For example, reductions in hydropower production of as much as 20% by the 2080s could be required to preserve in-stream flow targets for fish in the Columbia River basin.33 Springtime irrigation diversions increased between 1970 and 2007 in the Snake River basin, as earlier snowmelt led to reduced spring soil moisture.34 In the absence of human adaptation, annual hydropower production is much more likely to decrease than to increase in the Columbia River basin; economic impacts of hydropower changes could be hundreds of millions of dollars per year.35\nRegion-wide summer temperature increases and, in certain basins, increased river flooding and winter flows and\n\ndecreased summer flows, will threaten many freshwater species, particularly salmon, steelhead, and trout.27 Rising\ntemperatures will increase disease and/or mortality in several\niconic salmon species, especially for spring/summer Chinook and sockeye in the interior Columbia and Snake River basins.36 Some Northwest streams30 and lakes have already warmed\nover the past three decades, contributing to changes such as earlier Columbia River sockeye salmon migration37 and earlier blooms of algae in Lake Washington.38 Relative to the rest of\nthe United States, Northwest streams dominated by snowmelt\nrunoff appear to be less sensitive, in the short term, to warming\ndue to the temperature buffering provided by snowmelt and groundwater contributions to those streams.39 However, as\nsnowpack declines, the future sensitivity to warming is likely to increase in these areas.40 By the 2080s, suitable habitat for the\nfour trout species of the interior western U.S. is projected to decline 47% on average, compared to the period 1978-1997.41\nAs species respond to climate change in diverse ways, there is\npotential for ecological mismatches to occur \u00ad such as in the timing of the emergence of predators and their prey.38\n\nAdaptive Capacity and Implications for Vulnerability\nThe ability to adapt to climate changes is strengthened operating rules, and other institutional barriers to changing by extensive water resources infrastructure, diversity of operations continue to limit progress towards adaptation in institutional arrangements,42 and management agencies that many parts of the Columbia River basin.43,44 Vulnerability to are responsive to scientific input. However, over-allocation projected changes in snowmelt timing is probably highest in of existing water supply, conflicting objectives, limited basins with the largest hydrologic response to warming and management flexibility caused by rigid water allocation and lowest management flexibility \u00ad that is, fully allocated, mid-\nelevation, temperature-sensitive, mixed rain-snow watersheds with existing conflicts among users of summer water. Regional power planners have expressed concerns over the existing hydroelectric system's potential inability to provide adequate summer electricity given the combination of climate change, demand growth, and operating constraints.1 Vulnerability is probably lowest where hydrologic change is likely to be smallest (in rain-dominant basins) and where institutional arrangements are simple and current natural and human demands rarely exceed current water availability.43,45,46\n\n\u00a9 James Christensen/ Foto Natura/Minden Pictures/Corbis\n\nThe adaptive capacity of freshwater ecosystems also varies and, in managed basins, will depend on the degree to which\n\n491\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST\n\nthe need to maintain streamflows and water quality for fish and wildlife is balanced with human uses of water resources. In highly managed rivers, release of deeper, colder water from reservoirs could offer one of the few direct strategies to\n\nlower water temperatures downstream.47 Actions to improve\nstream habitat, including planting trees for shade, are being\ntested. Some species may be able to change behavior or take advantage of cold-water refuges.48\n\nKey Message 2: Coastal Vulnerabilities\n\nIn the coastal zone, the effects of sea level rise, erosion, inundation, threats to infrastructure and habitat, and increasing ocean acidity collectively pose a major threat to the region.\n\nWith diverse landforms (such as beaches, rocky shorelines, bluffs, and estuaries), coastal and marine ecosystems, and human uses (such as rural communities, dense urban areas, international ports, and transportation), the Northwest coast will experience a wide range of climate impacts.\nDescription of Observed and Projected Changes Global sea levels have risen about 8 inches since 1880 and are projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100 (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10). Many local and regional factors can modify the global trend, including vertical land movement, oceanic winds and circulation, sediment compaction, subterranean fluid withdrawal (such as groundwater and natural gas), and other geophysical factors such as the gravitational effects of major ice sheets and glaciers on regional ocean levels.\n\n\u00a9 Macduff Everton/Corbis\n\nMuch of the Northwest coastline is rising due to a geophysical force known as \"tectonic uplift,\" which raises the land surface. Because of this, apparent sea level rise is less than the currently observed global average. However, a major earthquake along the Cascadia subduction zone, expected within the next few hundred years, would immediately reverse centuries of uplift and, based on historical evidence, increase relative sea level 40 inches or more.49,50 On the other hand, some Puget Sound\n\nlocations are currently experiencing subsidence (where land is sinking or settling) and could see the reverse effect, witnessing immediate uplift during a major earthquake and lowered relative sea levels.51,52\nTaking into account many of these factors and considering a wider range of emissions scenarios than are used in this assessment (Appendix 5: Scenarios and Models), a recent\n\nProjected Relative Sea Level Rise for the Latitude of Newport, Oregon\nFigure 21.3. Projected relative sea level rise for the latitude of Newport, Oregon (relative to the year 2000) is based on a broader suite of emissions scenarios (ranging from B1 to A1FI) and a more detailed and regionally-focused calculation than those generally used in this assessment (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).50 The blue area shows the range of relative sea level rise, and the black line shows the projection, which incorporates global and regional effects of warming oceans, melting land ice, and vertical land movements.50 Given the difficulty of assigning likelihood to any one possible trajectory of sea level rise at this time, a reasonable risk assessment would consider multiple scenarios within the full range of possible outcomes shown, in conjunction with long- and shortterm compounding effects, such as El Ni\u00f1o-related variability and storm surge.

Coastal sea surface temperatures have increased55 and summertime fog has declined between 1900\nand the early 2000s, both of which could be consequences of weaker upwelling winds.56 Projected changes include increasing but highly variable acidity,57,58,59 increasing surface water\ntemperature (2.2\u00b0F from the period 1970 to 1999 to the period 2030 to 2059),60 and possibly changing storminess.61 Climate\nmodels show inconsistent projections for the future of Northwest coastal upwelling.12,62\n\nConsequences and Likelihoods of Changes In Washington and Oregon, more than 140,000 acres of coastal lands lie within 3.3 feet in elevation of high tide.63 As sea levels continue to rise, these areas will be inundated more frequently. Many coastal wetlands, tidal flats, and beaches will probably decline in quality and extent as a result of sea level rise, particularly where habitats cannot shift inland because of topographical limitations or physical barriers resulting from human development. Species such as shorebirds and forage fish (small fish eaten by larger fish, birds, or mammals) would be harmed, and coastal infrastructure and communities would be at greater risk from coastal storms.64\nOcean acidification threatens culturally and commercially significant marine species directly affected by changes in ocean chemistry (such as oysters) and those affected by changes in the marine food web (such as Pacific salmon65). Northwest coastal waters are among the most acidified worldwide, especially in spring and summer with coastal upwelling58,59,66 combined with local factors in estuaries.57,58\nIncreasing coastal water temperatures and changing ecological conditions may alter the ranges, types, and abundances of marine species.67,68 Recent warm periods in the coastal ocean, for example, saw the arrival of subtropical and offshore marine species from zooplankton to top predators such as striped marlin, tuna, and yellowtail more common to the Baja area.69 Warmer water in regional estuaries (such as Puget Sound) may contribute to a higher incidence of harmful blooms of algae linked to paralytic shellfish poisoning,70 and may result in adverse economic impacts from beach closures affecting recreational harvesting of shellfish such as razor clams.71 Toxicity of some harmful algae appears to be increased by acidification.72\n\nFigure 21.4. Areas of Seattle projected by Seattle Public Utilities to be below sea level during high tide (Mean Higher High Water) and therefore at risk of flooding or inundation are shaded in blue under three levels of sea level rise,78 assuming no adaptation. (High [50 inches] and medium [13 inches] levels are within the range projected for the Northwest by 2100; the highest level [88 inches] includes the compounding effect of storm surge, derived from the highest observed historical tide in Seattle79). Unconnected inland areas shown to be below sea level may not be inundated, but could experience problems due to areas of standing water caused by a rise in the water table and drainage pipes backed up with seawater. (Figure source: Seattle Public Utilities80).\nMany human uses of the coast \u00ad for living, working, and recreating \u00ad will also be negatively affected by the physical and ecological consequences of climate change. Erosion, inundation, and flooding will threaten public and private property along the coast; infrastructure, including wastewater treatment plants;7,73 stormwater outfalls;74,75 ferry terminals;76 and coastal road and rail transportation, especially in Puget Sound.77 Municipalities from Seattle74 and Olympia,75 Washington, to Neskowin, Oregon, have mapped risks from the combined effects of sea level rise and other factors.\n\n493\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST\n\nAdaptive Capacity and Implications for Vulnerability\n\nHuman activities have increased the vulnerability of many determine the viability of many shallow-water and estuarine coastal ecosystems, by degrading and eliminating habitat81 and ecosystems.68,82,83 In communities with few alternatives to\n\nby building structures that, along with natural bluffs, thwart existing coastal transportation networks, such as on parts of\n\ninland movement of many remaining habitats.

In Washington's Nisqually River Delta, estuary restoration on a large scale to assist salmon and wildlife recovery provides an example of adaptation to climate change and sea level rise. After a century of isolation behind dikes (left), much of the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge was reconnected with tidal flow in 2009 by removal of a major dike and restoration of 762 acres (right), with the assistance of Ducks Unlimited and the Nisqually Indian Tribe. This reconnected more than 21 miles of historical tidal channels and floodplains with Puget Sound.85 A new exterior dike was constructed to protect freshwater wetland habitat for migratory birds from tidal inundation and future sea level rise. Combined with expansion of the authorized Refuge boundary, ongoing acquisition efforts to expand the Refuge will enhance the ability to provide diverse estuary and freshwater habitats despite rising sea level, increasing river floods, and loss of estuarine habitat elsewhere in Puget Sound. This project is considered a major step in increasing estuary habitat and recovering the greater Puget Sound estuary.

Under\nhigher emissions scenarios, extensive conversion of subalpine forests to other forest types is projected by the 2080s.\n\nEvergreen coniferous forests are a prominent feature of Northwest landscapes, particularly in mountainous areas. Forests support diverse fish and wildlife species, promote\n\nclean air and water, stabilize soils, and store carbon. They support local economies and traditional tribal uses and provide recreational opportunities.\n\n494\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST\n\nDescription of Observed and Projected Changes\nClimate change will alter Northwest forests by increasing wildfire risk and insect and tree disease outbreaks, and by forcing longer-term shifts in forest types and species (see Ch 7: Forests). Many impacts will be driven by water deficits, which increase tree stress and mortality, tree vulnerability to insects, and fuel flammability. The cumulative effects of disturbance \u00ad and possibly interactions between insects and fires \u00ad will cause the greatest changes in Northwest forests.86,87 A similar outlook is expected for the Southwest region (see Ch. 20: Southwest, Key Message 3).\n\nForest Mortality\n\nAlthough wildfires are a natural part of most Northwest\n\nforest ecosystems, warmer and drier conditions have\n\nhelped increase the number and extent of wildfires in western U.S. forests since the 1970s.14,87,88,89 This trend is expected to continue under future climate conditions. By the 2080s, the median annual area burned in the Northwest would quadruple relative to the 1916 to 2007 period to 2 million acres (range of 0.2 to 9.8 million acres) under the A1B scenario. Averaged over the region,\n\nFigure 21.6. Forest mortality due to fire and insect activity is already evident in the Northwest. Continued changes in climate in coming decades are expected to increase these effects. Trees killed by a fire (left side of watershed) and trees killed by mountain pine beetle and spruce beetle infestations (orange and gray patches, right side of watershed) in subalpine forest in the Pasayten Wilderness, Okanogan Wenatchee National Forest, Washington, illustrates how\n\nthis would increase the probability that 2.2 million acres would burn in a year from 5% to nearly 50%.14 Within\n\ncumulative disturbances can affect forests. (Photo credit: Jeremy Littell, USGS).\n\nthe region, this probability will vary substantially with\n\nsensitivity of fuels to climatic conditions and local variability is projected to increase as temperature increases, exposing\n\nin fuel type and amount, which are in turn a product of forest higher-elevation forests to the pine beetle, but ultimately\n\ntype, effectiveness of fire suppression, and land use. For limiting available area as temperatures exceed the beetles' example, in the Western Cascades, the year-to-year variability optimal temperatures.14,92,93 As a result, the proportion of\n\nin area burned is difficult to attribute to climate conditions, Northwest pine forests where mountain pine beetles are most\n\nwhile fire in the eastern Cascades and other specific vegetation zones is responsive to climate.14 How individual fires behave in\nthe future and what impacts they have will depend on factors\n\nlikely to survive is projected to first increase (27% higher in\n2001 to 2030 compared to 1961 to 1990) and then decrease (about 49% to 58% lower by 2071 to 2100).92 For many tree\n\nwe cannot yet project, such as extreme daily weather and species, the most climatically suited areas will shift from their\n\nforest fuel conditions.\n\ncurrent locations, increasing vulnerability to insects, disease,\n\nand fire in areas that become unsuitable. Eighty-five percent of\n\nHigher temperatures and drought stress are contributing to the current range of three species that are host to pine beetles\n\noutbreaks of mountain pine beetles that are increasing pine mortality in drier Northwest forests.90,91 This trend is projected to continue with ongoing warming.14,92,93,94 Between now and\nthe end of this century, the elevation of suitable beetle habitat\n\nis projected to be climatically unsuitable for one or more of those species by the 2060s,14,95 while 21 to 38 currently existing\nplant species may no longer find climatically appropriate habitat in the Northwest by late this century.96\n\nConsequences and Likelihoods of Changes\n\nThe likelihood of increased disturbance (fire, insects, diseases, cannot yet be predicted, but such events could have enormous and other sources of mortality) and altered forest distribution impacts for forest-dependent species.88 Increased wildfire\n\nare very high in areas dominated by natural vegetation, and could exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses in\n\nthe resultant changes in habitat would affect native species nearby populations due to smoke and particulate pollution and ecosystems.

Adaptation actions that decrease forests,111 but may be ineffective in historically high-severityforest vulnerability exist, but none is appropriate across all of fire forests, like the western Cascades, Olympics, and some the Northwest's diverse climate threats, land-use histories, subalpine forests. It is possible to use thinning to reduce tree and management objectives.86,110 Surface and canopy thinning mortality from insect outbreaks,86,112 but not on the scale of can reduce the occurrence and effects of high severity fire in the current outbreaks in much of the West.\nKey Message 4: Adapting Agriculture\n\nWhile the agriculture sector's technical ability to adapt to changing conditions can offset some adverse impacts of a changing climate, there remain critical concerns for agriculture\nwith respect to costs of adaptation, development of more climate resilient technologies and management, and availability and timing of water.\n\nAgriculture provides the economic and cultural foundation for Northwest rural populations and contributes substantively to the overall economy. Agricultural commodities and food\n\nproduction systems contributed 3% and 11% of the region's gross domestic product, respectively, in 2009.113 Although the\noverall consequences of climate change will probably be lower\n\n496\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST\n\nin the Northwest than in certain other regions, sustainability erosion114 and water supply uncertainty, both of which could of some Northwest agricultural sectors is threatened by soil be exacerbated by climate change.\n\nDescription of Observed and Projected Changes\n\nNorthwest agriculture's sensitivity to climate change stems pests, and weeds present additional potential risks.

This process considered the combination of impact likelihood and the consequences for the region's economy, infrastructure, natural systems, human health, and the economically-important and climate sensitive regional agriculture sector (see Dalton et al. 20136 for details). The qualitative comparative risk assessment underlying the key messages in the Northwest chapter was informed by the Northwest Regional Climate Risk Framing workshop (December 2, 2011, in Portland, OR). The workshop brought together stakeholders and scientists from a cross-section of sectors and jurisdictions within the region to discuss and rank the likelihood and consequences for key climate risks facing the Northwest region and previously identified in the Oregon Climate Change Adaptation Framework.122 The approach consisted of an initial qualitative likelihood assessment based on expert judgment and consequence ratings based on the conclusions of a group of experts and assessed for four categories: human health, economy, infrastructure, and natural systems.123\nThis initial risk exercise was continued by the lead author team of the Northwest chapter, resulting in several white papers that were 1) condensed and synthesized into the Northwest chapter, and 2) expanded into a book-length report on Northwest impacts.6 The NCA Northwest chapter author team engaged in multiple technical discussions via regular teleconferences and two all-day meetings. These included careful review of the foundational technical input report123 and approximately 80 additional technical inputs provided to the NCA by the public, as well additional published literature. They also drew heavily from two state climate assessment reports.124\nThe author team identified potential regional impacts by 1) working forward from drivers of regional climate impacts (for example, changes in temperature, precipitation, sea level, ocean chemistry, and storms), and 2) working backward from affected regional sectors (for example, agriculture, natural systems, and energy). The team identified and ranked the relative consequences of each impact for the region's economy, infrastructure, natural systems, and the health of Northwest residents. The likelihood of each\n\nimpact was also qualitatively ranked, allowing identification of the impacts posing the highest risk, that is, likelihood \u00d7 consequence, to the region as a whole. The key regionally consequential risks thus identified are those deriving from projected changes in streamflow timing (in particular, warming-related impacts in watersheds where snowmelt is an important contributor to flow); coastal consequences of the combined impact of sea level rise and other climate-related drivers; and changes in Northwest forest ecosystems. The Northwest chapter therefore focuses on the implications of these risks for Northwest water resources, key aquatic species, coastal systems, and forest ecosystems, as well as climate impacts on the regionally important, climate-sensitive agricultural sector.\nEach author produced a white paper synthesizing the findings in his/her sectoral area, and a number of key messages pertaining to climate impacts in that area. These syntheses were followed by expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors wherein each key message was defended before the entire author team before this key message was selected for inclusion in the report. These discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each message, and they were based on criteria that help define \"key vulnerabilities,\" including likelihood of climate change and relative magnitude of its consequences for the region as a whole, including consequences for the region's economy, human health, ecosystems, and infrastructure.123\nThough the risks evaluated were aggregated over the whole region, it was recognized that impacts, risks, and appropriate adaptive responses vary significantly in local settings. For all sectors, the focus on risks of importance to the region's overall economy, ecology, built environment, and health is complemented, where space allows, by discussion of the local specificity of climate impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptive responses that results from the heterogeneity of Northwest physical conditions, ecosystems, human institutions and patterns of resource use.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nChanges in the timing of streamflow related to changing snowmelt are already observed and will continue, reducing the supply of water for many\n\n507\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST Traceable Accounts\n\ncompeting demands and causing far-reaching Evidence for far-reaching ecological and socioeconomic\n\necological and socioeconomic consequences.\n\nconsequences of the above is based on:\n\nDescription of evidence base This message was selected because of the centrality of the water cycle to many important human and natural systems of the Northwest: hydropower production and the users of this relatively inexpensive electricity; agriculture and the communities and economies dependent thereon, and; coldwater fish, including several species of threatened and endangered salmon, the tribal and fishing communities and ecosystems that depend on them, and the adjustments in human activities and efforts necessary to restore and protect them. Impacts of water-cycle changes on these systems, and any societal adjustments to them, will have far-reaching ecological and socioeconomic consequences.\nEvidence that winter snow accumulation will decline under projected climate change is based on 20th century observations and theoretical studies of the sensitivity of Northwest snowpack to changes in precipitation and temperature. There is good agreement on the physical role of climate in snowpack development, and projections of the sign of future trends are consistent (many studies). However, climate variability creates disagreement over the magnitude of current and near-term future trends.\n\n\u00b7 model simulations showing negative impacts of projected climate and altered streamflow on many water resource uses at scales ranging from individual basins (for example, Skagit, Yakima) to the region (for example, Columbia River basin);\n\u00b7 model simulations of future agricultural water allocation in the Yakima46 and the Snake River Basin,32 showing increased likelihood of water curtailments for junior water rights holders;\n\u00b7 model and empirical studies documenting sensitivity of coldwater fish to water temperatures, sensitivity of water temperature to air temperature, and projected warming of summer stream temperatures;\n\u00b7 regional and extra-regional dependence on Northwestproduced hydropower; and\n\u00b7 legal requirements to manage water resources for threatened & endangered fish as well as for human uses.\nEvidence that water users in managed mixed rain-snow basins are likely to be the most vulnerable to climate change and less vulnerable in rain-dominated basins is based on:\n\nEvidence that projected climate change would shift the timing and amount of streamflow deriving from snowmelt is based on 20th century observations of climate and streamflow and is also based on hydrologic model simulation of streamflow responses to climate variability and change. There is good agreement on the sign of trends (many studies), though the magnitude of current and nearterm future trends is less certain because of climate variability.\nEvidence that declining snowpack and changes in the timing of snowmelt-driven streamflow will reduce water supply for many competing and time-sensitive demands is based on:\n\u00b7 hydrologic simulations, driven by future climate projections, that consistently show reductions in spring and summer flows in mixed rain-snow and some snowdominant watersheds;\n\u00b7 documented competition among existing water uses (irrigation, power, municipal, and in-stream flows) and inability for all water systems to meet all summer water needs all of the time, especially during drier years;\n\u00b7 empirical and theoretical studies that indicate increased water demand for many uses under climate change; and\n\u00b7 policy and institutional analyses of the complex legal and institutional arrangements governing Northwest water management and the challenges associated with adjusting water management in response to changing conditions.\n\n\u00b7 observed, theoretical, and simulated sensitivity of watershed hydrologic response to warming by basin type;\n\u00b7 historical observations and modeled simulations of tradeoffs required among water management objectives under specific climatic conditions;\n\u00b7 analyses from water management agencies of potential system impacts and adaptive responses to projected future climate; and\n\u00b7 institutional and policy analyses documenting sources and types of management rigidity (for example, difficulty adjusting management practices to account for changing conditions).\nNew information and remaining uncertainties A key uncertainty is the degree to which current and future interannual and interdecadal variations in climate will enhance or obscure long-term anthropogenic climate trends.\nUncertainty over local groundwater or glacial inputs and other local effects may cause overestimates of increased stream temperature based solely on air temperature. However, including projected decreases in summer streamflow would increase estimates of summer stream temperature increases above those based solely on air temperature.\nUncertainty in how much increasing temperatures will affect crop evapotranspiration affects future estimates of irrigation demand.\n\n508\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nUncertainty in future population growth and changing per capita water use affects estimates of future municipal demand and therefore assessments of future reliability of water resource systems.\n\nConfidence is very high based on strong strength of evidence and high level of agreement among experts.\nSee specifics under \"description of evidence\" above.\n\nA major uncertainty is the degree to which water resources management operations of regulated systems can be adjusted to account for climate-driven changes in the amount and timing of streamflow, and how competing resource objectives will be accommodated or prioritized. Based on current institutional inertia, significant changes are unlikely to occur for several decades.\nThere is uncertainty in economic assessment of the impacts of hydrologic changes on the Northwest because much of the needed modeling and analysis is incomplete. Economic impacts assessment would require quantifying both potential behavioral responses to future climate-affected economic variables (prices of inputs and products) and to climate change itself. Some studies have sidestepped the issue of behavioral response to these and projected economic impacts based on future scenarios that do not consider adaptation, which lead to high estimates of \"costs\" or impacts.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence and agreement or, if defensible, estimates of the likelihood of impact or consequence\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent\nresults, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods\nvary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\n\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nIn the coastal zone, the effects of sea level rise, erosion, inundation, threats to infrastructure and habitat, and increasing ocean acidity collectively pose a major threat to the region.\nDescription of evidence base Given the extent of the coastline, the importance of coastal systems to the region's ecology, economy, and identity, and the difficulty of adapting in response, the consequences of sea level rise, ocean acidification, and other climate driven changes in ocean conditions and coastal weather are expected to be significant and largely negative, which is why this message was included.\nEvidence for observed global (eustatic) sea level rise and regional sea level change derives from satellite altimetry and coastal tide gauges. Evidence for projected global sea level rise is described in Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, in the recent NRC report50 that includes a detailed discussion of the U.S. West Coast, and Parris et al. 2012.125\nEvidence of erosion associated with coastal storms is based on observations of storm damage in some areas of the Northwest.\nEvidence for erosion and inundation associated with projected sea level rise is based on observations and mapping of coastal elevations and geospatial analyses of the extent and location of inundation associated with various sea level rise and storm surge scenarios.\nEvidence for climate change impacts on coastal infrastructure derives from geospatial analyses (mapping infrastructure locations likely to be affected by various sea level rise scenarios, storm surge scenarios and/or river flooding scenario), such as those undertaken by various local governments to assess local risks of flooding for the downtown area (Olympia), of sea level rise and storm surge for marine shoreline inundation and risk to public utility infrastructure (Seattle \u00ad highest observed tide from NOAA tide gauge added to projected sea levels), and of sea level rise for wastewater treatment plants and associated infrastructure (King County). Vulnerability of coastal transportation infrastructure to climate change has been assessed by combining geospatial risk analyses with expert judgment of asset sensitivity to climate risk and criticality to the transportation system in Washington State and by assessing transportation infrastructure exposure to climate risks associated with sea level rise and river flooding in the region as a whole.\n\n509\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nEvidence for impacts of climate change on coastal habitat is based on:\n\u00b7 model-based studies of projected impacts of sea level rise on tidal habitat showing significant changes in the composition and extent of coastal wetland habitats in Washington and Oregon;\n\u00b7 observations of extent and location of coastal armoring and other structures that would potentially impede inland movement of coastal wetlands;\n\u00b7 observed changes in coastal ocean conditions (upwelling, nutrients, and sea surface temperatures); biogeographical, physiological, and paleoecological studies indicating a historical decline in coastal upwelling; and global climate model projections of future increases in sea surface temperatures;\n\u00b7 modeled projections for increased risk of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Puget Sound associated with higher air and water temperatures, reduced streamflow, low winds, and small tidal variability (i.e., these conditions offer a favorable window of opportunity for HABs); and\n\u00b7 observed changes in the geographic ranges, migration timing, and productivity of marine species due to changes in sea surface temperatures associated with cyclical events, such as the interannual El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation and the inter-decadal Pacific Decadal Oscillation and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation.\nEvidence for historical increases in ocean acidification is from observations of changes in coastal ocean conditions, which also indicate high spatial and temporal variability. Evidence for acidification's effects on various species and the broader marine food web is still emerging but is based on observed changes in abundance, size, and mortality of marine calcifying organisms and laboratory based and in situ acidification experiments.\nEvidence for marine species responses to climate change derives from observations of shifts in marine plankton, fish, and seabird species associated with historical changes in ocean conditions, including temperature and availability of preferred foods.\nEvidence for low adaptive capacity is from observations of extent of degraded or fragmented coastal habitat, existence of few options for mitigating changes in marine chemical properties, observed extent of barriers to inland habitat migration, narrow coastal transportation corridors, and limited transportation alternatives for rural coastal towns. Evidence for low adaptive capacity is also based on the current limitations (both legal and political) of local and state governments to restrict and/or influence shoreline modifications on private lands.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties There is significant but well-characterized uncertainty about the rate and extent of future sea level rise at both the global\n\nand regional/sub-regional scales. However, there is virtually no uncertainty in the direction (sign) of global sea level rise. There is also a solid understanding of the primary contributing factors and mechanisms causing sea level rise. Other details concerning uncertainty in global sea level rise are treated elsewhere (for example, NRC 201250) and in Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). Regional uncertainty in projected Northwest sea level rise results primarily from global factors such as ice sheet mass balance and local vertical land movement (affecting relative sea level rise). An accurate determination of vertical land deformation requires a sufficient density of monitoring sites (for example, NOAA tide gauges and permanent GPS sites that monitor deformation) to capture variations in land deformation over short spatial scales, and in many Northwest coastal locations such dense networks do not exist. There is a general trend, however, of observed uplift along the northwestern portion of the Olympic Peninsula and of subsidence within the Puget Sound region (GPS data gathered from PBO data sets -- http://pbo.unavco.org/data/gps; see also Chapman and Melbourne 200951).\nThere is also considerable uncertainty about potential impacts of climate change on processes that influence storminess and affect coastal erosion in the Northwest. These uncertainties relate to system complexity and the limited number of studies and lack of consensus on future atmospheric and oceanic conditions that will drive changes in regional wind fields. Continued collection and assessment of meteorological data at ocean buoy locations and via remote sensing should improve our understanding of these processes.\nUncertainty in future patterns of sediment delivery to the coastal system limit projections of future inundation, erosion, and changes in tidal marsh. For example, substantial increases in riverine sediment delivery, due to climate-related changes in the amount and timing of streamflow, could offset erosion and/or inundation projected from changes in sea level alone. However, there are areas in the Northwest where it is clear that man-made structures have interrupted sediment supply and there is little uncertainty that shallow water habitat will be lost.\nAlthough relatively well-bounded, uncertainty over the rate of projected relative sea level rise limits our ability to assess whether any particular coastal habitat will be able to keep pace with future changes through adaptation (for example, through accretion).\nThe specific implications of the combined factors of sea level rise, coastal climate change, and ocean acidification for coastal ecosystems and specific individual species remain uncertain due to the complexity of ecosystem response. However, there is general agreement throughout the peer-reviewed literature that negative impacts for a number of marine calcifying organisms are projected, particularly during juvenile life stages.\n\n510\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nProjections of future coastal ocean conditions (for example, temperature, nutrients, pH, and productivity) are limited, in part, by uncertainty over future changes in upwelling \u00ad climate model scenarios show inconsistent projections for likely future upwelling conditions. Considerable uncertainty also remains in whether, and how, higher average ocean temperatures will influence geographical ranges, abundances, and diversity of marine species, although evidence of changes in pelagic fish species ranges and in production associated with Pacific Ocean temperature variability during cyclical events have been important indicators for potential species responses to climate change in the future. Consequences from ocean acidification for commercial fisheries and marine food web dynamics are potentially very high \u00ad while the trend of increasing acidification is very likely, the rate of change and spatial variability within coastal waters are largely unknown and are the subject of ongoing and numerous nascent research efforts.\nAdditional uncertainty surrounds non-climate contributors to coastal ocean chemistry (for example, riverine inputs, anthropogenic carbon, and nitrogen point and non-point source inputs) and society's ability to mitigate these inputs.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence and agreement or, if defensible, estimates of the likelihood of impact or consequence There is very high confidence in the global upward trend of sea level rise (SLR) and ocean acidification (OA). There is high confidence that SLR over the next century will remain under an upper bound of approximately 2 meters. Projections for SLR and OA at specific locations are much less certain (medium to low) because of the high spatial variability and multiple factors influencing both phenomena at regional and sub-regional scales.\nThere is medium confidence in the projections of species response to sea level rise and increased temperatures, but low confidence in species response to ocean acidification. Uncertainty in upwelling changes result in low confidence for projections of future change that depend on specific coastal ocean temperatures, nutrient contents, dissolved oxygen content, stratification, and other factors.\nThere is high confidence that significant changes in the type and distribution of coastal marsh habitat are likely, but low confidence in our current ability to project the specific location and timing of changes.\nThere is high confidence in the projections of increased erosion and inundation.\nThere is very high confidence that ocean acidity will continue to increase.\n\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nThe combined impact of increasing wildfire, insect outbreaks, and tree diseases are already causing widespread tree die-off and are virtually certain to cause additional forest mortality by the 2040s and long-term transformation of forest landscapes. Under higher emissions scenarios, extensive conversion of subalpine forests to other forest types is projected by the 2080s.\nDescription of evidence base Evidence that the area burned by fire has been high, relative to earlier in the century, since at least the 1980s is strong. Peerreviewed papers based on federal fire databases (for example, National Interagency Fire Management Integrated Database [NIFMID], 1970/1980-2011) and independent satellite data (Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity [MTBS], 1984-2011) indicate increases in area burned.98,126\nEvidence that the interannual variation in area burned was at least partially controlled by climate during the period 1980-2010 is also strong. Statistical analysis has shown that increased temperature (related to increased potential evapotranspiration, relative humidity, and longer fire seasons) and decreased precipitation (related to decreased actual evapotranspiration, decreased spring snowpack, and longer fire seasons) are moderate to strong (depending on forest type) correlates to the area and number of fires in the Pacific Northwest. Projections of area burned with climate change are documented in peer-reviewed literature, and different approaches (statistical modeling and dynamic global vegetation modeling) agree on the order of magnitude of those changes for Pacific Northwest forests, though the degree of increase depends on the climate change scenario and modeling approach.\nEvidence from aerial disease and detection surveys jointly coordinated by the U.S. Forest Service and state level governments supports the statement that the area of forest mortality caused by insect outbreaks (including the mountain pine beetle) and by tree diseases is increasing.\nEvidence that mountain pine beetle and spruce bark beetle outbreaks are climatically controlled is from a combination of laboratory experiments and mathematical modeling reported in peer-reviewed literature. Peer-reviewed future projections of climate have been used to develop projections of mountain pine beetle and spruce beetle habitat suitability based on these models, and show increases in the area of climatically suitable habitat (particularly at mid- to high elevations) by the mid-21st century, but subsequent (late 21st century) declines in suitable habitat, particularly at low- to mid-elevation. There is considerable spatial variability in the patterns of climatically suitable habitat.\n\n511\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nEvidence for long-term changes in the distribution of vegetation types and tree species comes from statistical species models, dynamic vegetation models, and other approaches and uses the correlation between observed climate and observed vegetation distributions to model future climatic suitability. These models agree broadly in their conclusions that future climates will be unsuitable for historically present species over significant areas of their ranges and that broader vegetation types will likely change, but the details depend greatly on climate change scenario, location within the region, and forest type.\nEvidence that subalpine forests are likely to undergo almost complete conversion to other vegetation types is moderately strong (relatively few studies, but good agreement) and comes from dynamic global vegetation models that include climate, statistical models that relate climate and biome distribution, and individual statistical species distribution models based on climatic variables. The fact that these three different approaches generally agree about the large decrease in area of subalpine forests despite different assumptions, degrees of \"mechanistic\" simulation, and levels of ecological hierarchy justifies the key message.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The key uncertainties are primarily the timing and magnitude of future projected changes in forests, rather than the direction (sign) of changes.\nThe rate of expected change is affected by the rate of climate change \u00ad higher emissions scenarios have higher impacts earlier in studies that consider multiple scenarios. Most impacts analyses reported in the literature and synthesized here use emissions scenario A1B or A2. Projections of changes in the proportion of Northwest pine forests where mountain pine beetles are likeliest to survive and of potential conversion of subalpine forests used scenario A2.\nStatistical fire models do not include changes in vegetation that occur in the 21st century due to disturbance (such as fire, insects, and tree diseases) and other factors such as land-use change and fire suppression changes. As conditions depart from the period used for model training, projections of future fire become more uncertain, and by the latter 21st century (beyond about the 2060s to 2080s), statistical models may over-predict area burned. Despite this uncertainty, the projections from statistical models are broadly similar to those from dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), which explicitly simulate changes in future vegetation. A key difference is for forest ecosystems where fire has been rare since the mid 20th century, such as the Olympic Mountains and Oregon coast range, and statistical models are comparatively weak. In these systems, statistical fire models likely underestimate the future area burned, whereas DGVMs may capably simulate future events that are outside the range of the statistical model's capability. In any case, an increase in forest area burned is nearly ubiquitous in these studies regardless of method, but the\n\namount of increase and the degree to which it varies with forest type is less certain. However, fire risk in any particular location or at any particular time is beyond the capability of current model projections. In addition, the statistical model approaches to future fire cannot address fundamental changes in fire behavior due to novel extreme weather patterns, so conclusions about changes in fire severity are not necessarily warranted.\nOnly a few insects have had sufficient study to understand their climatic linkages, and future insect outbreak damage from other insects, currently unstudied, could increase the estimate of future areas of forest mortality due to insects.\nFire-insect interactions and diseases are poorly studied \u00ad the actual effects on future landscapes could be greater if diseases and interactions were considered more explicitly.\nFor subalpine forests, what those forests become instead of subalpine forests is highly uncertain \u00ad different climate models used to drive the same dynamic global vegetation model agree about loss of subalpine forests, but disagree about what will replace them. In addition, statistical approaches that consider biome level and species level responses without the ecological process detail of DGVMs show similar losses, but do not agree on responses, which depend on climate scenarios. Because these statistical models simulate neither the regeneration of seedlings nor the role of disturbances, the future state of the system is merely correlative and based on the statistical relationship between climate and historical forest distribution.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence and agreement or, if defensible, estimates of the likelihood of impact or consequence The observed effects of climate on fires and insects combined with the agreement of future projections across modeling efforts warrants very high confidence that increased disturbance will increase forest mortality due to area burned by fire, and increases in insect outbreaks also have very high confidence until at least the 2040s in the Northwest. The timing and nature of the rates and the sources of mortality may change, but current estimates may be conservative for insect outbreaks due to the unstudied impacts of other insects. But in any case, the rate of projected forest disturbance suggests that changes will be driven by disturbance more than by gradual changes in forest cover or species composition. After mid-21st century, uncertainty about the interactions between disturbances and landscape response limits confidence to high because total area disturbed could begin to decline as most of the landscape becomes outside the range of historical conditions. The fact that different modeling approaches using a wide variety of climate scenarios indicate similar losses of subalpine forests justifies high confidence; however, comparatively little research that simulates ecological processes of both disturbance and regeneration as a function of climate, so there is low confidence on what will replace them.\n\n512\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f21: NORTHWEST Traceable Accounts\n\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nWhile agriculture's technical ability to adapt to changing conditions can offset some of the adverse impacts of a changing climate, there remain critical concerns for agriculture with respect to costs of adaptation, development of more climate resilient technologies and management, and availability and timing of water.\nDescription of evidence base Northwest agriculture's sensitivity to climate change stems from its dependence on irrigation water, adequate temperatures, precipitation and growing seasons, and the sensitivity of crops to temperature extremes. Projected warming trends based on global climate models and emissions scenarios potentially increase temperature-related stress on annual and perennial crops in the summer months.\nEvidence for projected impacts of warming on crop yields consists primarily of published studies using crop models indicating increasing vulnerability with projected warming over 1975-2005 baselines. These models also project that thermal-stress-related losses in agricultural productivity will be offset or overcompensated by fertilization from accompanying increases in atmospheric CO2. These models have been developed for key commodities including wheat, apples, and potatoes. Longer term, to end of century, models project crop losses from temperature stress to exceed the benefits of CO2 fertilization.\nEvidence for the effects of warming on suitability of parts of the region for specific wine grape and tree fruit varieties are based on well-established and published climatic requirements for these varieties.\nEvidence for negative impacts of increased variability of precipitation on livestock productivity due to stress on range and pasture consists of a few economic studies in states near the region; relevance to Northwest needs to be established.\nEvidence for negative impacts of warming on dairy production in the region is based on a published study examining projected summer heat-stress on milk production.\nEvidence for reduction in available irrigation water is based on peer-reviewed publications and state and federal agency reports utilizing hydrological models and precipitation and snowpack projections. These are outlined in more detail in the traceable account for Key Message 1 of this chapter. Increased demands for irrigation water with warming are based on cropping systems models and projected increases in acres cultivated. These projections, coupled with those for water supply, indicate that some areas will experience increased water shortages. Water\n\nrights records allow predictions of the users most vulnerable to the effects of these shortages.\nProjections for surface water flows include decreases in summer flow related to changes in snowpack dynamics and reductions in summer precipitation. Although these precipitation projections are less certain than those concerning temperatures, they indicate that water shortages for irrigation will be more frequent in some parts of the region, based especially on a Washington State Department of Ecology-sponsored report that considered the Columbia basin. Other evidence for these projected changes in water is itemized in Key Message 1 of this chapter.\nEvidence that agriculture has a high potential for autonomous adaptation to climate change, assuming adequate water availability, is inferred primarily from the wide range of production practices currently being used across the varied climates of the region.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Although increasing temperatures can affect the distribution of certain pest, weed, and pathogen species, existing models are limited. Without more comprehensive studies, it is not possible to project changes in overall pressure from these organisms, so overall effects remain uncertain. Some species may be adversely affected by warming directly or through enhancement of their natural enemy base, while others become more serious threats.\nUncertainty exists in models in how increasing temperatures will impact crop evapotranspiration, which affects future estimates of irrigation demand (Key Message 1 of this chapter).\nShifting international market forces including commodity prices and input costs, adoption of new crops, which may have different heat tolerance or water requirements, and technological advances are difficult or impossible to project, but may have substantial effects on agriculture's capacity to adapt to climate change.\nEstimates of changes in crop yields as a result of changing climate and CO2 are based on very few model simulations, so the uncertainty has not been well quantified.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence and agreement or, if defensible, estimates of the likelihood of impact or consequence Confidence is very high based on strong strength of evidence and high level of agreement among experts.\nSee specifics under \"description of evidence\" above.\n\n513\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 22 ALASKA\nConvening Lead Authors\nF.

Arctic summer sea ice is receding faster than previously projected and is expected to virtually disappear before mid-century. This is altering marine ecosystems and leading to greater ship access, offshore development opportunity, and increased community vulnerability to coastal erosion.\n2. Most glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia are shrinking substantially. This trend is expected to continue and has implications for hydropower production, ocean circulation patterns, fisheries, and global sea level rise.\n3. Permafrost temperatures in Alaska are rising, a thawing trend that is expected to continue,  causing multiple vulnerabilities through drier landscapes, more wildfire, altered wildlife habitat,  increased cost of maintaining infrastructure, and the release of heat-trapping gases that increase climate warming.\n4. Current and projected increases in Alaska's ocean temperatures and changes in ocean chemistry are expected to alter the distribution and productivity of Alaska's marine fisheries, which lead the U.S. in commercial value.\n5. The cumulative effects of climate change in Alaska strongly affect Native communities, which are highly vulnerable to these rapid changes but have a deep cultural history of adapting to change.\n\nAlaska is the United States' only Arctic region. Its marine, tundra, boreal (northern) forest, and rainforest ecosystems differ from most of those in other states and are relatively intact. Alaska is home to millions of migratory birds, hundreds of thousands of caribou, some of the world's largest salmon runs, a significant proportion of the nation's marine mammals, and half of the nation's fish catch.1\nEnergy production is the main driver of the state's economy, providing more than 80% of state government revenue and\n\nthousands of jobs.2 Continuing pressure for oil, gas, and mineral development on land and offshore in ice-covered waters increases the demand for infrastructure, placing additional stresses on ecosystems. Land-based energy exploration will be affected by a shorter season when ice roads are viable, yet reduced sea ice extent may create more opportunity for offshore development. Climate also affects hydropower generation.3 Mining and fishing are the second and third largest industries in the state, with tourism rapidly increasing since the 1990s.2 Fisheries are vulnerable to changes in fish abundance and dis-\n\n\u00a9 Bryan F.

Tourism might respond positively to warmer springs and autumns4 but negatively to less favorable conditions for winter activities and increased summer smoke from wildfire.5\nAlaska is home to 40% (229 of 566) of the federally recognized tribes in the United States.6 The small number of jobs, high cost of living, and rapid social change make rural, predominantly Native, communities highly vulnerable to climate change through impacts on traditional hunting and fishing and cultural connec-\n\ntion to the land and sea. Because most of these communities are not connected to the state's road system or electrical grid, the cost of living is high, and it is challenging to supply food, fuel, materials, health care, and other services. Climate impacts on these communities are magnified by additional social and economic stresses. However, Alaskan Native communities have for centuries dealt with scarcity and high environmental variability and thus have deep cultural reservoirs of flexibility and adaptability.\n\nObserved Climate Change\nOver the past 60 years, Alaska has warmed more than twice as its cooler phase in the early 2000s.8 The overall warming has rapidly as the rest of the United States, with state-wide average involved more extremely hot days and fewer extremely cold annual air temperature increasing by 3\u00b0F and average winter days (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 7).7,9 temperature by 6\u00b0F, with substantial year-to-year and regional variability.7 Most of the warming occurred around 1976 dur- Because of its cold-adapted features and rapid warming, cliing a shift in a long-lived climate pattern (the Pacific Decadal mate change impacts on Alaska are already pronounced, inOscillation [PDO]) from a cooler pattern to a warmer one. The cluding earlier spring snowmelt, reduced sea ice, widespread PDO has been shown to alternate over time between warm glacier retreat, warmer permafrost, drier landscapes, and more and cool phases. The underlying long-term warming trend has extensive insect outbreaks and wildfire, as described below. moderated the effects of the more recent shift of the PDO to\n\nProjected Climate Change\n\nAverage annual temperatures in Alaska are projected to rise by an additional 2\u00b0F to 4\u00b0F by 2050. If global emissions continue to increase during this century, temperatures can be expected to rise 10\u00b0F to 12\u00b0F in the north, 8\u00b0F to 10\u00b0F in the interior, and 6\u00b0F to 8\u00b0F in the rest of the state. Even with substantial emissions reductions, Alaska is projected to warm by 6\u00b0F to 8\u00b0F in the north and 4\u00b0F to 6\u00b0F in the rest of the state by the end of the century (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 3).7,10\n\nAlaska Will Continue to Warm Rapidly\n\nAnnual precipitation is projected to increase, especially in northwestern Alaska,7 as part of\nthe broad pattern of increases projected for\nhigh northern latitudes. Annual precipitation in-\ncreases of about 15% to 30% are projected for\nthe region by late this century if global emissions\ncontinue to increase (A2). All models project increases in all four seasons.7 However, increases in\nevaporation due to higher air temperatures and\nlonger growing seasons are expected to reduce water availability in most of the state.11\n\nThe length of the growing season in interior Alaska has increased 45% over the last century12 and that trend is projected to continue.13 This could\nimprove conditions for agriculture where mois-\nture is adequate, but will reduce water storage\nand increase the risks of more extensive wildfire and insect outbreaks across much of Alaska.14,15\n\nFigure 22.1. Northern latitudes are warming faster than more temperate regions, and Alaska has already warmed much faster than the rest of the country. Maps show changes in temperature, relative to 1971-1999, projected for Alaska in the early, middle, and late parts of this century, if heat-trapping gas (also known as greenhouse gas) emissions continue to increase (higher emissions, A2), or are substantially reduced (lower emissions, B1).

This is altering marine\necosystems and leading to greater ship access, offshore development opportunity, and increased community vulnerability to coastal erosion.\n\nArctic sea ice extent and thickness have declined substantially, especially in late summer (September), when there is now only about half as much sea ice as at the beginning of the satellite record in 1979 (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 11).17,18 The seven Septembers with the lowest ice extent all occurred in the past seven years. As sea ice declines, it becomes thinner, with less ice build-up over multiple years, and therefore more vulnerable to further melting.18 Models that best match historical trends project northern waters that are virtually ice-free by late summer by the 2030s.19,20 Within the general downward trend in sea ice, there will be time periods\nDeclining Sea Ice Extent\n\nwith both rapid ice loss and temporary recovery,21 making it challenging to predict short-term changes in ice conditions.\nReductions in sea ice increase the amount of the sun's energy that is absorbed by the ocean. This leads to a self-reinforcing climate cycle, because the warmer ocean melts more ice, leaving more dark open water that gains even more heat. In autumn and winter, there is a strong release of this extra ocean heat back to the atmosphere. This is a key driver of the observed increases in air temperature in the Arctic.23 This strong warming linked to ice loss can influence atmospheric circulation and patterns of precipitation, both within and beyond the Arctic (for example, Porter et al. 201224). There is growing evidence that this has already occurred25 through more evaporation from the ocean, which increases water vapor in the lower atmosphere26 and autumn cloud cover west and north of Alaska.27\n\nWith reduced ice extent, the Arctic Ocean is more accessible for marine traffic, including trans-Arctic shipping, oil and gas\n\nSea Ice Loss Brings Big Changes to Arctic Life\n\nFigure 22.2. Average September extent of Arctic sea ice in 1980 (second year of satellite record and year of greatest September sea ice extent; outer red boundary), 1998 (about halfway through the time series; outer pink boundary) and 2012 (recent year of record and year of least September sea ice extent; outer white boundary). September is typically the month when sea ice is least extensive. Inset is the complete time series of average September sea ice extent (1979-2013). (Figure source: NSIDC 2012; Data from Fetterer et al. 201322).\n\nFigure 22. 3. Reductions in sea ice alter food availability for many species from polar bear to walrus, make hunting less safe for Alaska Native hunters, and create more accessibility for Arctic Ocean marine transport, requiring more Coast Guard coverage.

A seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean also increases sovereignty and security concerns as a result of potential new international disputes and increased possibilities for marine traffic between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.10\nPolar bears are one of the most sensitive Arctic marine mammals to climate warming because they spend most of their lives on sea ice.29 Declining sea ice in northern Alaska is associated with smaller bears, probably because of less successful hunting of seals, which are themselves ice-dependent and so are projected to decline with diminishing ice and snow cover.30 Although bears can give birth to cubs on sea ice, increasing numbers of female bears now come ashore in Alaska in the summer and fall31 and den on land.32 In Hudson Bay, Canada,\n\nthe most studied population in the Arctic, sea ice is now absent for three weeks longer than just a few decades ago, resulting in less body fat, reduced survival of both the youngest and oldest bears,33 and a population now estimated to be in decline34 and projected to be in jeopardy.35 Similar polar bear population declines are projected for the Beaufort Sea region.36\nWalrus depend on sea ice as a platform for giving birth, nursing, and resting between dives to the seafloor, where they feed.37 In recent years, when summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea retreated over waters that were too deep for walrus to feed,38 large numbers of walrus abandoned the ice and came ashore. The high concentration of animals results in increased competition for food and can lead to stampedes when animals are startled, resulting in trampling of calves.39 This movement to land first occurred in 2007 and has happened three times since then, suggesting a threshold change in walrus ecology.\n\nLiving on the front lines of climate change\n\n\"Not that long ago the water was far from our village and could not be easily seen from our homes. Today the weather is changing and is slowly taking away our village. Our boardwalks are warped, some of our buildings tilt, the land is sinking and falling away, and the water is close to our homes. The infrastructure that supports our village is compromised and affecting the health and well-being of our community members, especially our children.\"\n\n\n\n\u00ad Alaska Department of Commerce and Community and Economic Development, 201244\n\nNewtok, a Yup'ik Eskimo community on the seacoast of western Alaska, is on the front lines of climate change. Between\n\nOctober 2004 and May 2006, three storms accelerated the erosion and repeatedly \"flooded the village water supply,\n\ncaused raw sewage to be spread throughout the community, displaced residents from homes, destroyed subsistence food storage, and shut down essential utilities.\"45 The village\n\nlandfill, barge ramp, sewage treatment facility, and fuel storage facilities were destroyed or severely damaged.46 The loss of the\n\nNewtok, Alaska\n\nbarge landing, which delivered most supplies and heating fuel,\n\ncreated a fuel crisis. Saltwater is intruding into the community\n\nwater supply. Erosion is projected to reach the school, the larg-\n\nest building in the community, by 2017.\n\nRecognizing the increasing danger from coastal erosion, Newtok has worked for a generation to relocate to a safer location. However, current federal legislation does not authorize federal or state agencies to assist communities in relocating, nor does it authorize them to repair or upgrade storm-damaged infrastructure in flood-prone locations like Newtok.42 Newtok therefore cannot safely remain in its current location nor can it access public funds to adapt to climate change through relocation.\nNewtok's situation is not unique. At least two other Alaskan communities, Shishmaref and Kivalina, also face immediate threat from coastal erosion and are seeking to relocate, but have been unsuccessful in doing so. Many of the world's largest cities are coastal and are also exposed to climate change induced flood risks.47\n\nFigure 22.4. Residents in Newtok, Alaska are living with the effects of climate change, with thawing permafrost, tilting houses, sinking boardwalks, in conjunction with aging fuel tanks and other infrastructure that cannot be replaced because of laws that prevent public investment in flood-prone localities.

Chapin III).\n\n518\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f22: ALASKA\n\nWith the late-summer ice edge located farther north than it\nused to be, storms produce larger waves and more coastal erosion.10 An additional contributing factor is that coastal bluffs\nthat were \"cemented\" by ice-rich permafrost are beginning\nto thaw in response to warmer air and ocean waters, and are therefore more vulnerable to erosion.40 Standard defensive\nadaptation strategies to protect coastal communities from\n\nerosion, such as use of rock walls, sandbags, and riprap, have been largely unsuccessful.41 Several coastal communities are\nseeking to relocate to escape erosion that threatens infra-\nstructure and services but, because of high costs and policy\nconstraints on use of federal funds for community relocation,\nonly one Alaskan village has begun to relocate (see also Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples).42,43\n\nKey Message 2: Shrinking Glaciers\n\nMost glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia are shrinking substantially. This trend is expected to continue and has implications for hydropower production,\nocean circulation patterns, fisheries, and global sea level rise.\n\nAlaska is home to some of the largest glaciers and fastest loss of glacier ice on Earth.48,49,50 This rapid ice loss is primarily a\nresult of rising temperatures (for example, Arendt et al. 2002, 200951,52,53; Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 11). Loss\nof glacial volume in Alaska and neighboring British Columbia,\nCanada, currently contributes 20% to 30% as much surplus\nfreshwater to the oceans as does the Greenland Ice Sheet \u00ad about 40 to 70 gigatons per year,49,54,55,56 comparable to 10% of the annual discharge of the Mississippi River.57 Glaciers\ncontinue to respond to climate warming for years to decades\nafter warming ceases, so ice loss is expected to continue, even\nif air temperatures were to remain at current levels. The global\ndecline in glacial and ice-sheet volume is predicted to be one\n\nof the largest contributors to global sea level rise during this century (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10).58,59\nWater from glacial landscapes is also recognized as an important source of organic carbon,60,61 phosphorus,62 and iron63 that contribute to high coastal productivity, so changes in these inputs could alter critical nearshore fisheries.61,64\nGlaciers supply about half of the total freshwater input to the Gulf of Alaska.65 Glacier retreat currently increases river discharge and hydropower potential in south central and southeast Alaska, but over the longer term might reduce water input to reservoirs and therefore hydropower resources.3\n\nPhoto by glaciologist William O.

Molnia of the United States Geological Survey.)\n\n519\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f22: ALASKA\n\nKey Message 3: Thawing Permafrost\n\nPermafrost temperatures in Alaska are rising, a thawing trend that is expected to continue, causing multiple vulnerabilities through drier landscapes, more\nwildfire, altered wildlife habitat, increased cost of maintaining infrastructure, and the release of heat-trapping gases that increase climate warming.\n\nAlaska differs from most of the rest of the U.S. in having per-\nmafrost \u00ad frozen ground that restricts water drainage and\ntherefore strongly influences landscape water balance and the\ndesign and maintenance of infrastructure. Permafrost near the Alaskan Arctic coast has warmed 4\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F at 65 foot depth66,67\nsince the late 1970s and 6\u00b0F to 8\u00b0F at 3.3 foot depth since the mid-1980s.68 In Alaska, 80% of land is underlain by perma-\nfrost, and of this, more than 70% is vulnerable to subsidence\nupon thawing because of ice content that is either variable, moderate, or high.69 Thaw is already occurring in interior and\nsouthern Alaska and in northern Canada, where permafrost temperatures are near the thaw point.70 Models project that permafrost in Alaska will continue to thaw,71,72 and some mod-\nels project that near-surface permafrost will be lost entirely from large parts of Alaska by the end of the century.73\n\nland loss would also reduce waterfowl harvest in Alaska, where it is an important food source for Alaska Natives and other rural residents.\nBoth wetland drying and the increased frequency of warm dry summers and associated thunderstorms have led to more large fires in the last ten years than in any decade since recordkeeping began in the 1940s.14 In Alaskan tundra, which was too cold and wet to support extensive fires for approximately the last 5,000 years,84 a single large fire in 2007 released as much carbon to the atmosphere as had been absorbed by the entire circumpolar Arctic tundra during the previous quartercentury.85 Even if climate warming were curtailed by reducing heat-trapping gas (also known as greenhouse gas) emissions (as in the B1 scenario), the annual area burned in Alaska is pro-\n\nUneven sinking of the ground in response to per-\nmafrost thaw is estimated to add between $3.6\nand $6.1 billion (10% to 20%) to current costs of\nmaintaining public infrastructure such as build-\nings, pipelines, roads, and airports over the next 20 years.74 In rural Alaska, permafrost thaw will\nlikely disrupt community water supplies and sewage systems,75,76,77 with negative effects on human health.78 The period during which oil and gas\nexploration is allowed on tundra has decreased\nby 50% since the 1970s as a result of permafrost vulnerability.11\n\nThe Big Thaw\n\nOn average, lakes have decreased in area in the\nlast 50 years in the southern two-thirds of Alaska,80,81,82 due to a combination of permafrost thaw,\ngreater evaporation in a warmer climate, and in-\ncreased soil organic accumulation during a longer\nseason for plant growth. In some places, however,\nlakes are getting larger because of lateral permafrost degradation.81 Future permafrost thaw\nwill likely increase lake area in areas of continu-\nous permafrost and decrease lake area in places where the permafrost zone is more fragmented.71\n\nA continuation of the current drying of Alaskan lakes and wetlands could affect waterfowl management nationally because Alaska accounts for 81% of the National Wildlife Refuge System and provides breeding habitat for millions of migratory birds that winter in more southerly regions of North America and on other continents.83 Wet-\n\nFigure 22.5.

In addition, thick smoke produced in years of extensive wildfire represents a human health risk (Ch. 9: Human Health). More extensive and severe wildfires could shift the forests of Interior Alaska during this century from dominance by spruce to broadleaf trees for the first time in the past 4,000 to 6,000 years.87,88\n\nMounting Expenses from Permafrost Thawing\n\nWildfire has mixed effects on habitat. It gener-\n\nally improves habitat for berries, mushrooms, and moose,58,89 but reduces winter habitat for\n\ncaribou because lichens, a key winter food\n\nsource for caribou, require 50 to 100 years to recover after wildfire.90 These habitat changes are\n\nnutritionally and culturally significant for Alaska Native Peoples.89,91 In addition, exotic plant spe-\ncies that were introduced along roadways are\nnow spreading onto river floodplains and recently burned forests,92 potentially changing the\nsuitability of these lands for timber production\nand wildlife. Some invasive species are toxic to moose, on which local people depend for food.93\n\nFigure 22.6. Effects of permafrost thaw on houses in interior Alaska (2001, top left), roads in eastern Alaska (1982, top right), and the estimated costs (with and without climate change) of replacing public infrastructure in Alaska, assuming a mid-range emissions scenario (A1B, with some decrease from current emissions growth trends).

Figure source: adapted from Larsen and Goldsmith 200779).\nDrying Lakes and Changing Habitat\n\nChanges in terrestrial ecosystems in Alaska and\n\nthe Arctic may be influencing the global climate\n\nsystem. Permafrost soils throughout the entire\n\nArctic contain almost twice as much carbon as the atmosphere.94 Warming and thawing of\n\nthese soils increases the release of carbon diox-\n\nide and methane through increased decomposi-\n\ntion. Thawing permafrost also delivers organic-\n\nrich soils to lake bottoms, where decomposition\n\nin the absence of oxygen releases additional methane.95 Extensive wildfires also release carbon that contributes to climate warming.86,96\n\nThe capacity of the Yukon River Basin in Alaska\n\nand adjacent Canada to store carbon has been\n\nsubstantially weakened since the 1960s by the\n\ncombination of warming and thawing of permafrost and by increased wildfire.97 Expansion of\n\ntall shrubs and trees into tundra makes the sur-\nface darker and rougher, increasing absorption\nof the sun's energy and further contributing to warming.98 This warming is likely stronger than\n\nFigure 22.7.

For example, reductions in seasonal sea ice cover and higher surface temperatures may open up new habitat in polar regions for some important fish species, such as cod, herring, and pollock.106 However, continued presence of cold bottom-water temperatures on the Alaskan continental shelf could limit northward migration into the northern\n\nBering Sea and Chukchi Sea off northwestern Alaska.107 In addition, warming may cause reductions in the abundance of some species, such as pollock, in their current ranges in the Bering Sea108 and reduce the health of juvenile sockeye salmon, potentially resulting in decreased overwinter survival.109 If ocean warming continues, it is unlikely that current fishing pressure on pollock can be sustained.110 Higher temperatures are also likely to increase the frequency of early Chinook salmon migrations, making management of the fishery by multiple user groups more challenging.111\nThe changing temperature and chemistry of the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea are likely changing their role in global ocean circulation and as carbon sinks for atmospheric CO2 respectively, although the importance of these changes in the global carbon budget remains unresolved. The North Pacific Ocean is particularly susceptible to ocean acidification (see also Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 12; Ch. 24: Oceans).112 Acidifying changes in ocean chemistry have potentially widespread impacts on the marine food web, including commercially important species.\n\nOcean acidification in alaska\nOcean waters globally have become 30% more acidic due to absorption of large amounts of human-produced carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. This CO2 interacts with ocean water to form carbonic acid that lowers the ocean's pH (ocean acidification). The polar ocean is particularly prone to acidification because of low temperature113,114 and low salt content, the latter resulting from the large freshwater input from melting sea ice115 and large rivers. Acidity reduces the capacity of key plankton species and shelled animals to form and maintain shells and other hard parts, and therefore alters the food available to important fish species.113,116 The rising acidity will have particularly strong societal effects on the Bering Sea on Alaska's west coast because of its high-productivity commercial and subsistence fisheries.102,117\nShelled pteropods, which are tiny planktonic snails near the base of the food chain, respond quickly to acidifying conditions and are an especially critical link in high-latitude food webs, as commercially important species such as pink salmon depend heavily on them for food.118 A 10% decrease in the population of pteropods could mean a 20% decrease in an adult pink salmon's body weight.119 Pteropod consumption by juvenile pink salmon in the northern Gulf of Alaska varied 45% between 1999 and 2001, although the reason for this variation is unknown.120\nAt some times of year, acidification has already reached a critical threshold for organisms living on Alaska's continental shelves.121 Certain algae and animals that form shells (such as clams, oysters, and crab) use carbonate minerals (aragonite and calcite) that dissolve below that threshold. These organisms form a crucial component of the marine food web that sustains life in the rich waters off Alaska's coasts. In addition, Alaska oyster farmers are now indirectly affected by ocean acidification impacts farther south because they rely on oyster spat (attached oyster larvae) from Puget Sound farmers who are now directly affected by the recent upwelling of acidic waters along the Washington and Oregon coastline (Ch. 24: Oceans; Ch. 21: Northwest).122\n\n522\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f22: ALASKA\n\nKey Message 5: Native Communities\n\nThe cumulative effects of climate change in Alaska strongly affect Native communities, which are highly vulnerable to these rapid changes\nbut have a deep cultural history of adapting to change.\n\nWith the exception of oil-producing regions in the north, rural Alaska is one of the most extensive areas of poverty in the U.S. in terms of household income, yet residents pay the highest prices for food and fuel.123 Alaska Native Peoples, who are the most numerous residents of this region, depend economically, nutritionally, and culturally on hunting and fishing for their livelihoods.124,125,126 Hunters speak of thinning sea and river ice that makes harvest of wild foods more dangerous,127 changes to permafrost that alter spring run-off patterns, a northward shift in seal and fish species, and rising sea levels with more extreme tidal fluctuations (see Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples).128,129 Responses to these changes are often constrained by regulations.77,129 Coastal erosion is destroying infrastructure. Impacts of climate change on river ice dynamics and spring flooding are threats to river communities but are complex, and trends have not yet been well documented.130\nMajor food sources are under stress due to many factors, including lack of sea ice for marine mammals.131 Thawing of near-surface permafrost beneath lakes and ponds that provide drinking water cause food and water security challenges for villages. Sanitation and health problems also result from deteriorating water and sewage systems, and ice cellars traditionally used for storing food are thawing (see also Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples).75,78 Warming also releases human-caused pollutants, such as poleward-transported mercury and organic pesticides, from thawing permafrost and brings new diseases to Arctic plants and animals, including subsistence food species, posing new health challenges, especially to rural communities.132 Posi-\n\ntive health effects of warming include a longer growing season for gardening and agriculture.10,133\nDevelopment activities in the Arctic (for example, oil and gas, minerals, tourism, and shipping) are of concern to Indigenous communities, from both perceived threats and anticipated benefits.126 Greater levels of industrial activity might alter the distribution of species, disrupt subsistence activities, increase the risk of oil spills, and create various social impacts. At the same time, development provides economic opportunities, if it can be harnessed appropriately.134\nAlaska Native Elders say, \"We must prepare to adapt.\" However, the implications of this simple instruction are multi-faceted. Adapting means more than adjusting hunting technologies and foods eaten. It requires learning how to garner information from a rapidly changing environment. Permanent infrastructure and specified property rights increasingly constrain people's ability to safely use their environment for subsistence and other activities.\nTraditional knowledge now facilitates adaptation to climate change as a framework for linking new local observations with western science.124,135 The capacity of Alaska Natives to survive for centuries in the harshest of conditions reflects their resilience.91 Communities must rely not only on improved knowledge of changes that are occurring, but also on support from traditional and other institutions \u00ad and on strength from within \u00ad in order to face an uncertain future.124\n\nAlaska Coastal Communities Damaged\n\nFigure 22.8: One effect of the reduction in Alaska sea ice is that storm surges that used to be buffered by the ice are now causing more shoreline damage.

Public and private citizens or institutions were consulted and engaged in its preparation and expert review by the various agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) represented by the 11-member TIR writing team. The key findings of the report were presented at the Alaska Forum on the Environment and in a regularly scheduled, monthly webinar by the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, with feedback then incorporated into the report.\n\nAlthough various models differ in the projected rate of sea ice loss, more recent CMIP5 models20 that most accurately reconstruct historical sea ice loss project that late-summer sea ice will virtually disappear by the 2030s, leaving only remnant sea ice.\nEvidence is strong about the impacts of sea ice loss.10 Because the sea ice cover plays such a strong role in human activities and Arctic ecosystems, loss of the ice cover is nearly certain to have substantial impacts.17\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence confirmed many of the findings from a prior Alaska assessment (http://nca2009.globalchange.gov/alaska), which informed the 2009 NCA.136\n\nThe chapter author team engaged in multiple technical discussions via regular teleconferences. These included careful expert review of the foundational TIR10 and of approximately 85 additional technical inputs provided by the public, as well as the other published literature and professional judgment. These discussions were followed by expert deliberation of draft key messages by the writing team in a face-to-face meeting before each key message was selected for inclusion in the Report. These discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each message, and they were based on criteria that help define \"key vulnerabilities\" (Ch. 26: Decision Support).\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nArctic summer sea ice is receding faster than previously projected and is expected to virtually disappear before mid-century. This is altering marine ecosystems and leading to greater ship access, offshore development opportunity, and increased community vulnerability to coastal erosion.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Alaska TIR.10 Technical input reports (85) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\nEvidence from improved models (for example, Wang and Overland 201220) and updated observational data from satellite, especially new results, clearly show rapid decline in not only extent but also mass and thickness of multi-year ice,18 information that was not available in prior assessments.\nNearly all studies to date published in the peer-reviewed literature agree that summer Arctic sea ice extent is rapidly declining and that, if heat-trapping gas concentrations continue to rise, an essentially ice-free summer Arctic ocean will be realized before mid-century. However, there remains uncertainty in the rate of sea ice loss, with the models that most accurately project historical sea ice trends currently suggesting nearly ice-free conditions sometime between 2021 and 2043 (median 2035).20 Uncertainty across all models stems from a combination of large differences in projections among different climate models, natural climate variability, and uncertainty about future rates of fossil fuel emissions.\nEcosystems: There is substantial new information that ocean acidification, rising ocean temperatures, declining sea ice, and other environmental changes are affecting the location and abundance of marine fish, including those that are commercially important, those used as food by other species, and those used for subsistence.101,102 However, the relative importance of these potential causes of change is highly uncertain.\nOffshore oil and gas development: A key uncertainty is the price of fossil fuels. Viable avenues for improving the information base in-\n\n533\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f22: ALASKA Traceable Accounts\n\nclude determining the primary causes of variation among different climate models and determining which climate models exhibit the best ability to reproduce the observed rate of sea ice loss.\nCoastal erosion: There is new information that lack of sea ice causes storms to produce larger waves and more coastal erosion.10 An additional contributing factor is that coastal bluffs that were \"cemented\" by permafrost are beginning to thaw in response to warmer air and ocean waters, and are therefore more vulnerable to erosion.40 Standard defensive adaptation strategies to protect coastal communities from erosion such as use of rock walls, sandbags, and riprap have been largely unsuccessful.41 There remains considerable uncertainty, however, about the spatial patterns of future coastal erosion.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties:\n\nMost glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia are shrinking substantially. This trend is expected to continue and has implications for hydropower production, ocean circulation patterns, fisheries, and global sea level rise.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Alaska Technical Input Report.10 Technical input reports (85) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nEvidence that glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia are shrinking is strong and is based on field studies,56 energy balance models,59 LIDAR remote sensing,51,52 and satellite data, especially new lines of evidence from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite.48,52,55\n\nVery high confidence for summer sea ice decline. High confidence for summer sea ice disappearing by mid-century.\nVery high confidence for altered marine ecosystems, greater ship access, and increased vulnerability of communities to coastal erosion.\nHigh confidence regarding offshore development opportunity.\n\nEvidence is also strong that Alaska ice mass loss contributes to global sea level rise,58 with latest results permitting quantitative evaluation of losses globally.49\nNumerous peer-reviewed publications describe implications of recent increases, but likely longer-term declines, in water input from glacial rivers to reservoirs and therefore hydropower resources.3,10,65\n\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.),\nhigh consensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium\nconsensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing\nschools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts\n\nGlacial rivers account for 47% of the freshwater input to the Gulf of Alaska65 and are an important source of organic carbon,60,61 phosphorus,62 and iron63 that contribute to the high productivity of near-shore fisheries.61,64 Therefore, it is projected that the changes in discharge of glacial rivers will affect ocean circulation patterns and major U.S. and locally significant fisheries.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence confirmed many of the findings from a prior Alaska assessment (http://nca2009.globalchange.gov/alaska), which informed the 2009 NCA.136\nAs noted above, major advances from GRACE and other datasets now permit analyses of glacier mass loss that were not possible previously.\nKey uncertainties remain related to large year-to-year variation, the spatial distribution of snow accumulation and melt, and the quantification of glacier calving into the ocean and lakes. Although most large glaciated areas of the state are regularly measured observationally, extrapolation to unmeasured areas carries uncertainties due to large spatial variability.\nAlthough there is broad agreement that near-shore circulation in the Gulf of Alaska is influenced by the magnitude of freshwater inputs, little is known about the mechanisms by which near-term increases and subsequent longer-term decreases in glacier runoff\n\n534\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f22: ALASKA Traceable Accounts\n\n(as the glaciers disappear) will affect the structure of the Alaska Coastal Current and smaller-scale ocean circulation, both of which have feedback on fisheries.\nThe magnitude and timing of effects on hydropower production depend on changes in glacial mass, as described above.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence High confidence that glacier mass loss in Alaska and British Columbia is high, contributing 20% to 30% as much to sea level rise as does shrinkage of the Greenland Ice Sheet.\nHigh confidence that due to glacier mass loss there will be related impacts on hydropower production, ocean circulation, fisheries, and global sea level rise.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nPermafrost temperatures in Alaska are rising, a thawing trend that is expected to continue, causing multiple vulnerabilities through drier landscapes, more wildfire, altered wildlife habitat, increased cost of maintaining infrastructure, and the release of heat-trapping gases that increase climate warming.\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence confirmed many of the findings from a prior Alaska assessment (http://nca2009.globalchange.gov/alaska), which informed the 2009 NCA.136\nThis evidence included results from improved models and updated observational data. The assessment included insights from stakeholders collected in a series of distributed engagement meetings that confirm the relevance and significance of the key message for local decision-makers.\nKey uncertainties involve: 1) the degree to which increases in evapotranspiration versus permafrost thaw are leading to drier landscapes; 2) the degree to which it is these drier landscapes associated with permafrost thaw, versus more severe fire weather associated with climate change, that is leading to more wildfire; 3) the degree to which the costs of the maintenance of infrastructure are associated with permafrost thaw caused by climate change versus disturbance of permafrost due to other human activities; and 4) the degree to which climate change is causing Alaska to be a sink versus a source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Very high confidence that permafrost is warming.\n\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting chapter text summarize extensive evidence documented in the Alaska Technical Input Report.10 Technical input reports (85) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nPrevious evidence that permafrost is warming66 has been confirmed and enhanced by more recent studies.70 The most recent modeling efforts (for example, Avis et al. 2011; Jafarov et al. 201271,73) extend earlier results72 and project that permafrost will be lost from the upper few meters from large parts of Alaska by the end of this century.\n\nHigh confidence that landscapes in interior Alaska are getting drier, although the relative importance of different mechanisms is not completely clear.\nMedium confidence that thawing permafrost results in more wildfires. There is high confidence that wildfires have been increasing in recent decades, even if it is not clear whether permafrost thaw or hotter and drier weather is more important.\nHigh confidence that climate change will lead to increased maintenance costs in future decades. Low confidence that climate change has led to increased maintenance costs of infrastructure in recent decades.\n\nEvidence that permafrost thaw leads to drier landscapes81,82 is beginning to accumulate, especially as improved remote sensing tools are applied to assess more remote regions.71\nSatellite data has expanded the capacity to monitor wildfire across the region, providing additional evidence of wildfire extent.87 This new evidence has led to increased study that is beginning to reveal impacts on ecosystems and wildlife habitat, but much more work is needed to understand the extent of natural resilience.\nImpacts of permafrost thaw on the maintenance of infrastructure11,74,75,76,77 is currently moderate but rapidly accumulating.

There is also strong evidence for the cultural adaptive capacity of these communities and peoples over time.91,130,135\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new evidence confirmed many of the findings from a prior Alaska assessment (http://nca2009.globalchange.gov/alaska), which informed the 2009 NCA.136\nThe precise mechanisms by which climate change affects Native communities are poorly understood, especially in the context of rapid social, economic, and cultural change. Present day responses to environmental change are poorly documented. More research is needed on the ways that Alaska Natives respond to current biophysical climate change and to the factors that enable or constrain contemporary adaptation.\nAlaska Native communities are already being affected by climateinduced changes in the physical and biological environment, from coastal erosion threatening the existence of some communities, to alterations in hunting, fishing, and gathering practices that undermine the intergenerational transfer of culture, skill, and wisdom. At the same time, these communities have a long record of adaptation and flexibility. Whether such adaptability is sufficient to address the challenges of climate change depends both on the speed of climate-induced changes and on the degree to which Native communities are supported rather than constrained in the adaptive measures they need to make.124\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is high confidence that cumulative effects of climate change in Alaska strongly affect Native communities, which are highly vulnerable to these rapid changes but have a deep cultural history of adapting to change.\n\n536\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 23\nHAWAI`I\nAND U.S. AFFILIATED PACIFIC ISLANDS\nConvening Lead Authors\nJo-Ann Leong, University of Hawai`i John J.

Warmer oceans are leading to increased coral bleaching events and disease outbreaks in coral reefs, as well as changed distribution patterns of tuna fisheries. Ocean acidification will reduce  coral growth and health. Warming and acidification, combined with existing stresses, will strongly affect coral reef fish communities.\n2. Freshwater supplies are already constrained and will become more limited on many islands. Saltwater intrusion associated with sea level rise will reduce the quantity and quality of freshwater in coastal aquifers, especially on low islands. In areas where precipitation does not increase,  freshwater supplies will be adversely affected as air temperature rises.\n3. Increasing temperatures, and in some areas reduced rainfall, will stress native Pacific Island plants and animals, especially in high-elevation ecosystems with increasing exposure to invasive species, increasing the risk of extinctions.\n4. Rising sea levels, coupled with high water levels caused by storms, will incrementally increase  coastal flooding and erosion, damaging coastal ecosystems, infrastructure, and agriculture, and  negatively affecting tourism.\n5. Mounting threats to food and water security, infrastructure, health, and safety are expected to  lead to increasing human migration, making it increasingly difficult for Pacific Islanders to sustain the region's many unique customs, beliefs, and languages.\n\nThe U.S. Pacific Islands region (Figure 23.1) is vast, comprising more than 2,000 islands spanning millions of square miles of ocean. The largest group of islands in this region, the Hawaiian Archipelago, is located nearly 2,400 miles from any continental landmass, which makes it one of the most remote archipelagos on the globe.1 The Hawaiian Islands support fewer than 2 million people, yet provide vital strategic capabilities to U.S. defense \u00ad and the islands' biodiversity is important to the world. Hawai`i and the U.S. affiliated Pacific Islands are at risk from climate changes that will affect nearly every aspect of life. Rising air and ocean temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, changing frequencies and intensities of storms and drought, decreasing baseflow in streams, rising sea levels, and changing ocean chemistry will affect ecosystems on land and in the oceans, as well as local communities, livelihoods, and cultures. Low islands are particularly at risk.\n\n538\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\u00a9 Michael Wells/fstop/Corbis\n\n\f23: HAWAI`I AND U.S. AFFILIATED PACIFIC ISLANDS\n\nThe Pacific Islands include volcanic islands, islands of continental crust, atolls\n\nU.S. Pacific Islands Region\n\n(formed by coral reefs), limestone is-\n\nlands, and islands of mixed geologic\n\norigin, with tremendous landscape di-\n\nversity.

Ocean acidification will reduce coral growth and health. Warming and acidification, combined with existing stresses,\nwill strongly affect coral reef fish communities.\n\nOcean temperatures in the Pacific region exhibit strong yearto-year and decadal fluctuations, but since the 1950s, they have also exhibited a warming trend, with temperatures from the surface to a depth of 660 feet rising by as much as 3.6\u00b0F.7\nFuture sea surface temperatures are projected to increase 1.1\u00b0F (compared to the 1990 levels) by 2030, 1.8\u00b0F by 2055, and 2.5\u00b0F by 2090 under a scenario that assumes substantial\n\nreductions in emissions (B1), or 1.7\u00b0F by 2030, 2.3\u00b0F by 2055, and 4.7\u00b0F by 2090 under a scenario that assumes continued increases in emissions (A2).8\nBleaching events (as a result of higher ocean temperatures) can weaken or kill corals. At least three mass bleaching episodes have occurred in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands in the last decade.9 Incidences of coral bleaching have been recorded in\n\n539\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f23: HAWAI`I AND U.S. AFFILIATED PACIFIC ISLANDS\n\"High\" and \"Low\" Pacific Islands Face Different Threats\n\nFigure 23.2.

Coral disease outbreaks have also been reported in the Hawaiian archipelago,11 American Samoa,12,13 the Marshall Islands, and Palau,14 correlated with periods of unusually high water temperatures.15 Despite uncertainties, advanced\nmodeling techniques project a large decline in coral cover in\nthe Hawaiian Archipelago during this century. However, there\nare significant differences in the projected time frames and\ngeographic distribution of these declines, even under a single climate change scenario.16 By 2100, assuming ongoing increas-\nes in emissions of heat-trapping gases (A2 scenario), continued\nloss of coral reefs and the shelter they provide will result in extensive losses in both numbers and species of reef fishes.17\nEven with a substantial reduction in emissions (B1 scenario),\nreefs could be expected to lose as much as 40% of their reef-\nassociated fish. Coral reefs in Hawai`i provide an estimated $385 million in goods and services annually,18 which could be\nthreatened by these impacts.\n\nOcean acidification is also taking place in the region, which\nadds to ecosystem stress from increasing temperatures. Ocean\nacidity has increased by about 30% since the pre-industrial\nera and is projected to further increase by 37% to 50% from\npresent levels by 2100 (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 12).19 The amount of calcium carbonate, the biologically\nimportant mineral critical to reef-building coral and to calcify-\ning algae, will decrease as a result of ocean acidification. By\n2035 to 2060, levels of one form of the mineral (aragonite) are\nprojected to decline enough to reduce coral growth and survival around the Pacific, with continuing declines thereafter.20\nCrustose coralline algae, an inconspicuous but important com-\nponent of reefs that help reefs to form and that act as critical\nsurfaces on which other living things grow, are also expected to exhibit reduced growth and survival.21,22 Ocean acidification\nreduces the ability of corals to build reefs and also increases erosion,23 leading to more fragile reef habitats. These changes\nare projected to have a strong negative impact on the econo-\n\nEl ni\u00f1o and other patterns of climate variability\nThe Pacific region is subject to various patterns of climate variability. The effects of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other patterns of oceanic and atmospheric variability on the region are significant. They include large variations in sea surface temperatures, the strength and persistence of the trade winds, the position of jet streams and storm tracks, and the location and intensity of rainfall.8,29,30 The ENSO-related extremes of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a generally persist for 6 to 18 months and change phase roughly every 3 to 7 years.8,31 The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) are patterns that operate over even longer time horizons and also influence the weather and climate of the region.31,32 Such dramatic short-term variability (the \"noise\") can obscure the long-term trend (the \"signal\").33 Despite the challenges of distinguishing natural climate variability from climate change, there are several key indicators of observed change that serve as a basis for monitoring and evaluating future change.2\n\n540\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f23: HAWAI`I AND U.S. AFFILIATED PACIFIC ISLANDS\n\nmies and well-being of island communities, with loss of coral biodiversity and reduced resilience.24\n\nSimilarly, there will be large impacts to the economically important tuna fishery in the Pacific Island region. Surface chlorophyll data obtained by satellites indicate less favorable conditions resulting in reduced productivity for tuna in the subtropical South and North Pacific26 due to warming. This trend is projected to continue under future climate change.27 One fishery model, coupled with a climate model, forecasts that the overall western and central Pacific fishery catch for skipjack tuna would initially increase by about 19% by 2035, though there would be no change for bigeye tuna. However, by 2100, skipjack catch would decline by 8% and bigeye catch\n\nIncreasing ocean temperature and acidity threaten coral reef ecosystems.\n\n\u00a9 Ron Dahlquist/Corbis\n\nIncreased Acidification Decreases Suitable Coral Habitat\n\nwould decline by 27% if emis-\nsions continue to rise (A2 sce-\nnario); geographic variations\nare projected within the region.28\n\nThese changes to both corals and fish pose threats to communities, cultures, and ecosystems of the Pacific Islands both directly through their impact on food security and indirectly through their impact on economic sectors including fisheries and tourism.\n\nFigure 23.3. Ocean waters have already become more acidic from absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. As this absorption lowers pH, it reduces the amount of calcium carbonate, which is critical for many marine species to reproduce and grow. Maps show projections of the saturation state of aragonite (the form of calcium carbonate used by coral and many other species) if CO2 levels were stabilized at 380 ppm (a level that has already been exceeded), 450 ppm (middle map), and 500 ppm (bottom map), corresponding approximately to the years 2005, 2030, and 2050, assuming a decrease in emissions from the current trend (scenario A1B). As shown on the maps, many areas that are adequate will become marginal. Higher emissions will lead to many more places where aragonite concentrations are \"marginal\" or \"extremely marginal\" in much of the Pacific. (Figure source: Burke et al. 201125).\n\n541\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f23: HAWAI`I AND U.S. AFFILIATED PACIFIC ISLANDS\n\nKey Message 2: Decreasing Freshwater Availability\n\nFreshwater supplies are already constrained and will become more limited on many islands. Saltwater intrusion associated with sea level rise will reduce the quantity and quality of\nfreshwater in coastal aquifers, especially on low islands. In areas where precipitation does not increase, freshwater supplies will be adversely affected as air temperature rises.\n\nIn Hawai`i, average precipitation, average stream discharge, mate, Figure 2.6),40 though there is low confidence in all these\n\nand stream baseflow have been trending downward for nearly projections.\n\na century, especially in recent decades, but with high variability\n\ndue to cyclical climate patterns such as ENSO and the PDO (see Climate change impacts on freshwater resources in the Pacific \"El Ni\u00f1o and other Patterns of Climate Variability\").34,35,36 For Islands will vary across the region.

The vulnerability of coral reef and ocean ecosystems was discussed earlier. Landbased and freshwater species that exist in high-elevation ecosystems in high islands, as well as low-lying coastal ecosystems on all islands, are especially vulnerable. Existing climate\nNative Plants at Risk\n\nzones on high islands are generally projected to shift upslope in response to climate change.48 The ability of native species\nto adapt to shifting habitats will be affected by ecosystem dis-\ncontinuity and fragmentation, as well as the survival or extinc-\ntion of pollinators and seed dispersers. Some (perhaps many)\ninvasive plant species will have a competitive edge over native\nspecies, as they disproportionately benefit from increased car-\nbon dioxide, disturbances from extreme weather and climate\nevents, and an ability to invade higher elevation habitats as climates warm.49 Hawaiian high-elevation alpine ecosystems on\nHawai`i and Maui islands are already beginning to show strong signs of higher temperatures and increased drought.50 For ex-\nample, the number of Haleakal silversword, a rare plant that\nis an integral component of the alpine ecosystem in Haleakal\nNational Park in Maui and is found nowhere else on the planet, has declined dramatically over the past two decades.51 Many\nof Hawai`i's native forest birds, marvels of evolution largely\nlimited to high-elevation forests due to predators and dis-\neases, are increasingly vulnerable as rising temperatures allow\nmosquitoes carrying diseases like avian malaria to thrive at\nhigher elevations and thereby reduce the extent of safe bird habitat.48,52\n\nFigure 23.5. Warming at high elevations could alter the distribution of native plants and animals in mountainous ecosystems and increase the threat of invasive species. The threatened, endemic `ahinahina, or Haleakal silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum), shown here in full bloom on Maui, Hawaiian Islands, is one example. (Photo credit: Forest and Kim Starr).\n\nOn high islands like Hawai`i, decreases in precipitation and\nbaseflow are already indicating impacts on freshwater ecosystems and aquatic species.35,37 Many Pacific Island freshwater\nfishes and invertebrates have oceanic larval stages in which\nthey seasonally return to high island streams to aid reproduction.53 Changes in stream flow and oceanic conditions that\naffect larval growth and survival will alter the ability of these\nspecies to maintain viable stream populations.\n\nKey Message 4: Sea Level Rising\n\nRising sea levels, coupled with high water levels caused by tropical and extra-tropical storms, will incrementally increase coastal flooding and erosion, damaging coastal ecosystems, infrastructure, and agriculture, and negatively affecting tourism.\n\nGlobal average sea level has risen by about 8 inches since 1900,54 with recent satellite observations indicating an in-\ncreased rate of rise over the past two decades (1.3 inches per\ndecade) (see also Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10). 55 Recent regional sea level trends in the western tropical Pacific are higher56,57 than the global average, due in part to\nchanging wind patterns associated with natural climate variability.58,59 Over this century, sea level in the Pacific is expected\nto rise at about the same rate as the projected increase in glob-\nal average sea level, with regional variations associated with\nocean circulation changes and the Earth's response to other\n\nlarge-scale changes, such as melting glaciers and ice sheets as well as changing water storage in lakes and reservoirs.60,61 For the region, extreme sea level events generally occur when high tides combine with changes in water levels due to storms, ENSO (see \"El Ni\u00f1o and other Patterns of Climate Variability\"), and other variations.54,55,56,57,58,59,60\nRising sea levels will escalate the threat to coastal structures and property, groundwater reservoirs, harbor operations, airports, wastewater systems, shallow coral reefs, sea grass beds, intertidal flats and mangrove forests, and other social, eco-\n\n543\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f23: HAWAI`I AND U.S. AFFILIATED PACIFIC ISLANDS\n\nSaltwater Intrusion Destroys Crops\n\nResidents of Low-lying Islands at Risk\n\nFigure 23.6.

Because Pacific Islands are almost entirely dependent upon imported food, fuel, and material, the vulnerability of ports and airports to extreme events, sea level rise, and increasing wave heights is of great concern. Climate change is expected to have serious effects on human health, for example by increasing the incidence of dengue fever (Ch. 9: Human Health).68 In addition, sea level rise and flooding are expected to overwhelm sewer systems and threaten public sanitation.\nThe traditional lifestyles and cultures of indigenous communities in all Pacific Islands will be seriously affected by climate change (see also Chapter 12: Indigenous Peoples). Sea level rise and associated flooding is expected to destroy coastal artifacts and structures69 or even the entire land base associ-\n\nated with cultural traditions.70 Drought threatens traditional food sources such as taro and breadfruit, and coral death from warming-induced bleaching will threaten subsistence fisheries in island communities.46 Climate change related environmental deterioration for communities at or near the coast, coupled with other socioeconomic or political motivations, is expected to lead individuals, families, or communities to consider moving to new locations. Depending on the scale and distance of the migration, a variety of challenges face the migrants and the communities receiving them. Migrants need to establish themselves in their new community, find employment, and access services, while the receiving community's infrastructure, labor market, commerce, natural resources, and governance structures need to absorb a sudden burst of population growth.\n\nAdaptation Activities\n\nAdaptive capacity in the region varies and reflects the histories Management Agency (FEMA) hazard mitigation plans, and the\n\nof governance, the economies, and the geographical features Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands lists climate variof the island/atoll site. High islands can better support larger ability as a possible hazard related to extreme climate events.74\n\npopulations and infrastructure, attract industry, foster institu- The U.S. Pacific Island Freely Associated States (which includes tional growth, and thus bolster adaptive capacity;2 but these the Republic of Palau, FSM, and RMI; Figure 23.1) have worked\n\nsites have larger policy or legal hurdles that complicate coastal with regional organizations to develop plans and access interplanning.71 Low islands have a different set of challenges.

The PIRCA is a collaborative effort aimed at assessing the state of climate knowledge, impacts, and adaptive capacity in Hawai`i and the U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands. These workshops included representatives from the U.S. federal agencies, universities, as well as international participants from other national agencies and regional organizations. The workshops led to the formulation of a foundational Technical Input Report (TIR).2 The report consists of nearly 140 pages, with almost 300 references, and was organized into 5 chapters by 11 authors.\nThe chapter author team engaged in multiple technical discussions via regular teleconferences that permitted a careful review of the foundational TIR2 and of approximately 23 additional technical inputs provided by the public, as well as the other published literature, and professional judgment. These discussions included a face-to-face meeting held on July 9, 2012. These discussions were supported by targeted consultation among the lead and contributing authors of each message. There were several iterations of review and comment on draft key messages and associated content.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nWarmer oceans are leading to increased coral bleaching events and disease outbreaks in coral reefs, as well as changed distribution patterns of tuna fisheries. Ocean acidification will reduce coral growth and health. Warming and acidification, combined with existing stresses, will strongly affect coral reef fish communities.\nDescription of evidence base The key message was chosen based on input from the extensive evidence documented in the Hawai`i Technical Input Report2 and additional technical inputs received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, as well as stakeholder engagement leading up to drafting the chapter.\n\nOcean warming: There is ample evidence that sea-surface temperatures have already risen throughout the region based on clear observational data, with improved data with the advent of satellite and in situ (ARGO & ship-based) data.7 Assessment of the literature for the region by other governmental bodies (such as Australian Bureau of Meteorology [ABOM] and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization [CSIRO]) point to continued increases under both B1 and A2 scenarios.8\nOcean acidification: Globally, the oceans are currently absorbing about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere annually, and becoming more acidic as a result (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 12). Historical and current observations of aragonite saturation state (ar) for the Pacific Ocean show a decrease from approximately 4.9 to 4.8 in the Central North Pacific (Hawaiian Islands); in the Western North Pacific (Republic of Marshall Islands, Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of Palau, Guam), it has declined from approximately 4.5 to 3.9 in 2000, and to 4.1 in the Central South Pacific (American Samoa) (this chapter: Figure 23.3; Ch. 24: Oceans and Marine Resources).19 Projections from CMIP3 models indicate the annual maximum aragonite saturation state will reach values below 3.5 by 2035 in the waters of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), by 2030 in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), by 2040 in Palau, and by 2060 around the Samoan archipelago. These values are projected to continue declining thereafter.2 The recently published Reefs at Risk Revisited25 estimates aragonite saturation state (as an indicator of ocean acidification) for CO2 stabilization levels of 380 ppm, 450 ppm, and 500 ppm, which correspond approximately to the years 2005, 2030, and 2050 under the A1B emissions scenario (which assumes similar emissions to the A2 scenario through 2050 and a slow decline thereafter) (Figure 4.4 from Keener et al. 20122).\nBleaching events: These have been well-documented in extensive literature worldwide due to increasing temperatures, with numerous studies in Hawai`i and the Pacific Islands.9,10\n\n552\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f23: HAWAI`I AND U.S. AFFILIATED PACIFIC ISLANDS Traceable Accounts\n\nDisease outbreaks: Reports of coral diseases have been proliferating in the past years,11,13 but few have currently been adequately described, with causal organisms identified (for example, fulfill Koch's Postulates).\nReduced growth: There is abundant evidence from laboratory experiments that lower seawater pH reduces calcification rates in marine organisms (for example, Feely et al. 200919). However, actual measurements on the effects of ocean acidification on coral reef ecosystems in situ or in complex mesocosms are just now becoming available, and these measurements show that there are large regional and diel variability in pH and pCO2.76 The role of diel and regional variability on coral reef ecosystems requires further investigation.\nDistribution patterns of coastal and ocean fisheries: Evidence of the effects of ocean acidification on U.S. fisheries in Hawai`i and the Pacific Islands is currently limited (Lehodey et al. 2011)28 but there is accumulating evidence for ecosystem impacts.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties New information: Since the 2009 National Climate Assessment,77 considerable effort has been employed to understand the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems, including recent ecosystem-based efforts.22,28 Studies of OA impacts on organisms has advanced considerably, with careful chemistry using worldwide standard protocols making inroads into understanding a broadening range of organisms.\nHowever, predicting the effect of ocean acidification on marine organisms and marine coral reef ecosystems remains the key issue of uncertainty. The role of community metabolism and calcification in the face of overall reduction in aragonite saturation state must be investigated.\nUnderstanding interactions between rising temperatures and OA remains a challenge. For example, high temperatures simultaneously cause coral bleaching, as well as affect coral calcification rates, with both impacts projected to increase in the future.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is very high confidence that ocean acidification and decreased aragonite saturation is taking place and is projected to continue. There is high confidence that ocean warming is taking place and is projected to continue; there is medium confidence that the thermal anomalies will lead to continued coral bleaching and coral disease outbreaks.\n\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent\nresults, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods\nvary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nFreshwater supplies are already constrained and will become more limited on many islands. Saltwater intrusion associated with sea level rise will reduce the quantity and quality of freshwater in coastal aquifers, especially on low islands. In areas where precipitation does not increase, freshwater supplies will be adversely affected as air temperature rises.\nDescription of evidence base There is abundant and definitive evidence that air temperature has increased and is projected to continue to increase over the entire region,8,41,78 as there is globally (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 3).\nIn Hawai`i and the Central North Pacific (CNP), projected annual surface air temperature increases are 1.0\u00b0F to 2.5\u00b0F by 2035, relative to 1971-2000.40,42 In the Western North Pacific (WNP), the projected increases are 2.0\u00b0F to 2.3\u00b0F by 2030, 6.1\u00b0F to 8.5\u00b0F by 2055, and 4.9\u00b0F to 9.2\u00b0F by 2090.8 In the central South Pacific (CSP), projected annual surface air temperature increases are 1.1\u00b0F to 1.3\u00b0F by 2030, 1.8\u00b0F to 2.5\u00b0F by 2055, and 2.5\u00b0F to 4.9\u00b0F by 2090.8 (Please note that the islands that comprise the U.S. Pacific Islands Region are shown in Figure 23.1).\n\nIn Hawai`i, mean precipitation, average stream discharge, and stream baseflow have been trending downward for nearly a cen-\n\n553\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f23: HAWAI`I AND U.S. AFFILIATED PACIFIC ISLANDS Traceable Accounts\n\ntury, especially in recent decades and with high variability related to El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).34,35 For the WNP, a decline of 15% in annual rainfall has been observed in the eastern-most islands in the Micronesia region and slight upward trends in precipitation have been seen for the western-most islands, with high ENSO-related variability.8 In American Samoa, no trends in average rainfall are apparent based on the very limited available data.8,37\nFor the region as a whole, models disagree about projected changes in precipitation. Mostly models predict increases in mean annual rainfall and suggest a slight dry season decrease and wet season increase in precipitation.8 However, based on statistical downscaling, one study39 projected a 5% to 10% reduction in precipitation for the wet season and a 5% increase in the dry season for Hawai`i by the end of this century.\nOn most islands, increased temperatures coupled with decreased rainfall and increased drought will reduce the amount of freshwater for drinking and crop irrigation.43 Atolls will be particularly vulnerable due to their low elevation, small land mass, geographic isolation, and limited potable water sources and agricultural resources.44 The situation will also be exacerbated by the increased incidence of intrusion of saltwater from the ocean during storms as the mean sea level rises over time (Key Message 4, this chapter; Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10).2\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Climate change impacts on freshwater resources in the Pacific Islands region will vary because of differing island size and height, which affect water storage capability and susceptibility to coastal inundation. The impacts will also vary because of natural phase variability (for example, ENSO and PDO) in precipitation and storminess (tropical and extra-tropical storms) as well as longterm trends, both strongly influenced by geographic location.\nClimate model simulations produce conflicting assessments as to how the tropical Pacific atmospheric circulation will respond in the future to climate change.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Freshwater systems are inherently fragile in many Pacific Islands. Historical observations show strong evidence of a decreasing trend for rainfall in Hawai`i and many other Pacific Islands (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).2 There is abundant and definitive evidence that air temperature has increased and will continue to increase. All of the scientific approaches to detecting sea level rise come to the conclusion that a warming planet will result in higher sea levels. Based on the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, we have high confidence in the key message.\n\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nIncreasing temperatures, and in some areas reduced rainfall, will stress native Pacific Island plants and animals, especially in high-elevation ecosystems with increasing exposure to invasive species, increasing the risk of extinctions.\nDescription of evidence base In Hawai`i and the Central North Pacific (CNP), projected annual surface air temperature increases are 1.0\u00b0F to 2.5\u00b0F by 2035, relative to 1971-2000.40,42 In the Western North Pacific (WNP), the projected increases are 2.0\u00b0F to 2.3\u00b0F by 2030, 6.1\u00b0F to 8.5\u00b0F by 2055, and 4.9\u00b0F to 9.2\u00b0F by 2090.8 In the Central South Pacific (CSP), projected annual surface air temperature increases are 1.1\u00b0F to 1.3\u00b0F by 2030, 1.8\u00b0F to 2.5\u00b0F by 2055, and 2.5\u00b0F to 4.9\u00b0F by 2090.8 In Hawai`i the rate of increase has been greater at high elevations.41 (Please note that the islands that comprise the U.S. Pacific Islands Region are shown in Figure 23.1).\nIn Hawai`i mean precipitation, average stream discharge, and stream baseflow have been trending downward for nearly a century, especially in recent decades and with high ENSO and PDOrelated variability.34,35,36 Projects based on statistical downscaling39 suggest the most likely precipitation scenario for Hawai`i for the 21st century to be a 5% to 10% reduction for the wet season and a 5% increase in the dry season.\nOn high islands like Hawai`i, decreases in precipitation and baseflow35 are already indicating that there will be impacts on freshwater ecosystems and aquatic species, and on water-intensive sectors such as agriculture and tourism.\nHawaiian high-elevation alpine ecosystems on Hawai`i and Maui islands are already beginning to show strong signs of increased drought and warmer temperatures.50 Demographic data for the Haleakal silversword, a unique (endemic to upper Haleakalvolcano) and integral component of the alpine ecosystem in Haleakal National Park, Maui, have recorded a severe decline in plant numbers over the past two decades.51 Many of Hawai`i's endemic forest birds, marvels of evolution largely limited to high-elevation forests by predation and disease, are increasingly vulnerable as rising temperatures allow the disease-vectoring mosquitoes to thrive upslope and thereby reduce the extent of safe bird habitat.48,52\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Climate change impacts in the Pacific Islands region will vary because of differing island size and height. The impacts will also vary because of natural phase variability (for example, El Ni\u00f1oSouthern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation) in precipitation and storminess (tropical and extra-tropical storms) as well as long-term trends, both strongly influenced by geographic location.\n\n554\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f23: HAWAI`I AND U.S. AFFILIATED PACIFIC ISLANDS Traceable Accounts\n\nClimate model simulations produce conflicting assessments as to how the tropical Pacific atmospheric circulation will respond in the future to climate change.2,8\nClimate change ecosystem response is poorly understood.2\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Terrestrial and marine ecosystems are already being impacted by local stressors, such as coastal development, land-based sources of pollution, and invasive species.2,25 There is abundant and definitive evidence that air temperature has increased and will continue to increase. Historical observations show strong evidence of a decreasing trend for rainfall in Hawai`i and many other Pacific Islands.2 Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is high in this key message.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nRising sea levels, coupled with high water levels caused by tropical and extra-tropical storms, will incrementally increase coastal flooding and erosion, damaging coastal ecosystems, infrastructure, and agriculture, and negatively affecting tourism.\nDescription of evidence base All of the scientific approaches to detecting sea level rise come to the conclusion that a warming planet will result in higher sea levels. Recent studies give higher sea level rise projections than those projected in 2007 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change29 for the rest of this century (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10).55\nSea level is rising and is expected to continue to rise. Over the past few decades, global mean sea level, as measured by satellite altimetry, has been rising at an average rate of twice the estimated rate for the previous century, based on tide gauge measurements,55 with models suggesting that global sea level will rise significantly over the course of this century. Regionally, the highest increases have been observed in the western tropical Pacific.56 However, the current high rates of regional sea level rise in the western tropical Pacific are not expected to persist, as regional sea level will fall in response to a change in phase of natural variability.62 Regional variations in sea level at interannual and interdecadal time scales are generally attributed to changes in prevailing wind patterns associated with El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as well as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and low frequency components of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI).59\nFor the region, extreme sea level events generally occur when high tides combine with some non-tidal residual change in water level. In the major typhoon zones (Guam and Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands), storm-driven surges can cause coastal flooding and erosion regardless of tidal state. Wave-driven inundation events are a major concern for all islands in the region. At present, trends in extreme levels tend to follow trends in mean sea level.\n\nIncreasing mean water levels and the possibility of more frequent extreme water level events, and their manifestation as flooding and erosion, will threaten coastal structures and property, groundwater reservoirs, harbor operations, airports, wastewater systems, sandy beaches, coral reef ecosystems, and other social and economic resources. Impacts will vary with location, depending on how natural sea level variability combines with modest increases of mean levels.62\nOn low-lying atolls, critical public facilities and infrastructure as well as private commercial and residential property are especially vulnerable.62 Agricultural activity will also be affected, as sea level rise decreases the land area available for farming45 and episodic inundation increases salinity of groundwater resources. Impacts to the built environment on low-lying portions of high islands will be much the same as those experienced on low islands. Islands with more developed built infrastructure will experience more economic impacts from tourism loss. One report stated: \"Our analyses estimate that nearly $2.0 billion in overall visitor expenditures could be lost annually due to a complete erosion of Waikk Beach.\"67\nCoastal and nearshore environments (sandy beaches, shallow coral reefs, seagrass beds, intertidal flats, and mangrove forests) and the vegetation and terrestrial animals in these systems will progressively be affected as sea level rise and high wave events alter atoll island size and shape and reduce habitat features necessary for survival. Based on extrapolation from results in American Samoa, sea level rise could cause future reductions of 10%\u00ad20% of total regional mangrove area over the next century.63 Further, atoll-breeding Pacific seabirds will lose large segments of their breeding populations65 as their habitat is increasingly and more extensively inundated.\nMajor uncertainties Sea levels in the Pacific Ocean will continue to rise with global sea level. Models provide a range of predictions, with some suggesting that global warming may raise global sea level considerably over the course of this century. The range of predictions is large due in part to unresolved physical understanding of various processes, notably ice sheet dynamics.\nChanges in prevailing wind patterns associated with natural climate cycles such as ENSO and the PDO affect regional variations in sea level at interannual and interdecadal time scales. Sea level at specific locales will continue to respond to changes in phase of these natural climate cycles. The current high rates of regional sea level rise in the western tropical Pacific are not expected to persist over time, falling once the trade winds begin to weaken.\nFuture wind wave conditions are difficult to project with confidence given the uncertainties regarding future storm conditions.\n\n555\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f23: HAWAI`I AND U.S. AFFILIATED PACIFIC ISLANDS Traceable Accounts\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Evidence for global sea level rise is strong (Ch. 25: Coasts; Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). Confidence is therefore very high. Modeling studies have yielded conflicting results as to how ENSO and other climate modes will vary in the future. As a result, there is low confidence in the prediction of future climate states and their subsequent influence on regional sea level.62 Recent assessments of future extreme conditions generally place low confidence on region-specific projections of future storminess.61\nFor aspects of the key message concerning impacts, confidence is high.\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nMounting threats to food and water security, infrastructure, and public health and safety are expected to lead to increasing human migration from low to high elevation islands and continental sites, making it increasingly difficult for Pacific Islanders to sustain the region's many unique customs, beliefs, and languages.\nDescription of evidence base Climate change threatens communities, cultures, and ecosystems of the Pacific Islands both directly through impact on food and water security, for example, as well as indirectly through impacts on economic sectors including fisheries and tourism.\nOn most islands, increased temperatures, coupled with decreased rainfall and increased drought, will lead to an additional need for freshwater resources for drinking and crop irrigation.43 This is particularly important for locations in the tropics and subtropics where observed data and model projections suggest that, by the end of this century, the average growing season temperatures will exceed the most extreme seasonal temperatures recorded from 1900 to 2006. Atolls will be particularly vulnerable due to their low elevation, small land mass, geographic isolation, and limited potable water sources and agricultural resources.44 The situation will also be exacerbated by the increased incidence of intrusion of saltwater from the ocean during storms as the mean sea level rises over time. These are but part of a cascade of impacts that will increase the pressures on, and threats to, the social and ecosystem sustainability of these island communities.47 On high islands like Hawai`i, decreases in precipitation and baseflow35 are already indicating that there will be impacts on freshwater ecosystems and aquatic species and on water-intensive sectors such as agriculture and tourism.\n\ndepending on how natural sea level variability combines with modest increases of mean levels.62 On low-lying atolls, critical public facilities and infrastructure as well as private commercial and residential property are especially vulnerable. Agricultural activity will also be affected, as sea level rise decreases the land area available for farming45 and episodic inundation increases salinity of groundwater resources.\nWith respect to cultural resources, impacts will extend from the loss of tangible artifacts and structures69 to the intangible loss of a land base and the cultural traditions that are associated with it.70\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Whenever appraising threats to human society, it is uncertain the degree to which societies will successfully adapt to limit impact. For island communities, though, the ability to migrate is very limited, and the ability to adapt is especially limited. Depending on the scale and distance of the migration, a variety of challenges face the migrants and the communities receiving them. Migrants need to establish themselves in their new community, find employment, and access services, while the receiving community's infrastructure, labor market, commerce, natural resources, and governance structures need to absorb a sudden burst of population growth.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Evidence for climate change and impacts is strong, but highly variable from location to location. One can be highly confident that climate change will continue to pose varied threats in the region. Adaptive capacity is also highly variable among the islands, so the resulting situation will play out differently in different places. Confidence is therefore medium.\n\nIncreasing mean oceanic and coastal water levels and the possibility of more frequent extreme water level events with flooding and erosion will escalate the threat to coastal structures and property, groundwater reservoirs, harbor operations, airports, wastewater systems, sandy beaches, coral reef ecosystems, and other social and economic resources. Impacts will vary with location\n\n556\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 24 OCEANS AND MARINE RESOURCES\nConvening Lead Authors\nScott Doney, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Andrew A.

The rise in ocean temperature over the last century will persist into the future, with continued large impacts on climate, ocean circulation, chemistry, and ecosystems.\n2. The ocean currently absorbs about a quarter of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, leading to ocean acidification that will alter marine ecosystems in dramatic yet uncertain ways.\n3. Significant habitat loss will continue to occur due to climate change for many species and areas, including Arctic and coral reef ecosystems, while habitat in other areas and for other species will expand. These changes will consequently alter the distribution, abundance, and productivity of many marine species.\n4. Rising sea surface temperatures have been linked with increasing levels and ranges of diseases in humans and marine life, including corals, abalones, oysters, fishes, and marine mammals.\n5. Climate changes that result in conditions substantially different from recent history may significantly increase costs to businesses as well as disrupt public access and enjoyment of ocean areas.\n6. In response to observed and projected climate impacts, some existing ocean policies, practices, and management efforts are incorporating climate change impacts. These initiatives can serve as models for other efforts and ultimately enable people and communities to adapt to changing ocean conditions.\n\nAs a nation, we depend on the oceans for seafood, recreation and tourism, cultural heritage, transportation of goods, and, increasingly, energy and other critical resources. The U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone extends 200 nautical miles seaward from the coasts, spanning an area about 1.7 times the land area of the continental U.S. and encompassing waters along the U.S. East, West, and Gulf coasts, around Alaska and Hawai`i, and including the U.S. territories in the Pacific and Caribbean. This vast region is host to a rich diversity of marine plants and animals and a wide range of ecosystems, from tropical coral reefs to Arctic waters covered with sea ice.\n\nOceans support vibrant economies and coastal communities with numerous businesses and jobs. More than 160 million people live in the coastal watershed counties of the United States, and population in this zone is expected to grow in the future. The oceans help regulate climate, absorb carbon dioxide (an important greenhouse, or heat-trapping, gas), and strongly influence weather patterns far into the continental interior. Ocean issues touch all of us in both direct and indirect ways.1,2,3\nChanging climate conditions are already affecting these valuable marine ecosystems and the array of resources and services we derive from the sea. Some climate trends, such as rising seawater temperatures and ocean acidification, are common across much of the coastal areas and open ocean worldwide. The biological responses to climate change often vary from region to region, depending on the different combinations of species, habitats, and other attributes of local systems. Data records for the ocean are often shorter and less complete than those on land, and for many biological variables it is still difficult to discern long-term ocean trends from natural variability.4\n\n\u00a9iStockPhoto.com Frank P.J. van Haalen\n\n558\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f24: OCEANS AND MARINE RESOURCES\n\nKey Message 1: Rising Ocean Temperatures\n\nThe rise in ocean temperature over the last century will persist into the future, with continued large impacts on climate, ocean circulation, chemistry, and ecosystems.\n\nCores from corals, ocean sediments, ice records, and other indirect temperature measurements indicate the recent rapid increase of ocean temperature is the greatest that has occurred in at least the past millennium and can only be reproduced by climate models with the inclusion of human-caused sources of heat-trapping gas emissions.5,6 The ocean is a critical reservoir for heat within Earth's climate system, and because of seawater's large heat storing capacity, small changes in ocean temperature reflect large changes in ocean heat storage. Direct measurements of ocean temperatures show warming beginning in about 1970 down to at least 2,300 feet, with stronger warming near the surface leading to increased thermal stratification (or layering) of the water column.7,8 Sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic and Pacific, including near U.S. coasts, have also increased since 1900.9,10 In conjunction with a warming climate, the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has\nObserved Ocean Warming\n\ndecreased rapidly over the past four decades.11,12 Models that best match historical trends project seasonally ice-free northern waters by the 2030s.13\nClimate-driven warming reduces vertical mixing of ocean water that brings nutrients up from deeper water, leading to potential impacts on biological productivity. Warming and altered ocean circulation are also expected to reduce the supply of oxygen to deeper waters, leading to future expansion of sub-surface low-oxygen zones.15 Both reduced nutrients at the surface and reduced oxygen at depth have the potential to change ocean productivity.14 Satellite observations indicate that warming of the upper ocean on year-to-year timescales leads to reductions in the biological productivity of tropical and subtropical (the region just outside the tropics) oceans and expansion of the area of surface waters with very low quantities of phyto-\nplankton (microscopic marine plants) biomass.16 Ecosystem models suggest that the same patterns of productivity change will occur over the next century as a consequence of warming during this century, perhaps also with increasing productivity near the poles.17 These changes can affect ecosystems at multiple levels of the food web, with consequent changes for fisheries and other important human activities that depend on ocean productivity.4,18\n\nFigure 24.1. Sea surface temperatures for the ocean surrounding the U.S. and its territories have warmed by more than 0.9\u00b0F over the past century (top panel). There is significant variation from place to place, with the ocean off the coast of Alaska, for example, warming far more rapidly than other areas (bottom panel). The gray shading on the map denotes U.S. land territory and the regions where the U.S. has rights over the exploration and use of marine resources, as defined by the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). (Figure source: adapted from Chavez et al. 201114).\n\nOther changes in the physical and chemical properties of the ocean are also underway due to climate change. These include rising sea level,19 changes in upper ocean salinity (including reduced salinity of Arctic surface waters) resulting from altered inputs of freshwater and losses from evaporation, changes in wave height from changes in wind speed, and changes in oxygen content at various depths \u00ad changes that will affect marine ecosystems and human uses of the ocean in the coming years.4\n\n559\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f24: OCEANS AND MARINE RESOURCES\n\nWhile the long-term global pattern is clear, there is considerable variability in the effects of climate change regionally and locally because oceanographic conditions are not uniform and are strongly influenced by natural climate fluctuations. Trends\n\nduring short periods of a decade or so can be dominated by natural variability.25 For example, the high incidence of La Ni\u00f1a\nevents in the last 15 years has played a role in the observed temperature trends.26\n\nOcean Impacts of Increased Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide\n\nAnalyses27 suggest that more of the increase in heat energy during this period has been transferred to the deep ocean (see also Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). While this might temporarily slow the rate of increase in surface air temperature, ultimately it will prolong the effects of global warming because the oceans hold heat for longer than the atmosphere does.\n\nInteractions with processes in the atmosphere and on land, such as rainfall patterns and runoff, also vary by region and are strongly influenced by natural climate fluctuations, resulting in additional local variation in the observed effects in the ocean.\n\nMarine ecosystems are also affected by other human-caused local and regional disturbances such as overfishing, coastal habitat loss, and pollution, and climate change impacts may exacerbate the effects of these other human factors.\n\nFigure 24.2. As heat-trapping gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) (panel A), have increased over the past decades, not only has air temperature increased worldwide, but so has the temperature of the ocean's surface (panel B). The increased ocean temperature, combined with melting of glaciers and ice sheets on land, is leading to higher sea levels (panel C). Increased air and ocean temperatures are also causing the continued, dramatic decline in Arctic sea ice during the summer (panel D). Additionally, the ocean is becoming more acidic as increased atmospheric CO2 dissolves into it (panel E). (CO2 data from Etheridge 2010,20 Tans and Keeling 2012,21 and NOAA NCDC 2012;22 SST data from NOAA NCDC 201222 and Smith et al. 2008;10 Sea level data from CSIRO 201223 and Church and White 2011;19 Sea ice data from University of Illinois 2012;24 pH data from Doney et al. 20124).\n\n560\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f24: OCEANS AND MARINE RESOURCES\n\nKey Message 2: Ocean Acidification Alters Marine Ecosystems\n\nThe ocean currently absorbs about a quarter of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, leading to ocean acidification that will alter marine ecosystems in dramatic yet uncertain ways.\n\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has risen by about 40% above pre-industrial levels.21,28 The ocean absorbs about a\nquarter of human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide annu-\nally, thereby changing seawater chemistry and decreasing pH\n(making seawater more acidic) (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 12).3,29 Surface ocean pH has declined by 0.1\nunits, equivalent to a 30% increase in ocean acidity, since preindustrial times.30 Ocean acidification will continue in the fu-\nture due to the interaction of atmospheric carbon dioxide and\nocean water. Regional differences in ocean pH occur as a result\nof variability in regional or local conditions, such as upwelling that brings subsurface waters up to the surface.31 Locally,\ncoastal waters and estuaries can also exhibit acidification as\nthe result of pollution and excess nutrient inputs.\n\nOver 90% of seafood consumed in the U.S. is imported, and\nmore than half of the imported seafood comes from aquaculture (fish and shellfish farming).1 While only 1% of U.S. seafood\ncomes from domestic shellfish farming, the industry is locally\nimportant. In addition, shellfish have historically been an im-\nportant cultural and food resource for indigenous peoples along our coasts (Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples, Key Message 1). Increased ocean acidification, low-oxygen events, and rising\ntemperatures are already affecting shellfish aquaculture op-\nerations. Higher temperatures are predicted to increase aqua-\nculture potential in poleward regions, but decrease it in the tropics.37 Acidification, however, will likely reduce growth and survival of shellfish stocks in all regions.34\n\nMore acidic waters create repercussions along the marine food chain. For example, calcium carbonate is a skeletal component of a wide variety of organisms in the oceans, including corals. The chemical changes caused by the uptake of CO2 make it more difficult for these living things to form and maintain calcium carbonate shells and skeletal components and increases erosion of coral reefs,32 resulting in alterations in marine ecosystems that will become more severe as present-day trends in acidification continue or accelerate (Ch. 22: Alaska; Ch. 23: Hawai`i and Pacific Islands).33,34,35 Tropical corals are particularly susceptible to the combination of ocean acidification and ocean warming, which would threaten the rich and biologically diverse coral reef habitats.\n\nPteropods, or \"sea butterflies,\" are eaten by a variety of marine species ranging from tiny krill to salmon to whales. The photos show what happens to a pteropod's shell in seawater that is too acidic. On the left is a shell from a live pteropod from a region in the Southern Ocean where acidity is not too high. The shell on the right is from a pteropod in a region where the water is more acidic. (Photo credits: (left) Bednarsek et al. 2012;105 (right) Nina Bednarsek).\n\nOcean Acidification Reduces Size of Clams\n\nFigure 24.3. The 36-day-old clams in the photos are a single species, Mercenaria mercenaria, grown in the laboratory under varying levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air. CO2 is absorbed from the air by ocean water, acidifying the water and thus reducing the ability of juvenile clams to grow their shells. As seen in the photos, where CO2 levels rise progressively from left to right, 36-day-old clams (measured in microns) grown under elevated CO2 levels are smaller than those grown under lower CO2 levels. The highest CO2 level, about 1500 parts per million (ppm; far right), is higher than most projections for the end of this century but could occur locally in some estuaries. (Figure source: Talmage and Gobler 201036).\n\n561\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f24: OCEANS AND MARINE RESOURCES\nThe impacts of ocean acidification on west coast aquaculture\nOcean acidification has already changed the way shellfish farmers on the West Coast conduct business. For oyster growers, the practical effect of the lowering pH of ocean water has not only been to make the water more acidic, but also more corrosive to young shellfish raised in aquaculture facilities. Growers at Whiskey Creek Hatchery, in Oregon's Netarts Bay, found that low pH seawater during spawning reduced growth in mid-stage larval (juvenile) Pacific oysters.38 Hatcheries in Washington State have also experienced losses of spat (oyster larvae that have attached to a surface and begun to develop a shell) due to water quality issues that include other human-caused effects like dredging and pollution.39 Facilities like the Taylor Shellfish Farms hatchery on Hood Canal have changed their production techniques to respond to increasing acidification in Puget Sound.\nThese impacts bring to light a potential challenge: existing natural variation may interact with human-caused changes to produce unanticipated results for shell-forming marine life, especially in coastal regions.40 As a result, there is an increasing need for information about water chemistry conditions, such as data obtained through the use of sensor networks. In the case of Whiskey Creek, instruments installed in collaboration with ocean scientists created an \"early warning\" system that allows oyster growers to choose the time they take water into the hatchery from the coastal ocean. This allows them to avoid the lower-pH water related to upwelling and the commensurate loss of productivity in the hatchery.\nFrom a biological perspective, these kinds of preventative measures can help produce higher-quality oysters. Studies on native Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) show that there is a \"carry-over\" effect of acidified water \u00ad oysters exposed to acidic conditions while in the juvenile stage continue to grow slower in later life stages.41 Research on some oyster species such as Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), the commercially important species in U.S. west coast aquaculture, shows that specially selected strains can be more resistant to acidification.42\nOverall, economically important species such as oysters, mussels, and sea urchins are highly vulnerable to changes in ocean conditions brought on by climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 levels. Sea temperature and acidification are expected to increase; the acidity of surface seawater is projected to nearly double by the end of this century. Some important cultured species may be influenced in larval and juvenile developing stages, during fertilization, and as adults,43 resulting in lower productivity. Action groups, such as the California Current Acidification Network (C-CAN), are working to address the needs of the shellfish industry \u00ad both wild and aquaculture-based fisheries \u00ad in the face of ocean change. These efforts bring scientists from across disciplines together with aquaculturists, fishermen, the oceanographic community, and state and federal decision-makers to ensure a concerted, standardized, and cost-effective approach to gaining new understanding of the impact of acidification on ecosystems and the economy.44\n\nKey Message 3: Habitat Loss Affects Marine Life\n\nSignificant habitat loss will continue to occur due to climate change for many species and areas, including Arctic and coral reef ecosystems, while habitat in other areas and for other species will expand. These changes will consequently alter the distribution, abundance, and productivity of many marine species.\n\nSpecies have responded to climate change in part by shifting where they live.45 Such range shifts result in ecosystem changes, including the relationships between species and their connection to habitat, because different species respond to changing conditions in different ways. This means that ocean ecosystems are changing in complex ways, with accompanying changes in ecosystem functions (such as nutrient cycling, productivity of species, and predator-prey relationships). Overall habitat extent is expected to change as well, though the degree of range migration will depend upon the life history of particular species. For example, reductions in seasonal sea-ice cover and higher surface temperatures may open up new habitats in polar regions for some important fish species, such as cod, herring, and pollock.46 However, the continuing presence of cold bottom-water temperatures on the Alaskan Continen-\n\ntal shelf could limit northward migration into the northern Bering Sea and Chukchi Sea.47 In addition, warming may cause\nreductions in the abundance of some species, such as pollock, in their current ranges in the Bering Sea.48 For other ice-de-\npendent species, including several marine mammals such as\npolar bears, walruses, and many seal species, the loss of their critically important habitat will result in population declines.49\nAdditionally, climate extremes can facilitate biological inva-\nsions by a variety of mechanisms such as increased movement\nor transport of invasive species, and decreased resilience of\nnative species, so that climate change could increase existing impacts from human transport.50 These changes will result in\nchanging interactions among species with consequences that\nare difficult to predict. Tropical species and ecosystems may\nencounter similar difficulties in migrating poleward as success\n\n562\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f24: OCEANS AND MARINE RESOURCES\n\nof some key species such as corals may be limited by adequate bottom substrate, water clarity, and light availability.51\nClimate change impacts such as increasing ocean temperatures can profoundly affect production of natural stocks of fish by changing growth, reproduction, survival, and other critical characteristics of fish stocks and ecosystems. For species that migrate to freshwater from the sea, like salmon, some published studies indicate earlier start of spawning migration, warming stream temperatures, and extirpation in southern extent of range, all of which can affect productivity.4,52 To remain within their normal temperature range, some fish stocks are moving poleward and to deeper water.53,54 Fishery productivity is predicted to decline in the lower 48 states, but increase in\n\nparts of Alaska.55 However, projections based only on temperature may neglect important food web effects. Fishing costs are predicted to increase as fisheries transition to new species and as processing plants and fishing jobs shift poleward.18 The cumulative impact of such changes will be highly variable on regional scales because of the combination of factors \u00ad some acting in opposite directions. Some areas will benefit from range expansions of valuable species or increases in productivity, while others will suffer as species move away from previously productive areas.\n\nCoral reef ecosystem collapse\n\nRecent research indicates that 75% of the world's coral reefs are threatened due to the interactive effects of climate change and local sources of stress, such as overfishing, nutrient pollution, and disease.56,57 In Florida, all reefs are rated as threatened, with significant impacts on valuable ecosystem services they provide.58 Caribbean coral cover has decreased 80% in less than three decades.59 These declines have in turn led to a flattening of the three dimensional\nstructure of coral reefs and hence a decrease in the capacity of coral reefs to provide shelter and other resources for other reef-dependent ocean life.60\n\nThe relationship between coral and zooxanthellae (algae vital for reef-building corals) is disrupted by higher than usual\n\ntemperatures and results in a condition where the coral is still alive, but devoid of all its color (bleaching). Bleached\n\ncorals can later die or become infected with disease.61,62 Thus, high temperature events alone can kill large stretches\n\nof coral reef, although\n\nWarming Seas Are a Double-blow to Corals\n\ncold water and poor water quality can\n\nalso cause localized\n\nbleaching and death.\n\nEvidence suggests that\n\nrelatively pristine reefs,\n\nwith fewer human im-\n\npacts and with intact\n\nfish and associated\n\ninvertebrate communi-\n\nties, are more resilient\n\nto coral bleaching and\n\ndisease.63\n\nFigure 24.4. A colony of star coral (Montastraea faveolata) off the southwestern coast of Puerto Rico (estimated to be about 500 years old) exemplifies the effect of rising water temperatures. Increasing disease due to warming waters killed the central portion of the colony (yellow portion in A), followed by such high temperatures that bleaching - or loss of symbiotic algae from coral - occurred from the surrounding tissue (white area in B). The coral then experienced more disease in the bleached area on the periphery (C) that ultimately killed the colony (D).

Disease increases mortality and can reduce abundance for affected populations as well as fundamentally change ecosystems by changing habitat or species relationships. For example, loss of eelgrass beds due to disease can reduce critical nursery habitat for several species of commercially important fish.70,71\nThe complexity of the host/environment/pathogen interaction makes it challenging to separate climate warming from the myriad of other causes facilitating increased disease outbreaks in the ocean. However, three categories of disease-causing pathogens are unequivocally related to warming oceans. Firstly, warmer winters due to climate change can increase the overwinter survival and growth rates of pathogens.67 A disease-causing parasite in oysters that proliferates at high water temperatures and high salinities spread northward up the eastern seaboard as water temperatures warmed during the 1990s.72 Growth rates of coral disease lesions increased with winter and summer warming from 1996 to 2006.62 Winter warming in the Arctic is resulting in increased incidence of a salmon disease in the Bering Sea and is now thought to be a cause of a 57% decline of Yukon Chinook salmon.73\n\nSecondly, increasing disease outbreaks in ecologically important species like coral, eelgrass, and abalone have been linked with temperatures that are higher than the long-term averages. The spectacular biodiversity of tropical coral reefs is particularly vulnerable to warming because the corals that form the foundational reef structure live very near the upper temperature limit at which they thrive. The increasing frequency of record hot temperatures has caused widespread coral bleaching66 and disease outbreaks65 and is a principal factor contributing to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature listing a third of the reef-building corals as vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered 74 and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration proposing to list 66 species of corals under the Endangered Species Act.75,76 In the Chesapeake Bay, eelgrass died out almost completely during the record-hot summers of 2005 and 2010,77 and the California black abalone has been driven to the edge of extinction by a combination of warming water and bacterial disease.78\nThirdly, there is evidence that increased water temperature is responsible for the enhanced survival and growth of certain marine bacteria that make humans sick.78 Increases in growth of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (a pathogenic bacterial species) during the warm season are responsible for human illnesses associated with oysters harvested from the Gulf of Mexico79 and northern Europe.80 Vibrio vulnificus, which is responsible for the overwhelming majority of reported seafood-related deaths in the United States,81 is also a significant and growing source of potentially fatal wound infections associated with recreational swimming, fishing-related cuts, and seafood handling, and is most frequently found in water with a temperature above 68\u00b0F.79,81,82\n\nKey Message 5: Economic Impacts of Marine-related Climate Change\n\nClimate changes that result in conditions substantially different from recent history may significantly increase costs to businesses as well as disrupt public access and enjoyment of ocean areas.\n\nAltered environmental conditions due to climate change will affect, in both positive and negative ways, human uses of the ocean, including transportation, resource use and extraction, leisure and tourism activities and industries, in the nearshore and offshore areas. Climate change will also affect maritime security and governance. Arctic-related national security concerns and threats to national sovereignty have also been a recent focus of attention for some researchers.83,84 With sea ice receding in the Arctic as a result of rising temperatures, global shipping patterns are already changing and will con-\n\ntinue to change considerably in the decades to come.84,85 The increase in maritime traffic could make disputes over the legal status of sea lines-of-communication and international straits more pointed, but mechanisms exist to resolve these disputes peacefully through the Law of the Sea Convention and other customary international laws.\nResource use for fisheries, aquaculture, energy production, and other activities in ocean areas will also need to adjust to changing ocean climate conditions. In addition to the shift in\n\n564\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f24: OCEANS AND MARINE RESOURCES\n\nhabitat of living resources discussed above, changing ocean and weather conditions due to human-induced climate change make any activities at sea more difficult to plan, design, and operate.\nIn the United States, the healthy natural services (such as fishing and recreation) and cultural resources provided by the ocean also play a large economic role in our tourism industry. Nationally in 2010, 2.8% of gross domestic product, 7.52 million jobs, and $1.11 trillion in travel and recreational total sales are supported by tourism.86 In 2009-2010, nine of the top ten states and U.S. territories and seven of the top ten cities visited by overseas travelers were coastal, including the Great Lakes. Changes in the location and distribution of marine resources (such as fish, healthy reefs, and marine mammals) due to climate change will affect the recreational industries and all the people that depend on reliable access to these resources in predictable locales. For example, as fish species shift poleward or to deeper waters,54,87 these fish may be less accessible to recreational fishermen. Similar issues will also affect commercial fishing.\n\nSimilarly, new weather conditions differing from the historical\npattern will pose a challenge for tourism, boating, recreational\nfishing, diving, and snorkeling, all of which rely on highly pre-\ndictable, comfortable water and air temperatures and calm wa-\nters. For example, the strength of hurricanes and the number of\nstrong (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes are projected to increase\nover the North Atlantic (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). Changes in wind patterns88 and wave heights have been observed89 and are projected to continue to change in the future.90 This means\nthat the public will not be able to rely on recent experience in planning leisure and tourism activities.91,92 As weather patterns\nchange and air and sea surface temperatures rise, preferred\nlocations for recreation and tourism also may change. In ad-\ndition, infrastructure such as marinas, marine supply stores,\nboardwalks, hotels, and restaurants that support leisure activi-\nties and tourism will be negatively affected by sea level rise.\nThey may also be affected by increased storm intensity and changing wave heights,92 as well as elevated storm surge due\nto sea level rise and other expected effects of a changing climate; these impacts will vary significantly by region.93\n\nKey Message 6: Initiatives Serve as a Model\n\nIn response to observed and projected climate impacts, some existing ocean policies, practices, and management efforts are incorporating climate change impacts. These\ninitiatives can serve as models for other efforts and ultimately enable people and communities to adapt to changing ocean conditions.\n\nClimate considerations can be integrated into planning, restoration, design of marine protected areas, fisheries management, and aquaculture practices to enhance ocean resilience and adaptive capacity. Many existing sustainable-use strategies, such as ending overfishing, establishing protected areas, and conserving habitat, are known to increase resilience. Analyses of fishery management and climate scenarios suggest that adjustments to harvest regimes (especially reducing harvest rates of over-exploited species) can improve catch stability under changing climate conditions. These actions could have a greater effect on biological and economic performance in fisheries than impacts due to warming over the next 25 years.94 The stability of international ocean and fisheries treaties, particularly those covering commercially exploited and critical species, might be threatened as the ocean changes.95\nThe fact that the climate is changing is beginning to be incorporated into existing management strategies. New five-year strategies for addressing flooding, shoreline erosion, and coastal storms have been developed by most coastal states under their Coastal Zone Management Act programs.3 Many of these plans are explicitly taking into account future climate scenarios as part of their adaptation initiatives. The North Pacific Fishery Management Council and NOAA have declared a moratorium on most commercial fisheries in the U.S. Arctic pending sufficient understanding of the changing productiv-\n\nity of these fishing grounds as they become increasingly icefree. Private shellfish aquaculture operations are changing their business plans to adapt to ocean acidification.38,39 These changes include monitoring and altering the timing of spat settlement dependent on climate change induced conditions, as well as seeking alternative, acid-resistant strains for culturing. Marine protected areas in the National Marine Sanctuary (NMS) System are gradually preparing climate impact reports and climate adaptation action plans under their Climate Smart Sanctuary Initiative.96\nAdditionally, there is promise in restoring key habitats to provide a broad suite of benefits that can reduce climate impacts with relatively little ongoing maintenance costs (see Ch. 25: Coasts; Ch. 28: Adaptation). For example, if in addition to sea level rise, an oyster reef or mangrove restoration strategy also included fish habitat benefits for commercial and recreational uses and coastal protection services, the benefits to surrounding communities could multiply quickly. Coral-reef-based tourism can be more resilient to climate change impacts through protection and restoration, as well as reductions of pollution and other habitat-destroying activities. Developing alternative livelihood options as part of adaptation strategies for marine food-producing sectors can help reduce economic and social impacts of a changing climate.\n\n565\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f24: OCEANS AND MARINE RESOURCES\n\nClimate impacts on new england fisheries\n\nFishing in New England has been associated with bottom-dwelling fish for more than\n\n400 years, and is a central part of the region's cultural identity and social fabric. Atlantic\n\nhalibut, cod, haddock, flounders, hakes, pollock, plaice, and soles are included under\n\nthe term \"groundfish.\" The fishery is pursued by both small boats (less than 50 feet long)\n\nthat are typically at sea for less than a day, and by large boats (longer than 50 feet) that\n\nfish for a day to a week at a time. These vessels use home ports in more than 100 coast-\n\nal communities from Maine to New Jersey, and the landed value from fisheries in New\n\nEngland and the\n\nMid-Atlantic in\n\n2010 was nearly $1.2 billion.76 Cap-\n\nFisheries Shifting North\n\ntains and crew are\n\noften second- or\n\nthird-generation\n\nfishermen who have\n\nlearned the trade\n\nfrom their families.\n\niStockPhoto.com/\u00a9mayo5\n\nFrom 1982 to 2006, sea surface temperature in the coastal waters of the Northeast warmed by close to twice the global rate of warming over this period.97 Long-term monitoring of bottom-dwelling fish communities in New England revealed that the abundance of warmwater species increased, while cool-water species decreased.54,98 A recent study suggests that many species in this community have shifted their geographic distributions northward by up to 200 miles since 1968, though substantial variability among species also exists.54 The northward shifts of these species are reflected in the fishery as well: landings and landed value of these species have shifted towards northern states such as Massachusetts and Maine, while southern states have seen declines (see Figure 24.5).\n\nThe economic and social impacts of these changes depend in large part on the response of the fishing communities in the region.99 Communities have a range of strategies for coping with the inherent uncertainty and variability of fishing, including diversification among species and livelihoods, but climate change imposes both increased variability and sustained change that may push these fishermen beyond their ability to cope.100 Larger fishing boats can follow the fish to a certain extent as they shift northward, while smaller inshore boats will be more likely to leave fishing or switch to new species.100 Long-term viability of fisheries in the region may ultimately depend on a transition to new species that have shifted from regions farther south.18\n\nFigure 24.5. Ocean species are shifting northward along U.S. coastlines as ocean temperatures rise. As a result, over the past 40 years, more northern ports have gradually increased their landings of four marine species compared to the earlier pattern of landed value. While some species move northward out of an area, other species move in from the south. This kind of information can inform decisions about how to adapt to climate change. Such adaptations take time and have costs, as local knowledge and equipment are geared to the species that have long been present in an area.

In the workshop, nearly 30 participants took part in a series of scoping presentations and breakout sessions that began the process leading to a foundational Technical Input Report (TIR) entitled \"Oceans and Marine Resources in a Changing Climate: Technical Input to the 2013 National Climate Assessment.\"102 The report, consisting of nearly 220 pages of text organized into 7 sections with numerous subsections and more than 1200 references, was assembled by 122 authors representing governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, tribes, and other entities.\nThe chapter author team engaged in multiple technical discussions via teleconferences that permitted a careful review of the foundational TIR102 and of approximately 25 additional technical inputs provided by the public, as well as the other published literature, and professional judgment. The chapter author team met at Conservation International in Arlington, VA on 3-4 May 2012 for expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors, wherein each message was defended before the entire author team before the key message was selected for inclusion in the report. These discussions were supported by targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each message to help define \"key vulnerabilities.\"\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nThe rise in ocean temperature over the last century will persist into the future, with continued large impacts on climate, ocean circulation, chemistry, and ecosystems.\nDescription of evidence base The key message is supported by extensive evidence documented in Sections 2 and 3 of the Oceans Technical Input Report102 and in the additional technical inputs received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, as well as stakeholder engagement leading up to drafting the chapter.\n\nRelevant and recent peer-reviewed publications,5,7,8 including many others that are cited therein, describe evidence that ocean temperature has risen over the past century. This evidence base includes direct and indirect temperature measurements, paleoclimate records, and modeling results.\nThere are also many relevant and recent peer-reviewed publications describing changes in physical and chemical ocean properties that are underway due to climate change.11,14\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Important new information since the last National Climate Assessment103 includes the latest update to a data set of ocean temperatures.7\nThere is accumulating new information on all of these points with regard to physical and chemical changes in the ocean and resultant impacts on marine ecosystems. Both measurements and model results are continuing to sharpen the picture.\nA significant area of uncertainty remains with regard to the region-by-region impacts of warming, acidification, and associated changes in the oceans. Regional and local conditions mean that impacts will not be uniform around the U.S. coasts or internationally. Forecasting of regional changes is still an area of very active research, though the overall patterns for some features are now clear.\nLarge-scale and recurring climate phenomena (such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) cause dramatic changes in biological productivity and ecosystem structure and make it difficult to discern climate-driven trends.\nCurrent time series of biological productivity are restricted to a handful of sites around the globe and to a few decades, and global, comprehensive satellite time series of ocean color are even shorter, beginning in 1997. Based on an analysis of different in situ datasets, one research group suggested a decline of 1% per year over the past century, but these findings may be an artifact\n\n575\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f24: OCEANS AND MARINE RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\nof limited data and have been widely debated.14,104 However, the few in situ time series mostly indicate increases in biological productivity over the past 20 years, but with clear links to regional changes in climate.14\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Confidence that the ocean is warming and acidifying, and that sea level is rising is very high. Changes in other physical and chemical properties such as ocean circulation, wave heights, oxygen minimums, and salinity are of medium confidence. For ecosystem changes, there is high confidence that these are occurring and will persist and likely grow in the future, though the details of these changes are highly geographically variable.\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent\nresults, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods\nvary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\n\nNumerous references provide evidence for the increasing acidity (lower pH) of oceans around the world (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 12).3,31\nThere is a rapid growth in peer-reviewed publications describing how ocean acidification will impact ecosystems,33,34 but to date evidence is largely based on studies of calcification rather than growth, reproduction, and survival of organisms. For these latter effects, available evidence is from laboratory studies in low pH conditions, rather than in situ observations.35\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The interplay of environmental stressors may result in \"surprises\" where the synergistic impacts may be more deleterious or more beneficial than expected. Such synergistic effects create complexities in predicting the outcome of the interplay of stressors on marine ecosystems. Many, but not all, calcifying species are affected by increased acidity in laboratory studies. How those responses will cascade through ecosystems and food webs is still uncertain. Although studies are underway to expand understanding of ocean acidification on all aspects of organismal physiology, much remains to be learned.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Confidence is very high that carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere are causing ocean acidification, and high that this will alter marine ecosystems. The nature of those alterations is unclear, however, and predictions of most specific ecosystem changes have low confidence at present, but with medium confidence for coral reefs.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nSignificant habitat loss will continue to occur due to climate change for many species and areas, including Arctic and coral reef ecosystems, while habitat in other areas and for other species will expand. These changes will consequently alter the distribution, abundance, and productivity of many marine species.\n\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nThe ocean currently absorbs about a quarter of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, leading to ocean acidification that will alter marine ecosystems in dramatic yet uncertain ways.\n\nDescription of evidence base The key message is supported by extensive evidence documented in the Oceans Technical Input Report102 and additional technical inputs received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, as well as stakeholder engagement leading up to drafting the chapter.\n\nDescription of evidence base The key message is supported by extensive evidence documented in the Oceans Technical Input Report102 and additional technical inputs received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, as well as stakeholder engagement leading up to drafting the chapter.\n\nMany peer-reviewed publications56,70 describe threats to coral reefs induced by global change.\nThere are also many relevant and recent peer-reviewed publications53,54,87 that discuss impacts on marine species and resources of habitat change that is induced by climate change.\n\n576\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f24: OCEANS AND MARINE RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Regional and local variation is, again, a major component of the remaining uncertainties. Different areas, habitats, and species are responding differently and have very different adaptive capacities. Those species that are motile will certainly respond differently, or at least at a different rate, by changing distribution and migration patterns, compared to species that do not move, such as corals.\nAlthough it is clear that some fish stocks are moving poleward and to deeper water, how far they will move and whether most species will move remains unclear. A key uncertainty is the extent to which various areas will benefit from range expansions of valuable species or increases in productivity, while other areas will suffer as species move away from previously productive areas. The loss of critically important habitat due to climate change will result in changes in species interactions that are difficult to predict.\n\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nClimate changes that result in conditions substantially different from recent history may significantly increase costs to businesses as well as disrupt public access and enjoyment of ocean areas.\nDescription of evidence base The key message is supported by extensive evidence documented in the Oceans Technical Input Report102 and additional technical inputs received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, as well as stakeholder engagement leading up to drafting the chapter.\nMany peer-reviewed publications describe the predicted impacts of climate change on tourism and recreation industries and their associated infrastructure.91,92\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is very high confidence that habitat and ecosystems are changing due to climate change, but that change is not unidirectional by any means. Distribution, abundance, and productivity changes are species and location dependent and may be increasing or decreasing in a complex pattern.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nRising sea surface temperatures have been linked with increasing levels and ranges of diseases in humans and in marine life, including corals, abalones, oysters, fishes, and marine mammals.\nDescription of evidence base The key message is supported by extensive evidence in the Oceans Technical Input Report102 and additional technical inputs received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, as well as stakeholder engagement leading up to drafting the chapter.\nAs noted in the chapter, the references document increased levels and ranges of disease coincident with rising temperatures.64,65,66,67\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The interactions among host, environment, and pathogen are complex, which makes it challenging to separate warming due to climate change from other causes of disease outbreaks in the ocean.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is high confidence that disease outbreaks and levels are increasing, and that this increase is linked to increasing temperatures. Again, there is substantial local to regional variation but the overall pattern seems consistent.\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Given the complexity of transportation, resource use and extraction, and leisure and tourism activities, there are large uncertainties in impacts in specific locales or for individual activities. Some businesses and communities may be able to adapt rapidly, others less so. Infrastructure impacts of climate change will also be an important part of the ability of businesses, communities, and the public to adapt.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence As with many other impacts of climate change, the evidence that change is occurring is very strong but the resultant impacts are still uncertain. For all of these human uses, and the associated costs and disruption, the evidence is suggestive and confidence medium on the effects of the ongoing changes in ocean conditions.\nKey message #6 Traceable Account\nIn response to observed and projected climate impacts, some existing ocean policies, practices, and management efforts are incorporating climate change impacts. These initiatives can serve as models for other efforts and ultimately enable people and communities to adapt to changing ocean conditions.\nDescription of evidence base The key message is supported by extensive evidence documented in the Oceans Technical Input Report102 and additional technical inputs reports received as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, as well as stakeholder engagement leading up to drafting the chapter.\nScenarios suggest that adjustments to fish harvest regimes can improve catch stability under increased climate variability. These actions could have a greater effect on biological and economic performance in fisheries than impacts due to warming over the next 25 years.94\n\n577\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fNew information and remaining uncertainties Efforts are underway to enhance the development and deployment of science in support of adaptation, to improve understanding and awareness of climate-related risks, and to enhance analytic capacity to translate understanding into planning and management activities. While critical knowledge gaps exist, there is a wealth of climate- and ocean-related science pertinent to adaptation.102\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence There is high confidence that adaptation planning will help mitigate the impacts of changing ocean conditions. But there is much work to be done to craft local solutions to the set of emerging issues in ocean and coastal areas.\n\n24: OCEANS AND MARINE RESOURCES Traceable Accounts\n\n578\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 25 COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS\nConvening Lead Authors\nSusanne C.

Coastal lifelines, such as water supply and energy infrastructure and evacuation routes, are increasingly vulnerable to higher sea levels and storm surges, inland flooding, erosion, and other climate-related changes.\n2. Nationally important assets, such as ports, tourism and fishing sites, in already-vulnerable coastal locations, are increasingly exposed to sea level rise and related hazards. This threatens to disrupt economic activity within coastal areas and the regions they serve and results in significant costs from protecting or moving these assets.\n3. Socioeconomic disparities create uneven exposures and sensitivities to growing coastal risks and limit adaptation options for some coastal communities, resulting in the displacement of the most vulnerable people from coastal areas.\n4. Coastal ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change because many have already been dramatically altered by human stresses; climate change will result in further reduction or loss of the services that these ecosystems provide, including potentially irreversible impacts.\n5. Leaders and residents of coastal regions are increasingly aware of the high vulnerability of coasts to climate change and are developing plans to prepare for potential impacts on citizens, businesses, and environmental assets. Significant institutional, political, social, and economic obstacles to implementing adaptation actions remain.\n\nPopulation Change in U.S. Coastal Watershed Counties\n\n(1970-2010)\n\nFigure 25.1.

A coastal watershed county\n\nis defined as one where either 1)\n\nat a minimum, 15% of the county's\n\ntotal land area is located within a\n\ncoastal watershed, or 2) a portion\n\nof or an entire county accounts for\n\nat least 15% of a coastal USGS 8-digit cataloging unit.1 Residents\n\nin these coastal areas can be con-\n\nsidered \"the U.S. population that most directly affects the coast.\"1\n\nWe use this definition of \"coastal\"\n\nthroughout the chapter unless\n\notherwise specified. (Data from\n\nU.S. Census Bureau).\n\n580\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS\n\nEach year, more than 1.2 million people move to the coast, collectively adding the equivalent of nearly one San Diego, or more than three Miami's, to the Great Lakes or open-ocean coastal watershed counties and parishes of the United States. As a result, 164 million Americans \u00ad more than 50% of the population \u00ad now live in these mostly densely populated areas1,2 (Figure 25.1) and help generate 58% of the national gross domestic product (GDP).3 People come \u00ad and stay \u00ad for the diverse and growing employment opportunities in recreation and tourism, commerce, energy and mineral production, vibrant urban centers, and the irresistible beauty of our coasts.4 Residents, combined with the more than 180 million tourists that flock to the coasts each year,5,6 place heavy demands on the unique natural systems and resources that make coastal areas so attractive and productive.7\nMeanwhile, public agencies and officials are charged with balancing the needs of economic vitality and public safety, while sustaining the built and natural environments in the face of risks from well-known natural hazards such as storms, flooding, and erosion.8 Although these risks play out in different ways along the United States' more than 94,000 miles of coastline,9 all coasts share one simple fact: no other region concentrates so many people and so much economic activity on so little land, while also being so relentlessly affected by the sometimes violent interactions of land, sea, and air.\nHumans have heavily altered the coastal environment through development, changes in land use, and overexploitation of resources. Now, the changing climate is imposing additional\n\nstresses,10 making life on the coast more challenging (Figure 25.2). The consequences will ripple through the entire nation, which depends on the productivity and vitality of coastal regions.\nCoastal resilience defined\nResilience means different things to different disciplines and fields of practice. In this chapter, resilience generally refers to an ecological, human, or physical system's ability to persist in the face of disturbance or change and continue to perform certain functions.11 Natural or physical systems do so through absorbing shocks, reorganizing after disturbance, and adapting;12 social systems can also consciously learn.13\nEvents like Superstorm Sandy in 2012 have illustrated that public safety and human well-being become jeopardized by the disruption of crucial lifelines, such as water, energy, and evacuation routes. As climate continues to change, repeated disruption of lives, infrastructure functions, and nationally and internationally important economic activities will pose intolerable burdens on people who are already most vulnerable and aggravate existing impacts on valuable and irreplaceable natural systems. Planning long-term for these changes, while balancing different and often competing demands, are vexing challenges for decision-makers (Ch. 26: Decision Support).\n\nFlooding During High Tides\n\nFigure 25.2. Sea level rise is not just a problem of the future, but is already affecting coastal communities such as Charleston, South Carolina, and Olympia in South Puget Sound through flooding during high tides.

In regions where precipitation increases, coastal areas will see heavier runoff from inland areas, with the already observed trend toward more intense rainfall events continuing to increase the risk of extreme runoff and flooding. Where precipitation is expected to decline and droughts to increase, freshwater inflows to the coast will be reduced (Ch. 3: Water).\n\nJacques Descloitres, MODIS Rapid Response Team, NASA/GSFC\n\n\u00b7 There has been an overall increase in storm activity near\nthe Northeast and Northwest coastlines since about 1980.25 Winter storms have increased slightly in frequency\nand intensity and their storm tracks have shifted northward.26 The most intense tropical storms have increased in intensity in the last few decades.27 Future projections\nsuggest increases in hurricane rainfall and intensity (with\na greater number of the strongest \u00ad Category 4 and 5 \u00ad\nhurricanes), a slight decrease in the frequency of tropical\ncyclones, and possible shifts in storm tracks, though the\ndetails remain uncertain (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).\n\n582\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS\nProjected Sea Level Rise and Flooding by 2050\n\nFigure 25.3.

These vulnerabilities have the potential to fundamentally alter life at the coast and disrupt coast-dependent economic activities.\n\nAdapting Coastal Infrastructure to Sea Level Rise and Land Loss\n\nCoastal infrastructure is exposed to climate\n\nchange impacts from both the landward and ocean sides.44,45,46,47,48 Some unique characteristics increase\n\nthe vulnerability of coastal infrastructure to climate change (Ch. 11: Urban).7,49 For instance, many coastal\n\nregions were settled long ago, making much of the infrastructure older than in other locations.50 Also,\n\ninflexibility of some coastal, water-dependent infra-\n\nstructure, such as onshore gas and oil facilities, port\n\nfacilities, thermal power plants, and some bridges,\n\nmakes landward relocation difficult (Figure 25.5),\n\nand build-up of urban and industrial areas inland from the shoreline can inhibit landward relocation.7\n\nInfrastructure is built to certain site-specific design standards (such as the once-in-10-year, 24-hour rainstorm or the once-in-100-year flood) that take account of historical variability in climate, coastal, and hydrologic conditions. Impacts exceeding these\n\nFigure 25.5. This \"mock-up\" shows the existing Highway LA-1 and Leeville Bridge in coastal Louisiana (on the right) with a planned new, elevated bridge that would retain functionality under future, higher sea level conditions (center left). (Current sea level and sinking bridge are shown here.) A 7-mile portion of the planned bridge has been completed and opened to traffic in December 2011. (Figure source: Greater Lafourche Port Commission, reprinted with permission).\n\nstandards can shorten the expected lifetime, in-\n\ncrease maintenance costs, and decrease services.\n\nIn general, higher sea levels, especially when combined with Wastewater management and drainage systems constitute\n\ninland changes from flooding and erosion, will result in ac- critical infrastructure for coastal businesses and residents (Ch.\n\ncelerated infrastructure impairment, with associated indirect 3: Water). Wastewater treatment plants are typically located\n\neffects on regional economies and a need for infrastructure at low elevations to take advantage of gravity-fed sewage col-\n\nupgrades, redesign, or relocation.7,44,45,46,51\n\nlection.

One group estimated that nationwide adaptation costs to utilities for wastewater systems alone could range between $123 billion and $252 billion by 2050 and, while not specific to coastal systems, gives a sense of the magnitude of necessary expenditures to avert climate change impacts.71\n\nFigure 25.6. A coastal ecosystem restoration project in New York City integrates revegetation (a form of green infrastructure) with bulkheads and riprap (gray or built infrastructure). Investments in coastal ecosystem conservation and restoration can protect coastal waterfronts and infrastructure, while providing additional benefits, such as habitat for commercial and recreational fish, birds, and other animal and plant species, that are not offered by built infrastructure. (Photo credit: Department of City Planning, New York City, reprinted with permission).\n\nThe nation's energy infrastructure, such as power plants, oil and gas refineries, storage tanks, transformers, and electricity transmission lines, are often located directly in the coastal floodplain.48,72 Roughly two-thirds of imported oil enters the U.S. through Gulf of Mexico ports,55 where it is refined and then transported inland. Unless adaptive measures are taken, storm-related flooding, erosion, and permanent inundation from sea level rise will disrupt these refineries (and related underground infrastructure) and, in turn, will constrain the supply of refined products to the rest of the nation (Ch. 4: Energy; Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land) (Figure 25.5).73\nCoastal communities have a variety of options to protect, replace, and redesign existing infrastructure, including flood proofing and flood protection through dikes, berms, pumps, integration of natural landscape features, elevation, more frequent upgrades, or relocation.74 Relocation of large coastal\n\ninfrastructure away from the coastline can be very expensive and, for some facilities such as port installations, impossible due to the need for direct access to the shoreline. In most instances, the addition of new flood-proofed infrastructure in high-hazard zones has been viewed as a more cost-effective near-term option than relocation.75 In these cases, significantly higher removal costs may be incurred later when sea level is higher or if the facility needs to be abandoned altogether in the future. This suggests that adaptation options are best assessed in a site-specific context, comprehensively weighing social, economic, and ecological considerations over multiple timeframes. A combination of gray and green infrastructure is increasingly recognized as a potentially cost-effective approach67,76 to reducing risks to communities and economies while preserving or restoring essential ecosystems and thus their benefits to human welfare (Figure 25.6).7,77\n\nAssessing flood exposure of critical facilities and roads\n\nNOAA's Critical Facilities Flood Exposure Tool provides an initial assessment of the risk to a community's critical facilities and roads within the \"100-year\" flood zone established by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (the 100-year flood zone is the areal extent of a flood that has a 1% chance of occurring or being exceeded in any given year). The tool helps coastal managers quickly learn which facilities may be at risk \u00ad providing information that can be used to increase flood risk awareness and to inform a more detailed analysis and ultimately flood risk reduction measures. The critical facilities tool was initially created to assist Mississippi/Alabama Sea Grant in conducting its \"Coastal Resiliency Index: A Community Self-Assessment\" workshops and is now available for communities nationwide. For additional information see: http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/criticalfacilities.\n\n588\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS\n\nKey Message 2: Economic Disruption\n\nNationally important assets, such as ports, tourism, and fishing sites, in already-vulnerable coastal locations, are increasingly exposed to sea level rise and related hazards. This\nthreatens to disrupt economic activity within coastal areas and the regions they serve and results in significant costs from protecting or moving these assets.\n\nIn 2010, economic activity in shoreline counties accounted for approximately 66 million jobs and $3.4 trillion in wages78 through diverse industries and commerce. In many instances, economic activity is fundamentally dependent on the physical and ecological characteristics of the coast. These features provide the template for coastal economic activities, including natural protection from waves, access to beaches, flat land for port development and container storage, and wetlands that support fisheries and provide flood protection.\nMore than 5,790 square miles and more than $1 trillion of property and structures are at risk of inundation from sea level rise of two feet above current sea level \u00ad an elevation which could be reached by 2050 under a high rate of sea level rise of approximately 6.6 feet by 2100,16 20 years later assuming a lower rate of rise (4 feet by 2100) (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate), and sooner in areas of rapid land subsidence.79,80 Roughly half of the vulnerable property value is located in Florida, and the most vulnerable port cities are Miami, Greater New York, New Orleans, Tampa-St. Petersburg, and Virginia Beach.38,45,79,81\nAlthough comprehensive national estimates are not yet available, regional studies are indicative of the potential risk: the incremental annual damage of climate change to capital assets in the Gulf region alone could be $2.7 to $4.6 billion by 2030, and $8.3 to $13.2 billion by 2050; about 20% of these at-risk assets are in the oil and gas industry.82 Investing approximately $50 billion for adaptation over the next 20 years could lead to approximately $135 billion in averted losses over the lifetime of adaptive measures.82,83\n\nMore than $1.9 trillion in imports came through U.S. ports in 2010, with commercial ports directly supporting more than 13 million jobs78 and providing 90% of consumer goods.84 Ports damaged during major coastal storms can be temporarily or permanently replaced by other modes of freight movement, but at greater cost (Ch. 5: Transportation). The stakes are high and resources exist for ports to take proactive adaptation steps, such as elevating and interconnecting port- and land-based infrastructure or developing offsite storage capability (off-dock intermodal yards) for goods and related emergency response procedures.85 However, a recent survey showed that most U.S. ports have not yet taken actions to adapt their operations to rising seas, increased flooding, and the potential for more extreme coastal storms.86\nCoastal recreation and tourism comprises the largest and fastest-growing sector of the U.S. service industry, accounting for 85% of the $700 billion annual tourism-related revenues,5,88 making this sector particularly vulnerable to increased impacts from climate change.89 Historically, development of immediate shoreline areas with hotels, vacation rentals, and other tourism-related establishments has frequently occurred without adequate regard for coastal hazards, shoreline dynamics (for example, inlet migration), or ecosystem health.90 Hard shoreline protection against the encroaching sea (like building sea walls or riprap) generally aggravates erosion and beach loss and causes negative effects on coastal ecosystems, undermining the attractiveness of beach tourism. Thus, \"soft protection,\" such as beach replenishment or conservation and restoration of sand dunes and wetlands, is increasingly preferred to \"hard protection\" measures. Increased sea level rise means sand replenishment would need to be undertaken more frequently, and thus at growing expense.34,91,92,93\n\nNatural shoreline protection features have some capacity to\nadapt to sea level rise and storms (Figure 25.6) and can also provide an array of ecosystem services benefits94 that may\noffset some maintenance costs. A challenge ahead is the need\nto integrate climate considerations (for example, temperature\nchange and sea level rise) into coastal ecosystem restoration and conservation efforts,95 such as those underway in the Gulf\nof Mexico, Chesapeake Bay, and Sacramento-San Joaquin Del-\nta, to ensure that these projects have long-term effectiveness.\n\n\u00a9Boston Globe via Getty Images\n\nU.S. oceanic and Great Lakes coasts are important centers for commercial and recreational fishing due to the high productivity of coastal ecosystems. In 2009, the U.S. seafood industry supported approximately 1 million full- and part-time jobs and\n\n589\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS\n\ngenerated $116 billion in sales and $32 billion in income.96 Rec-\nreational fishing also contributes to the economic engine of the\ncoasts, with some 74 million saltwater fishing trips along U.S.\ncoasts in 2009 generating $50 billion in sales and supporting over 327,000 jobs.96 Climate change threatens to disrupt fishing\n\noperations through direct and indirect impacts to fish stocks (for example, temperature-related shifts in species ranges, changes in prey availability, and loss of coastal nursery habitat) as well as storm-related disruptions of harbor installations (Ch. 24: Oceans).\n\nCoast-to-Inland Economic Connections\n\nFigure 25.7. Ports are deeply interconnected with inland areas through the goods imported and exported each year. Climate change impacts on ports can thus have far-reaching implications for the nation's economy. These maps show the exports and imports in 2010 (in tons/year) and freight flows (in trucks per day) from four major U.S. ports to other U.S. areas designated in the U.S. Department of Transportation's Freight Analysis Framework (FAF): Los Angeles, Houston, New York/New Jersey, and Seattle. Note: Highway Link Flow less than 5 FAF Trucks/Day are not shown. (Figure source: U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, Office of Freight Management and Operations, Freight Analysis Framework, version 3.4, 2012).87\n\n590\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS\n\nKey Message 3: Uneven Social Vulnerability\n\nSocioeconomic disparities create uneven exposures and sensitivities to growing coastal risks and limit adaptation options for some coastal communities, resulting in the displacement of the most vulnerable people from coastal areas.\n\nIn 2010, almost 2.8% of the U.S. population, or more than 8.6 mil- to be less socially vulnerable, adjacent populations just inland\n\nlion Americans, lived within the area subject to coastal floods are often highly vulnerable. that have at least a 1% chance of occurring in any one year.97,98\n\nMore than 120 million Americans live in counties that border\nthe open ocean or Great Lakes coasts and/or have a 100-year coastal floodplain within them.98 Two trends will place even\n\nThe range of adaptation options for highly socially vulnerable populations is limited.81 Native communities in Alaska, Loui-\nsiana, and other coastal locations already face this challenge\n\nmore people at risk in the future: 1) the expansion of the flood- today (see \"Unique Challenges for Coastal Tribes\" and Ch. 12: plain as sea level rises, and 2) the continuing immigration of Indigenous Peoples).105,106 As sea level rises faster and coastal\n\npeople to coastal areas.\n\nstorms, erosion, and inundation cause more frequent or wide-\n\nspread threats, relocation (also called (un)managed retreat\n\nBy 2100, the fraction of the U.S. population living in coastal or realignment), while not a new strategy in dynamic coastal\n\ncounties is expected to increase by 50% (46.2 million) to 144% environments, may become a more pressing option.

Thus, coastal population densities, along with increasing sea level rise (Ch.2: Our Changing Climate), for several key\n\neconomic development, will continue to be an important factor reasons: they cannot afford expensive protection measures\n\nin the overall exposure to climate change.3,7,39,101\n\nthemselves, public expense is not financially justified (often\n\nbecause social, cultural, and ecological factors are not consid-\n\nDespite persistent beliefs that living on the coast is reserved for the wealthy,79,102 there are large social disparities in coastal areas that vary regionally.41,103 Full understanding of risk for\n\nered), or there is little social and political support for a more\norderly retreat process.

For example, 75% of U.S. coral reefs in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico are already in \"poor\" or \"fair\" condition;114,115 all Florida reefs are currently rated as \"threatened.\"116 Coastal barrier ecosystems continue to be degraded by human development, even in cases where development has slowed (for example, Crawford et al. 2013; Feagin et al. 2010b 117). Coastal wetlands are being lost at high rates in southeastern Louisiana (Figure 25.9).118 In addition, the incidence of lowoxygen \"dead zones\" in coastal waters has increased 30-fold in the U.S. since 1960, with over 300 coastal water bodies now experiencing stressful or lethal oxygen levels (Ch. 8: Ecosystems).119\nThese existing stresses on coastal ecosystems will be exacerbated by climate change effects, such as increased ocean temperatures that lead to coral bleaching,30 altered river flows affecting the health of estuaries,121 and acidified waters threatening shellfish.122 Climate change affects the survival, reproduction, and health of coastal plants and animals in different ways. For example, changes in the timing of seasonal events (such as breeding and migration), shifts in species distributions and ranges, changes in species interactions, and declines in biodiversity all combine to produce fundamental changes in ecosystem character, distribution, and functioning.28 Species with narrow physiological tolerance to change, low genetic diversity, specialized resource requirements, and poor competitive abilities are particularly vulnerable.123,124 Where the rate of climate change exceeds the pace at which plants and\n\nanimals can acclimate or adapt, impacts on coastal ecosystems will be profound.35,125,126 For example, high death rates of East Coast intertidal mussels at their southern range boundary have occurred because of rising temperatures between 1956 and 2007.127 The presence of physical barriers (for example, hardened shorelines or reduced sediment availability) and other non-climatic stressors (such as pollution, habitat destruction, and invasive species) will further exacerbate the ecological impacts of climate change and limit the ability of these ecosystems to adapt.128,129,130 Onshore migration of coastal marshes as sea level rises is often limited by bulkheads or roads (a phenomenon often called \"coastal squeeze\"), ultimately resulting in a reduction in wetland area.35,126,128,131,132,133\nOf particular concern is the potential for coastal ecosystems to cross thresholds of rapid change (\"tipping points\"), beyond which they exist in a dramatically altered state or are lost entirely from the area; in some cases, these changes will be irreversible.134 These unique, \"no-analog\" environments present serious challenges to resource managers, who are confronted with conditions never seen before.135,136,137 The ecosystems most susceptible to crossing such tipping points are those that have already lost some of their resilience due to degradation or depletion by non-climatic stressors.138 Certain coastal ecosystems are already rapidly changing as a result of interactions between climatic and non-climatic factors, and others have already crossed tipping points. Eelgrass in the Chesapeake Bay died out almost completely during the record-hot summer of 2005, when temperatures exceeded the species' tolerance threshold of 86\u00b0F,139 and subsequent recovery has been poor.140 Severe low-oxygen events have emerged as a new phenomenon in the Pacific Northwest due to changes in the timing and duration of coastal upwelling.32,141 These have led to high mortality of Dungeness crabs33 and the temporary disappearance of rockfish,32 with consequences for local fisheries. Reducing non-climatic stressors at the local scale can potentially prevent crossing some of these tipping points.142\n\n592\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS\nCoastal Ecosystem Services\n\nFigure 25.8. Coastal ecosystems provide a suite of valuable benefits (ecosystem services) on which humans depend for food, economic activities, inspiration, and enjoyment. This schematic illustrates many of these services situated in a Pacific or Caribbean island setting, but many of them can also be found along mainland coastlines.\n\n593\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS\nProjected Land Loss from Sea Level Rise in Coastal Louisiana\n\nFigure 25.9. These maps show expected future land change in coastal Louisiana under two different sea level rise scenarios without protection or restoration actions. Red indicates a transition from land (either wetlands or barrier islands) to open water. Green indicates new land built over previously open water. Land loss is influenced by factors other than sea level rise, including subsidence, river discharge and sediment load, and precipitation patterns. However, all these factors except sea level rise were held constant for this analysis. The panel on the left shows land change with a sea level rise of 10.6 inches between 2010 and 2060, while the one on the right assumes 31.5 inches of sea level rise for the same period. These amounts of sea level rise are within the projected ranges for this time period (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). (Figure source: State of Louisiana, reprinted with permission120).\n\nKey Message 5: The State of Coastal Adaptation\n\nLeaders and residents of coastal regions are increasingly aware of the high vulnerability of coasts to climate change and are developing plans to prepare for potential impacts on citizens, businesses, and environmental assets. Significant institutional, political, social, and\neconomic obstacles to implementing adaptation actions remain.\n\nConsiderable progress has been made since the last National\nClimate Assessment in both coastal adaptation science and\npractice (Figure 25.4, panel (d)), though significant gaps in understanding, planning, and implementation remain.20,143,144,145\nU.S. coastal managers pay increasing attention to adaptation,\nbut are mostly still at an early stage of building their capacities\nfor adaptation rather than implementing structural or policy changes (Ch. 28: Adaptation).20,146,147 Although many non-struc-\ntural (land-use planning, fiscal, legal, and educational) and\nstructural adaptation tools are available through the Coastal\nZone Management Act, Coastal Barriers Resources Act, and\nother frameworks, and while coastal managers are well familiar\nwith these historical approaches to shoreline protection, they\nare less familiar with some of the more innovative approaches\nto coastal adaptation, such as rolling easements, ecosystembased adaptation, or managed realignment.109,131,144,148 Federal,\nstate, and local management approaches have also been found to be at odds at times,149 making successful integration of adaptation more difficult.145 There is only limited evidence\nof more substantial (\"transformational\") adaptation occurring,\nthat is, of adaptations that are \"adopted at a much larger scale,\nthat are truly new to a particular region or resource system, and that transform places and shift locations,\"150 such as re-\n\nlocation of communities in coastal Alaska and Louisiana (Ch. 22: Alaska).83,109,150,151 Although more research is needed, reasons for the limited transformational adaptation to date may include the relatively early stage of recognizing climate change and sea level rise risks, the perception that impacts are not yet severe enough, and the fact that social objectives can still be met.152\nCoastal leaders and populations, however, are increasingly concerned about climate-related impacts and support the development of adaptation plans,153,154,155 but support for development restrictions or managed retreat is limited.156,157,158 Economic interests and population trends tend to favor continued (re)development and in-fill in near-shore locations. Current disaster recovery practices frequently promote rapid rebuilding on-site with limited consideration for future conditions159 despite clear evidence that more appropriate siting and construction can substantially reduce future losses.160,161\nEnacting measures that increase resilience in the face of current hazards, while reducing long-term risks due to climate change, continues to be challenging.162,163,164 This is particularly difficult in coastal flood zones that are subject to a 1%\n\n594\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS\n\nor greater chance of flooding in any given year, including those\nareas that experience additional hazards from wave action. Ac-\ncording to FEMA and policy/property data maintained by the\nNational Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP) Bureau and Statisti-\ncal Agent, nearly half of the NFIP's repetitive flood losses occur in those areas.165,166 A robust finding is that the cost of inaction\nis 4 to 10 times greater than the cost associated with preventive hazard mitigation.79,160 Even so, prioritizing expenditures now whose benefits accrue far in the future is difficult.167 Moreover,\ncumulative costs to the economy of responding to sea level\nrise and flooding events alone could be as high as $325 billion\nby 2100 for 4 feet of sea level rise, with $130 billion expected\nto be incurred in Florida and $88 billion in the North Atlantic region.80 The projected costs associated with one foot of sea\nlevel rise by 2100 are roughly $200 billion. These figures only\ncover costs of beach nourishment, hard protective structures,\nand losses of inundated land and property where protection\nis not warranted, but exclude losses of valuable ecosystem\nservices, as well as indirect losses from business disruption,\nlost economic activity, impacts on economic growth, or other non-market losses.80,168,169 Such indirect losses, even in regions\ngenerally well prepared for disaster events, can be substantial\n(in the case of Superstorm Sandy, followed by a nor'easter, in\nfall 2012, insured losses and wider economic damages added up to at least $65 billion).170 Sequences of extreme events that\noccur over a short period not only reduce the time available\nfor natural and social systems to recover and for adaptation\nmeasures to be implemented, but also increase the cumulative\neffect of back-to-back extremes compared to the same events occurring over a longer period.164,171 The cost of managed re-\ntreat requires further assessment.\n\nClimate adaptation efforts that integrate hazard mitigation,\nnatural resource conservation, and restoration of coastal\necosystems can enhance ecological resilience and reduce the\nexposure of property, infrastructure, and economic activities to climate change impacts (Figure 25.6).113,179 Yet, the integra-\ntion and translation of scientific understanding of the benefits\nprovided by ecosystems into engineering design and hazard management remains challenging.180 Moreover, interdepen-\ndencies among functioning infrastructure types and coastal\nuses require an integrated approach across scientific disciplines\nand levels of government, but disconnected scientific efforts\nand fragmented governance at the managerial, financial, and\nregulatory levels, and narrow professional training, job descrip-\ntions, and agency missions pose significant barriers (Ch. 11: Urban; Ch. 28: Adaptation).145,181,182 Adaptation efforts to date that\nhave begun to connect across jurisdictional and departmental\nboundaries and create innovative solutions are thus extremely encouraging.7,145,183,184\n\nProperty insurance can serve as an important mode of financial adaptation to climate risks,172 but the full potential of le-\nveraging insurance rates and availability has not yet been realized.7,173,174 The Government Accountability Office (GAO) listed\nthe National Flood Insurance Program as a \"high-risk area\" for\nthe first time in 2006, indicating its significance in terms of federal fiscal exposure (nearly $1.3 trillion in 2012).175 In the\ncontext of identifying climate change as a high risk to federal op-\nerations, the GAO in 2013 singled out the NFIP again, recognizing\ngrowing risks and liabilities due to climate change and sea level rise and the increase in erosion and flooding they entail.176 While\ninsured assets in coastal areas represent only a portion of this\ntotal liability, taxpayers are responsible, via the NFIP, for more\nthan $510 billion of insured assets in the coastal Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) alone.53,177 A number of reforms in the NFIP\nhave been enacted in 2012 to ensure that the program is more\nfiscally sound and hazard mitigation is improved, though various challenges remain.178\n\n595\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The key messages were initially developed at this meeting. Key vulnerabilities were operationally defined as those challenges that can fundamentally undermine the functioning of human and natural coastal systems. They arise when these systems are highly exposed and sensitive to climate change and (given present or potential future adaptive capacities) insufficiently prepared or able to respond. The vulnerabilities that the team decided to focus on were informed by ongoing interactions of the author team with coastal managers, planners, and stakeholders, as well as a review of the existing literature. In addition, the author team conducted a thorough review of the technical input reports (TIR) and associated literature, including the coastal zone foundational TIR prepared for the National Climate Assessment (NCA).7 Chapter development was supported by numerous chapter author technical discussions via teleconference from April to June 2012.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nCoastal lifelines, such as water supply and energy infrastructure and evacuation routes, are increasingly vulnerable to higher sea levels and storm surges, inland flooding, erosion, and other climaterelated changes.\nDescription of evidence base Coastal infrastructure is defined here to include buildings, roads, railroads, airports, port facilities, subways, tunnels, bridges, water supply systems, wells, sewer lines, pump stations, wastewater treatment plants, water storage and drainage systems, port facilities, energy production and transmission facilities on land and offshore, flood protection systems such as levees and seawalls, and telecommunication equipment. Lifelines are understood in the common usage of that term in hazards management.\nThe key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the coastal zone technical input report7 as well as a technical input report on infrastructure.48 Technical input reports (68) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, along with the extant scientific literature. Additional\n\nevidence is provided in other chapters on hurricanes (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 8), global sea level rise (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 10), water supply vulnerabilities (Ch. 3: Water); key coastal transportation vulnerabilities (Ch. 5: Transportation), and energy-related infrastructure (Ch. 4: Energy). This key message focuses mainly on water supply and energy infrastructure and evacuation routes, as these constitute critical lifelines.\nThe evidence base for exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to higher sea levels and storm surges is very strong, both from empirical observation and historical experience and from studies projecting future impacts on critical coastal infrastructure. There are numerous publications concerning the effects of sea level rise and storm surges on roadways, coastal bridges, and supply of refined products.7,38,40,64,93,147,162 The information on roadways came from various reports (for example, DOT 2012; Transportation Research Board 2011; NPCC 2009, 201055,56,184) and other publications (for example, State of Louisiana 201283). The impact on coastal bridges is documented in U.S. Department of Transportation reports.55,59 A number of publications explored the impacts on supply of refined oil-based products such as gasoline.73\nThe evidence base is moderate for the interaction of inland and coastal flooding. There are many and recent publications concerning impacts to wastewater treatment plants47,61 and drainage systems.18,27,64,65,70 These impacts lead to increased risk of urban flooding and disruption of essential services to urban residents.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The projected rate of sea level rise (SLR) is fully accounted for through the use of common scenarios. We note, however, that there is currently limited impacts literature yet that uses the lowest or highest 2100 scenario and none that specifically use the broader range of SLR (0.2 to 2 meters, or 0.7 to 6.6 feet, by 2100) 16 and NCA land-use scenarios (60% to 164% increase in urban and suburban land area).185\nThe severity and frequency of storm damage in any given location cannot yet be fully accounted for due to uncertainties in projecting future extratropical and tropical storm frequency, intensity, and\n\n613\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS Traceable Accounts\n\nchanges in storm tracks for different regions (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).7\nThe timely implementation and efficacy of adaptation measures, including planned retreat, in mitigating damages is accounted for in the underlying literature (for example, by varying assumptions about the timing of implementation of adaptation measures and the type of adaptation measures) such as hard protection, elevation, relocation, or protection through wetlands and dunes in front of the infrastructure in question) (for example, Aerts and Botzen 2012; Biging et al. 2012; Bloetscher et al. 2011; Heberger et al. 2009; Irish et al. 2010; Kirshen et al. 201118,38,44,45,47). However, such studies can only test the sensitivity of conclusions to these assumptions; they do not allow statements about what is occurring on the ground.\n\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nNationally important assets, such as ports, tourism and fishing sites, in already-vulnerable coastal locations, are increasingly exposed to sea level rise and related hazards. This threatens to disrupt economic activity within coastal areas and the regions they serve and results in significant costs from protecting or moving these assets.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the coastal zone technical input report.7 Technical input reports (68) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, as well as the extant scientific literature.\n\nAdditional uncertainties arise from the confluence of climate change impacts from the inland and ocean side, which have yet to be studied in an integrated fashion across different coastal regions of the United States.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base, the large quantity of infrastructure (water-related infrastructure, energy infrastructure, and the 60,000 miles of coastal roads) in the U.S. coastal zone, and the directional trend at least of sea level rise and runoff associated with heavy precipitation events, we have very high confidence that these types of infrastructure in the coastal zone are increasingly vulnerable.\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent\nresults, well documented and accepted methods, etc.), high\nconsensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods\nvary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions\namong experts\n\nThe evidence base for increased exposure to assets is strong. Many publications have assessed at-risk areas (for example, Biging et al. 2012; Cooley et al. 2012; Heberger et al. 2009; Neumann et al. 2010a38,45,79,81). Highly reliable economic activity information is available from recurring surveys conducted by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and others, and asset exposure is conclusively demonstrated by historical information (from storm and erosion damage), elevation data (in Geographic Information System (GIS)-based, LIDAR, and other forms), and numerous vulnerability and adaptation studies of the built environment. Further evidence is provided in technical input reports and other NCA chapters on infrastructure and urban systems (Ch. 11: Urban),48 transportation (Ch. 5: Transportation),55 and energy (Ch. 4: Energy). A number of studies in addition to the ones cited in the text, using various economic assumptions, aim to assess the cost of protecting or relocating coastal assets and services. Many publications and reports explore the cost of replacing services offered by ports,55,91 though one study186 notes that few ports are implementing adaptation practices to date. The economic consequences of climate change on tourism are supported by a number of recent studies.89,90,91,93 The threats of climate change on fishing have been explored in the coastal zone technical input report.7\nAdditional evidence comes from empirical observation: public statements by private sector representatives and public officials indicate high awareness of economic asset exposure and a determination to see those assets protected against an encroaching sea, even at high cost (New York City, Miami Dade County, San Francisco airport, etc.). The economic value of exposed assets and activities is frequently invoked when they get damaged or interrupted during storm events (for example, Hallegattee 2012169). Threats to economic activity are also consistently cited as important to local decision-making in the coastal context (for example, Titus et al. 2009109).\n\n614\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS Traceable Accounts\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The projected rate of sea level rise is fully accounted for through the use of common scenarios. We note, however, that there is currently limited impacts literature that uses the lowest or highest scenario for 2100, and no studies that specifically use the broader range of SLR (0.7 to 6.6 feet,) and NCA land-use scenarios (60% to 164% increase in urban and suburban land area).185\nThe projected severity and frequency of storm damage in any given location cannot yet be fully accounted for due to uncertainties in projecting future extratropical and tropical storm frequency, intensity, and changes in storm tracks for different regions.7\nThe timely implementation and efficacy of adaptation measures, including planned retreat, in mitigating damages are accounted for in the underlying literature (for example, by varying assumptions about the timing of implementation of adaptation measures, the type of adaptation measures, and other economic assumptions such as discount rates). However, such studies can only test the sensitivity of conclusions to these assumptions; they do not allow statements about what is occurring on the ground. Well-established post-hoc assessments160 suggest that hazard mitigation action is highly cost-effective (for every dollar spent, four dollars in damages are avoided). A more recent study suggests an even greater costeffectiveness.79\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base, the well-established accumulation of economic assets and activities in coastal areas, and the directional trend of sea level rise, we have very high confidence in the main conclusion that resources and assets that are nationally important to economic productivity are threatened by SLR and climate change.\nWhile there is currently no indication that the highest-value assets and economic activities are being abandoned in the face of sea level rise and storm impacts, we have very high confidence that the cost of protecting these assets in place will be high, and that the cost will be higher the faster sea level rises relative to land.\nWe have very high confidence that adequate planning and arrangement for future financing mechanisms, timely implementation of hazard mitigation measures, and effective disaster response will keep the economic impacts and adaptation costs lower than if these actions are not taken.\nWe are not able to assess timing or total cost of protecting or relocating economic assets with any confidence at this time, due to uncertainties in asset-specific elevation above sea level, in the presence and efficacy of protective measures (at present and in the future), in the feasibility of relocation in any particular case, and uncertainties in future storm surge heights and storm frequencies.\n\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nSocioeconomic disparities create uneven exposures and sensitivities to growing coastal risks and limit adaptation options for some coastal communities, resulting in the displacement of the most vulnerable people from coastal areas.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the coastal zone technical input report.7 Technical input reports (68) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, along with the extant literature.\nEvidence base is moderate: assessment of the social vulnerability to coastal impacts of climate change is a comparatively new research focus in the United States, and clearly an advance since the prior NCA.187 There are currently multiple published, peer-reviewed studies, by different author teams, using different vulnerability metrics, which all reach the same conclusion: economically and socially vulnerable individuals and communities face significant coastal risks and have a lower adaptive capacity than less socially vulnerable populations. Studies have shown that the U.S. coastal population is growing 99 and have assessed the importance of this population for climate change exposure.39,101 The social factors that play key roles in coastal vulnerability are detailed in numerous publications.81,104,188\nThere is an additional body of evidence emerging in the literature that also supports this key message, namely the growing literature on \"barriers to adaptation,\" particularly from studies conducted here in the United States.7,81,105,145,189 This literature reports on the limitations poorer communities face at present in beginning adaptation planning, and on the challenges virtually all communities face in prioritizing adaptation and moving from planning to implementation of adaptation options.\nThere is empirical evidence for how difficult it is for small, less wealthy communities (for example, the Native communities in Alaska or southern Louisiana) to obtain federal funds to relocate from eroding shorelines.107,108 Eligibility criteria (positive benefit-cost ratios) make it particularly difficult for low-income communities to obtain such funds; current federal budget constraints limit the available resources to support managed retreat and relocation.166,173 The recent economic hardship has placed constraints even on the richer coastal communities in the U.S. in developing and implementing adaptation strategies, for example in California.145 While the economic situation, funding priorities, or institutional mechanisms to provide support to socially vulnerable communities will not remain static over time, there is no reliable scientific evidence for how these factors may change in the future.\n\n615\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS Traceable Accounts\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The body of research on this topic is largely new since the prior NCA in 2009.187 Each of the peer-reviewed studies discusses data gaps and methodological limitations, as well as the particular challenge of projecting demographic variables \u00ad a notoriously difficult undertaking \u00ad forward in time. While methods for population projections are well established (typically using housing projections), those, in turn, depend on more difficult to make assumptions about fertility, migration, household size, and travel times to urban areas. The conclusion is limited by uneven coverage of in-depth vulnerability studies; although those that do exist are consistent with and confirm the conclusions of a national study.41 This latter study was extended by applying the same approach, data sources, and methodology to regions previously not covered, thus closing important informational gaps (Hawai`i, Alaska, the Great Lakes region). Data gaps remain for most coastal locations in the Pacific Islands, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories.\nThe most important limit on understanding is the current inability to project social vulnerability forward in time. While some social variables are more easily predicted (for example, age and gender distribution) than others (for example, income distribution, ethnic composition, and linguistic abilities), the predictive capability declines the further out projections aim (beyond 2030 or 2050). Further, it is particularly difficult to project these variables in specific places subject to coastal hazards, as populations are mobile over time, and no existing model reliably predicts placebased demographics at the scale important to these analyses.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence We have high confidence in this conclusion, as it is based on well-accepted techniques, replicated in several place-based case studies, and on a nationwide analysis, using reliable Census data. Consistency in insights and conclusions in these studies, and in others across regions, sectors, and nations, add to the confidence. The conclusion does involve significant projection uncertainties, however, concerning where socially vulnerable populations will be located several decades from now. Sensitivity analysis of this factor, and overall a wider research base is needed, before a higher confidence assessment can be assigned.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nCoastal ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change because many have already been dramatically altered by human stresses; climate change will result in further reduction or loss of the services that these ecosystems provide, including potentially irreversible impacts.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the coastal zone technical input report.7 Technical input reports (68) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, along with the extant literature.\n\nEvidence base is strong for this part of the key message: \"Coastal ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change because many have already been dramatically altered by human stresses.\"\nThe degradation and depletion of coastal systems due to human stresses (for example, pollution, habitat destruction, and overharvesting) has been widely documented throughout the U.S. and the world.68,115,116,118,119 The degree of degradation varies based on location and level of human impact. However, evidence of degradation is available for all types of U.S. coastal ecosystems, from coral reefs to seagrasses and rocky shores. Human stresses can be direct (for example, habitat destruction due to dredging of bays) or indirect (for example, food web disruption due to overfishing). There is also consistent evidence that ecosystems degraded by human activities are less resilient to changes in climatic factors, such as water temperature, precipitation, and sea level rise (for example, Gedan et al. 2009; Glick et al. 2011; Williams and Grosholz 2008128,129,130).\nEvidence base is strong: \"climate change will result in further reduction or loss of the services that these ecosystems provide.\"\nThe impacts of changing coastal conditions (for example, changes associated with altered river inflows, higher temperatures, and the effects of high rates of relative sea level rise) on coastal ecosystems and their associated services have been extensively documented through observational and empirical studies, including recent publications.28,121,122,123,129,133 Many models of coastal ecosystem responses to climatic factors have been well-validated with field data. Given the existing knowledge of ecosystem responses, future climate projections, and the interactions with non-climatic stressors that further exacerbate climatic impacts, evidence is strong of the potential for further reduction and/or loss of ecosystem services.\nEvidence is suggestive: \"including potentially irreversible impacts.\"\nSevere impacts (for example, mass coral bleaching events and rapid species invasions) have been extensively documented for U.S. coastal ecosystems. Many experts have suggested that some of these impacts may be irreversible134 and never before seen conditions have been documented.136,137 Recovery may or may not be possible in different instances; this depends on factors that are not well-understood, such as the adaptive capacity of ecosystems, future projections of change that consider interactions among multiple climatic and non-climatic human alterations of systems, the dynamics and persistence of alternative states that are created after a regime shift has occurred, and whether or not the climatic and/or non-climatic stressors that lead to impacts will be ameliorated.32,33,138,139,140,141\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Since the 2009 NCA,187 new studies have added weight to previously established conclusions. The major advance lies in the examination of tipping points for species and entire ecosystems\n\n616\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS Traceable Accounts\n\n(for example, Barnosky et al. 2012; Folke et al. 2004; Foti et al. 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg and Bruno 2010134,135,137,138). Existing uncertainties and future research needs were identified through reviewing the NCA technical inputs and other peer-reviewed, published literature on these topics, as well as through our own identification and assessment of knowledge gaps.\n\npotentially irreversible impacts exists in the literature. This vulnerability is frequently identified by studies of coastal ecosystems. However, methods, research, and models are still being developed for understanding, documenting, and predicting potentially irreversible impacts across all types of coastal ecosystems.\n\nKey uncertainties in our understanding of ecosystem impacts of climate change in coastal areas are associated with:\n\u00b7 the interactive effects and relative contributions of multiple climatic and non-climatic stressors on coastal organisms and ecosystems;\n\u00b7 how the consequences of multiple stressors for individual species combine to affect community- and ecosystem-level interactions and functions;\n\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nLeaders and residents of coastal regions are increasingly aware of the high vulnerability of coasts to climate change, and are developing plans to prepare for potential impacts on citizens, businesses, and environmental assets. Significant institutional, political, social, and economic obstacles to implementing adaptation actions remain.\n\n\u00b7 the projected magnitude of coastal ecosystem change under different scenarios of temperature change, sea level rise, and land-use change, particularly given the potential for feedbacks and non-linearities in ecosystem responses;\n\u00b7 the potential adaptive capacity of coastal organisms and ecosystems to climate change;\n\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the coastal zone technical input report.7 Technical input reports (68) on a wide range of topics were also received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input, along with the extant literature.\n\n\u00b7 trajectories, timeframes, and magnitudes of coastal ecosystem recovery;\n\u00b7 the dynamics and persistence of alternative states that are created after ecosystem regime shifts have occurred; and\n\u00b7 the potential and likelihood for irreversible climaterelated coastal ecosystem change.\nIn general, relatively little work to date has been conducted to project future coastal ecosystem change under integrative scenarios of temperature change, sea level rise, and changes in human uses of, and impacts to, coastal ecosystems (for example, through land-use change). Advancing understanding and knowledge associated with this key uncertainty, as well as the others included in the above list, would be fostered by additional research.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence We have very high confidence that coastal ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change because they have already been dramatically altered by human stresses, as documented in extensive and conclusive evidence.\nWe have very high confidence that climate change will result in further reduction or loss of the services that these ecosystems provide, as there is extensive and conclusive evidence related to this vulnerability.\nWe have high confidence that climatic change will include \"potentially irreversible impacts.\" Site-specific evidence of\n\nEvidence base is moderate to strong: the results on which this key message relies are based on case studies, direct observation and \"lessons learned\" assessments from a wide range of efforts, surveys, and interview studies in ongoing adaptation efforts around the country.154 There has been some planning for remediating climate change impacts, including recent publications144,153,163,164 and there are publications on the lower social acceptance of certain adaptation option (for example, Finzi Hart et al. 2012; Peach 2012144,158) and on the many barriers that affect adaptation.145,181,182\nIn addition, there is confirming evidence of very similar findings from other locations outside the U.S. (some, from Canada, were also submitted as technical input reports to the NCA), such as the United Kingdom, continental Europe, Australia, and others.157,181\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Adaptation is a rapidly spreading policy and planning focus across coastal America. This was not previously captured or assessed in the 2009 NCA187 and is thus a major advance in understanding, including what adaptation activities are underway, what impedes them, and how coastal stakeholders view and respond to these emerging adaptation activities.\nGiven the local nature of adaptation (even though it frequently involves actors from all levels of government), it is difficult to systematically track, catalog, or assess progress being made on adaptation in coastal America. The difficulty, if not impossibility, of comprehensively tracking such progress has been previously acknowledged.20 This conclusion is reiterated in the Adaptation chapter (Ch. 28) of this report.\n\n617\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f25: COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT AND ECOSYSTEMS Traceable Accounts\nWhile the findings and integrative key message stand on strong evidence, some uncertainties remain about U.S. coastal regions' adaptive capacity, the level of adoption of hazard mitigation and other adaptation strategies, and the extent and importance of barriers to adaptation.\nPossibly the least well-understood aspect about coastal adaptation is how and when to undertake large-scale, transformational adaptation. Aside from the mentioned examples of relocation, no other examples exist at the present time, and further research is required to better understand how major institutional, structural, or social transformation might occur and what would be involved to realize such options.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence We have very high confidence in this key message, as it is primarily based on studies using well-accepted social science research techniques (for example, surveys, interviews, and participant observation), replicated in several place-based case studies, and on a nationwide compilation of adaptation case studies. Consistency in insights and conclusions in these studies, and in others across regions, sectors, and nations, add to the confidence.\nAs described above, a comprehensive catalogue of all adaptation efforts, and of related challenges and lessons learned, is difficult if not impossible to ever obtain. Nevertheless, the emerging insights and evidence from different regions of the country provide considerable confidence that the situation is reasonably well captured in the documents relied on here. The coastal stakeholders represented among the authors of the foundational technical input report7 confirmed the conclusions from their longterm experience in coastal management and direct involvement in adaptation efforts locally.\nMoreover, evidence from other regions outside the U.S. adds weight to the conclusions drawn here.\n\n618\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fRESPONSE STRATEGIES\nPeople make choices every day about risks and benefits in their lives, weighing experience, information, and judgment as they consider the impacts of their decisions on themselves and the people around them. Similarly, people make choices that alter the magnitude of impacts resulting from current and future climate change. Using science-based information to anticipate future changes can help society make better decisions about how to reduce risks and protect people, places, and ecosystems from climate change impacts. Decisions made now and in the future will influence society's resilience to impacts of future climate change.\nIn recognition of the significance of these decisions, the National Climate Assessment presents information that is useful for a wide variety of decisions across regions and sectors, at multiple scales, and over multiple time frames. For the first time, the National Climate Assessment includes chapters on Decision Support, Mitigation, and Adaptation, in addition to identifying research needs associated with these topics.\nAs with other sections of this report, the linkages across and among these chapters are extremely important. There are direct connections between mitigation decisions (about whether and how to manage emissions of heat-trapping gases) and how much climate will change in the future. The amount of change that occurs will in turn dictate the amount of adaptation that will be required.\nIn the Decision Support chapter, a variety of approaches to bridge the gap between scientific understanding and decision-making are discussed, leading to the conclusion that there are many opportunities to help scientists understand the needs of decision-makers, and also to help decision-makers use available tools and information to reduce the risks of climate change. The Mitigation chapter describes emissions trajectories and assesses the state of mitigation activities. Policies already enacted and other factors lowered U.S. emissions in recent years, but achievement of a global emissions path consistent with the lower scenario (B1) analyzed in this assessment will require strenuous action by all major emitters. The Adaptation chapter assesses current adaptation activities across the United States in the public and private sectors, and concludes that although a lot of adaptation planning is being done, implementation lags significantly behind the scale of anticipated changes.\nThis report concludes with chapters on Research Needs to improve future climate and global change assessments and on the Sustained Assessment Process, which describes the rationale for ongoing assessment activity to achieve greater efficiency and better scientific and societal outcomes.\n\n\u00a9Najlah Feanny/Corbis \u00a9Denise Applewhite \u00a9Don Mason/Blend Images/Corbis\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 26 DECISION SUPPORT\nCONNECTING SCIENCE, RISK PERCEPTION, AND DECISIONS\nConvening Lead Authors\nRichard Moss, Joint Global Change Research Institute, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, University of Maryland P.

Decisions about how to address climate change can be complex, and responses will require a combination of adaptation and mitigation actions. Decision-makers \u00ad whether individuals, public officials, or others \u00ad may need help integrating scientific information into adaptation and mitigation decisions.\n2. To be effective, decision support processes need to take account of the values and goals of the key stakeholders, evolving scientific information, and the perceptions of risk.\n3. Many decision support processes and tools are available. They can enable decision-makers to identify and assess response options, apply complex and uncertain information, clarify tradeoffs, strengthen transparency, and generate information on the costs and benefits of different choices.\n4. Ongoing assessment processes should incorporate evaluation of decision support tools, their accessibility to decision-makers, and their application in decision processes in different sectors and regions.\n5. Steps to improve collaborative decision processes include developing new decision support tools and building human capacity to bridge science and decision-making.\n\nAfter a long period of relative stability in the climate system, climate conditions are changing and are projected to continue to change (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate). As a result, historically successful strategies for managing climate-sensitive resources and infrastructure will become less effective over time. Although decision-makers routinely make complex decisions under uncertain conditions, decision-making in the context of climate change can be especially challenging due to a number of factors. These include the rapid pace of changes in some physical and human systems, long time lags between human activities and response of the climate system, the high economic and political stakes, the number and diversity of potentially affected stakeholders, the need to incorporate uncertain scientific information of varying confidence levels, and the values of stakeholders and decision-makers.1,2,3 The social, economic, psychological, and political dimensions of these decisions underscore the need for ways to improve communication of scientific information and uncertainties and to help decision-makers assess risks and opportunities.\nExtensive literature and practical experience offer means to help improve decision-making in the context of climate variability and change. The decision-support literature includes topics such as decision-making frameworks, decision support tools, and decision support processes. These approaches can help evaluate the costs and benefits of alternative actions, communicate relative amounts of risk associated with different options, and consider\n\nthe role of alternative institutions and governance structures. In particular, iterative decision processes that incorporate improving scientific information and learning though periodic reviews of decisions over time are helpful in the context of rapid changes in environmental conditions.3,4 Some of the approaches described in this chapter can also help overcome barriers to the use of existing tools and improve communications among scientists, decision-makers, and the public.5,6\nFocus of this chapter\nThis chapter introduces decision-making frameworks that are useful for considering choices about climate change responses through the complementary strategies of adaptation and mitigation. It also includes numerous examples in which decision support tools are being employed in making adaptation and mitigation decisions. It focuses on the processes that promote sustained interaction between decision-makers and the scientific/technical community. This chapter reviews the state of knowledge and practice in the context of managing risk. Extensive literature makes clear that in many cases, decisions aided by the types of approaches described here prove more successful than unaided decisions.3,7 Because of space limitations, the chapter describes some general classes of tools but does not assess specific decision support tools.\n\n621\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f26: DECISION SUPPORT: CONNECTING SCIENCE, RISK PERCEPTION, AND DECISIONS\n\nWhat are the decisions and who are the decision-makers?\n\nDecisions about climate change adaptation and mitigation are\n\nbusiness opportunities associated with preparing for a\n\nbeing made in many settings (Table 26.1).

Some examples include methods for as credible, useful, and actionable; and enhancing the quality assessing tradeoffs among options, scenarios of the future of decisions.3 Decision support activities that facilitate wellused for exploring the impacts of alternative decisions, vulner- structured decision processes can result in consensus about ability and impacts assessments, maps of projected climate defining the problems to be addressed, objectives and options impacts, and tools that help users locate, organize, and display for consideration, criteria for evaluation, potential opportunidata in new ways.

Decisions take place within a complex context. Decision support processes and tools can help structure decisionmaking, organize and analyze information, and build consensus around options for action.\n\nBoundary Processes: Collaboration among Decision-Makers, Scientists, and Stakeholders\n\nIncorporating the implications of climate\n\nchange in decision-making requires consideration of scientific insights as well as cultural and social considerations, such as\n\nBoundary Processes Linking Decision-Makers and Scientific/Technical Experts\n\nthe values of those affected and cultural\n\nand organizational characteristics. Chap-\n\nter 28 (Adaptation) addresses how some\n\nof these factors might be addressed in the\n\ncontext of adaptation. The importance of\n\nboth scientific information and societal\n\nconsiderations suggests the need for the\n\npublic, technical experts, and decision-\n\nmakers to engage in mutual shared learn-\n\ning and shared production of relevant knowledge.3,10 A major challenge in these\n\nengagements is communicating scientific\n\ninformation about the risks and uncertainties of potential changes in climate.11\n\nEfforts to facilitate interactions among technical experts and members of the public and decision-makers are often referred to as \"boundary processes\" (Figure 26.2). Boundary processes and associated tools include, for example, joint fact finding, structured decision-making,\n\nFigure 26.2. Boundary processes facilitate the flow of information and sharing of knowledge between decision-makers and scientists/technical experts. Processes that bring these groups together and help translate between different areas of expertise can provide substantial benefits.\n\n623\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f26: DECISION SUPPORT: CONNECTING SCIENCE, RISK PERCEPTION, AND DECISIONS\n\nCourtesy of Lynn Laws, Iowa State University 2013\n\ncollaborative adaptive management, and computer-aided collaborative simulation, each of which engages scientists, stakeholders, and decision-makers in ongoing dialog about understanding the policy problem and identifying what information and analyses are necessary to evaluate decision options.12,13,14 The use of these kinds of processes is increasing in decision settings involving complex scientific information and multiple \u00ad sometimes competing \u00ad societal values and goals. Well-designed boundary processes improve the match between the availability of scientific information and capacity to use it and result in scientific information that is perceived as useful and applicable.\n\nThough boundary processes developed to support climaterelated decisions vary in their design, they all involve bringing together scientists, decision-makers, and citizens to collaborate in the scoping, conduct, and employment of technical and scientific studies to improve decision-making. Boundary processes can involve establishing specialized institutions, sometimes referred to as boundary organizations, to provide a forum for interaction amongst scientists and decision-makers.15 One such boundary activity is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Regional Integrated Science and Assessment (RISA) Program. Interdisciplinary RISA teams are largely based at universities and engage regional, state, and local governments, non-governmental organizations, and private sector organizations to address issues of concern to decision-makers and planners at the regional level. RISA teams help to build bridges across the scientist, decisionmaker, and stakeholder divide.16 Effective engagement may also occur through less formal approaches by incorporating boundary processes that bring scientists, stakeholders, and decision-makers together within a specific decision-making setting rather than relying on an independent boundary organization. Sustained conversations among scientists, decisionmakers, and stakeholders are often necessary to frame issues and identify, generate, and use relevant information.17\nSome analysts have emphasized the importance of boundary processes that are collaborative and iterative.18 In one example, federal, state, and local agencies, water users, and other stakeholders are using a collaborative process to manage the Platte River to meet species protection goals and the needs of other water users. The Platte River Recovery Implementation Program brings together participants on an ongoing basis to help set goals, choose management options, and generate information about the effectiveness of their actions.19 Scientists engaged in the process do not make policy decisions, but they engage directly with participants to help them frame scientific questions relevant to management choices, understand available information, design monitoring systems to assess outcomes of management actions, and generate new knowledge tailored to addressing key decision-maker questions. The process has helped participants move beyond disagreements about the water-flow needs of the endangered species and\n\nmove to action. Through monitoring, participants will evaluate whether the water flows and other management practices are achieving the goals for species recovery set out in the Platte River Recovery Implementation Plan.\nIn a number of other examples, boundary processes involve the use of computer simulation models.14 Scientists, stakeholders, and decision-makers develop a shared understanding of the problem and potential solutions by jointly designing models that reflect their values, interests, and analytical needs. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has developed this type of boundary process in their \"shared vision planning.\"20 A comprehensive website provides a history of the process, demonstrations and case studies, and tools and techniques for implementing the process.21\nRecently, the International Joint Commission used the shared vision planning process in decisions about how to regulate water levels in both the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River system22 and in the Upper Great Lakes.23,24 Both studies engaged hundreds of participants from the United States and Canada in discussions about water level management options and the impacts of those options on ecosystems; recreational boating and tourism; hydropower; commercial navigation; municipal, industrial, and domestic water use; and the coastal zone. The models used in the studies incorporated information about ecosystem responses, shoreline dynamics, economics, and lake hydrology, and the potential operating plans were tested using multiple climate change scenarios. Although the shared vision planning process did not ultimately lead to consensus on a single recommended plan in the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Study, the process did help improve participants' understanding of the system and develop a shared vision of possible futures.22,25 Building on lessons from the Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River Study, the Upper Great Lakes Study's use of shared vision planning did result in a single recommended plan.24\n\n624\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f26: DECISION SUPPORT: CONNECTING SCIENCE, RISK PERCEPTION, AND DECISIONS\n\nUsing a Decision-Making Framework\n\nThe term \"adaptive management\" is used here to refer to a specific approach in which decisions are adjusted over time\n\nDecision-Making Framework\n\nto reflect new scientific information and decision-makers\n\nlearn from experience. The National Research Council (NRC)\n\ncontrasts the processes of \"adaptive management\" and \"deliberation with analysis.\"3 Both can be used as part of an \"itera-\n\ntive adaptive risk management framework\" that is useful for\n\ndecisions about adaptation and ways to reduce future climate\n\nchange, especially given uncertainties and ongoing advances in scientific understanding.8,26 Iterative adaptive risk manage-\n\nment emphasizes learning by doing and continued adaptation\n\nto improve outcomes. It is especially useful when the likeli-\n\nhood of potential outcomes is very uncertain.\n\nAn idealized iterative adaptive risk management process includes clearly defining the issue, establishing decision criteria, identifying and incorporating relevant information, evaluating options, and monitoring and revisiting effectiveness (Figure 26.3). The process can be used in situations of varying complexity, and while it can be more difficult for complex decisions,27 the incorporation of an iterative approach makes it possible to adjust decisions as information improves. Iterative adaptive risk management can be undertaken through collaborative processes that facilitate incorporation of stakeholder values in goal-setting and review of decision options.28 Examples of the\n\nFigure 26.3.

Such technologies allow for rapid scenario building and testing using many different variables, enhancing capacity to measure the physical impacts of climate change. These technologies are managing an increasing volume of data from satellite instruments, in situ (direct) measurement networks, and increasingly detailed and high-resolution models.38 \"Information Technology Supports Adapta-\n\nEntergy (a regional electric utility), Swiss Re (a reinsurance company), and the Economics of Climate Adaptation Working Group (a partnership between several public and private organizations) integrated natural catastrophe weather models with economic data to develop damage estimates related to climate change adaptation.41 An extension of this work is the first comprehensive analysis of climate risks and adaptation economics along the U.S. Gulf Coast.42 Another example is a simplified model, developed with support from EPA, to look at flooding risks associated with coastal exposure in southern Maine.43 Use of an \"open platform\" system that allows multiple users to input and access data resulted in spreadsheets, graphs, and three-dimensional imagery displayed on contour maps downscaled to the city and county level for local decision-makers to access.44\n\nAssessing, Perceiving, and Managing Risk\nMaking effective climate-related decisions requires balance quences).

While a full quantitative risk analysis is not always possible, the concept of risk assessment coupled with understanding of risk perception provides a powerful framework for decision-makers to evaluate alternative options for managing the risks that they face today and in the future.47 As described below, methods such as multiple criteria analysis, valuation of both risks and opportunities, and scenarios can help to combine experts' assessment of climate change risks with public perception of these risks, both influenced by the diverse values people bring to these questions48 and in support of risk management strategies more likely to achieve both public support and their desired objectives.46 To illustrate how this framework can be applied to resource management decisions, we use an example of coastal risk management decisions in the context of climate change.49\n\nFigure 26.4. This figure highlights the importance of incorporating both experts' assessment of the climate change risk and general public perceptions of this risk in developing risk management strategies for reducing the negative impacts of climate change. As indicated by the arrows, how the public perceives risk should be considered when experts communicate data on the risks associated with climate change so the public refines its understanding of these risks. As the arrows indicate, the general public's views must also be considered in addition to experts' judgments when developing risk management strategies that achieve decision-makers' desired objectives.

For example, psychological risk dimensions have been shown to influence people's perceptions of health and safety risks across numerous studies in multiple countries.57 People also often use common \"mental shortcuts,\" such as availability and representativeness, to organize a wide range of experiences and information.58 How risks are framed is also important \u00ad for example, as numbers versus percentages and worst-case formulations versus more probable events.59 Recent research has emphasized the role of emotions in the perception of risk.60,61\nOther factors explored in the literature center on perceived characteristics of specific risks, such as whether the risks are familiar or unfamiliar; prosaic or perceived as catastrophic (\"dread\" risks); reversible or irreversible; and voluntarily assumed or imposed.62 Risk perception is also influenced by the social characteristics of individuals and groups, including gender, race, and socioeconomic status.61,63 Experiences with specific risks are also important, such as being affected by a hazard (for discussions, see Figner and Weber 2011;64 NRC 2006;64 Tierney et al. 200166) and experiencing near misses or false alarms.67\nRisk perceptions do not exist as isolated perceptions, but are linked to other individual and group perceptions and beliefs and to psychosocial factors, such as fatalism, locus of control (the degree to which people feel they have control over their own lives and outcomes), and religiosity,65,66 as well as to more general worldviews. Research has also focused on people's mental models regarding the causality and effects of different risks.68\nStill other research focuses on how risk information is mediated through organizations and institutions and how mediation processes influence individual and group risk perceptions. For example, the \"social amplification of risk\" framework stresses the importance of the media and other institutions in shaping risk perceptions, such as by making risks seem more or less threatening.69 Perceptions are also related to people's trust in the institutions that manage risk; loss of trust can lead to feelings of disloyalty regarding organizations that produce risks and institutions charged with managing them, which can in turn amplify individual and public concerns.70 Additionally, perceptions are linked to individual and group attitudes concerning sources of risk information, including official and media sources. These factors include the perceived legitimacy, credibility, believability, and consistency of information sources.71\n\n628\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f26: DECISION SUPPORT: CONNECTING SCIENCE, RISK PERCEPTION, AND DECISIONS\n\na long period of time.75 In the context of the coastal residential development, elevating the structure will reduce expected damages from hurricanes, resulting in smaller annual insurance premiums. Long-term loans that spread the costs of this action over time can make the option financially attractive, if the savings on the insurance premiums outweigh the costs of the loan payments.\nThere is also a tendency for decision-makers to treat a lowprobability event as if it had no chance of occurring because it is below their threshold level of concern (such as a 1 in 100\n\nchance of a damaging disaster occurring next year). As shown by empirical research, stretching the time horizon over which information is communicated can make a difference in risk perception.76 In the case of the coastal residential development, community leaders may pay more attention to the need for adaptation measures if the likelihood of inundation by a future hurricane is presented over a 25-year or 50-year horizon (for example, the facility may flood 5 times in 25 years) rather than as a risk on annual basis (for example, there is a 20% chance of flooding in any given year).\n\nRisk Management Strategies\n\nIn general, an effective response to the current and future risks Turning to risk management strategies, public agencies, pri-\n\nfrom climate variability and change will require a portfolio of vate firms, and individuals have incentives, information, and\n\ndifferent types of actions, ranging from those intended to options available to adapt to emerging conditions due to cli-\n\nmanage, reduce, and transfer risk to those intended to provide mate change.

To illustrate, consider two adaptation measures, elevating a building and flood-proofing it, to reduce the chances of severe water damage from hurricane storm surge coupled with sea level rise. Measure 1 (elevation) may perform extremely well based on specific estimates of the likelihood of different climate change conditions that will affect storm surge and sea level rise, but it may perform poorly if those estimates turn out to be mistaken. Measure 2 (floodproofing) may have a lower expected benefit than elevation but much less variance in its outcomes and thus be the preferred choice of the community.49\n\nA frequently asked question when making complex decisions is: \"When does the addition of more information contribute to decision-making so that the benefit of obtaining this information exceeds the expense of collecting, processing, or waiting for it?\" In a decision context, the value of information often is defined as the expected additional benefit from additional information, relative to what could be expected without that information.80,81 Even though decision-makers often cite a lack of information as a rationale for not making timely decisions, delaying a decision to obtain more information does not always lead to different or better decisions.82,83\n\nImplementation, Continued Monitoring, and Evaluation of Decisions The implementation phase of a well-structured decision pro- sequences of undertaking specific actions, as shown on the cess involves an ongoing cycle of setting goals, taking action, left-hand side of Figure 26.3.

The need for social and technical learning to inform decision-making is likely to increase in the face of pressures on social and resource systems from climate\n\nchange. However, the relative effectiveness of monitoring and assessment in producing social and technical learning depends on the nature of the problem, the amount and kind of uncertainty and risk associated with climate change, and the design of the monitoring and evaluation efforts.\n\nExamples of Decision Support Tools and Methods While decision frameworks vary in their details, they generally data management systems and scientific assessments \u00ad help incorporate most or all of the steps outlined above.

Typically, these applications integrate observed or modeled data on climate and a resource or system\nto enable users to evaluate the potential consequences of options for management, investment, and other decisions.\nThese tools apply to many types of decisions; examples of decisions and references for further information are provided\nin Table 26.2.\n\nTopic Water resources Infrastructure\n\nTable 26.2.

The Santa Cruz Watershed Ecosystem Portfolio Model is a regional land-use planning tool that integrates ecological, economic, and social information and values relevant to decision-makers and stakeholders. The tool is a mapbased set of evaluation tools for planners and stakeholders, and is meant to help in balancing disparate interests within a regional context. Projections for climate change can be added to tools such as this one and used to simulate impacts of climate change and generate scenarios of climate change sensitivity; such an application is under development for this tool (Figure source: USGS 201290).\n\nValuing the Effects of Different Decisions\n\nUnderstanding costs and benefits of different decisions re- context because of its ability to address uncertainty) or more\n\nquires understanding people's preferences and developing traditional cost-benefit analyses, if appropriate.\n\nways to measure outcomes of those decisions relative to\n\npreferences.

Due to recent and anticipated effects of climate variability and change on water availability, Denver Water faces the challenge of weighing alternative response strategies and is looking at developing options to help meet more challenging future conditions.\n\n\u00a9Denver Water\n\nScenario Planning\n\nDenver Water is using scenario planning in its long-range planning process (looking out to 2050) to consider a range of plausible future scenarios (Figure 26.6). This approach contrasts with its traditional approach of planning for a single future based on demand projections and should better prepare the utility and enhance its ability to adapt to changing and uncertain future conditions.\n\nFigure 26.6: Scenario planning is an important component of decision-making. This \"cone of uncertainty\" is used to depict potential futures in Denver Water's scenario planning exercises. (Figure source: adapted from Waage 2010122).\n\nDenver Water is assessing multiple scenarios based on several potential water system challenges, including climate change, demographic and water-use changes, and economic and regulatory changes. The scenario planning strategy includes \"robust decisionmaking,\" which focuses on keeping as many future options open as possible while trying to ensure reliability of current supplies.\n\nScenario planning was chosen as a way to plan for multiple possible futures, given the degree of uncertainty associated with many variables, particularly demographic change and potential changes in precipitation. This method is easy to understand and has gained acceptance across the utility. It is a good complement to more technical, detailed analytical approaches.\n\nThe next step for Denver Water is to explore a more technical approach to test their existing plan and identified options against multiple climate change scenarios. Following a modified robust decision-making approach,121 Denver Water will test and hedge its plan and options until those options demonstrate that they can sufficiently handle a range of projected climate conditions.\n\nScientific Assessments Ongoing assessments of the state of knowledge allow for itera- process (Ch. 30: Sustained Assessment)40 can be designed to\ntive improvements in understanding over time and can provide support the adaptation and mitigation information needs of\nopportunities to work directly with decision-makers to under- decision-makers, with ongoing improvements in data quality stand their needs for information.123 A sustained assessment and utility over time. This report represents one such type of\n\n633\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f26: DECISION SUPPORT: CONNECTING SCIENCE, RISK PERCEPTION, AND DECISIONS\n\nassessment. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has prepared assessments of the state of the science related to climate change, impacts and adaptation, and mitigation since the late 1980s. Numerous additional assessments\n\nhave been prepared for a variety of national and international bodies focused on issues such as biodiversity, ecosystem services, global change impacts in the Arctic, and many others.\n\nWashington state's climate action team: uses and limits to decision support\n\nBetween 2000 and 2007, pioneering work by the University of Washington's Climate Impacts Group (a NOAA RISA) tailored national climate models to the Pacific Northwest and produced, for the first time, specific information about likely adverse impacts to virtually every part of Washington's economy and environment if carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were not quickly stabilized.124 The localized impacts predicted from these models were significant.\nIn February of 2007, Governor Christine Gregoire issued Executive Order 07-02, establishing the Climate Action Team (CAT).125 Its charge was to develop a plan to achieve dramatic, climate-stabilizing reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases according to goals established in the Executive Order. The CAT was a 29-member team that included representatives of industry, utilities, environmental advocacy groups, Native American tribes, state and municipal governments, and elected officials.\nThe CAT met four to five times a year for two years. Between meetings, technical consultants, including boundary organizations such as the Climate Impacts Group, provided detailed analyses of the issues that were on the next CAT agenda. Technical experts were recruited to provide direct testimony to the CAT. Professional facilitators helped run the meetings, decipher the technical testimony, and keep the CAT on track to meet its obligations. All CAT meetings were open to the public, and public testimony was accepted. To assist in this effort, five subcommittees were created to develop proposals for achieving emissions reductions in the following parts of the economy: the built environment, agriculture, forestry, transportation, and energy generation. Similarly, adaptation groups were formed to develop recommendations for dealing with impacts that could not be avoided. These Preparation/Adaptation Working Groups focused on forest health, farmlands, human health, and coastal infrastructure and resources.\nThe CAT and the working groups were well supported with science and technical expertise. The CAT issued its first report, on reducing greenhouse gases, at the close of 2007.126 It was well received by the legislature, and a significant number of its recommendations were implemented in the 2008 session.127\nIn 2008, the CAT continued its work. The focus shifted to whether Washington should join the Western Climate Initiative (WCI), a state and provincial organization that was developing a regional, economy-wide cap and trade system for carbon emissions. The same high-quality professional facilitation was provided at all meetings. Several highly qualified technical experts provided technical support.\nWith this support, the CAT produced another set of recommendations.128 The centerpiece recommendation was that Washington join the WCI's regional cap and trade program. This time, the combination of a weakening economy and political dynamics trumped the CAT's findings, and resulted in a decision not to implement its recommendations.\n\nIncorporating Recent Scientific Advances and Translating Science for Decision-Making\nWhile decision support is not necessarily constrained by a lack large numbers of models and model runs, and can also be used\nof tools, a number of barriers restrict application of existing to develop ranges and other forms of quantification of uncer-\nand emerging science and technology in adaptation and mitiga- tainty (for further discussion, see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate tion decisions.3,8,129 In cases where tools exist, decision-makers and Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement).

Authors reviewed over 50 technical inputs provided by the public and a wide variety of technical and scholarly literature related to decision support, including reports from the National Research Council that provided recent syntheses of the field (America's Climate Choices series, especially the reports Informing an Effective Response to Climate Change8 and Informing Decisions in a Changing Climate3). During the in-person meeting, authors reflected on the body of work informing the chapter and drafted a number of candidate critical messages that could be derived from the literature. Following the meeting, authors ranked these messages and engaged in expert deliberation via teleconference and email discussions in order to agree on a small number of key messages for the chapter.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nDecisions about how to address climate change can be complex, and responses will require a combination of adaptation and mitigation actions. Decision-makers \u00ad whether individuals, public officials, or others \u00ad may need help integrating scientific information into adaptation and mitigation decisions. Description of evidence base\nThe sensitivity of the climate system to human activities, the extent to which mitigation policies are implemented, and the effects of other demographic, social, ecological, and economic changes on vulnerability also contribute to uncertainty in decision-making.\nUncertainties can make decision-making in the context of climate change especially challenging for several reasons, including the rapid pace of changes in physical and human systems, the lags between climate change and observed effects, the high economic and political stakes, the number and diversity of potentially affected stakeholders, the need to incorporate scientific information of varying confidence levels, and the values of stakeholders and decision-makers.2,3\nAn iterative decision process that incorporates constantly improving scientific information and learning through periodic reviews of decisions over time is helpful in the context of rapid changes in environmental conditions.3,4 The National Research Council has concluded that an \"iterative adaptive risk management\" framework, in which decisions are adjusted over time to reflect new scientific information and decision-makers learn from experience, is appropriate for deci-\n\nsions about adaptation and ways to reduce future climate change, especially given uncertainties and advances in scientific understanding.8,26\nWell-designed decision support processes, especially those in which there is a good match between the availability of scientific information and the capacity to use it, can result in more effective outcomes based on relevant information that is perceived as useful and applicable.6\nNew information and remaining uncertainties N/A\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence and agreement or, if defensible, estimates of the likelihood of impact or consequence N/A\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nTo be effective, decision support processes need to take account of the values and goals of the key stakeholders, evolving scientific information, and the perceptions of risk.\nDescription of evidence base This message emphasizes that making a decision is more than picking the right tool and adopting its outcome. It is a process that should involve stakeholders, managers, and decision-makers to articulate and frame the decision, develop options, consider consequences (positive and negative), evaluate tradeoffs, make a decision, implement, evaluate, learn, and reassess.1,8 Oftentimes having an inclusive, transparent decision process increases buy-in, regardless of whether a particular stakeholder's preferred option is chosen.3 Decisions about investment in adaptation and mitigation measures occur in the context of uncertainty and high political and economic stakes, complicating the evaluation of information and its application in decisionmaking.3,8 Decisions involve both scientific information and values \u00ad for example, how much risk is acceptable and what priorities and preferences are addressed.2\nNew information and remaining uncertainties N/A\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence N/A\n\n646\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f26: DECISION SUPPORT: CONNECTING SCIENCE, RISK PERCEPTION, AND DECISIONS Traceable Accounts\n\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nMany decision support processes and tools are available. They can enable decision-makers to identify and assess response options, apply complex and uncertain information, clarify tradeoffs, strengthen transparency, and generate information on the costs and benefits of different choices.\nDescription of evidence base Many decision support tools have been developed to support adaptive management in specific sectors or for specific issues. These tools include: risk assessments; geographic information system (GIS)-based analysis products; targeted projections for high-consequence events such as fires, floods, or droughts; vulnerability assessments; integrated assessment models; decision calendars; scenarios and scenario planning; and others.3,8,84 Many of these tools have been validated scientifically and evaluated from the perspective of users. They are described in the sector and regional chapters of this assessment. In addition, a variety of clearing houses and data management systems provide access to decision support information and tools (for example, CAKE 2012; NatureServe 201239,85).\nThere are many tools, some of which we discuss in the chapter, that are currently being used to make decisions that include a consideration of climate change and variability, or the impacts or vulnerabilities that would result from such changes.\nAlso important is the creation of a well-structured and transparent decision process that involves affected parties in problem framing, establishing decision criteria, fact finding, deliberation, and reaching conclusions.1,8,26 These aspects of decision-making are often overlooked by those who focus more on scientific inputs and tools, but given the high stakes and remaining uncertainties, they are crucial for effective decision-making on adaptation and mitigation.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties N/A\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence N/A\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nOngoing assessment processes should incorporate evaluation of decision support tools, their accessibility to decision-makers, and their application in decision processes in different sectors and regions.\n\nallow for a movement from case studies to larger-scale assessment across decision support and would allow us to better understand how to better utilize what decision support is available and understand what needs to be improved to support adaptation and mitigation decisions in different sectors and regions.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties N/A\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence N/A\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nSteps to improve collaborative decision processes include developing new decision support tools and building human capacity to bridge science and decision-making.\nDescription of evidence base There are many challenges in communicating complex scientific information to decision makers and the public,11 and while \"translation\" of complex information is one issue, there are many others. Defining the scope and scale of the relevant climate change problem can raise both scientific and social questions. These questions require both scientific insights and consideration of values and social constructs, and require that participants engage in mutual learning and the co-production of relevant knowledge.10 Boundary processes that are collaborative and iterative18 among scientists, stakeholders, and decision-makers, such as joint fact finding and collaborative adaptive management, foster ongoing dialogue and increasing participants' understanding of policy problems and information and analysis necessary to evaluate decision options.12,13 Analysis of the conditions that contribute to their effectiveness of boundary processes is an emerging area of study.13\nA large body of literature notes that the ability of decision-makers to use data and tools has not kept pace with the rate at which new tools are developed, pointing to a need for \"science translators\" who can help decision-makers efficiently access and properly use data and tools that would be helpful in making more informed decisions in the context of climate change.3,4,8,83,133 The U.S. climate research effort has been strongly encouraged to improve integration of social and ecological sciences and to develop the capacity for decision support to help address the need to effectively incorporate advances in climate science into decision-making.135\nNew information and remaining uncertainties N/A\n\nDescription of evidence base As part of a sustained assessment, it is critical to understand the state of decision support, including what is done well and where we need to improve.

Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere by natural processes at a rate that is roughly half of the current rate of emissions from human activities. Therefore, mitigation efforts that only stabilize global emissions will not reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, but will only limit their rate of increase. The same is true for other long-lived greenhouse  gases.\n2. To meet the lower emissions scenario (B1) used in this assessment, global mitigation actions would need to limit global carbon dioxide emissions to a peak of around 44 billion tons per year within the next 25 years and decline thereafter. In 2011, global emissions were around 34 billion tons, and have been rising by about 0.9 billion tons per year for the past decade. Therefore, the world is on a path to exceed 44 billion tons per year within a decade.\n3. Over recent decades, the U.S. economy has emitted a decreasing amount of carbon dioxide per dollar of gross domestic product. Between 2008 and 2012, there was also a decline in the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted annually from energy use in the United States as a result of a variety of factors, including changes in the economy, the development of new energy production technologies, and various government policies.\n4. Carbon storage in land ecosystems, especially forests, has offset around 17% of annual U.S. fossil fuel emissions of greenhouse gases over the past several decades, but this carbon \"sink\" may not be sustainable.\n5. Both voluntary activities and a variety of policies and measures that lower emissions are  currently in place at federal, state, and local levels in the United States, even though there is no comprehensive national climate legislation. Over the remainder of this century, aggressive and sustained greenhouse gas emission reductions by the United States and by other nations would be needed to reduce global emissions to a level consistent with the lower scenario (B1) analyzed in this assessment.\n\nMitigation refers to actions that reduce the human contribution to the planetary greenhouse effect. Mitigation actions include lowering emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, and particles like black carbon (soot) that have a warming effect. Increasing the net uptake of carbon dioxide through land-use change and forestry can make a contribution as well. As a whole, human activities result in higher global concentrations of greenhouse gases and to a warming of the planet \u00ad and the effect is increased by various self-reinforcing cycles in the Earth system (such as the way melting sea ice results in more dark ocean water, which absorbs more heat, and leads to more sea ice loss). Also, the absorption of\n\nincreased carbon dioxide by the oceans is leading to increased ocean acidity with adverse effects on marine ecosystems.\nFour mitigation-related topics are assessed in this chapter. First, it presents an overview of greenhouse gas emissions and their climate influence to provide a context for discussion of mitigation efforts. Second, the chapter provides a survey of activities contributing to U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Third, it provides a summary of current government and voluntary efforts to manage these emissions. Finally, there is an assessment of the adequacy of these efforts relative to the magnitude of the climate change threat and a discussion of preparation for potential future action.\n\n649\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f27: MITIGATION\n\nWhile the chapter presents a brief overview of mitigation issues, it does not provide a comprehensive discussion of policy options, nor does it attempt to review or analyze the range of technologies available to reduce emissions.\nThese topics have also been the subject of other assessments, including those by the National Academy of Sciences1 and the U.S. Department of Energy.2 Mitigation topics are addressed\n\nthroughout this report (see Ch. 4: Energy, Key Message 5; Ch. 5: Transportation, Key Message 4; Ch. 7: Forests, Key Message 4; Ch. 9: Human Health, Key Message 4; Ch. 10: Energy, Water, and Land, Key Messages 1, 2, 3; Ch. 13: Land Use & Land Cover Change, Key Messages 2, 4; Ch. 15: Biogeochemical Cycles, Key Message 3; Ch. 26: Decision Support, Key Messages 1, 2, 3; Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplemental Message 5; Appendix 4: FAQs N, S, X, Y, Z).\n\nEmissions, Concentrations, and Climate Forcing\n\nSetting mitigation objectives requires knowledge of the Earth system processes that determine the relationship among emissions, atmospheric concentrations and, ultimately, climate. Human-caused climate change results mainly from the increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.3 These gases cause radiative \"forcing\" \u00ad an imbalance of heat trapped by the atmosphere compared to an equilibrium state. Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are the result of the history of emissions and of processes that remove them from the atmosphere; for example, by \"sinks\" like growing forests.4 The fraction of emissions that remains in the atmosphere, which is different for each greenhouse gas, also varies over time as a result of Earth system processes.\n\nafter which it continues to circulate in the land-atmosphereocean system until it is finally converted into stable forms in soils, deep ocean sediments, or other geological repositories (Figure 27.1).\nOf the carbon dioxide emitted from human activities in a year, about half is removed from the atmosphere by natural processes within a century, but around 20% continues to circu-\nHuman Activities and the Global Carbon Dioxide Budget\n\nThe impact of greenhouse gases depends partly on how long each one persists in the atmosphere.5 Reactive gases like methane and nitrous oxide are destroyed chemically in the atmosphere, so the relationships between emissions and atmospheric concentrations are determined by the rate of those reactions. The term \"lifetime\" is often used to describe the speed with which a given gas is removed from the atmosphere. Methane has a relatively short lifetime (largely removed within a decade or so, depending on conditions), so reductions in emissions can lead to a fairly rapid decrease in concentrations as the gas is oxidized in the atmosphere.6 Nitrous oxide has a much longer lifetime, taking more than 100 years to be substantially removed.7 Other gases in this category include industrial gases, like those used as solvents and in air conditioning, some of which persist in the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years.\n\nCarbon dioxide (CO2) does not react chemically with other gases in the atmosphere, so it does not, strictly speaking, have a \"lifetime.\"8 Instead, the relationship between emissions and concentrations from year to year is determined by patterns of release (for example, through burning of fossil fuels) and uptake (for example, by vegetation and by the ocean).9 Once CO2 is emitted from any source, a portion of it is removed from the atmosphere over time by plant growth and absorption by the oceans,\n\nFigure 27.1. Figure shows human-induced changes in the global carbon dioxide budget roughly since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Emissions from fossil fuel burning are the dominant cause of the steep rise shown here from 1850 to 2012. (Global Carbon Project 2010, 201210).\n\n650\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f27: MITIGATION\n\nlate and to affect atmospheric concentrations for thousands of years.11 Stabilizing or reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, therefore, requires very deep reductions in future emissions \u00ad ultimately approaching zero \u00ad to compensate for past emissions that are still circulating in the Earth system. Avoiding future emissions, or capturing and storing them in stable geological storage, would prevent carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere, and would have very long-lasting effects on atmospheric concentrations.\nIn addition to greenhouse gases, there can be climate effects from fine particles in the atmosphere. An example is black carbon (soot), which is released from coal burning, diesel engines, cooking fires, wood stoves, wildfires, and other combustion sources. These particles have a warming influence, especially when they absorb solar energy low in the atmosphere.12 Other particles, such as those formed from sulfur dioxide released during coal burning, have a cooling effect by reflecting some of the sun's energy back to space or by increasing the brightness of clouds (see: Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate; Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement; and Appendix 4: FAQs).\nThe effect of each gas is related to both how long it lasts in the atmosphere (the longer it lasts, the greater its influence) and its potency in trapping heat. The warming influence of different gases can be compared using \"global warming potentials\" (GWP), which combine these two effects, usually added up over a 100-year time period. Global warming potentials are\n\nreferenced to carbon dioxide \u00ad which is defined as having a GWP of 1.0 \u00ad and the combined effect of multiple gases is denoted in carbon dioxide equivalents, or CO2-e.\nThe relationship between emissions and concentrations of gases can be modeled using Earth System Models.4 Such models apply our understanding of biogeochemical processes that remove greenhouse gas from the atmosphere to predict their future concentrations. These models show that stabilizing CO2 emissions would not stabilize its atmospheric concentrations but instead result in a concentration that would increase at a relatively steady rate. Stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 would require reducing emissions far below presentday levels. Concentration and emissions scenarios, such as the recently developed Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and scenarios developed earlier by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), are used in Earth System Models to study potential future climates. The RCPs span a range of atmospheric targets for use by climate modelers,13,14 as do the SRES cases. These global analyses form a framework within which the climate contribution of U.S. mitigation efforts can be assessed. In this report, special attention is given to the SRES A2 scenario (similar to RCP 8.5), which assumes continued increases in emissions, and the SRES B1 scenario (close to RCP 4.5), which assumes a substantial reduction of emissions (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate; Appendix 5: Scenarios and Models).\n\nGeoengineering\n\nGeoengineering has been proposed as a third option for addressing climate change in addition to, or alongside, mitigation and adaptation. Geoengineering refers to intentional modifications of the Earth system as a means to address climate change. Three types of activities have been proposed: 1) carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which boosts CO2 removal from the atmosphere by various means, such as fertilizing ocean processes and promoting land-use practices that help take up carbon, 2) solar radiation management (SRM), which reflects a small percentage of sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases,15 and 3) direct capture and storage of CO2 from the atmosphere.16\nCurrent research suggests that SRM or CDR could diminish the impacts of climate change. However, once undertaken, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on human populations and ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes.17 SRM undertaken by itself would not slow increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and would therefore also fail to address ocean acidification. Furthermore, existing international institutions are not adequate to manage such global interventions. The risks associated with such purposeful perturbations to the Earth system are thus poorly understood, suggesting the need for caution and comprehensive research, including consideration of the implicit moral hazards.18\n\nSection 1: U.S. Emissions and Land-Use Change\nIndustrial, Commercial, and Household Emissions\n\nU.S. greenhouse gas emissions, not accounting for uptake by land use and agriculture (see Figure 27.3), rose to as high as 7,260 million tons CO2-e in 2007, and then fell by about 9% between 2008 and 2012.19 Several factors contributed to the\n\ndecline, including the reduction in energy use in response to the 2008-2010 recession, the displacement of coal in electric generation by lower-priced natural gas, and the effect of federal and state energy and environmental policies.20\n\n651\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f27: MITIGATION\n\nCarbon dioxide made up 84% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2011. Forty-one percent of these emissions were attributable to liquid fuels (petroleum), followed closely by solid fuels (principally coal in electric generation), and to a lesser extent by natural gas.20 The two dominant production sectors responsible for these emissions are electric power generation (coal and gas) and transportation (petroleum). Flaring and cement manufacture together account for less than 1% of the total. If emissions from electric generation are allocated to their various end-uses, transportation is the largest CO2 source, contributing a bit over one-third of the total, followed by industry at slightly over a quarter, and residential use and the commercial sector at around one-fifth each.\nA useful picture of historical patterns of carbon dioxide emissions can be constructed by decomposing the cumulative change in emissions from a base year into the contributions of five driving forces: 1) decline in the CO2 content of energy use, as with a shift from coal to natural gas in electric generation, 2) reduction in energy intensity \u00ad the energy needed to produce each unit of gross domestic product (GDP) \u00ad which results from substitution responses to energy prices, changes in the com-\nDrivers of U.S. Fossil Emissions\n\nposition of the capital stock, and both autonomous and priceinduced technological change, 3) changes in the structure of the economy, such as a decline in energy-intensive industries and an increase in services that use less energy, 4) growth in per capita GDP, and 5) rising population.\nOver the period 1963-2008, annual U.S. carbon dioxide emissions slightly more than doubled, because growth in emissions potential attributable to increases in population and GDP per person outweighed reductions contributed by lowered energy and carbon intensity and changes in economic structure (Figure 27.2). Each series in the figure illustrates the quantity of cumulative emissions since 1963 that would have been generated by the effect of the associated driver. By 2008, fossil fuel burning had increased CO2 emissions by 2.7 billion tons over 1963 levels. However, by itself the observed decline in energy would have reduced emissions by 1.8 billion tons, while the observed increase in per capita GDP would have increased emissions by more than 5 billion tons.\nAfter decades of increases, CO2 emissions from energy use (which account for 97% of total U.S. emissions) declined by\naround 9% between 2008 and 2012, largely due to a shift from coal to less CO2-intensive natural gas for electricity production.19 Trends in driving forces shown in Figure 27.2 are expected to continue in the future, though their relative contributions are subject to significant uncertainty. The reference case projection by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) shows their net effect being a slower rate of CO2 emissions growth than in the past, with roughly constant energy sector emissions to 2040.22 It must be recognized, however, that emissions from energy use rise and fall from year to year, as the aforementioned driving forces vary.\n\nThe primary non-CO2 gas emissions in 2011 were methane (9% of total CO2-e emissions), nitrous oxide (5%), and a set of industrial gases (2%). U.S. emissions of each of these gases have been roughly constant over the past half-dozen years.22 Emissions of methane and nitrous oxide have been roughly constant over the past couple of decades, but there has been an increase in the industrial gases as some are substituted for ozone-destroying substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol.23\n\nFigure 27.2. This graph depicts the changes in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions over time as a function of five driving forces: 1) the amount of CO2 produced per unit of energy (CO2 intensity); 2) the amount of energy used per unit of gross domestic product (energy intensity); 3) structural changes in the economy; 4) per capita income; and 5) population. Although CO2 intensity and especially energy intensity have decreased significantly and the structure of the U.S. economy has changed, total CO2 emissions have continued to rise as a result of the growth in both population and per capita income. (Baldwin and Sue Wing, 201321).\n\nYet another warming influence on the climate system is black carbon (soot), which consists of fine particles that result mainly from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. Long a public health concern, black carbon particles absorb solar radiation during their short life in the atmosphere (days to weeks). When deposited on snow and ice, these particles darken the surface and reduce the reflection of incoming solar radiation back to space. These particles also influence cloud formation in ways yet poorly quantified.24\n\n652\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f27: MITIGATION\n\nLand Use, Forestry, and Agriculture\n\nThe main stocks of carbon in its various biological forms (plants and trees, dead wood, litter, soil, and harvested products) are estimated periodically and their rate of change, or flux, is calculated as the average annual difference between two time periods. Estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes for U.S. lands are based on land inventories augmented with data from ecosystem studies and production reports.25,26\n\nSources and Sinks in U.S. Agriculture and Forests\n\nU.S. lands were estimated to be a net sink\n\nof between approximately 640 and 1,074\n\nmillion tons CO2-e in the late 2000s.26,27\n\nEstimates vary depending on choice of\n\ndatasets, models, and methodologies (see\n\nCh. 15: Biogeochemical Cycles, \"Estimat-\n\ning the U.S. Carbon Sink,\" for more discussion). This net land sink effect is the result of sources (from crop production, livestock production, and grasslands) and sinks (in forests, urban trees, and wetlands).

A 2012 Supreme Court decision upheld the EPA's finding that greenhouse gases \"endanger public health and welfare.\"36 This ruling added the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to the Agency's authority under the Clean Air Act. Actions taken and proposed under the new authority have focused on road transport and electric power generation.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a 40- The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) provides most of the year history of regulating the concentration and deposition of funding for a broad range of programs for energy research,\n\n\u00a9 Jerome Levitch/Corbis Flickr Solar Panels Department of Energy\n\n654\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f27: MITIGATION\n\ndevelopment, and demonstration. DOE also has the authority to regulate the efficiency of appliances and building codes for manufactured housing. In addition, most of the other federal agencies \u00ad including the Departments of Defense, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Agriculture \u00ad have programs related to greenhouse gas mitigation.\nThe Administration's Climate Action Plan37 builds on these activities with a broad range of mitigation, adaptation, and preparedness measures. The mitigation elements of the plan are in part a response to the commitment made during the 2010 Cancun Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Frame-\n\nwork Convention on Climate Change to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. Actions proposed in the Plan include: 1) limiting carbon emissions from both new and existing power plants, 2) continuing to increase the stringency of fuel economy standards for automobiles and trucks, 3) continuing to improve energy efficiency in the buildings sector, 4) reducing the emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases through a variety of measures, 5) increasing federal investments in cleaner, more efficient energy sources for both power and transportation, and 6) identifying new approaches to protect and restore our forests and other critical landscapes, in the presence of a changing climate.\n\nCity, State, and Regional Actions\n\nJurisdiction for greenhouse gases and energy policies is shared between the federal government and the states.1 For example, states regulate the distribution of electricity and natural gas to consumers, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates wholesale sales and transportation of natural gas and electricity. In addition, many states have adopted climate initiatives as well as energy policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For a survey of many of these state activities, see Table 27.2. Many cities are taking similar actions.\nThe most ambitious state activity is California's Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32), a law that sets a state goal to reduce\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The state program caps emissions and uses a market-based system of trading in emissions credits (cap and trade), as well as a number of regulatory actions. The most well-known, multi-state effort has been the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), formed by ten northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states (though New Jersey exited in 2011). RGGI is a cap and trade system applied to the power sector with revenue from allowance auctions directed to investments in efficiency and renewable energy.\n\nVoluntary Actions\n\nCorporations, individuals, and non-profit organizations have initiated a host of voluntary actions. The following examples give the flavor of the range of efforts:\n\nClimate Protection Agreement,39 and many of these communities are actively implementing strategies to reduce their greenhouse gas footprint.\n\n\u00b7 The Carbon Disclosure Project has the largest global col- \u00b7 Under the American College and University Presidents'\n\nlection of self-reported climate change and water-use\n\nClimate Commitment (ACUPCC), 679 institutions have\n\ninformation.

Studies of price-based policies, such as a cap and trade system, indicate that a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050 could be achieved at a cost of a year or two of projected growth in gross domestic product over the period (for example, Paltsev et al. 2009; EIA 200940). However,\n\nbecause of differences in analysis method, and in assumptions about economic growth and technology change, cost projections vary considerably even for a policy applying price penalties.41 Comparisons of emissions reduction by prices versus regulations show that a regulatory approach can cost substantially more than a price-based policy.42\n\nCo-benefits for air pollution and human health\n\n\u00a9 iStockPhoto.com_Daniel Stein\n\nActions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can yield co-benefits for objectives apart from climate change, such as energy security, health, ecosystem services, and biodiversity.43,44 The co-benefits for reductions in air pollution have received particular attention. Because air pollutants and greenhouse gases share common sources, particularly from fossil fuel combustion, actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions also reduce air pollutants. While some greenhouse gas reduction measures might increase other emissions, broad programs to reduce greenhouse gases across an economy or a sector can reduce air pollutants markedly.14,45 (Unfortunately for climate mitigation, cutting sulfur dioxide pollution from coal burning also reduces the cooling influence of reflective particles formed from these emissions in the atmosphere.46)\nThere is significant interest in quantifying the air pollution and human health co-benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation, particularly from the public health community,44,47 as the human health benefits can be immediate and local, in contrast to the long-term and widespread effects of climate change.48 Many studies have found that monetized health and pollution control benefits can be of similar magnitude to abatement costs (for example, Nemet et al. 2010; Burtraw et al. 200348,49). Methane reductions have also been shown to generate health benefits from reduced ozone.50 Similarly, in developing nations, reducing black carbon from household cook stoves substantially reduces air pollution-related illness and death.51 Ancillary health benefits in developing countries typically exceed those in developed countries for a variety of reasons.48 But only in very few cases are these ancillary benefits considered in analyses of climate mitigation policies.\n\nSection 3: Preparation for Potential Future Mitigation Action\nTo meet the emissions reduction in the lower (B1) scenario of a global emissions path consistent with the B1 scenario will used in this assessment (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate) under require strenuous action by all major emitters. reasonable assumptions about managing costs, annual global CO2 emissions would need to peak at around 44 billion tons Policies already enacted and other factors lowered U.S. emiswithin the next 25 years or so and decline steadily for the rest sions in recent years. The Annual Energy Outlook prepared by of the century. At the current rate of emissions growth, the the EIA, which previously forecasted sustained growth in emisworld is on a path to exceed the 44 billion ton level within a de- sions, projected in 2013 that energy-related U.S. CO2 emiscade (see \"Emissions Scenarios and RCPs\"). Thus achievement sions would remain roughly constant for the next 25 years.22\n\n656\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f27: MITIGATION\n\nMoreover, through the President's Climate Action Plan, the Administration has committed to additional measures not yet reflected in the EIA's projections, with the goal of reducing emissions about 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. Still, additional and stronger U.S. action, as well as strong action by other major emitters, will be needed to meet the long-term global emission reductions reflected in the B1 scenario.\nAchieving the B1 emissions path would require substantial decarbonization of the global economy by the end of this century, implying a fundamental transformation of the global energy system. Details of the energy mix along the way differ among analyses, but the implied involvement by the U.S. can be seen in studies carried out under the U.S. Climate Change Science Program54 and the Energy Modeling Forum.55,56 In these studies, direct burning of coal without carbon capture is essentially excluded from the power system, and the same holds for natural gas toward the end of the century \u00ad to be replaced by some combination of coal or gas with carbon capture and storage, nuclear generation, and renewables. Biofuels and electricity are projected to substitute for oil in the transport sector. A substantial component of the task is accomplished with demand reduction, through efficiency improvement, conservation, and shifting to an economy less dependent on energy services.\nThe challenge is great enough even starting today, but delay by any of the major emitters makes meeting any such target even more difficult and may rule out some of the more ambitious\nEmissions scenarios and RCPs\nThe Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) specify alternative limits to human influence on the Earth's energy balance, stated in watts per square meter (W/m2) of the Earth's surface.13,52 The A2 emissions scenario implies atmospheric concentrations with radiative forcing slightly lower than the highest RCP, which is 8.5 W/m2. The lower limits, at 6.0, 4.5 and 2.6 W/m2, imply ever-greater mitigation efforts. The B1 scenario (rapid emissions reduction) is close to the 4.5 W/m2 RCP53 and to a similar case (Level 2) analyzed in a previous federal study.54 Those assessments find that, to limit the economic costs, annual global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industrial sources like cement manufacture, need to peak by 2035 to 2040 at around 44 billion tons of CO2, and decline thereafter. The scale of the task can be seen in the fact that these global emissions were already at 34 billion tons CO2 in 2011, and over the previous decade they rose at around 0.92 billion tons of CO2 per year.10 The lowest RCP would require an even more rapid turnaround and negative net emissions \u00ad that is, removing more CO2 from the air than is emitted globally \u00ad in this century.52\n\ngoals.54,55 A study of the climate change threat and potential responses by the U.S. National Academies therefore concludes that there is \"an urgent need for U.S. action to reduce greenhouse emissions.\"57 The National Research Council (NRC) goes on to suggest alternative national-level strategies that might be followed, including an economy-wide system of prices on greenhouse gas emissions and a portfolio of possible regulatory measures and subsidies. Deciding these matters will be a continuing task, and U.S. Administrations and Congress face a long series of choices about whether to take additional mitigation actions and how best to do it. Two supporting activities will help guide this process: opening future technological options and development of ever-more-useful assessments of the cost effectiveness and benefits of policy choices.\nMany technologies are potentially available to accomplish emissions reduction. They include ways to increase the efficiency of fossil energy use and facilitate a shift to low-carbon energy sources, sources of improvement in the cost and performance of renewables (for example, wind, solar, and bioenergy) and nuclear energy, ways to reduce the cost of carbon capture and storage, means to expand terrestrial sinks through management of forests and soils and increased agricultural productivity,2 and phasing down HFCs. In addition to the research and development carried out by private sector firms with their own funds, the Federal Government traditionally supports major programs to advance these technologies. This support is accomplished in part by credits and deductions in the tax code, and in part by federal expenditure. For example, the 2012 federal budget devoted approximately $6 billion to clean energy technologies.58 Success in these ventures, lowering the cost of greenhouse gas reduction, can make a crucial contribution to future policy choices.1\nBecause they are in various stages of market maturity, the costs and effectiveness of many of these technologies remain uncertain: continuing study of their performance is important to understanding their role in future mitigation decisions.59 In addition, evaluation of broad policies and particular mitigation measures requires frameworks that combine information from a range of disciplines. Study of mitigation in the near future can be done with energy-economic models that do not assume large changes in the mix of technologies or changes in the structure of the economy. Analysis over the time spans relevant to stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations, however, requires Integrated Assessment Models, which consider all emissions drivers and policy measures that affect them, and that take account of how they are related to the larger economy and features of the climate system.54,55,60 This type of analysis is also useful for exploring the relations between mitigation and measures to adapt to a changing climate.\nContinued development of these analytical capabilities can help support decisions about national mitigation and the U.S. position in international negotiations. In addition, as shown\n\n657\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f27: MITIGATION\n\nabove, mitigation is being undertaken by individuals and firms as well as by city, state, and regional governments. The capacity for mitigation from individual and household behavioral changes, such as increasing energy end-use efficiency with available technology, is known to be large.63 Although there is capacity, there is not always broad acceptance of those behavioral changes, nor is there sufficient understanding of how to design programs to encourage such changes.64 Behavioral\n\nand institutional research on how such choices are made and the results evaluated would be extremely beneficial. For many of these efforts, understanding of cost and effectiveness is limited, as is understanding of aspects of public support and institutional performance; so additional support for studies of these activities is needed to ensure that resources are efficiently employed.\n\nInteractions between adaptation and mitigation\nThere are various ways in which mitigation efforts and adaptation measures are interdependent (see Ch. 28: Adaptation). For example, the use of plant material as a substitute for petroleum-based transportation fuels or directly as a substitute for burning coal or gas for electricity generation has received substantial attention.61 But land used for mitigation purposes is potentially not available for food production, even as the global demand for agricultural products continues to rise.62 Conversely, land required for adaptation strategies, like setting aside wildlife corridors or expanding the extent of conservation areas, is potentially not available for mitigation involving the use of plant material, or active management practices to enhance carbon storage in vegetation or soils. These possible interactions are poorly understood but potentially important, especially as climate change itself affects vegetation and ecosystem productivity and carbon storage. Increasing agricultural productivity to adapt to climate change can also serve to mitigate climate change.\n\nSection 4: Research Needs\n\n\u00b7 Engineering and scientific research is needed on the de- \u00b7 Uncertainties in model-based projections of greenhouse\n\nvelopment of cost-effective energy use technologies (de-\n\ngas emissions and of the effectiveness and costs of policy\n\nvices, systems, and control strategies) and energy supply\n\nmeasures need to be better quantified.

Therefore, mitigation efforts that only stabilize global emissions will not reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, but will only limit their rate of increase. The same is true for other long-lived greenhouse gases.\nDescription of evidence base The message is a restatement of conclusions derived from the peer-reviewed literature over nearly the past 20 years (see Section 1 of chapter). Publications have documented the long lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere, resulting in long time lags between action and reduction,9,11,76 and Earth System Models have shown that stabilizing emissions will not immediately stabilize atmospheric concentrations, which will continue to increase.4\nNew information and remaining uncertainties There are several important uncertainties in the current carbon cycle, especially the overall size, location, and dynamics of the land-use sink9,11 and technological development and performance.\n\nConfidence Level\nVery High\nStrong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well documented and accepted methods, etc.),\nhigh consensus\nHigh\nModerate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium\nconsensus\nMedium\nSuggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing\nschools of thought\nLow\nInconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts\n\nSimulating future atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases requires both assumptions about economic activity, stringency of any greenhouse gas emissions control, and availability of technologies, as well as a number of assumptions about how the changing climate system affects both natural and anthropogenic sources.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence Very High. Observations of changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases are consistent with our understanding of the broad relationships between emissions and concentrations.\n\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nTo meet the lower emissions scenario (B1) used in this assessment, global mitigation actions would need to limit global carbon dioxide emissions to a peak of around 44 billion tons per year within the next 25 years and decline thereafter. In 2011, global emissions were around 34 billion tons, and have been rising by about 0.9 billion tons per year for the past decade. Therefore, the world is on a path to exceed 44 billion tons per year within a decade.\n\nDescription of evidence base A large number of emissions scenarios have been modeled, with a number of publications showing what would be required to limit CO213,53,54,77 to any predetermined limit. At current concentrations and rate of rise, the emissions of CO2 would need to peak around\n\n667\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f27: MITIGATION Traceable Accounts\n\n44 billion tons within the next 25 years in order to stabilize concentrations as in the B1 scenario. Given the rate of increase in recent years,10 this limit is expected to be surpassed.78\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Uncertainties about the carbon cycle could affect these calculations, but the largest uncertainties are the assumptions made about the strength and cost of greenhouse gas emissions policies.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence The confidence in the conclusion is high. This is a contingent conclusion, though \u00ad we do not have high confidence that the current emission rate will be sustained. However, we do have high confidence that if we do choose to limit concentrations as in the B1 scenario, emissions will need to peak soon and then decline.\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nOver recent decades, the U.S. economy has emitted a decreasing amount of carbon dioxide per dollar of gross domestic product. Between 2008 and 2012, there was also a decline in the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted annually from energy use in the United States as a result of a variety of factors, including changes in the economy, the development of new energy production technologies, and various government policies.\nDescription of evidence base Trends in greenhouse gas emissions intensity are analyzed and published by governmental reporting agencies.20,23,26 Published, peer-reviewed literature cited in Section 2 of the Mitigation Chapter supports the conclusions about why these trends have occurred.79\n\nthe Mitigation Chapter. Studies have shown that there is a large land-use carbon sink in the United States.26,27,28 Many publications attribute this sink to forest re-growth, and the sink is projected to decline as a result of forest aging30,31,33 and factors like drought, fire, and insect infestations31 reducing the carbon sink of these regions.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties FIA plots are measured extremely carefully over long time periods, but do not cover all U.S. forested land. Other U.S. land types must have carbon content estimated from other sources. Modeling relationships between growth and carbon content, and taking CO2 and climate change into account have large scientific uncertainties associated with them.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence High. Evidence of past trends is based primarily on government data sources, but these also have to be augmented by other data and models in order to incorporate additional land-use types. Projecting future carbon content is consistent with published models, but these have intrinsic uncertainties associated with them.\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nBoth voluntary activities and a variety of policies and measures that lower emissions are currently in place at federal, state, and local levels in the United States, even though there is no comprehensive national climate legislation. Over the remainder of this century, aggressive and sustained greenhouse gas emission reductions by the United States and by other nations would be needed to reduce global emissions to a level consistent with the lower scenario (B1) analyzed in this assessment.\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties Economic and technological forecasts are highly uncertain.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence High. The statement is a summary restatement of published analyses by government agencies and interpretation from the reviewed literature.\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nCarbon storage in land ecosystems, especially forests, has offset around 17% of annual U.S. fossil fuel emissions of greenhouse gases over the past several decades, but this carbon \"sink\" may not be sustainable.\n\nDescription of evidence base The identification of state, local, regional, federal, and voluntary programs that will have an effect of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a straightforward accounting of both legislative action and announcements of the implementation of such programs. Some of the programs include the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement,39 and many other local government initiatives.38 Several states have also adapted climate policies including California's Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32) and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The assertion that they will not lead to a reduction of US CO2 emissions is supported by calculations from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nDescription of evidence base Underlying data come primarily from U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots, supplemented by additional ecological data collection efforts. Modeling conclusions come from peer-reviewed literature. All references are in Section 2 of\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties The major uncertainty in the calculation about future emissions levels is whether a comprehensive national policy will be implemented.\n\n668\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAssessment of confidence based on evidence Very High. There is recognition that the implementation of voluntary programs may differ from how they are originally planned, and that institutions can always choose to leave voluntary programs (as is happening with RGGI, noted in the chapter). The statement about the future of U.S. CO2 emissions cannot be taken as a prediction of what will happen \u00ad it is a conditional statement based on an assumption of no comprehensive national legislation or regulation.\n\n27: MITIGATION Traceable Accounts\n\n669\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 28 ADAPTATION\nConvening Lead Authors\nRosina Bierbaum, University of Michigan Arthur Lee, Chevron Corporation Joel Smith, Stratus Consulting\nLead Authors\nMaria Blair, Independent Lynne M.

Substantial adaptation planning is occurring in the public and private sectors and at all levels of government; however, few measures have been implemented and those that have appear to be incremental changes.\n2. Barriers to implementation of adaptation include limited funding, policy and legal impediments, and difficulty in anticipating climate-related changes at local scales.\n3. There is no \"one-size fits all\" adaptation, but there are similarities in approaches across regions and sectors. Sharing best practices, learning by doing, and iterative and collaborative processes including stakeholder involvement, can help support progress.\n4. Climate change adaptation actions often fulfill other societal goals, such as sustainable development, disaster risk reduction, or improvements in quality of life, and can therefore be incorporated into existing decision-making processes.\n5. Vulnerability to climate change is exacerbated by other stresses such as pollution, habitat fragmentation, and poverty. Adaptation to multiple stresses requires assessment of the composite threats as well as tradeoffs among costs, benefits, and risks of available options.\n6. The effectiveness of climate change adaptation has seldom been evaluated, because actions have only recently been initiated and comprehensive evaluation metrics do not yet exist.\n\nOver the past few years, the focus moved from the question \"Is climate changing?\" to the equally important question: \"Can society manage unavoidable changes and avoid unmanageable changes?\"1,2 Research demonstrates that both mitigation (efforts to reduce future climate changes) and adaptation (efforts to reduce the vulnerability of society to climate change impacts) are needed in order to minimize the damages from human-caused climate change and to adapt to the pace and ultimate magnitude of changes that will occur.3,4,5\nAdaptation and mitigation are closely linked; adaptation efforts will be more difficult, more costly, and less likely to succeed if significant mitigation actions are not taken.2,6 The study and application of adaptation in the climate change realm is nascent compared to the many analyses of mitigation policies and practices to reduce emissions. Uncertainties about future socioeconomic conditions as well as future climate changes can make it difficult to arrive at adaptation decisions now. However, the pace and magnitude of projected change emphasize the need to be prepared for a wide range and intensity of climate impacts in the future. Planning and managing based on the climate of the last century means that tolerances of some infrastructure and species will be exceeded.5,7,8 For example, building codes and landscaping\n\nordinances will likely need to be updated not only for energy efficiency but also to conserve water supplies, protect against disease vectors, reduce susceptibility to heat stress, and improve protection against extreme events.5,9 Although there is uncertainty about future conditions, research indicates that intelligent adaptive actions can still be taken now.10,11 Climate change projections have inherent uncertainties, but it is still important to develop, refine, and deploy tools and approaches that enable iterative decision-making and increase flexibility and robustness of climate change responses (Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate).12\nClimate change affects human health, natural ecosystems, built environments, and existing social, institutional, and legal arrangements. Adaptation considerations include local, state, regional, national, and international issues. For example, the implications of international arrangements need to be considered in the context of managing the Great Lakes, the Columbia River, and the Colorado River to deal with drought.13,14 Both \"bottom up\" community planning and \"top down\" national strategies11 may help regions deal with impacts such as increases in electrical brownouts, heat stress, floods, and wildfires. Such a mix of approaches will require\n\n671\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f28: ADAPTATION\n\ncross-boundary coordination at multiple levels as operational agencies integrate adaptation planning into their programs.\nAdaptation actions can be implemented reactively, after changes in climate occur, or proactively, to prepare for projected changes.11 Proactively preparing can reduce the harm from certain climate change impacts, such as increasingly intense extreme events, shifting zones for agricultural crops, and rising sea levels, while also facilitating a more rapid and efficient response to changes as they happen. This chapter highlights\n\nefforts at the federal, regional, state, tribal, and local levels, as well as initiatives in the corporate and non-governmental sectors to build adaptive capacity and resilience in response to climate change. While societal adaptation to climate variability is as old as civilization itself,15 the focus of this chapter is on preparing for unprecedented human-induced climate change through adaptation. A map of illustrative adaptation activities and four detailed case examples that highlight ongoing adaptation activity across the U.S. are provided in Section 4 of this chapter.\n\nAdaptation key terms definitions*\nAdapt, Adaptation: Adjustment in natural or human systems to a new or changing environment that exploits beneficial opportunities or moderates negative effects.\nAdaptive Capacity: The potential of a system to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, take advantage of opportunities, and cope with the consequences.\nMitigation: Technological change and substitutions that reduce resource inputs and emissions per unit of output. Although several social, economic, and technological actions would reduce emissions, with respect to climate change, mitigation means implementing actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or increase the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed and stored by natural and man-made carbon sinks (see Ch. 27: Mitigation).\nMultiple Stressors: Stress that originates from different sources that affect natural, managed, and socioeconomic systems and can cause impacts that are compounded and sometimes unexpected. An example would be when economic or market stress combines with drought to negatively impact farmers.\nResilience: A capability to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from significant multi-hazard threats with minimum damage to social well-being, the economy, and the environment.\nRisk: A combination of the magnitude of the potential consequence(s) of climate change impact(s) and the likelihood that the consequence(s) will occur.\nVulnerability: The degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity.\n*Definitions adapted from (IPCC 2007; 16 NRC 2007,17 201011).\n\nAdaptation Activities in the United States\n\nFederal Government\n\nFederal leadership, guidance, information, and support are \u00b7 the release of President Obama's Climate Action Plan in June\n\nvital to planning for and implementing adaptation actions at all scales and in all affected sectors of society (Table 28.1).11,18,19,20\n\n2013, which has as one of its three major pillars, preparing the United States for the impacts of climate change, including\n\nSeveral new federal climate adaptation initiatives and\n\nbuilding stronger and safer communities and infrastructure,\n\nstrategies have been developed in recent years, including:\n\nprotecting the economy and natural resources, and using sound science to manage climate impacts;22\n\n\u00b7 Executive Order (EO) 13514, requiring federal agencies to\n\ndevelop recommendations for strengthening policies and programs to adapt to the impacts of climate change;21\n\n\u00b7 the creation of an Interagency Climate Change Adaptation\nTask Force (ICCATF) (now the Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience, per Executive Order 1365323) that led to\n\nthe development of national principles for adaptation and\n\n672\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f28: ADAPTATION\n\nis leading to crosscutting and government-wide adaptation policies;\n\u00b7 the development of three crosscutting national adaptation strategies focused on integrating federal, and often state, local, and tribal efforts on adaptation in key sectors: 1) the National Action Plan: Priorities for Managing Freshwater Resources in a Changing Climate;24 2) the National Fish, Wildlife and Plants Climate Adaptation Strategy;25 and 3) a priority objective on resilience and adaptation in the National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan;26\n\u00b7 a new decadal National Global Change Research Plan (2012\u00ad 2021) that includes elements related to climate adaptation, such as improving basic science, informing decisions, improving assessments, and communicating with and educating the public;27\n\u00b7 the development of several interagency and agency-specific groups focused on adaptation, including a \"community of\n\npractice\" for federal agencies that are developing and implementing adaptation plans, an Adaptation Science Workgroup inside the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), and several agency specific climate change and adaptation task forces; and\n\u00b7 a November 2013 Executive Order entitled \"Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change\" that, among other things, calls for the modernizing of federal programs to support climate resilient investments, managing lands and waters for climate preparedness and resilience, the creation of a Council on Climate Preparedness and Resilience, and the creation of a State, Local, and Tribal Leaders Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience.23\nFederal agencies are all required to plan for adaptation.

New England Federal Partners is a multi-agency group formed to support the needs of the states, tribes, and communities of the New England Region and to facilitate and enable informed decision-making on issues pertaining to coastal and marine spatial planning, climate mitigation, and climate adaptation throughout the region.125\n4. Philadelphia is greening its combined sewer infrastructure to protect rivers, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and enhance adaptation to a changing climate.126\n5. Keene, NH, developed a Comprehensive Master Plan that emphasizes fostering walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods by putting services, jobs, homes, arts and culture, and other community amenities within walking distance of each other. The plan also calls for sustainable site and building designs that use resources efficiently. These strategies were identified in the city's 2007 Adaptation Plan as ways to build resilience while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.127\n6. New York City has created a Green Infrastructure Plan and is committed to goals that include the construction of enough green infrastructure throughout the city to manage 10% of the runoff from impervious surfaces by 2030.128\n7. Lewes, DE, undertook an intensive stakeholder process to integrate climate change into the city's updated hazard mitigation plan.62\n8. Local governments and tribes throughout Alaska, such as those in Homer, are planting native vegetation and changing the coastal surface, moving inland or away from rivers, and building riprap walls, seawalls or groins, which are shore-protection structures built perpendicular to the shoreline (see also: Ch. 22:Alaska; Ch. 12: Indigenous Peoples).129\n9. Alaskan villages are physically being relocated because of climate impacts such as sea level rise and erosion; these include Newtok, Shishmaref, Kivalina, and dozens of other villages.130\n10. Cedar Falls, Iowa, passed legislation in 2009 that includes a new floodplain ordinance that expands zoning restrictions from the 100-year floodplain to the 500-year floodplain, because this expanded floodplain zone better reflects the flood risks experienced by the city during the 2008 floods.131\n11. In January 2011, the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) released the Michigan Climate and Health Adaptation Plan, which has a goal of \"preparing the public health system in Michigan to address the public health consequences of climate change in a coordinated manner.\" In September 2010, MDCH received three years' funding to implement this plan as part of the Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative of CDC.132\n12. Chicago was one of the first cities to officially integrate climate adaptation into a citywide climate adaptation plan. Since its release, a number of strategies have been implemented to help the city manage heat, protect forests, and enhance green design, such as their work on green roofs.64\n13. Grand Rapids, MI, recently released a sustainability plan that integrates future climate projections to ensure that the economic, environmental, and social strategies embraced are appropriate for today as well as the future.133\n14. Tulsa, OK, has a three-pronged approach to reducing flooding and managing stormwater: a) prevent new problems by looking ahead and avoiding future downstream problems from new development (for example, requiring on-site stormwater detention); b) correct existing problems and learn from disasters to reduce future disasters (for example, through watershed management and the acquisition and relocation of buildings in flood-prone areas); and c) act to enhance the safety, environment, and quality of life of the community through public awareness, an increase in stormwater quality, and emergency management.134\n15.

The Texas Forest Service works closely with communities to help them to reach Firewise Community status and offers a variety of awareness, educational, informational, and capacity-building efforts, such as Texas Wildscapes, a program that assists in choosing less fire-friendly plants.135\n\nContinued\n685\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f28: ADAPTATION\n16. After the heavy rainfall events of 2004 that resulted in significant erosion on his farms, Dan Gillespie, a farmer with the Natural Resources Conservation Service in Norfolk, NE, began experimenting with adding cover crops to the no-till process. It worked so well in reducing erosion and increasing crop yields that he is now sharing his experience with other farmers. (http://www.lenrd. org/projects-programs/; http://www.notill.org/)136\n17. Point Reyes National Seashore is preparing for climate change by removing two dams that are barriers to water flow and fish migration. This change restores ecological continuity for anadromous fish (those that migrate from the sea to fresh water to spawn), creating a more resilient ecosystem.137\n18. Western Adaptation Alliance is a group of eleven cities in five states in the Intermountain West that share lessons learned in adaptation planning, develop strategic thinking that can be applied to specific community plans, and join together to generate funds to support capacity building, adaptation planning, and vulnerability assessment.138\n19. Navajo Nation used information on likely changes in future climate to help inform their drought contingency plan.139\n20. California Department of Health and the Natural Resources Defense Council collaborated to create the Public Health Impacts of Climate Change in California: Community Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation Strategies report, which is being used to inform public health preparedness activities in the state.140\n21. State of Idaho successfully integrated climate adaptation into the state's Wildlife Management Plan. (http://fishandgame.idaho. gov/public/wildlife/cwcs/)8\n22.The Rising Tides Competition was held in 2009 by the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission to elicit ideas for how the Bay could respond to sea level rise.141\n23.Flagstaff, Arizona, created a resilience strategy and passed a resilience policy, as opposed to a formal adaptation plan, as a means to institutionalize adaptation efforts in city government operations.142\n24. The Olympic National Forest and Olympic National Park were sites of case studies looking at how to adapt management of federal lands to climate change. Sensitivity assessments, review of management activities and constraints, and adaptation workshops in the areas of hydrology and roads, fish, vegetation, and wildlife were all components of the case study process.143\n25. King County Flood Control District was reformed to merge multiple flood management zones into a single county entity for funding and policy oversight for projects and programs \u00ad partly in anticipation of increased stormwater flows due to climate change.144\n26. The Water Utilities Climate Alliance has been working with member water utilities to ensure that future weather and climate considerations are integrated into short- and long-term water management planning. (http://www.wucaonline.org/html/)90\n27. Seattle's RainWatch program uses an early warning precipitation forecasting tool to help inform decisions about issues such as drainage operations. (http://www.atmos.washington.edu/SPU/)19\n28.City of Portland and Multnomah County created a Climate Action Plan that includes indicators to help them gauge progress in planning and implementing adaptation actions.145\n29. In 2010, the state of Louisiana launched a $10 million program to assist communities that had been affected by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in becoming more resilient to future environmental problems. Twenty-nine communities from around the state were awarded resiliency development funds. The Coastal Sustainability Studio at Louisiana State University started working in 2012 with all 29 funded communities, as well as many that did not receive funds, to develop peer-learning networks, develop best practices, build capacity to implement plans, and develop planning tools and a user-inspired and useful website to increase community resiliency in the state.146\n30.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and The Nature Conservancy are cooperating in a pilot adaptation project to address erosion and saltwater intrusion, among other issues, in the Alligator River Refuge. This project incorporates multiple agencies, native knowledge, community involvement, local economics, and technical precision.147\n31. North and South Carolina are actively working to revise their state wildlife strategies to include climate adaptation.82\n32. The Southeast Florida Climate Change Compact is a collaboration of the four southernmost counties in Florida (Monroe, Broward, Palm Springs, and Miami-Dade) focusing on enhancing regional resilience to climate change and reducing regional greenhouse gas emissions.67\n\n686\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f28: ADAPTATION\n\nSection 3: Next Steps\n\nAdaptation to climate change is in a nascent stage. The decision-making in light of uncertainty about climate change\n\nFederal Government is beginning to develop institutions and other considerations will be equally important. In addition\n\nand practices necessary to cope with climate change, to these areas, emerging areas of emphasis include:\n\nincluding efforts such as regional climate centers within the\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic and \u00b7 Costs and Benefits of Adaptation: Methodologies to evaluate\n\nAtmospheric Administration (a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce), and the U.S. Department of the Interior. While\n\nthe relevant costs of adaptation options, as well as the costs of inaction, need to be developed.6,102\n\nthe Federal Government provides financial assistance in\n\nfederally-declared disasters, it is also enabling and facilitating \u00b7 A Compendium of Adaptation Practices: A central and\n\nearly adaptation within states, regions, local communities, and the public and private sectors.11 The approaches include\n\nstreamlined database of adaptation options implemented at different scales in space and time is needed. Information on\n\nworking to limit current institutional constraints to effective\n\nthe adaptation actions, how effective they were, what they\n\nadaptation, funding pilot projects, providing useful and usable adaptation information \u00ad including disseminating best\n\ncost, and how monitoring and evaluation were conducted should be part of the aggregated information.11,20,31\n\npractices and helping develop tools and techniques to evaluate\n\nsuccessful adaptation.\n\n\u00b7 Adaptation and Mitigation Interactions: Research and analy-\n\nsis on the growing and competing demands for land, water,\n\nDespite emerging efforts, the pace and extent of adaptation activities are not proportional to the risks to people, property,\n\nand energy and how mitigation actions could affect adaptation options, and vice versa.4,27,81,148\n\ninfrastructure, and ecosystems from climate change;\n\nimportant opportunities available during the normal course \u00b7 Critical Adaptation Thresholds: Research to identify critical\n\nof planning and management of resources are also being\n\nthresholds beyond which social and/or ecological systems\n\noverlooked. A number of state and local governments are\n\nare unable to adapt to climate change. This should include\n\nengaging in adaptation planning, but most have not taken action to implement the plans.107 Some companies in the\n\nanalyzing historical and geological records to develop models of \"breakpoints\".2,31,149\n\nprivate sector and numerous non-governmental organizations\n\nhave also taken early action, particularly in capitalizing on the \u00b7 Adaptation to Extreme Events: Research on preparedness\n\nopportunities associated with facilitating adaptive actions.\n\nand response to extreme events such as droughts, floods,\n\nActions and collaborations have occurred across all scales. At\n\nintense storms, and heat waves in order to protect people,\n\nthe same time, barriers to effective implementation continue\n\necosystems, and infrastructure. Increased attention must be\n\nto exist (see Section 2).\n\npaid to how extreme events and variability may change as\n\nOne of the overarching key areas of focus for global change\n\nclimate change proceeds, and how that affects adaptation actions.11,150\n\nresearch is enabling research and development to advance\n\nadaptation across scales, sectors, and disciplines. This includes Effective adaptation will require ongoing, flexible, transpar-\n\nsocial science research for overcoming the barriers identified ent, inclusive, and iterative decision-making processes, col-\n\nin Section 2, such as strategies that foster coordination, better laboration across scales of government and sectors, and the\n\ncommunication, and knowledge sharing amongst fragmented continual exchange of best practices and lessons learned. All\n\ngoverning structures and stakeholders. Research on the stakeholders have a critical role to play in ensuring the pre-\n\nkinds of information that users desire and how to deliver that paredness of our society to extreme events and long-term\n\ninformation in contextually appropriate ways and research on changes in climate.\n\nSection 4: Case Studies\n\nIllustrative Case One: National Integrated Drought Information System\nNIDIS (National Integrated Drought Information System), and research organizations to advance a warning system for originally proposed by the Western Governors' Association drought-sensitive areas. (WGA) and established by Congress in 2006,151 is a federallycreated entity that improves the nation's capacity to The creation of NIDIS involved many years of development and proactively manage drought-related risks across sectors, coordination among federal, state, local, regional, and tribal regions, and jurisdictions. It was created by Congress to partners with the help of Governors' associations and Senate \"enable the Nation to move from a reactive to a more and Congressional leaders. NIDIS provides: 1) drought early proactive approach to managing drought risks and impacts.\" warning information systems with regional detail concerning NIDIS has successfully brought together government partners onset and severity; 2) a web-based portal (www.drought.gov);\n\n687\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f28: ADAPTATION\n\n3) coordination of federal research in support of and use of these systems; and 4) leveraging of existing partnerships and of forecasting and assessment programs. NIDIS currently supports work on water supply and demand, wildfire risk assessment and management, and agriculture. Regional drought early warning system pilot projects have been established to illustrate the benefits of improved knowledge management, improved use of existing and new information products, and coordination and capacity development for early warning systems. These prototype systems are in the Upper Colorado Basin, the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River Basin in the Southeast, the Four Corners region in the Southwest, and California. The NIDIS Outlook in the Upper Colorado Basin provides early warning information every week, for example, that is utilized by a variety of users from federal agencies, water resource management, and the recreation industry.\nThe Western Governors' Association, the U.S. Congress, and others have formally acknowledged that NIDIS provides a successful example of achieving effective federal-state partnerships by engaging both leadership and the public, and establishing an authoritative basis for integrating monitoring and research to support risk management. Some of NIDIS's keys to success include:\n\nimpact assessments for decision support. A key aspect of NIDIS is the development of an ongoing regional outlook forum based on the above information to build awareness of the drought hazard and to embed information in planning and practice (in partnership with the National Drought Mitigation Center, the Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA), and other research-based boundary organizations) to reduce risks and impacts associated with drought.\n\u00b7 Leadership and Champions: NIDIS supporters worked at all levels over more than two decades (1990s and 2000s) to establish the NIDIS Act, including political groups (WGA, Southern Governors' Association, National Governors Association, and U.S. Senators and Representatives), scientific leaders, and federal agencies (NOAA, USDA, DOI).\n\u00b7 Risk Perceptions: Whereas drought had been considered primarily a western issue in previous decades, drought is now regularly affecting the southern, southeastern, and northeastern parts of the country and response strategies are needed. During the 2012 drought, more than 63% of the contiguous U.S. by the end of July was classified as experiencing moderate to exceptional drought, and more than 3,200 heat records were broken in June 2012 alone.152\n\n\u00b7 Usable Technology and Information for Decision Support: The production of the U.S. Drought Monitor map, which integrates multiple indicators and indices from many data sources, was developed before NIDIS was established and has become a useful visual decision support tool for monitoring and characterizing drought onset, severity, and persistence. NIDIS has engaged regional and local experts in refining the regional details of this national product and in \"ground truthing\" maps via email discussions and webinars (Figure 28.5).\n\nU.S. Drought Monitor August 14, 2012\n\n\u00b7 Financial Assistance: Federal funding was allocated to NOAA specifically for NIDIS, but leveraged in kind by other agencies and partners.\n\n\u00b7 Institutional/Partnerships: Effective collaborations, partnerships, and coordination with NOAA, WGA, USDA, DOI, and USGS as well as local, regional, state, and tribal partners and with the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, have led to multi-institutional \"buy-in.\"\n\n\u00b7 Institutional/Policy: The NIDIS Act was oriented toward the improvement of coordination across federal agencies and with regional organizations, universities, and states. It focused on the application of technology, including the Internet, and on\n\nFigure 28.5. U.S. Drought Monitor Map accessed on August 20, 2012.

Northwoods Climate Change Response Framework Region (Figure Source: USDA Forest Service 2012159).\n\nA \"menu\" of adaptation strategies and approaches for planning, implementing, and monitoring adaptation activities was synthesized into an adaptation workbook from a broad set of literature and refined based on feedback from regional scientists and managers.163\n3. A series of adaptation demonstrations was initiated to show-\n\ncase ground-level implementation. The Framework and\n\nadaptation workbook provide a common process shared\n\nby diverse landowners and a formal network that supports\n\n689\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f28: ADAPTATION\n\ncross-boundary discussion about different management objectives, ecosystems, and associated adaptation tactics.\n\n\u00b7 Acknowledge and work with uncertainty, rather than submit to \"uncertainty paralysis.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, the Framework has taken an adaptive management approach in its adaptation planning and projects. Lessons learned include:\n\n\u00b7 Recognize the necessity of effective communication among people with different goals, disciplinary backgrounds, vocabulary, and perspectives on uncertainty.\n\n\u00b7 Define the purpose and scope of the Framework and its components early, but allow for refinement to take advantage of new opportunities.\n\n\u00b7 Integrate the ecological and socioeconomic dimensions early by emphasizing the many ways that communities value and depend on forests.\n\n\u00b7 Begin projects with a synthesis of existing information to avoid duplicating efforts.\n\n\u00b7 Use technology to increase efficiency of internal communication and collaboration, as well as outreach.\n\n\u00b7 Plan for the extra time necessary to implement true collaboration.\n\u00b7 Carefully match the skills, commitment, and capacity of people and organizations to project tasks.\n\u00b7 Maintain an atmosphere of trust, positivity, and sense of adventure, rather than dwelling on failures.\n\nThe Framework brings scientists and land managers together to assess the vulnerability of ecosystems based on scientific information and experience in order to plan adaptation actions that meet management goals. On-the-ground implementation has just begun, and an increased focus on demonstrations, monitoring, and evaluation will inform future adaptation efforts.\n\nIllustrative Case Four: Transportation, Land Use, and Climate Change \u00ad Integrating\n\nClimate Adaptation and Mitigation in Cape Cod, Massachusetts\n\nCape Cod, Massachusetts, a region of scenic beauty and Once the preliminary scenarios were developed, a workshop\n\nenvironmental significance, is currently affected by sea level was convened in which community and transportation\n\nrise, coastal erosion, and localized flooding \u00ad impacts that are planners, environmental managers, and Cape Cod National likely to be exacerbated by climate change.164,165 To address Seashore stakeholders selected areas for development and\n\nthese concerns and help meet the state's greenhouse gas (GHG) transit improvements to accommodate new growth while\n\nreduction target (25% reduction based on 1990 levels by 2020), meeting the goals of reduced heat-trapping gas emissions,\n\nthe U.S. Department of Transportation's Volpe Center worked increased resilience to climate change, and the conservation with federal, regional, state, and local stakeholders to integrate of natural systems.165 Through interactive visualization tools,\n\nclimate change into existing and future transportation, land- participants were able to see in real-time the impacts of\n\nuse, coastal zone, and hazard mitigation planning through an their siting decisions, allowing them to evaluate synergies\n\ninitiative called the Transportation, Land Use, and Climate and potential tradeoffs of their choices and to highlight areas\n\nChange Pilot Project.164,166\n\nwhere conflict could or already does exist, such as increasing\n\ndensity of development in areas already or likely to be The process was initiated through an expert elicitation held vulnerable to climate change.168 As a result, the stakeholders\n\nin mid-2010 to identify areas on Cape Cod that are or could developed a refined transportation and land-use scenario\n\npotentially be vulnerable to sea level rise, flooding, and that will support the region's long-range transportation\n\nerosion.

An in-person meeting was held in Washington, D.C., in June 2012. Meeting discussions were followed by expert deliberation of draft key messages by the authors and targeted consultation with additional experts by the lead author of each key message. Consensus was reached on all key messages and supporting text.\nKey message #1 Traceable Account\nSubstantial adaptation planning is occurring in the public and private sectors and at all levels of government; however, few measures have been implemented and those that have appear to be incremental changes.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the peer-reviewed literature as well as the more than 130 technical inputs received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nNumerous peer-reviewed publications indicate that a growing number of sectors, governments at all scales, and private and non-governmental actors are starting to undertake adaptation activity.9,13 Much of this activity is focused on planning with little literature documenting implementation of activities.8,11,82 Supporting this statement is also plentiful literature that profiles barriers or constraints that are impeding the advancement of adaptation activity across sectors, scales, and regions.42,68\nAdditional citations are used in the text of the chapter to substantiate this key message.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties n/a\n\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence n/a\nKey message #2 Traceable Account\nBarriers to implementation of adaptation include limited funding, policy and legal impediments, and difficulty in anticipating climate-related changes at local scales.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the peer reviewed literature as well as the more than 130 technical inputs received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input. A significant quantity of reviewed literature profiles barriers or constraints that are impeding the advancement of adaptation activity across sectors, scales, and regions.11,20,42,68\nNumerous peer-reviewed documents describe adaptation barriers (see Table 28.6). Moreover, additional citations are used in the text of the chapter to substantiate this key message.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties n/a\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence n/a\nKey message #3 Traceable Account\nThere is no \"one-size fits all\" adaptation, but there are similarities in approaches across regions and sectors. Sharing best practices, learning by doing, and iterative and collaborative processes including stakeholder involvement, can help support progress.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the peer-reviewed literature as well as the more than 130 technical inputs received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\n\n704\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f28: ADAPTATION Traceable Accounts\n\nLiterature submitted for this assessment, as well as additional literature reviewed by the author team, fully supports the concept that adaptations will ultimately need to be selected for their local applicability based on impacts, timing, political structure, finances, and other criteria.11,90 Similarities do exist in the types of adaptation being implemented, although nuanced differences do make most adaptation uniquely appropriate for the specific implementer. The selection of locally and context-appropriate adaptations is enhanced by iterative and collaborative processes in which stakeholders directly engage with decision-makers and information providers.11,20,28 While there are no \"one-size fits all\" adaptation strategies, evidence to date supports the message that the sharing of best practices and lessons learned are greatly aiding in adaptation progress across sectors, systems, and governance systems.82,86\nAdditional citations are used in the text of the chapter to substantiate this key message.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties\nn/a\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence\nn/a\nKey message #4 Traceable Account\nClimate change adaptation actions often fulfill other societal goals, such as sustainable development, disaster risk reduction, or improvements in quality of life, and can therefore be incorporated into existing decision-making processes.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the peer-reviewed literature as well as the more than 130 technical inputs received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nLiterature submitted for this assessment, as well as additional literature reviewed by the author team, supports the message that a significant amount of activity that has climate adaptation value is initiated for reasons other than climate preparedness and/or has other co-benefits in addition to increasing preparedness to climate and weather impacts.11,20,82,86,116 In recognition of this and other factors, a movement has emerged encouraging the integration of climate change considerations into existing decision-making and planning processes (i.e., mainstreaming).5,11,40 The case studies discussed in the chapter amplify this point.\nAdditional citations are used in the text of the chapter to substantiate this key message.\n\nNew information and remaining uncertainties n/a\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence n/a\nKey message #5 Traceable Account\nVulnerability to climate change is exacerbated by other stresses such as pollution, habitat fragmentation, and poverty. Adaptation to multiple stresses requires assessment of the composite threats as well as tradeoffs amongst costs, benefits, and risks of available options.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the peer-reviewed literature as well as the more than 130 technical inputs received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nClimate change is only one of a multitude of stresses affecting social, environmental, and economic systems. Activity to date and literature profiling those activities support the need for climate adaptation activity to integrate the concerns of multiple stresses in decision-making and planning.16,17,32 As evidenced by activities to date, integrating multiple stresses into climate adaptation decision-making and vice versa will require the assessment of tradeoffs amongst costs, benefits, the risks of available options, and the potential value of outcomes.5,90,111\nAdditional citations are used in the text of the chapter to substantiate this key message.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties n/a\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence n/a\nKey message #6 Traceable Account\nThe effectiveness of climate change adaptation has seldom been evaluated, because actions have only recently been initiated and comprehensive evaluation metrics do not yet exist.\nDescription of evidence base The key message and supporting text summarize extensive evidence documented in the peer-reviewed literature as well as the more than 130 technical inputs received and reviewed as part of the Federal Register Notice solicitation for public input.\nNumerous peer-reviewed publications indicate that no comprehensive adaptation evaluation metrics exist, meaning that no substantial body of literature or guidance materials\n\n705\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fexist on how to thoroughly evaluate the success of adaptation activities.11,81,110 This is an emerging area of research. A challenge of creating adaptation evaluation metrics is the growing interest in mainstreaming; this means that separating out adaptation activities from other activities could prove difficult.\nAdditional citations are used in the text of the chapter to substantiate this key message.\nNew information and remaining uncertainties n/a\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence n/a\n\n28: ADAPTATION Traceable Accounts\n\n706\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fClimate Change Impacts in the United States\nCHAPTER 29\nRESEARCH NEEDS FOR CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE ASSESSMENTS\nConvening Lead Authors\nRobert W.

RESEARCH NEEDS FOR CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE ASSESSMENTS\n\nResearch Goals\n\nResearch Goal 1: Improve understanding of the climate system and its drivers\n\nResearch investments across a broad range of disciplines are critically important to building understanding of, and in some cases reducing uncertainties related to, the physical and human-induced processes that govern the evolution of the climate system. This assessment demonstrates the continued need for high quality data and observations, analysis of Earth system processes and changes, and modeling that increases understanding and projections of climate change across scales. Social science research is also essential to improved understanding and modeling of the drivers of climate change, such as energy use and land-use change, as well as understanding impacts (see Research Goal 2). Assessing a changing climate requires understanding the role of feedbacks, thresholds, extreme events, and abrupt changes and exploring a range of scenarios (see Cross-Cutting Research Capabilities section) that drive changes in the climate system.\nThis assessment reveals several research needs including:\n\u00b7 Continue efforts to improve the understanding, modeling, and projections of climate changes, especially at the regional scale, including driving forces of emissions and land-use change, changes in temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, groundwater, evapo-\n\ntranspiration, permafrost, ice and snow cover, sea level change, and ocean processes and chemistry;\n\u00b7 Improve characterization of important sources of uncertainty, including feedbacks and possible thresholds in the climate system associated with changes in clouds, land and sea ice, aerosols (tiny particles in the atmosphere), greenhouse gases, land use and land cover, emissions scenarios, and ocean dynamics;\n\u00b7 Develop indicators that allow for timely reporting and enhanced public understanding of climate changes and that allow anticipation and attribution of changes, including abrupt changes and extreme events in the context of a changing climate; and\n\u00b7 Advance understanding of the interactions of climate change and natural variability at multiple time scales, including seasonal to decadal changes (and consideration of climate oscillations including the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the North Atlantic Oscillation), and extreme events (such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods).\n\nResearch Goal 2: Improve understanding of climate impacts and vulnerability\n\nAssessing the implications of climate change for the U.S. re-\n\ncomparative studies of alternative response options; so-\n\nlies not just on studies of the threats associated with changing\n\ncial science research focused on impacts; and the use of\n\nweather patterns due to climate change and emerging chronic\n\ngeospatial data systems;\n\nstresses such as sea level rise, but also on studies of who or\n\nwhat is exposed and sensitive to those threats, their underly- \u00b7 Assess the impacts of climatic extremes, high-end tem-\n\ning vulnerability, the associated costs, and adaptive capacity.\n\nperature scenarios, and abrupt climate change on eco-\n\nThe detailed sectoral and regional chapters of this assessment\n\nsystems, health, food, water, energy, infrastructure, and\n\nshow that considerable progress has been made in under-\n\nother critical sectors, and improve modeling capabilities\n\nstanding the extent to which natural and human systems in the\n\nto better project and understand the vulnerability and\n\nU.S. are vulnerable to climate change and how these vulner-\n\nresilience of human systems and ecosystems to climate\n\nabilities combine with climatic trends and exposures to create\n\nchange and other stresses such as land-use change and\n\nimpacts, but there is still a need to build capacity for assessing\n\npollution;\n\nvulnerability.\n\n\u00b7 Increase the understanding of how climate uncertainties\n\nThis assessment suggests related research goals and activities\n\ncombine with socioeconomic and ecological uncertain-\n\nincluding:\n\nties and identify improved ways to communicate the com-\n\nbined outcomes;\n\n\u00b7 Maintain and enhance research and development of\n\ndata collection and analyses to monitor and attribute \u00b7 Develop measurement tools and valuation methods\n\nongoing and emerging climate impacts across the United\n\nfor documenting the economic consequences of climate\n\nStates, including changes in ecosystems, pests and patho-\n\nchanges;\n\ngens, disaster losses, water resources, oceans, and social,\n\nurban, and economic systems. Priorities include ensuring \u00b7 Expand climate impact analyses to focus on understud-\n\nenhanced geographic coverage of impacts research; the\n\nied but significant economic sectors such as natural re-\n\nassessment of economic costs and benefits, as well as\n\nsources and energy development (for example, mining,\n\n710\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f29.

These include research on adaptation processes, adaptive capacity, adaptation option identification, implementation and evaluation, and adaptive management of risks and opportunities.\nImportant needs include research on the limits to, timing of, and tradeoffs in adaptation, and understanding of how adaptation interacts with mitigation activities, other stresses, and broader sustainability issues.\nThis assessment suggests research activities to:\n\n\u00b7 Identify the best practices for adaptation planning, implementation, and evaluation across federal, state, and local agencies, tribal entities, private firms, non-governmental organizations, and local communities. This requires the rigorous and comparative analysis of the effectiveness of iterative risk management, adaptation strategies and decision support tools (for example, in terms of stakeholder views, institutional structures including regional centers and multi-agency programs, cost/benefit, assessment against stated goals or social and ecological indicators, model validation, and use of relevant information, including traditional knowledge); and\n\u00b7 Understand the institutional and behavioral barriers to adaptation and how to overcome them, including revisions to legal codes, building and infrastructure standards, urban planning, and policy practices.\n\nResearch Goal 4: Identify the mitigation options that reduce the risk of longer-term climate change\n\nThe severity of climate change impacts in the U.S. and the to reduce GHG emissions and identified important research need for adapting to them over the longer term will depend needs, including the need to study the feasibility, costs, and\n\non the success of efforts to reduce or sequester heat-trapping consequences of different mitigation options. In addition, the\n\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, particularly those associated report recommended research to support new technologies\n\nwith the burning of fossil fuels but also those associated with and the effective deployment of existing options, research into\n\nchanges in land use. Managing the consequences of climate how best to monitor emissions and adherence to international\n\nchange over this century depends on reducing concentrations of greenhouse gases, including short-lived climate pollutants such as black carbon (soot).\n\npolicies, and research into how human behavior and institutions enable mitigation.3\n\nThis Third National Climate Assessment also suggests research While such efforts are necessarily worldwide, the U.S. pro- activities to:\n\nduces a significant share of global greenhouse gases and can assist and influence other countries to reduce their emissions.\n\n\u00b7 Develop information that supports analysis of new\n\nAssessments can play a significant role in providing a better information base from which to analyze mitigation options.\n\ntechnologies for energy production and use, carbon capture and storage, agricultural and land-use prac-\n\ntices, and other technologies that could reduce or\n\nTherefore, the mitigation section of this assessment (Ch. 27:\n\noffset greenhouse gas emissions; research into the\n\nMitigation) noted the importance of research to understand\n\npolicy mechanisms that could be used to foster their\n\nand develop emission reductions through: 1) identifying cli-\n\ndevelopment and implementation; analyses of the\n\nmate and global change scenarios and their impacts; 2) pro-\n\ncosts, benefits, tradeoffs, and synergies associated\n\nviding a range of options for reducing the risks to climate and\n\nwith different actions and combinations of actions;\n\nglobal change; and 3) developing options that allow joint mitigation-adaptation strategies, such as buildings that are more\n\nand improved understanding of the potential and risks of geoengineering;\n\nenergy efficient and resilient to climate change impacts.\n\n\u00b7 Investigate the co-benefits, interactions, feedbacks,\n\nMore generally, the America's Climate Choices report on Limiting the Magnitude of Climate Change3 recommended that the\nU.S. promptly develop and implement appropriate strategies\n\nand tradeoffs between adaptation and mitigation at the local and regional level, for example, in sectors such as agriculture, forestry, energy, health, and\n\n711\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f29. RESEARCH NEEDS FOR CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE ASSESSMENTS\n\nthe built environment. This involves, as a priority, the assessment of the economics of impacts, mitigation, and adaptation;\n\u00b7 Improve understanding of the effectiveness and timescales of mitigation measures through deepened understanding of the relationship between the fate of human-induced and natural carbon emissions,\n\nuptake by the terrestrial biosphere and oceans, and atmospheric concentrations; and\n\u00b7 Identify the critical social, cultural, institutional, economic, and behavioral processes that present barriers and opportunities for mitigation at the federal and international levels and by individuals, state and local governments, and corporations.\n\nResearch Goal 5: Improve decision support and integrated assessment\n\nFor assessments to be useful to policy makers, they need to\n\napproaches that support adaptation and mitigation\n\nprovide integrated results that can be used in decision-making.\n\nefforts in the context of a changing climate;\n\nResearch can develop tools that facilitate decision-making and the integration of knowledge.\n\n\u00b7 Develop tools to support risk-based decision pro-\n\ncesses, including tools to identify risk management\n\nCritical gaps in knowledge for decision support include the issues that affect the capacity of agencies, individuals, and communities to access and use the best available scientific infor-\n\ninformation needs, develop transferable vulnerability assessment techniques, and evaluate alternative adaptation options. In addition, tools are needed\n\nmation in support of decision-making, including the need to\n\nto improve understanding of consumption patterns\n\nassess the ability of existing institutions, legal, and regulatory\n\nand environmental consequences; effective resource\n\nstructures to respond to highly interdependent climate impacts. There are instances where policy barriers, institutional\n\nmanagement institutions; iterative risk management strategies; and social learning, cognition, and adap-\n\ncapacity or structure, or conflicting laws and regulations can create barriers to effective decisions. For instance, Chapter 12 (Indigenous Peoples) notes that there is no institutional frame-\n\ntive processes; \u00b7 Improve, fill gaps, and enhance research efforts to\n\nwork for addressing village relocation in response to climate change in Alaska,7 and Chapter 3 (Water) points out that exist-\n\nevaluate the effectiveness, costs, and benefits of mitigation and adaptation actions, including eco-\n\ning water management institutions may be inadequate in the\n\nnomic and non-economic metrics that evaluate the\n\ncontext of rapidly changing conditions. These instances point\n\ncosts of action, inaction, and residual impacts.

RESEARCH NEEDS FOR CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE ASSESSMENTS\n\nFoundational Cross-Cutting Research Capabilities to Support Future Climate Assessments\n\nThis assessment identifies a set of five foundational cross-cutting research capabilities that are essential for advancing our ability to continue to conduct climate and global change assessments and for addressing the five research goals.\n\n1. Integrate natural and social sciences, engineering, and other disciplinary approaches\n\nContinued advances in comprehensive and useful climate assessments will rely on additional interdisciplinary research. Understanding of the coupled human-environment system is enriched by combining research from natural and social sciences with research and experience from the engineering, law, and business professions.\nBecause human activities and decisions are influencing many Earth system processes, models and observations of natural and social changes at planetary, regional, and local scales are needed to understand how climate is changing, its impacts on people and environments, and how human responses feedback on the Earth system.\nBuilding experienced interdisciplinary research teams that are able to understand each other's theories, methods, and language as well as the needs of stakeholders will allow for more rapid and effective assessments.\n\nInterdisciplinary research is needed, for example, to:\n\u00b7 Understand how hydrological drivers of water supply interact with changing patterns of water demand and evolving water management practices to increase risks of drought, or influence the effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options;\n\u00b7 Understand climate change in the context of multiple stresses on Earth, ecological, and human systems;\n\u00b7 Bring together economic and quantitative assessment of climate impacts and policies with other more qualitative assessments that include non-market and cultural values; and\n\u00b7 Integrate the understanding of human behavior, engineering, and genomics to expand the range of choice in responding to climate change by providing and thoroughly evaluating new options for adaption and mitigation that improve economic development, energy, health, and food security.\n\n2. Ensure availability of observations, monitoring, and infrastructure for critical data collection and analysis\n\nOur understanding and ability to assess changes in climate and other global processes is based on a comprehensive and sustained system of observations that document the history of climate, socioeconomic, and related changes at spatial and time scales relevant to global, regional, and sectoral needs. The most recent USGCRP Strategic Plan5 states that to advance scientific knowledge of an integrated natural and human Earth system, an interoperable and integrated observational, monitoring, and data access capability is also essential. This observational capability is needed to gain the fundamental scientific understanding of essential status, trends, variability, and changes in the Earth system. It should include the physical, chemical, biological, and human components of the Earth system over multiple space and time scales.\nTo attain their full value, observational systems must provide data that are responsive to the needs of decision-makers in government, industry, and society. These needs include observations and data that can inform the nation's strategies to respond to climate and global change, including, for example, efforts to limit emissions, monitor public health, capture and store carbon, monitor changes in ocean processes, and implement adaptation strategies. This will require establishing explicit baseline conditions, specifying spatial detail and\n\ntemporal frequency of observations, including social data, and setting standards for metadata (information about collected data), interoperability, and regulatory and voluntary reporting, such as those outlined in the Informing an Effective Response to Climate Change Panel Report of the National Research Council's Americas Climate Choices series.8 These data need to be openly and widely available in order to support the best and most comprehensive science and for use in decision-making by a range of stakeholders.\nThis assessment shows that enhanced research and development will be necessary to ensure that the scope and integration of relevant scientific data improves overall utility for decisionmakers, including better ways to communicate metadata, data quality, and uncertainties. The observations must include critical geophysical variables such as temperature, precipitation, sea level changes, ocean circulation, atmospheric composition, and hydrology; the essential parameters that describe the biosphere; and social science information on drivers, impacts, and responses to climate and other global changes. More comprehensive and integrated data capabilities are needed to document the processes and patterns that drive natural and social feedbacks and better describe the mechanisms of abrupt change. Progress is needed in particular for data-poor regions,\n\n713\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f29. RESEARCH NEEDS FOR CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE ASSESSMENTS\n\nfocusing on inadequately documented socioeconomic, ecolog- \u00b7 Better integrate observations and modeling to advance\n\nical, and health-related factors, and under-observed regional\n\nscientific understanding about past, present, and future\n\nand sectoral data. There are opportunities to take advantage\n\nclimate within government, industry, and civil society; and\n\nof citizen science observations where appropriate; monitor\n\nsystem resilience and robustness; and attend to physical and \u00b7 Develop more fully the components and structure of a\n\nsocial systems that are not currently observed with sufficient\n\nnational climate and global change indicator system to\n\ntemporal or spatial resolution to enable vulnerability analysis\n\nsupport assessment that includes indicators of climate\n\nand decision support at regional and sectoral scales. More ex-\n\nchange, impacts, vulnerabilities, opportunities, and pre-\n\nplicitly, strategic integration of our nation's observations, mon-\n\nparedness as well as trends and changes in land use, air\n\nitoring, and data capabilities should be considered in order to:\n\nand water pollution, water supply and demand, extreme\n\nevents, diseases, public health, and agronomic data,\n\n\u00b7 Sustain and integrate the nation's capacity to observe\n\ncoastal and ocean conditions (such as marine ecosystem\n\nlong-term changes in the Earth system and improve\n\nhealth, ocean acidity, sea level, and salinity), cryosphere\n\nfundamental understanding of the complex causes and\n\ndata (such as snow, sea ice conditions, ice sheets and gla-\n\nconsequences of global change, including integration of\n\ncier melt rates), and changes in public attitudes and un-\n\nessential socioeconomic, health, and ecological observa-\n\nderstanding of climate change. All of these are important\n\ntions;\n\nto assessing climate change, and should eventually be bet-\n\nter coordinated at local, as well as national and regional\n\n\u00b7 Maintain and enhance advanced modeling capability,\n\nlevels in collaboration with local agencies.\n\nincluding high-performance computing infrastructure,\n\nimprovements in analysis of large and complex data sets,\n\ncomprehensive Earth system and integrated assessment\n\nmodels, reanalysis, verification, and model comparisons;\n\n3. Build capacity for climate assessment through training, education, and workforce development\n\nBuilding human capacity for improved assessments requires expansion of skills within the existing public and private sectors and developing a much larger workforce that excels at critical and interdisciplinary thinking. Useful capacities include the ability to facilitate and communicate research and practice, manage collaborative processes to allow for imaginative analysis and solutions, develop sustainable technologies to reduce climate risks, and build tools for decision-making in an internationally interdependent world.\nA deeper understanding of the processes and impacts of climate change, disaster risk reduction, energy policy impacts, ecosystem services and biodiversity, poverty reduction, food security, and sustainable consumption requires new approaches to training and curriculum, as well as research to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches to research and teaching.\n\nAssessments will benefit from activities that:\n\u00b7 Strengthen approaches to education about climate, impacts, and responses including developing and evaluating the best ways to educate in the fields of science (natural and social), technology, engineering, and mathematics and related fields of study (such as business, law, medicine, and other relevant professional disciplines). Ideally, such training would include a deeper understanding of the climate system, natural resources, adaptation and energy policy options, and economic sustainability, and would build capacity at colleges and institutions, including minority institutions such as tribal colleges; and\n\u00b7 Identify increasingly effective approaches to developing a more climate-informed society that understands and can participate in assessments, including alternative media and methods for communication; this could also include a program to certify climate interpreters to actively assist decision-makers and policymakers to understand and use climate scenarios.8\n\n714\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f29. RESEARCH NEEDS FOR CLIMATE AND GLOBAL CHANGE ASSESSMENTS\n\n4. Enhance the development and use of scenarios\n\nScenarios are \"coherent, internally consistent and plausible descriptions of possible future states of the world\"9 that provide reasoned projections of energy and land use, future population levels, economic activity, the structure of governance, social values, and patterns of technological change. They survey, integrate, and synthesize science, within and among scientific disciplines and across sectors and regions. Such scenarios are essential tools that enable projections of emissions, climate, vulnerabilities, and global change. They are indispensable for linking science and decision-making and for assessing choices about America's climate future.\nStakeholders and scientists within this assessment identified a need for more fully developed scenario-building capabilities that better enable assessments at regional and sectoral scales in timeframes of relevance to policy and decision-making and that more effectively reflect climate and global change at these scales.\n\nAchieving capacity in scenario development will:\n\u00b7 Enhance understanding of how and why climate may change and its implications, especially at the regional scale. For example, a set of scenarios can be used to better understand the way energy, land use, and policy choices create alternative emissions pathways; how changes at global scales can be downscaled to estimate local climate possibilities; how various socioeconomic development pathways increase or decrease climate vulnerability; and to assess alternative strategies for reducing emissions and implementing adaptation; and\n\u00b7 Develop new methods, tools, and skills for applying scenarios to policy development at local levels in order to broaden society's understanding of a changing climate and to analyze the full range of policy choices. In addition, improve capabilities in integrated assessment modeling to inform policy analysis and allow stakeholders to co-produce information and explore options for local and national decisions.\n\n5. Promote international research and collaboration\n\nResearch efforts in support of climate assessment are very dependent on the international research community. International teams conduct Earth system monitoring and analysis using observing systems that cannot be funded and maintained by any one country alone. Many of the impacts of climate change in the U.S. are closely linked to how climate affects other parts of the world. There is general understanding that impacts of climate change on U.S. socioeconomic systems are mediated or amplified through globally connected commodity chains and prices; more detailed research on climate change and its impacts elsewhere is needed to provide accurate assessments of what could happen to U.S. regional and local economies. The U.S. has the capacity to leverage investments in collaborative international climate and global change scientific research efforts, examples of which include IGBP (International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme), WCRP (World Climate Research Programme), DIVERSITAS (an international program of biodiversity science), IHDP (International Human Dimensions Programme) (as they evolve into or in affiliation\n\nwith the new Future Earth program), and IGFA (International Group of Funding Agencies for Global Change Research).\nSupporting international collaborative research will:\n\u00b7 Contribute to international systems of data collection, monitoring, indicators, and modeling that closely track and project changes in Earth system dynamics, climate, human drivers, and climate impacts that are needed for national and international assessments;\n\u00b7 Assess the implications of climate change for globally shared common resources such as the oceans, polar regions, and migratory species; and\n\u00b7 Fill important gaps in understanding of how climate change in other countries affects U.S. food, energy, health, manufacturing, and national security.\n\n715\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f29.

Since 1990, when Congress authorized the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) through the Global Change Research Act1 and required periodic updates on climate science and its implications, researchers from many fields have observed significant climate change impacts in every region of the United States. The accelerating pace of these changes (for example, the recent rapid reductions observed in the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice), as well as scenariobased projections for future climate changes and effects, is articulated in this third NCA.\nBased on recommendations stemming from the National Research Council (NRC), USGCRP in its most recent strategic plan2 identified the rationale and benefits of implementing a sustained assessment process. In response, a vision for a new approach to assessments took shape as the third NCA report was being prepared. The vision includes an ongoing process of working to understand and evaluate the nation's vulnerabilities to climate variability and change and its capacity to respond. A sustained assessment, in addition to producing quadrennial assessment reports as required by law, recognizes that the ability to understand, predict, assess, and respond to rapid changes in the global environment requires ongoing efforts to integrate new knowledge and experience. It accomplishes this by: 1) advancing the science needed to improve the assessment process and its outcomes, building associated foundational knowledge, and collecting relevant data; 2) developing targeted scientific reports and other products that respond directly to the needs of federal agencies, state and local governments, tribes, other decision-makers, and end users; 3) creating a framework for continued interactions between the assessment partners and stakeholders and the scientific community; and 4) supporting the capacity of those engaged in assessment activities to maintain such interactions.\n\nTo provide decision-makers with more timely, concise, and useful information, a sustained assessment process would include both ongoing, extensive engagement with public and private partners and targeted, scientifically rigorous reports that address concerns in a timely fashion. A growing body of assessment literature has guided and informed the development of this approach to a sustained assessment.3,4,5\nThe envisioned sustained assessment process includes continuing and expanding engagement with scientists and other professionals from government, academia, business, and nongovernmental organizations. These partnerships broaden the knowledge base from which conclusions can be drawn. In addition, sustained engagement with decision-makers and end users helps scientists understand what information society wants and needs, and it provides mechanisms for researchers to receive ongoing feedback on the utility of the tools and data they provide.\nAn ongoing process that supports these forms of outreach and engagement allows for more comprehensive and insightful evaluation of climate changes across the nation, including how decision-makers and end users are responding to these changes. The most thoughtful and robust responses to climate change can be made only when these complex issues, including the underlying science and its many implications for the nation, are documented and communicated in a way that both scientists and non-scientists can understand.\nThis sustained assessment process will lead to better outcomes for the people of the United States by providing more relevant, comprehensible, and usable knowledge to guide decisions related to climate change at local, regional, and national scales. Additional details about the components of the sustained assessment process are provided in \"Preparing the Nation for Change: Building a Sustained National Climate Assessment Process,\" the first special report of the National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee.6\n\nContributions of a Sustained Assessment Process\n\nA sustained assessment process will not only include produc- 2.

SUSTAINED ASSESSMENT: A NEW VISION FOR FUTURE U.S. ASSESSMENTS\n\n3. Support the creation of the first integrated suite of national indicators of climate-related trends across a variety of important climate drivers and responses.\n4. Catalyze the production of targeted, in-depth special assessment reports on sectoral topics (for example, agriculture), cross-sectoral topics (for example, the connection between water and energy production), regional topics, and other topics that will help inform Americans' climate choices about mitigation and adaptation. These reports will generate new insights about climate change, its impacts, and the effectiveness of societal responses. In addition, a second report category, referred to as foundational reports, will focus on improvements to specific aspects of the process (for example, scenarios and indicators) to reinforce the foundation for the overarching, but necessarily more constrained, quadrennial assessment reports.\n5. Facilitate the creation of, support, and leverage a network of scientific, decision-maker, and user communities for extended dialog and engagement regarding climate change.\n6. Provide a systematic way to identify gaps in knowledge and uncertainties faced by the scientific community and by U.S. domestic and international partners and to assist in setting priorities for their resolution.\n7. Enhance integration with other assessment efforts such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and modeling efforts such as the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project.\n\n8. Develop and apply tools to evaluate progress and guide improvements in processes and products over time. This will support an iterative approach to managing risks and opportunities associated with changing global and national conditions.\nAssessments facilitate the collection of different kinds of information that can be integrated to yield new and useful scientific insights. The vision for the sustained assessment process is to continue to build knowledge about human and natural systems and their interactions to better understand the risks and opportunities of global change at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The sustained assessment process also can help define the range of information needs of decision-makers and end users relative to adaptation and mitigation, as well as the associated costs of impacts and benefits of response actions. Moreover, it is by its very nature a continuous process, uniquely positioned to support an iterative, risk-based approach to adaptation.\nFinally, although a sustained assessment process allows for ongoing improvements in products and processes, it also requires underlying support systems. These can include access to observational data sources, support networks, and information management systems such as the Global Change Information System (GCIS; see section on \"Data Collection, Access, and Analysis\"). Other fundamental support for assessments includes various types of integrated and vulnerability assessment models, climate model intercomparison projects, data streams (for example, emissions data and socioeconomic data), processes for building scenarios and deploying them at critical junctures in the assessment process, and evaluation approaches.\n\nAssessment Capacity\n\nScientific assessments require substantial scientific expertise\nand judgment, involving skills atypical of those required for routine research.4,5 Assessment capacity includes engaging\n\nness of assessment processes and outcomes5 and to facilitate the development of decision support tools.7 A sustained as-\nsessment provides the necessary coordination and infrastruc-\n\nknowledgeable and experienced people, developing networks ture needed to maintain an ongoing dialog among producers\n\nto promote interactions, identifying and mentoring new scien- and users of information so that decision-makers can manage\n\ntific talent, and building in-depth understanding of a variety of risks and take advantage of opportunities more efficiently.\n\neconomic, technical, and scientific topics.

SUSTAINED ASSESSMENT: A NEW VISION FOR FUTURE U.S. ASSESSMENTS\n\nquadrennial assessment reports in a more efficient and effective manner. Selecting which data to collect and analyze is a critical component of assessments of change. In addition, for certain assessment-related purposes, use of traditional knowledge may be appropriate and require different analytical approaches.\nThe sustained assessment process will facilitate the development and maintenance of a web-based assessment informa-\n\ntion discovery, access, and retrieval system that facilitates easy access to a range of information for those who need it, in a timely and authoritative manner (the GCIS of the USGCRP). A major short-term goal is to provide transparent and highlylinked access to the data used to support conclusions in the third NCA report, but this is only the first step in a much larger effort. Initially targeted audiences include assessment practitioners across various sectors and governmental levels.\n\nIndicators\nIndicators are measurements or calculations that represent impacts, and states of preparedness \u00ad to inform decisionimportant features of the status, trends, or performance of a makers and the public. In the context of ongoing assessment system (such as the economy, agriculture, natural ecosystems, activities, these indicators can be tracked to provide timely, or Arctic sea ice cover).

Mechanisms for creating and implementing a sustained process were included as key discussion points in early NCA process workshops.11 Prior to the formation of the chapter author teams, the need for a sustained assessment was described in the NCA Strategy Summary.12 The amended charter for the National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee (NCADAC) specifies that the NCADAC is \"to provide advice and recommendations toward the development of an ongoing, sustainable national assessment of global change impacts and adaptation and mitigation strategies for the Nation.\"13 To that end, the NCADAC formed a working group on sustained assessment, and the USGCRP Interagency National Climate Assessment Working Group (INCA) made this topic a priority in their regular meetings. The USGCRP also established \"conduct sustained assessments\" as one of four programmatic pillars in its recent Strategic Plan.2\n\nThe sustained assessment author team drew on a wide variety of source materials in framing the need for a sustained assessment process, including calls for sustained assessment in both previous National Climate Assessment reports14 and in several publications from the National Research Council5,9,15 that focused specifically on the National Climate Assessment. The author team also considered a rich literature on assessments in general (for example, Farrell and J\u00e4ger 2005 and Mitchell et al. 20064). In developing the chapter describing the sustained assessment process, the author team first worked with the NCADAC, especially the initial NCADAC working group on sustained assessment, and the INCA to develop a vision for sustained assessment and a list of activities required to implement this vision. They then collected feedback from each of the chapters' convening lead authors, agencies, chairs of other NCADAC working groups, and targeted stakeholders. Drawing on these comments and the knowledge bases cited above, the author team came to consensus on the objectives and categories of activities provided in the chapter through teleconference and email discussions. The NCADAC formed a new author team to produce a longer special report on the sustained assessment process. The report was completed in the late summer of 2013.6\n\n726\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\f1 APPENDIX\n\nREPORT\nDEVELOPMENT PROCESS\n\nThe National Climate Assessment (NCA) supports the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and its Strategic Plan1 in multiple ways. The Strategic Plan focuses on climate science that informs societal objectives; the USGCRP program and the NCA help build an information base to support climaterelated decisions, including decisions to reduce human contributions to future climate change, and to adapt to changes that are occurring now and are projected in the future. In order to facilitate the integration of federal science investments with\n\nacademic, public, and private sector climate change research, the Third NCA process focused on building strong relationships with stakeholders and experts outside the government. Early in the process, the National Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee (NCADAC) and NCA Coordination Office developed a strategy to engage a broad range of the American public. Open participation, communication, and feedback have been integral to the preparation of this farreaching assessment.2\n\nNCA Goal and Vision\n\nAs established by the NCADAC,3 the overarching goal of the The vision is to advance an inclusive, broad-based, and sus-\n\nNCA process is to enhance the ability of the United States to tained process for developing, assessing, and communicating\n\nanticipate, mitigate, and adapt to changes in the global envi- scientific knowledge of the impacts, risks, vulnerabilities, and\n\nronment that are increasingly linked to human activities.\n\nresponse options associated with a changing global climate,\n\nand to support informed decision-making across the United\n\nStates.\n\nLegislative Foundations\n\nThe NCA is conducted under the auspices of the Global Change Section 106 of the GCRA requires a report to the President and Research Act (GCRA) of 1990.4 The mandate for the U.S. Global the Congress every four years that integrates, evaluates, and\n\nChange Research Program as a whole is: \"To provide for devel- interprets the findings of the USGCRP; analyzes the effects of\n\nopment and coordination of a comprehensive and integrated global change on the natural environment, agriculture, energy\n\nUnited States research program which will assist the Nation production and use, land and water resources, transportation,\n\nand the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to human health and welfare, human social systems, and bio-\n\nhuman-induced and natural processes of global change.\"\n\nlogical diversity; and analyzes current trends in global change,\n\nboth human-induced and natural, and projects major trends\n\nfor the subsequent 25 to 100 years.\n\nInstitutional Foundations\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\nUSGCRP is a federation of the research components of 13 U.S. Department of Agriculture\n\nfederal departments and agencies that supports the largest U.S. Department of Commerce\n\ninvestment in climate and global change research in the world.

The TSU staff provides multiple kinds of support to the NCA, including climate science research, data management, web design, graphic design, technical and scientific writing and editing, publication production, and meeting support.\n\nThe National Climate Assessment Network (NCAnet) consists of more than 100 partner organizations that work with the NCA Coordination Office, NCADAC, report authors, and USGCRP agencies to engage producers and users of assessment information.5 Partners extend the NCA process and products to a broad audience through the development of assessmentrelated capacities and products, such as collecting and synthesizing data or other technical and scientific inputs into the NCA, disseminating NCA report findings to a wide range of users, engaging producers and users of assessment information, supporting NCA events, and producing communications materials related to the NCA and its report findings.\n\nCreating the Third NCA Report\nProcess Development The NCA Engagement Strategy provides a vision for participation, outreach, communication, and education processes that help make the NCA process and products accessible and useful to a wide variety of audiences. The overall goal of engagement is to create a more effective and successful NCA \u00ad improving the processes and products of the effort so that they are credible, salient, and legitimate and building the capacity of participants to engage in the creation and use of NCA products in decisionmaking.2 The strategy describes a number of mechanisms through which scientific and technical experts, decision-makers, and members of the general public might learn about and participate in the NCA process.\nAs part of the assessment process, a series of 14 process workshops helped establish consistent assumptions and methodologies. The resulting reports provide a consistent foundation for the technical input teams and chapter authors.\nThe NCA Coordination Office organized listening sessions, symposia, and sessions at professional society meetings during the development of the NCA report and sustained assessment process. These sessions provided updates on the NCA process, solicited broad input from subject matter experts, and collected feedback on the approach, topics, and methodologies under consideration.\n\nThird National Climate Assessment Report Process\n\nFigure 2.

These tools (collectively, Guidance on Information Quality Assurance to Chapter Authors of the National Climate Assessment: Question Tools) were approved by the NCADAC and introduced to the CLAs at workshops. They have been available on the USGCRP website since February 2012.4 The Guidance requires consideration of the following criteria for each source of information used in the Third NCA Report:\n\u00b7 Utility: Is the particular source important to the topic of your chapter?\n\u00b7 Transparency and traceability: Is the source material identifiable and publicly available?\n\u00b7 Objectivity: Why and how was the source material created?

Although climate changes in the past have been caused by natural factors, human activities are  now the dominant agents of change. Human activities are affecting climate through increasing  atmospheric levels of heat-trapping gases and other substances, including particles.\n2. Global trends in temperature and many other climate variables provide consistent evidence of a warming planet. These trends are based on a wide range of observations, analyzed by many  independent research groups around the world.\n3. Natural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o events and other recurring patterns of ocean-atmosphere   interactions, influences global and regional temperature and precipitation over timescales ranging  from months up to a decade or more.\n4. Human-induced increases in atmospheric levels of heat-trapping gases are the main cause of   observed climate change over the past 50 years. The \"fingerprints\" of human-induced change also  have been identified in many other aspects of the climate system, including changes in ocean heat  content, precipitation, atmospheric moisture, and Arctic sea ice.\n5. Past emissions of heat-trapping gases have already committed the world to a certain amount of   future climate change. How much more the climate will change depends on future emissions and the  sensitivity of the climate system to those emissions.\n6. Different kinds of physical and statistical models are used to study aspects of past climate and  develop projections of future change. No model is perfect, but many of them provide useful   information. By combining and averaging multiple models, many clear trends emerge.\n7. Scientific understanding of observed temperature changes in the United States has greatly improved,  confirming that the U.S. is warming due to heat-trapping gas emissions, consistent with the climate  change observed globally.\n8. Many other indicators of rising temperatures have been observed in the United States. These include  reduced lake ice, glacier retreat, earlier melting of snowpack, reduced lake levels, and a longer   growing season. These and other indicators are expected to continue to reflect higher temperatures.\n9. Trends in some types of extreme weather events have been observed in recent decades, consistent  with rising temperatures. These include increases in heavy precipitation nationwide, especially in  the Midwest and Northeast; heat waves, especially in the West; and the intensity of Atlantic   hurricanes. These trends are expected to continue. Research on climate change's effects on other  types of extreme events continues.\n10. Drought and fire risk are increasing in many regions as temperatures and evaporation rates rise. The  greater the future warming, the more these risks will increase, potentially affecting the entire United  States.\n\n736\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\n11. Summer Arctic sea ice extent, volume, and thickness have declined rapidly, especially north of  Alaska. Permafrost temperatures are rising and the overall amount of permafrost is shrinking.   Melting of land- and sea-based ice is expected to continue with further warming.\n12. Sea level is already rising at the global scale and at individual locations along the U.S. coast.  Future sea level rise depends on the amount of warming and ice melt around the world as well as   local processes like changes in ocean currents and local land subsidence or uplift.\n\nThis appendix provides further information and discussion on climate science beyond that presented in Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate. Like the chapter, the appendix focuses on the observations, model simulations, and other analyses that explain what is happening to climate at the national and global scales, why these changes are occurring, and how climate is projected to change throughout this century. In the appendix, however, more information is provided on attribution, spatial and temporal detail, and physical mechanisms than could be covered within the length constraints of the main chapter.\nAs noted in the main chapter, changes in climate, and the nature and causes of these changes, have been comprehensively discussed in a number of other reports, including the 2009 as-\n\nsessment: Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States1 and the global assessments produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. This appendix provides an updated discussion of global change in the first few supplemental messages, followed by messages focusing on the changes having the greatest impacts (and potential impacts) on the United States. The projections described in this appendix are based, to the extent possible, on the CMIP5 model simulations. However, given the timing of this report relative to the evolution of the CMIP5 archive, some projections are necessarily based on CMIP3 simulations. (See Supplemental Message 5 for more on these simulations and related future scenarios).\n\nSupplemental Message 1.\n\nAlthough climate changes in the past have been caused by natural factors, human activities are now the dominant agents of change. Human activities are affecting climate through increasing atmospheric levels of heat-trapping gases and other substances, including particles.\n\nThe Earth's climate has long been known to change in response to natural external forcings. These include variations in the energy received from the sun, volcanic eruptions, and changes in the Earth's orbit, which affects the distribution of sunlight across the world. The Earth's climate is also affected by factors that are internal to the climate system, which are the result of complex interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and living things (see Supplemental Message 3). These internal factors include natural modes of climate system variability, such as the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation.\nNatural changes in external forcings and internal factors have been responsible for past climate changes. At the global scale, over multiple decades, the impact of external forcings on temperature far exceeds that of internal variability (which is less than 0.5\u00b0F).2 At the regional scale, and over shorter time periods, internal variability can be responsible for much larger changes in temperature and other aspects of climate. Today, however, the picture is very different. Although natural factors still affect climate, human activities are now the primary cause of the current warming: specifically, human activities that increase atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other\n\nheat-trapping gases and various particles that, depending on the type of particle, can have either a heating or cooling influence on the atmosphere.\nThe greenhouse effect is key to understanding how human activities affect the Earth's climate. As the sun shines on the Earth, the Earth heats up. The Earth then re-radiates this heat back to space. Some gases, including water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), absorb some of the heat given off by the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. These heat-trapping gases then radiate energy back toward the surface, effectively trapping some of the heat inside the climate system. This greenhouse effect is a natural process, first recognized in 1824 by the French mathematician and physicist Joseph Fourier3 and confirmed by British scientist John Tyndall in a series of experiments starting in 1859.4 Without this natural greenhouse effect (but assuming the same albedo, or reflectivity, as today), the average surface temperature of the Earth would be about 60\u00b0F colder.\nToday, however, the natural greenhouse effect is being artificially intensified by human activities. Burning fossil fuels (coal,\n\n737\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nHuman Influence on the Greenhouse Effect\n\nFigure 1. Left: A stylized representation of the natural greenhouse effect. Most of the sun's radiation reaches the Earth's surface. Naturally occurring heat-trapping gases, including water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, do not absorb the short-wave energy from the sun but do absorb the long-wave energy re-radiated from the Earth, keeping the planet much warmer than it would be otherwise. Right: In this stylized representation of the human-intensified greenhouse effect, human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), are increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, increasing the natural greenhouse effect and thus Earth's temperature.

By 2100, additional emissions from human activities are projected to increase CO2 levels to 420 ppm under a very low scenario, which would require immediate and sharp emissions reductions (RCP 2.6), and 935 ppm under a higher scenario, which assumes continued increases in\n\nby countries under the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement designed to protect the ozone layer.

Some encourage cloud formation because they are ideal surfaces on which water vapor can condense to form cloud droplets. Some can also increase the number, but decrease the average size of cloud droplets when there is not enough water vapor compared to the number of particles available, thus creating brighter clouds that reflect energy from the sun away from the Earth, resulting in an overall cooling effect. Particles that absorb energy encourage cloud droplets to evaporate by warming the atmosphere. Depending on their type, increasing amounts of particles can either offset or increase the warming caused by increasing levels of greenhouse gases. At the scale of the planet, the net effect of these particles is to offset between 20% and 35% of the warming caused by heat-trapping gases.\n\nConsidering all known natural and human drivers of climate since 1750, a strong net warming from long-lived greenhouse gases produced by human activities dominates the recent climate record. This warming has been partially offset by increases in atmospheric particles and their effects on clouds. Two important natural external drivers also influence climate: the sun and volcanic eruptions. Since 1750, these natural external drivers are estimated to have had a small net warming influence, one that is much smaller than the human influence. Natural internal climate variations, such as El Ni\u00f1o events in\nRelative Strengths of Warming and Cooling Influences\n\nThe effects of all of these greenhouse gases and particles on the Earth's climate depend in part on how long they remain in the atmosphere. Human-induced emissions of carbon dioxide have already altered atmospheric levels in ways that will persist for thousands of years. About one-third of the carbon dioxide emitted in any given year remains in the atmosphere 100 years later. However, the impact of past human emissions of carbon dioxide on the global carbon cycle will endure for tens of thousands of years. Methane lasts for approximately a decade before it is removed through chemical reactions. Particles, on the other hand, remain in the atmosphere for only a few days to several weeks. This means that the effects of any human actions to reduce particle emissions can show results nearly immediately. It may take decades, however, before the results of human actions to reduce long-lived greenhouse gas emissions can be observed. Some recent studies17 examine various means for reducing near-term changes in climate, for example, by reducing emissions of short-lived gases like methane and particles like black carbon (soot). These approaches are being explored as ways to reduce the rate of short-term warming while more comprehensive approaches to reducing carbon dioxide emissions (and hence the rate of long-term warming) are being implemented.\nIn addition to emissions of greenhouse gases, air pollutants, and particles, human activities have also affected climate by changing the land surface. These changes include cutting and burning forests, replacing natural vegetation with agriculture or cities, and large-scale irrigation. These transformations of the land surface can alter how much heat is reflected or absorbed by the surface, causing local and even regional warming or cooling. Globally, the net effect of these changes has probably been a slight cooling influence over the past 100 years.\n\nFigure 6. Different factors have exerted a warming influence (red bars) or a cooling influence (blue bars) on the planet. The warming or cooling influence of each factor is measured in terms of the change in radiative forcing in watts per square meter by 2005 relative to 1750. This figure includes all the major human-induced factors as well as the sun, the only major natural factor with a long-term effect on climate. The cooling effect of individual volcanoes is also natural, but is relatively short-lived and so is not included here. Aerosols refer to tiny particles, with their direct effects including, for example, the warming influence of black carbon (soot) and cooling influence of sulfate particles from coal burning. Indirect effects of aerosols include their effect on clouds. The net radiative influence from natural and human influences is a strong warming, predominantly from human activities. The thin lines on each bar show the range of uncertainty. (Figure source: adapted from Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis.

Several other modes of internal natural variability have been identified, and their effects on climate are superimposed on the effects of human activities, the sun, and volcanoes.\nDuring the last three decades, direct observations indicate that the sun's energy output has decreased slightly. The two major volcanic eruptions of the past 30 years have had short-term cooling effects on climate, lasting two to three years. Thus, natural factors cannot explain the warming of recent decades; in fact, their net effect on climate has been a slight cooling influence over this period. In addition, the changes occurring now are very rapid compared to the major changes in climate over at least the last several thousand years.\n\nportant factor in increasing the heat-trapping capacity of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide and other gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide, do not condense and fall out of the atmosphere, whereas water vapor does (for example, as rain or snow). Together, heat-trapping gases other than water vapor account for between 26% and 33% of the total greenhouse effect,18 but are responsible for most of the changes in climate over recent decades. This is a range, rather than a single number, because some of the absorption effects of water vapor overlap with those of the other important gases. Without the heat-trapping effects of carbon dioxide and the other non-water vapor greenhouse gases, climate simulations indicate that the greenhouse effect would not function, turning the Earth into a frozen ball of ice.19\n\nIt is not only the direct effects from human emissions that affect climate. These direct effects also trigger a cascading set of feedbacks that cause indirect effects on climate \u00ad acting to increase or dampen an initial change. For example, water vapor is the single most important gas responsible for the natural greenhouse effect. Together, water vapor and clouds account for between 66% and 80% of the natural greenhouse effect.18 However, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere depends on temperature; increasing temperatures increase the amount of water vapor. This means that the response of water vapor is an internal feedback, not an external forcing of the climate.\nObservational evidence shows that, of all the external forcings, an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is the most im-\n\nThe average conditions and the variability of the Earth's climate are critical to all aspects of human and natural systems on the planet. Human society has become increasingly complex and dependent upon the climate system and its behavior. National and global infrastructures, economies, agriculture, and ecosystems are adapted to the present climate state, which from a geologic timescale perspective has been remarkably stable for the past several thousand years. Any significant perturbation, in either direction, would have substantial impacts upon both human society and the natural world. The magnitude of the human influence on climate and the rate of change raise concerns about the ability of ecosystems and human systems to successfully adapt to future changes.\n\nSupplemental Message 2.\n\nGlobal trends in temperature and many other climate variables provide consistent evidence of a warming planet. These trends are based on a wide range of observations, analyzed by\nmany independent research groups around the world.\n\nThere are many types of observations that can be used to detect changes in climate and determine what is causing these changes. Thermometer and other instrument-based surface weather records date back hundreds of years in some locations. Air temperatures are measured at fixed locations over land and with a mix of predominantly ship- and buoy-based measurements over the ocean. By 1850, a sufficiently extensive array of land-based observing stations and ship-borne observations had accumulated to begin tracking global average temperature. Measurements from weather balloons began in the early 1900s, and by 1958 were regularly taken around the world. Satellite records beginning in the 1970s provide additional perspectives, particularly for remote areas such as the Arctic that have limited ground-based observations. Satellites also provided new capabilities for mapping precipitation and upper air temperatures. Climate \"proxies\" \u00ad biological or physical records ranging from tree rings to ice cores that correlate\n\nwith aspects of climate \u00ad provide further evidence of past climate that can stretch back hundreds of thousands of years.\nThese diverse datasets have been analyzed by scientists and engineers from research teams around the world in many different ways. The most high-profile indication of the changing climate is the surface temperature record, so it has received the most attention. Spatial coverage, equipment, methods of observation, and many other aspects of the measurement record have changed over time, so scientists identify and adjust for these changes. Independent research groups have looked at the surface temperature record for land21 and ocean22 as well as land and ocean combined.23,24 Each group takes a different approach, yet all agree that it is unequivocal that the planet is warming.\nThere has been widespread warming over the past century. Not every region has warmed at the same pace, however,\n\n742\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nDevelopment of Observing Capabilities\n\nFigure 7. Changes in the mix and increasing diversity of technologies used to observe climate (IGY is the International Geophysical Year).

This is due to the stronger influence of internal variability over smaller geographic regions and shorter time scales, as mentioned in Supplemental Message 1 and discussed in\n\nmore detail in Supplemental Message 3. Warming during the first half of the last century occurred mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. The last three decades have seen greater warming in response to accelerating increases in heat-trapping gas concentrations, particularly at high northern latitudes, and over land as compared to ocean.\n\nObserved Change in Global Average Temperature\n\nFigure 8. Three different global surface temperature records all show increasing trends over the last century. The lines show annual differences in temperature relative to the 1901-1960 average. Differences among data sets, due to choices in data selection, analysis, and averaging techniques, do not affect the conclusion that global surface temperatures are increasing.

The relatively coarse resolution of these maps does not capture the finer details associated with mountains, coastlines, and other small-scale effects. (Figure source: updated from Vose et al. 201224).\n\nEven if the surface temperature had never been measured, scientists could still conclude with high confidence that the global temperature has been increasing because multiple lines of evidence all support this conclusion. Temperatures in the lower atmosphere and oceans have increased, as have sea level and near-surface humidity. Arctic sea ice, mountain glaciers, and\n\nNorthern Hemisphere spring snow cover have all decreased. As with temperature, multiple research groups have analyzed each of these indicators and come to the same conclusion: all of these changes paint a consistent and compelling picture of a warming world.\n\n744\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nIndicators of Warming from Multiple Data Sets\n\nFigure 10. Observed changes, as analyzed by many independent groups in different ways, of a range of climate indicators. All of these are in fact changing as expected in a warming world. Further details underpinning this diagram can be found at http://www. ncdc.noaa.gov/bams-state-of-the-climate/. (Figure source: updated from Kennedy et al. 201025).\n\nNot all of the observed changes are directly related to temperature; some are related to the hydrological cycle (the way water moves cyclically among land, ocean, and atmosphere). Precipitation is perhaps the most societally relevant aspect of the hydrological cycle and has been observed over global land areas for over a century. However, spatial scales of precipitation are small (it can rain several inches in Washington, D.C.,\n\nbut not a drop in Baltimore) and this makes interpretation of the point-measurements difficult. Based upon a range of efforts to create global averages, it is likely that there has been little change in globally averaged precipitation since 1900. However, there are strong geographic trends including a likely increase in precipitation in Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude regions taken as a whole. In general, wet areas are getting wet-\n\n745\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\n\nter and dry areas are getting drier, consistent with an overall intensification of the hydrological cycle in response to global warming.\nAnalyses of past changes in climate during the period before instrumental records (referred to as paleoclimate) allow current changes in atmospheric composition, sea level, and climate (including extreme events), as well as future projections, to be placed in a broader perspective of past climate variability. A number of different reconstructions of the last 1,000 to 2,000 years26,27 give a consistent picture of Northern Hemisphere temperatures, and in a few cases, global temperatures, over that time period. The analyses in the Northern Hemisphere indicate that the 1981 to 2010 period (including the last decade)\n\nwas the warmest of at least the last 1,300 years and probably much longer.28,29 A reconstruction going back 11,300 years ago30 suggests that the last decade was warmer than at least 72% of global temperatures since the end of the last ice age 20,000 years ago. The observed warming of the last century has also apparently reversed a long-term cooling trend at midto high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere throughout the last 2,000 years.\nOther analyses of past climates going back millions of years indicate that past periods with high levels (400 ppm or greater) otofdCaOy2'swanerdewaistshomciuatcehdhwigihtehrtseemapleevrealtsu.r31es much higher than\n\nPrecipitation Trends: Past Century, Past 30+ Years\n\nFigure 11.

Changes in the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere from surface observations (in red) and from proxies (in black; uncertainty range represented by shading) relative to 1961-1990 average temperature. These analyses suggest that current temperatures are higher than seen globally in at least the last 1700 years, and that the last decade (2001 to 2010) was the warmest decade on record. (Figure source: adapted from Mann et al. 200827).\n\nSupplemental Message 3.\n\nNatural variability, including El Ni\u00f1o events and other recurring patterns of ocean-atmosphere interactions, influences global and regional temperature and precipitation over timescales ranging from months up to a decade or more.\n\nNatural variations internal to the Earth's climate system can drive increases or decreases in global and regional temperatures, as well as affect precipitation and drought patterns around the world. Today, average temperature, precipitation, and other aspects of climate are determined by a combination of human-induced changes superimposed on natural variations in both internal and external factors such as the sun and volcanoes (see Supplemental Message 1). The relative magnitudes of the human and natural contributions to temperature and climate depend on both the time and spatial scales considered. The magnitude of the effect humans are having on global temperature specifically, and on climate in general, has been steadily increasing since the Industrial Revolution. At the global scale, the human influence on climate can be either masked or augmented by natural internal variations over timescales of a decade or so (for example, Tung and Zhou 201332). At regional and local scales, natural variations have an even larger effect. Over longer periods of time, however, the influence of internal natural variability on the Earth's climate system is negligible; in other words, over periods longer than several decades, the net effect of natural variability tends to sum to zero.\nThere are many modes of natural variability within the climate system. Most of them involve cyclical exchanges of heat and energy between the ocean and atmosphere. They are mani-\n\nfested by recurring changes in sea surface temperatures, for example, or by surface pressure changes in the atmosphere. While many global climate models are able to simulate the spatial patterns of ocean and atmospheric variability associated with these modes, they are less able to capture the chaotic variability in the timescales of the different modes.33\nThe largest and most well-known mode of internal natural variability is the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation or ENSO. This natural mode of variability was first identified as a warm current of ocean water off the coast of Peru, accompanied by a shift in pressure between two locations on either side of the Pacific Ocean. Although centered in the tropical Pacific, ENSO affects regional temperatures and precipitation around the world by heating or cooling the lower atmosphere in low latitudes, thereby altering pressure gradients aloft. These pressure gradients, in turn, drive the upper-level winds and the jet stream that dictates patterns of mid-latitude weather, as shown in Figure 13. In the United States, for example, the warm ENSO phase (commonly referred to as El Ni\u00f1o) is usually associated with heavy rainfall and flooding in California and the Southwest, but decreased precipitation in the Northwest.34 El Ni\u00f1o conditions also tend to suppress Atlantic hurricane formation by increasing the amount of wind shear in the region where hurricanes form.35 The cool ENSO phase (usually called\n\n747\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nLa Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o Patterns\n\nFigure 13.

The influence of these and other natural variations on global temperatures is generally less than ENSO, but local influences may be large.\nA combination of natural and human factors explains regional \"warming holes\" where temperatures actually decreased for several decades in the middle to late part of the last century at a few locations around the world.

Observations of global mean surface air temperature show that although there can be short periods with little or even no significant upward trend (red trend lines in shaded areas), global temperature continues to rise unabated over long-term climate timescales (black trend line). The recent period, 1998-2012, is another example of a short-term pause embedded in the underlying warming trend. The differences between short-term trends and the underlying (long-term) trend are often associated with modes of natural variability such as El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a that redistribute heat between the ocean and atmosphere.

For example, there can be warmer years due to El Ni\u00f1o (such as 1998) and cooler years due to La Ni\u00f1a (such as 2011), but over multiple decades the net effect of natural variability on uncertainty in global temperature and precipitation projections is small.\n\nAveraging (or compositing) of projections from different models smooths out the randomly occurring natural variations in the different models, leaving a clear signal of the long-term externally forced changes in climate, not weather. In this report, all future projections are averaged over 20- to 30-year time periods.\n\nSupplemental Message 4.\n\nHuman-induced increases in atmospheric levels of heat-trapping gases are the main cause of observed climate change over the past 50 years. The \"fingerprints\" of human-induced change also have been identified in many other aspects of the climate system, including changes in\nocean heat content, precipitation, atmospheric moisture, and Arctic sea ice.\n\nDetermining the causes of climate changes is a field of research known as \"detection and attribution.\" Detection involves identifying a climate trend or event (for instance, long-term surface air temperature trends, or a particularly extreme heat wave) that is strikingly outside the norm of natural variations in the climate system. Similar to conducting forensic analysis on evidence from a crime scene, attribution involves considering the possible causes of an observed event or change, and identifying which factor(s) are responsible.\nDetection and attribution studies use statistical analyses to identify the causes of observed changes in temperature, pre-\n\ncipitation, and other aspects of climate. They do this by trying to match the complex \"fingerprint\" of the observed climate system behavior to a set of simulated changes in climate that would be caused by different forcings.46 Most approaches consider not only global but also regional patterns of changes over time.\nClimate simulations are used to test hypotheses regarding the causes of observed changes. First, simulations that include changes in both natural and human forcings that may cause climate changes, such as changes in energy from the sun and increases in heat-trapping gases, are used to characterize what\n\nDetection and Attribution as Forensics\n\nFigure 16. Simplified image of the methodology that goes into detection and attribution of climate changes. The natural factors considered usually include changes in the sun's output and volcanic eruptions, as well as natural modes of variability such as El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a. Human factors include the emissions of heat-trapping gases and particles as well as clearing of forests and other land-use changes. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n750\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nHuman Influences Apparent in Many Aspects of the Changing Climate\n\nFigure 17. Figure shows examples of the many aspects of the climate system in which changes have been formally attributed to human emissions of heat-trapping gases and particles by studies published in peer-reviewed science literature. For example, observed changes in surface air temperature at both the global and continental levels, particularly over the past 50 years or so, cannot be explained without including the effects of human activities. While there are undoubtedly many natural factors that have affected climate in the past and continue to do so today, human activities are the dominant contributor to recently observed climate changes. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC).\n\neffect those factors would have had working together. Then, simulations with no changes in external forcings, only changes due to natural variability, are used to characterize what would be expected from normal internal variations in the climate. The results of these simulations are compared to observations to see which provides the best match for what has really occurred.\nDetection and attribution studies have been applied to study a broad range of changes in the climate system as well as a number of specific extreme events that have occurred in recent years. These studies have found that human influences are the only explanation for the observed changes in climate over the last half-century. Such changes include increases in surface temperatures,46,47 changes in atmospheric vertical temperature profiles,48 increases in ocean heat content,49 increasing atmospheric humidity,50 increases in intensity of precipitation51 and in runoff,52 indirectly estimated through changes in ocean salinity,53 shifts in atmospheric circulation,54 and changes in a\n\nhost of other indices.46 Taken together these paint a coherent picture of a planet whose climate is changing primarily as a result of human activities.\nDetection and attribution of specific events is more challenging than for long-term trends as there are less data, or evidence, available from which to draw conclusions. Attribution of extreme events is especially scientifically challenging.56 Many extreme weather and climate events observed to date are within the range of what could have occurred naturally, but the probability, or odds, of some of these very rare events occurring57 has been significantly altered by human influences on the climate system. For example, studies have concluded that there is a detectable human influence in recent heat waves in Europe,58 Russia,59 and Texas60 as well as flooding events in England and Wales,61 the timing and magnitude of snowmelt and resulting streamflow in some western U.S. states,62,63 and some specific events around the globe during 2011.64\n\n751\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nOnly Human Influence Can Explain Recent Warming\n\nFigure 18. Changes in surface air temperature at the continental and global scales can only be explained by the influence of human activities on climate. The black line depicts the annually averaged observed changes. The blue shading shows climate model simulations that include the effects of natural (solar and volcanic) forcing only. The orange shading shows climate model simulations that include the effects of both natural and human contributions. These analyses demonstrate that the observed changes, both globally and on a continent-bycontinent basis, are caused by the influence of human activities on climate. (Figure source: updated from Jones et al. 201355).\n\n752\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\n\nSupplemental Message 5.\n\nPast emissions of heat-trapping gases have already committed the world to a certain amount of future climate change. How much more the climate will change depends on future\nemissions and the sensitivity of the climate system to those emissions.\n\nA certain amount of climate change is already inevitable due to the build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere from human activities, most of it since the Industrial Revolution. A decrease in temperature would only be expected if there was an unexpected decrease in natural forcings, such as a reduction in the power of the sun. The Earth's climate system, particularly the ocean, tends to lag behind changes in atmospheric composition by decades, and even centuries, due to the large heat capacity of the oceans and other factors. Even if all emissions of the relevant gases and particles from human activity suddenly stopped, a temperature increase of 0.5\u00b0F still would occur over the next few decades,65 and the human-induced changes in the global carbon cycle would persist for thousands of years.66\nGlobal emissions of CO2 and other heat-trapping gases continue to rise. How much climate will change over this century and beyond depends primarily on: 1) human activities and resulting emissions, and 2) how sensitive the climate is to those changes (that is, the response of global temperature to a change in radiative forcing caused by human emissions). Uncertainties in how the economy will evolve, what types of energy will be used, or what our cities, buildings, or cars will look like in the future all limit scientists' ability to predict the future changes in climate. Scientists can, however, develop scenarios \u00ad plausible projections of what might happen, under a given set of assumptions. These scenarios describe possible futures in terms of population, energy sources, technology, heat-trapping gas emissions, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, and/or global temperature change.\nOver the next few decades, the greater part of the range (or uncertainty) in projected global and regional change is the result of natural variability and scientific limitations in our ability to model and understand the Earth's climate system (natural variability is discussed in Supplemental Message 3 and scientific or model uncertainty in Supplemental Message 6). By the second half of the century, however, scenario uncertainty (that is, uncertainty about what will be the level of emissions from human activities) becomes increasingly dominant in determining the magnitude and patterns of future change, particularly for temperature-related aspects.67 Even though natural variability will continue to occur, most of the difference between present and future climates will be determined by choices that society makes today and over the next few decades. The further out in time we look, the greater the influence of human choices on the magnitude of future change.\nFor temperature, it is clear that increasing emissions from human activities will drive consistent increases in global and most\n\nregional temperatures and that these rising temperatures will increase with the magnitude of future emissions (see Figure 19 and Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Figures 2.8 and 2.9). Uncertainty in projected temperature change is generally smaller than uncertainty in projected changes in precipitation or other aspects of climate.\nFuture climate change also depends on \"climate sensitivity,\" generally summarized as the response of global temperature to a doubling of CO2 levels in the atmosphere relative to preindustrial levels of 280 parts per million. If the only impact of increasing atmospheric CO2 levels were to amplify the natural greenhouse effect (as CO2 levels increase, more of the Earth's heat is absorbed by the atmosphere before it can escape to space, as discussed in Supplemental Message 1), it would be relatively easy to calculate the change in global temperature that would result from a given increase in CO2 levels. However, a series of feedbacks within the Earth's climate system acts to amplify or diminish an initial change, adding some uncertainty to the precise climate sensitivity. Some important feedbacks include:\n\u00b7 Clouds \u00ad Will warming increase or decrease cloudiness? Will the changes be to lower-altitude clouds that primarily reflect the sun's energy, or higher clouds that trap even more heat within the Earth system?\n\u00b7 Albedo (reflectivity) \u00ad How quickly will bright white reflective surfaces, such as snow and ice that reflect most of the sun's energy, melt and be replaced by a dark ocean or land area that absorbs most of the sun's energy? How will vegetation changes caused by climate change alter surface reflectivity?\n\u00b7 Carbon dioxide absorption by the ocean and the biosphere \u00ad Will the rate of uptake increase in the future, helping to remove human emissions from the atmosphere? Or will it decrease, causing emissions to build up even faster than they are now?\nFeedbacks are particularly important in the Arctic, where rising temperatures melt ice and snow, exposing relatively dark land and ocean, which absorb more of the sun's energy, heating the region even further. Rising temperatures also thaw permafrost, releasing carbon dioxide and methane trapped in the previously frozen ground into the atmosphere, where they further amplify the greenhouse effect (see Supplemental Message 1). Both of these feedbacks act to further amplify the\n\n753\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\n\ninitial warming due to human emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases.\nTogether, these and other feedbacks determine the long-term response of the Earth's temperature to an increase in carbon dioxide and other emissions from human activities. Past observations, including both recent measurements and studies that look at climate changes in the distant past, cannot tell us precisely how sensitive the climate system will be to increasing emissions of heat-trapping gases if we are starting from today's conditions. They can tell us, however, that the net effect of these feedbacks will be to increase, not diminish, the direct warming effect. In other words, the climate system will warm by more than would be expected from the greenhouse effect alone.\nQuantifying the effect of these feedbacks on global and regional climate is the subject of ongoing data collection and active research. As noted above, one measure used to study these effects is the \"equilibrium climate sensitivity,\" which is an estimate of the temperature change that would result, once the climate had reached an equilibrium state, as a result of doubling the CO2 concentration from pre-industrial levels. The equilibrium climate sensitivity has long been estimated to be in the range of 2.7\u00b0F to 8.1\u00b0F. The 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report15 refined this range based on more recent evidence to conclude that the value is likely to be in the range 3.6\u00b0F to 8.1\u00b0F, with a most probable value of about 5.4\u00b0F, based upon multiple observational and modeling constraints, and that it is very unlikely to be less than 2.7\u00b0F. Climate sensitivities determined from a variety of evidence agree well with this range, including analyses of past paleoclimate changes.68,69 This is substantially greater than the increase in temperature from just the direct radiative effects of the CO2 increase (around 2\u00b0F).\nSome recent studies (such as Fasullo and Trenberth 201270) have suggested that climate sensitivities are at the higher end\n\nof this range, while others have suggested values at the lower end of the range.71,72 Some recent studies have even suggested that the climate sensitivity may be less than 2.7\u00b0F based on analyses of recent temperature trends.72 However, analyses based on recent temperature trends are subject to significant uncertainties in the treatment of natural variability,69 the effects of volcanic eruptions,73 and the effects of recent accelerated penetration of heat to the deep ocean.74\nThe equilibrium climate sensitivity is sometimes confused with the \"transient climate response,\" defined as the temperature change for a 1% per year CO2 increase, and calculated using the difference between the start of the experiment and a 20-year period centered on the time of CO2 doubling. This value is generally smaller than the equilibrium climate sensitivity because of the slow rate at which heat transfers between the oceans and the atmosphere due to transient heat uptake of the ocean. The transient climate response is better constrained than the equilibrium climate sensitivity.15 It is very likely larger than 1.8\u00b0F and very unlikely to be greater than 5.4\u00b0F. This transient response includes feedbacks that respond to global temperature change over timescales of years to decades. These \"fast\" feedbacks include increases in atmospheric water vapor, reduction of ice and snow, warming of the ocean surface, and changes in cloud characteristics. The entire response of the climate system will not be fully seen until the deep ocean comes into balance with the atmosphere, a process that can take thousands of years.\nCombining the uncertainty due to climate sensitivity with the uncertainty due to human activities produces a range of future temperature changes that overlap over the first half of this century, but begins to separate over the second half of the century as emissions and atmospheric CO2 levels diverge.\n\n754\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nEmissions, Concentrations, and Temperature Projections\n\nFigure 19. Two families of scenarios are commonly used for future climate projections: the 2000 Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES, left) and the 2010 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP, right). The SRES scenarios are named by family (A1, A2, B1, and B2), where each family is designed around a set of consistent assumptions: for example, a world that is more integrated or more divided. In contrast, the RCP scenarios are simply numbered according to the change in radiative forcing (from +2.6 to +8.5 watts per square meter) that results by 2100. This figure compares SRES and RCP annual carbon emissions (top), carbon dioxide equivalent levels in the atmosphere (middle), and temperature change that would result from the central estimate (lines) and the likely range (shaded areas) of climate sensitivity (bottom). At the top end of the range, the older SRES scenarios are slightly higher. Comparing carbon dioxide concentrations and global temperature change between the SRES and RCP scenarios, SRES A1fI is similar to RCP 8.5; SRES A1B to RCP 6.0 and SRES B1 to RCP 4.5. The RCP 2.6 scenario is much lower than any SRES scenario because it includes the option of using policies to achieve net negative carbon dioxide emissions before end of century, while SRES scenarios do not.

Projected change in surface air temperature at the end of this century (2071-2099) relative to the end of the last century (1970-1999). The older generation of models (CMIP3) and SRES emissions scenarios are on the left side; the new models (CMIP5) and scenarios are on the right side. The scenarios are described under Supplemental Message 5 and in Figure 19. Differences between the old and new projections are mostly a result of the differences in the scenarios of the emission of heat-trapping gases rather than the increased complexity of the new models. None of the new scenarios are exactly the same as the old ones, although at the end of the century SRES B1 and RCP 4.5 are roughly comparable, as are SRES A1B and RCP 6.0.

The older generation of models (CMIP3) and emissions scenarios are on the left side; the new models (CMIP5) and scenarios are on the right side. Hatched areas indicate that the projected changes are significant and consistent among models. White areas indicate that the changes are not projected to be larger than could be expected from natural variability. In both sets of projections, the northern parts of the U.S. (and Alaska) become wetter. Increases in both the amount of precipitation change and the confidence in the projections go up as the projected temperature rises. In the farthest northern parts of the U.S., much of the additional winter precipitation will still fall as snow. This is not likely to be the case farther south. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n757\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nProjected Summertime Precipitation Changes\n\nFigure 22.

The older generation of models (CMIP3) and emissions scenarios are on the left side; the new models (CMIP5) and scenarios are on the right side. Hatched areas indicate that the projected changes are significant and consistent among models. White areas indicate confidence that the changes are not projected to be larger than could be expected from natural variability. In most of the contiguous U.S., decreases in summer precipitation are projected, but not with as much confidence as the winter increases. When interpreting maps of temperature and precipitation projections, readers are advised to pay less attention to small details and greater attention to the large-scale patterns of change.

No model is perfect, but many of them provide\nuseful information. By combining and averaging multiple models, many clear trends emerge.\n\nClimate scientists use a wide range of observational and computational tools to understand the complexity of the Earth's climate system and to study how that system responds to external forces, including the effect of humans on climate. Observational tools are described in Supplemental Message 2.\nComputational tools include models that simulate different parts of the climate system. The most sophisticated computational tools used by climate scientists are global climate models (previously referred to as \"general circulation models\"), or GCMs. Global climate models are mathematical models that simulate the physics, chemistry, and, increasingly, the biology that influence the climate system. GCMs are built on fundamental equations of physics that include the conservation of energy, mass, and momentum, and how these are exchanged among different parts of the climate system. Using these fundamental relationships, the models generate many important features that are evident in the Earth's climate system: the jet stream that circles the globe 30,000 feet above the Earth's surface; the Gulf Stream and other ocean currents that transport heat from the tropics to the poles; and even, when the models can be run at a fine enough spatial resolution to capture these features, hurricanes in the Atlantic and typhoons in the Pacific.\nGCMs and other physical models are subject to two main types of uncertainty. First, because scientific understanding of the climate system is not complete, a model may not include an important process. This could be because that process is not yet recognized, or because it is known but is not yet understood well enough to be modeled accurately. For example, the models do not currently include adequate treatments of dynamical mechanisms that are important to melting ice sheets. The existence of these mechanisms is known, but they are not yet well enough understood to simulate accurately at the global scale. Also, observations of climate change in the distant past suggest there might be \"tipping points,\" or mechanisms of abrupt changes in climate change, such as shifts in ocean circulation, that are not adequately understood.76 These are discussed further in Appendix 4: FAQ T.\nSecond, many processes occur at finer temporal and spatial (time and space) scales than models can resolve. Models instead must approximate what these processes would look like at the spatial scale that the model can resolve using empirical equations, or parameterizations, based on a combination of observations and scientific understanding. Examples of important processes that must be parameterized in climate models include turbulent mixing, radiational heating/cooling, and small-scale physical processes such as cloud formation and\n\nprecipitation, chemical reactions, and exchanges between the biosphere and atmosphere. For example, these models cannot represent every raindrop. However, they can simulate the total amount of rain that would fall over a large area the size of a grid cell in the model. These approximations are usually derived from a limited set of observations and/or higher resolution modeling and may not hold true for every location or under all possible conditions.\nGCMs are constantly being enhanced as scientific understanding of climate improves and as computational power increases. For example, in 1990, the average model divided up the world into grid cells measuring more than 300 miles per side. Today, most models divide the world up into grid cells of about 60 to 100 miles per side, and some of the most recent models are able to run short simulations with grid cells of only 15 miles per side. Supercomputer capabilities are the primary limitation on grid cell size. Newer models also incorporate more of the physical processes and components that make up the Earth's climate system. The very first global climate models were designed to simulate only the circulation of the atmosphere. Over time, the ocean, clouds, land surface, ice, snow, and other features were added one by one. Most of these features were new modules that were developed by experts in those fields and then added into an existing GCM framework. Today, there are more than 35 GCMs created and maintained by more than 20 modeling groups around the world. Some of the newest models are known as Earth System Models, or ESMs, which include all the previous components of a typical GCM but also incorporate modules that represent additional aspects of the climate system, including agriculture, vegetation, and the carbon cycle.\nSome models are more successful than others at reproducing observed climate and trends over the past century,77 or the large-scale dynamical features responsible for creating the average climate conditions over a certain region (such as the Arctic78 or the Caribbean79). Evaluation of models' success often depends on the variable or metric being considered in the analysis, with some models performing better than others for certain regions or variables.80 However, all future simulations agree that both global and regional temperatures will increase over this century in response to increasing emissions of heattrapping gases from human activities.15\nDifferences among model simulations over several years to several decades arise from natural variability (as discussed in Supplemental Message 3) as well as from different ways models characterize various small-scale processes. Averaging simu-\n\n760\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\n\nlations from multiple models removes the effects of randomly occurring natural variations. The timing of natural variations is largely unpredictable beyond several seasons (although such predictability is an active research area). For this reason, model simulations are generally averaged (as the last stage in any analysis) to make it easier to discern the impact of external forcing (both human and natural). The effect of averaging on the systematic errors depends on the extent to which models have similar errors or offsetting errors.\nDespite their increasing resolution, most GCMs cannot simulate fine-scale changes at the regional to local scale. For that reason, downscaling is often used to translate GCM projections into the high-resolution information required as input to impact analyses. There are two types of models commonly used for downscaling: dynamical and statistical.\nDynamical downscaling models are often referred to as regional climate models since they include many of the same physical processes that make up a global climate model, but simulate these processes at higher resolution and over a relatively small area, such as the Northwest or Southeast United States. At their boundaries, regional climate models use output from GCMs to simulate what is going on in the rest of the world. Regional climate models are computationally intensive, but provide a broad range of output variables including atmospheric circulation, winds, cloudiness, and humidity at spatial scales ranging from about 6 to 30 miles per grid cell. They are also subject to the same types of uncertainty as a global model, such as not fully resolving physical processes that occur at even smaller scales. Regional climate models have additional uncertainty related to how often their boundary conditions are updated and where they are defined. These uncertainties can have a large impact on the precipitation simulated by the models at the local to regional scale. Currently, a limited set of regional climate model simulations based on one future scenario and output from five CMIP3 GCMs is available from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (these are the \"NARCCAP\" models used in some sections of this report). These simulations are useful for examining certain impacts over North America. However, they do not encompass the full range of uncertainty in future projections due to both human activities and climate sensitivity described in Supplemental Message 5.\nStatistical downscaling models use observed relationships between large-scale weather features and local climate to translate future projections down to the scale of observations. Statistical models are generally very effective at removing errors in historical simulated values, leading to a good match between the average (multi-decadal) statistics of observed and statistically downscaled climate at the spatial scale and over\n\nthe historical period of the observational data used to train the statistical model. However, statistical models are based on the key assumption that the relationship between largescale weather systems and local climate will remain constant over time. This assumption may be valid for lesser amounts of change, but could lead to errors, particularly in precipitation extremes, with larger amounts of climate change.81 Statistical models are generally flexible and less computationally demanding than regional climate models. A number of databases provide statistically downscaled projections for a continuous period from 1960 to 2100 using many global models and a range of higher and lower future scenarios (for example, the U.S. Geological Survey database described by Maurer et al. 200782).83,84 Statistical downscaling models are best suited for analyses that require a range of future projections that reflect the uncertainty in emissions scenarios and climate sensitivity, at the scale of observations that may already be used for planning purposes.\nIdeally, climate impact studies could use both statistical and dynamical downscaling methods. Regional climate models can directly simulate the response of regional climate processes to global change, while statistical models can better remove any biases in simulations relative to observations. However, rarely (if ever) are the resources available to take this approach. Instead, most assessments tend to rely on one or the other type of downscaling, where the choice is based on the needs of the assessment. If the study is more of a sensitivity analysis, where using one or two future simulations is not a limitation, or if it requires many climate variables as input, then regional climate modeling may be more appropriate. If the study needs to resolve the full range of projected changes under multiple models and scenarios or is more constrained by practical resources, then statistical downscaling may be more appropriate. However, even within statistical downscaling, selecting an appropriate method for any given study depends on the questions being asked. The variety of techniques ranges from a simple \"delta\" (change or difference) approach (subtracting historical simulated values from future values, and adding the resulting delta to historical observations, as used in the first national climate assessment85) to complex clustering and neural network techniques that rival dynamical downscaling in their demand for computational resources and high-frequency model output (for example, Kostopoulou and Jones 200786; Vrac et al. 200781). The delta approach is adequate for studies that are only interested in changes in seasonal or annual average temperature. More complex methods must be used for studies that require information on how climate change may affect the frequency or timing of precipitation and climate extremes.\n\n761\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nModeling the Climate System\n\nFigure 24.

Numer-\nous studies have looked at many different aspects of the record.28,89,90,91,92,93 These studies have increased confidence that\nthe U.S. is warming, and refined estimates of how much.\n\n\u00b7 comparisons to a range of state-of-the-art meteorological data analyses;92 and\n\u00b7 in-depth analyses of the potential impacts of urbanization.90\n\nHistorical temperature data are available for thousands of weather stations. However, for a variety of practical and often unavoidable reasons, there have been frequent changes to individual stations and to the network as a whole. Two changes are particularly important. The first is a widespread change in the time at which observers read their thermometers. Second, most stations now use electronic instruments rather than traditional glass thermometers.\nExtensive work has been done to document the effect of these changes on historical temperatures. For example, the change from afternoon to morning observations resulted in systematically lower temperatures for both maximum and minimum, artificially cooling the U.S. temperature record by about 0.5\u00b0F.93,94 The change in instrumentation was equally important but more complex. New electronic instruments generally recorded higher minimum temperatures, yielding an artificial warming of about 0.25\u00b0F, and lower maximum temperatures, resulting in an artificial cooling of about 0.5\u00b0F. This has been confirmed by extended period side-by-side instrument comparisons.95 Confounding this, as noted by a recent citizen science effort, the new instruments were often placed nearer buildings or other man-made structures.96 Analyses of the changes in siting indicate that this had a much smaller effect than the change in instrumentation across the network as a whole.89,91,93\nExtensive work has been done to develop statistical adjustments that carefully remove these and other non-climate elements that affect the data. To confirm the efficacy of the adjustments, several sensitivity assessments have been undertaken. These include:\n\u00b7 a comparison with the U.S. Climate Reference Network;91,97\n\nThese assessments agree that the corrected data do not overestimate the rate of warming. Rather, because the average effect of these issues was to reduce recorded temperatures, adjusting for these issues tends to reveal a larger long-term warming trend. The impact is much larger for maximum temperature as compared to minimum temperature because the adjustments account for two distinct artificial cooling signals: the change in observation time and the change in instrumentation. The impact is smaller for minimum temperature because the artificial signals roughly offset one another (the change in observation time cooling the record, the change in instrumentation warming the record). Even without these adjustments, however, both maximum and minimum temperature records show increases over the past century.\nGeographically, maximum temperature has increased in most areas except in parts of the western Midwest, northeastern Great Plains, and the Southeast regions. Minimum temperature exhibits the same pattern of change with a slightly greater area of increases. The causes of these slight differences between maximum and minimum temperature are a subject of ongoing research.98 In general, the uncorrected data exhibit more extreme trends as well as larger spatial variability; in other words, the adjustments have a smoothing effect.\nThe corrected temperature record also confirms that U.S. average temperature is increasing in all four seasons. The heat that occurred during the Dust Bowl era is prominent in the summer record. The warmest summer on record was 1936, closely followed by 2012. However, twelve of the last fourteen summers have been above average. Temperatures during the other seasons have also generally been above average in recent years.\n\n\u00b7 analyses to evaluate biases and uncertainties;93\n\n764\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nTrends in Maximum and Minimum Temperatures\n\nFigure 27.

These include reduced lake ice, glacier retreat, earlier melting of snowpack, reduced lake levels, and a longer growing season. These and other indicators are expected to continue to reflect higher temperatures.\n\nWhile surface air temperature is the most widely cited measure of climate change, other aspects of climate that are affected by temperature are often more directly relevant to both human society and the natural environment. Examples include shorter duration of ice on lakes and rivers, reduced glacier extent, earlier melting of snowpack, reduced lake levels due to increased evaporation, lengthening of the growing season, and changes in plant hardiness zones. Changes in these and many other variables are consistent with the recent warming over much of the United States. Taken as a whole, these changes provide compelling evidence that increasing temperatures are affecting both ecosystems and human society.\nStriking decreases in the coverage of ice on the Great Lakes have occurred over the last few decades (see Ch 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 11). The annual average ice cover area for the Great Lakes, which typically shows large year-toyear variability, has sharply declined over the last 30+ years.100 Based on records covering the winters of 1972-1973 through 2010-2011, 12 of the 19 winters prior to 1991-1992 had annual average ice cover greater than 20% of the total lake area while 15 of the 20 winters since 1991-1992 have had less than 20% of the total lake area covered with ice. This includes the three lowest ice extent winters of 1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2005-2006. A reduction in ice leading to more open water in winter raises concerns about possible increases in lake effect snowfall, although future trends will also depend on the difference between local air and water temperatures.\n\nare an indication of higher lake temperatures, as it takes longer for the warmer water to freeze in winter. Prior to 1950, the absence of winter ice cover on Lake Champlain was rare, occurring just three times in the 1800s and four times between 1900 and 1950. By contrast, it remained ice-free during 42% of the winters between 1951 and 1990, and since 1991, Lake Champlain has remained ice-free during 64% of the winters. One- to two-week advances of ice breakup dates and similar length delays of freeze-up dates are also typical of lakes and rivers in Canada, Scandinavia, and northern Asia.15\nWhile shorter durations of lake ice enhance navigational opportunities during winter, decreasing water levels in the Great Lakes present risks to navigation, especially during the summer. Water levels on Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Ontario have been below their long-term (1918-2008) averages for much of the past decade.103 The summer drought of 2012 left Lakes Michigan and Ontario approximately one foot below their long-term averages. As noted in the second national climate assessment,1 projected water level reductions for this century in the Great Lakes range from less than a foot under lower emissions scenarios to between 1 and 2 feet under high-\nIce Cover on Lake Mendota\n\nSmaller lakes in other parts of the country show similar changes. For example, the total duration of ice cover on Lake Mendota in Madison, Wisconsin, has decreased from about 120 days in the late 1800s to less than 100 days in most years since 1990.101 Average dates of spring ice disappearance on Minnesota lakes show a trend toward earlier melting over the past 60 years or so. These changes affect the recreational and commercial activities of the surrounding communities.\n\nA long-term record of the ice-in date (the first date in winter when ice coverage closes the lake to navigation) on Lake Champlain in Vermont shows that the lake now freezes approximately two weeks later than in the early 1800s and over a week later than 100 years ago.102 Later ice-in dates\n\nFigure 29. The duration, or number of days, of ice cover on Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, has decreased over time. The 10 longest ice seasons are marked by blue circles, and the 11 shortest ice seasons are marked by red circles. Seven of the 10 shortest ice cover seasons have occurred since 1980.

At many locations in the western U.S., the timing of streamflow in rivers fed by snowpack is shifting to earlier in the year. Red dots indicate stream gauge locations where half of the annual flow is now arriving anywhere from 5 to 20 days earlier each year for 2001-2010, relative to the 19512000 average. Blue dots indicate locations where the annual flow is now arriving later. Crosses indicate locations where observed changes are not statistically different from the past century baseline at 90% confidence levels, diamonds indicate gauges where the timing difference was significantly different at 90% confidence, and dots indicate gauges where timing was different at 95% confidence level.

The U.S. average frost-free season length (defined as the number of days between the last and first occurrences of 32\u00b0F in spring and autumn, respectively) increased by about two weeks during the last century.114 The increase was much greater in the western than in the eastern United States. Consistent with the recent observed trends in frost-free season length, the largest projected changes in growing season length are in the mountainous regions of the western United States, while smaller changes are projected for the Midwest, Northeast, and Southeast. Related plant and animal changes include a northward shift in the typical locations of bird species115 and a shift since the 1980s toward earlier first-leaf dates for lilac and honeysuckle.116\nPlant hardiness zones are determined primarily by the extremes of winter cold.117 Maps of plant hardiness have guided the selection of plants for both ornamental and agricultural purposes, and these zones are changing as climate warms. Plant hardiness zones for the U.S. have recently been updated using the new climate normals (1981-2010), and these zones show a northward shift by up to 100 miles relative to the zones based on the older (1971-2000) normals. Even greater northward shifts, as much as 200 miles, are projected over the next 30 years as warming increases. Projected shifts are largest in the major agricultural regions of the central United States.\nEvidence of a warming climate across the U.S. is based on a host of indicators: hydrology, ecology, and physical climate. Most of these are changing in ways consistent with increasing temperatures, and are expected to continue to change in the future as a result of ongoing increases in human-induced heattrapping gas emissions.\n\n768\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nShifts in Plant Hardiness Zones\n\nFigure 31. The map on the left shows the change in Plant Hardiness Zones calculated from those based on the 1971-2000 climate to those based on the 1981-2010 climate. Even greater changes are projected over the next 30 years (right). (Figure source: NOAA).\n\nSupplemental Message 9.\n\nTrends in some types of extreme weather events have been observed in recent decades, consistent with rising temperatures. These include increases in heavy precipitation\nnationwide, especially in the Midwest and Northeast; heat waves, especially in the West; and the intensity of Atlantic hurricanes. These trends are expected to continue. Research on climate change's effects on other types of extreme events continues.\n\nHigh impact, large-scale extreme events are complex phenomena involving various factors that can vcreate a \"perfect storm.\" Such extreme weather occurs naturally. However, the influence of human activities on global climate is altering the frequency and/or severity of many of these events.\nObservations show that heavy downpours have already increased nationally. Regional and global models project increases in extreme precipitation for every U.S. region.118 Precipitation events tend to be limited by available moisture. For the heaviest, most rare events, there is strong evidence from observations119 and models118,120 that higher temperatures and the resulting moister atmosphere are the main cause of these observed and projected increases. Other factors that may also have an influence on observed U.S. changes in extreme precipitation are land-use changes (for example, changes in irrigation121,122) and a shift in the number of El Ni\u00f1o events versus La Ni\u00f1a events.\n\nClimate change can also alter the characteristics of the atmosphere in ways that affect weather patterns and storms. In the mid-latitudes, where most of the continental U.S. is located, there is an increasing trend in extreme precipitation in the vicinity of fronts associated with mid-latitude storms (also referred to as extra-tropical [outside the tropics] cyclones123). There is also a northward shift in storms over the U.S.124 that are often associated with extreme precipitation. This shift is consistent with projections of a warming world.125 No change in mid-latitude storm intensity or frequency has been detected.\nIn the tropics, the most important types of storms are tropical cyclones, referred to as hurricanes when they occur in the Atlantic Ocean. Over the 40 years of satellite monitoring, there has been a shift toward stronger hurricanes in the Atlantic, with fewer Category 1 and 2 hurricanes and more Category 4 and 5 hurricanes. There has been no significant trend in the global number of tropical cyclones126 nor has any trend been identified in the number of U.S. landfalling hurricanes.1 Two\n\n769\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fExtreme Precipitation\n\nAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\n\nFigure 32. Heavy downpours are increasing nationally, with especially large increases in the Midwest and Northeast.99 Despite considerable decadal-scale natural variability, indices such as this one based on 2-day precipitation totals exceeding a threshold for a 1-in-5-year occurrence exhibit a greater than normal occurrence of extreme events since 1991 in all U.S. regions except Alaska and Hawai`i. Each bar represents that decade's average, while the far right bar in each graph represents the average for the 12-year period of 2001-2012. Analysis is based on 726 long-term, quality-controlled station records. This figure is a regional expansion of the national index in Figure 2.16 of Chapter 2. (Figure source: updated from Kunkel et al. 201399).\n\nstudies have found an upward trend in the number of extreme precipitation events associated with tropical cyclones,127 but significant uncertainties remain.122 A change in the number of Atlantic hurricanes has been identified, but interpreting its significance is complicated both by multi-decadal natural variability and the reliability of the pre-satellite historical record.128 The global satellite record shows a shift toward stronger tropical cyclones,126,129 but does not provide definitive evidence of a long-term trend. Nonetheless, there is a growing consensus based on scientific understanding and very-high-resolution atmospheric modeling that the strongest tropical cyclones, including Atlantic hurricanes, will become stronger in a warmer world.130\nThe number of heat waves has been increasing in recent years. On a decadal basis, the decade of 2001-2010 had the second highest number since 1901 (first is the 1930s). This trend has continued in 2011 and 2012, with the number of intense heat waves being almost triple the long-term average. Region-\n\nally, the Northwest, Southwest, and Alaska had their highest number of heat waves in the 2000s, while the 1930s were the highest in the other regions (note that the Alaskan time series begins in the 1950s). For the number of intense cold waves, the national-average value was highest in the 1980s and lowest in the 2000s. The lack of cold waves in the 2000s was prevalent throughout the contiguous U.S. and Alaska. Climate model simulations indicate that the recent trends toward increasing frequency of heat waves and decreasing frequency of cold waves will continue in the future.\nThe data on the number and intensity of severe thunderstorm phenomena (including tornadoes, thunderstorm winds, and hail) are not of sufficient quality to determine whether there have been historical trends.119 This scarcity of high-quality data, combined with the fact that these phenomena are too small to be directly represented in climate models,131 makes it difficult to project how these storms might change in the future.\n\n770\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\n\nSupplemental Message 10.\n\nDrought and fire risk are increasing in many regions as temperatures and evaporation rates rise. The greater the future warming, the more these risks will increase, potentially affecting the entire United States.\n\nAs temperatures rise, evaporation rates increase, which (all else remaining equal) would be expected to lead to increased drying.131 The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI),132 a widely used indicator of dryness that incorporates both precipitation and temperaturebased evaporation estimates, does not show any trend for the U.S. as a whole over the past century.133 However, drought intensity and frequency have been increasing over much of the western United States, especially during the last four decades. In the Southeast, western Great Lakes, and southern Great Plains, droughts have increased during the last 40 years, but do not show an increase when examined over longer periods encompassing the entire last century. In the Southwest, drought has been widespread since 2000; the average value of the PDSI during the 2000s indicated the most severe average drought conditions of any decade. The severity of recent drought in the Southwest reflects both the decade's low precipitation and high temperatures.\n\nPercent of West in Summer Drought\nFigure 33. The area of the western U.S. in moderately to extremely dry conditions during summer (June-July-August) varies greatly from year to year but shows a longterm increasing trend from 1900 to 2012. (Data from NOAA NCDC State of the Climate Drought analysis).\nChanging Forest Fires in the U.S.\n\nSeasonal and multi-year droughts affect wildfire severity.134 For example, persistent drought conditions in the Southwest, combined with wildfire suppression and land management practices,135 have contributed to wildfires of unprecedented size since 2000. Five western states (Arizona, Colorado, Utah, California, and New Mexico) have experienced their largest fires on record at least once since 2000. Much of the increase in fires larger than 500 acres occurred in the western United States, and the area burned in the Southwest increased more than 300% relative to the area burned during the 1970s and early 1980s.136\n\nDroughts on a duration and scale that affect agriculture are\nprojected to increase in frequency and severity in this century\ndue to higher temperatures. Projections of the Palmer Drought\nSeverity Index at the end of this century indicate that the nor-\nmal state for most of the nation will be what is considered moderate to severe drought today.137,138 The PDSI is used by\nseveral states for monitoring drought and for triggering certain actions.139 It is also one component of the U.S. Drought Monitor.140 The closely related Palmer Hydrological Index is the most\n\nFigure 34. Although the average number of wildfires per year (black line) has decreased over time, the total area burned by wildfires (orange bars) in the continental U.S. (primarily in the western states) has nearly doubled since 2000 relative to the long-term 1960-1999 average (data shown are for 1960-2011).

Permafrost temperatures are rising and the overall amount of permafrost is\nshrinking. Melting of land- and sea-based ice is expected to continue with further warming.\n\nIncreasing temperatures and associated impacts are apparent throughout the Arctic, including Alaska. Sea ice coverage and thickness, permafrost on land, mountain glaciers, and the Greenland Ice Sheet all show changes consistent with higher temperatures.\nThe most dramatic decreases in summer sea ice have occurred along the northern coastline of Alaska and Russia. Since the satellite record began in 1979, September (summer minimum) sea ice extent has declined by 13% per decade in the Beaufort Sea and 32% per decade in the Chukchi Sea,146 leaving the Chukchi nearly ice-free in the past few Septembers. Longerterm records based on climate proxies suggest that pan-Arctic\n\nice extent in summer is the lowest it has been in at least the past 1,450 years.147 Winter ice extent has declined less than summer ice extent (see Ch. 2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 11), indicative of a trend toward seasonal-only (as opposed to year-round) ice cover, which is relatively thin and vulnerable to melt in the summer. Recent work has indicated that the loss of summer sea ice may be affecting the atmospheric circulation in autumn and early winter. For example, there are indications that a weakening of subpolar westerly winds during autumn is an atmospheric response to a warming of the lower troposphere of the Arctic.148 Extreme summer ice retreat also appears to be increasing the persistence of associated mid-latitude weather patterns, which may lead to an increased prob-\n\n773\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nArctic Sea Ice Decline\n\nFigure 37.

Borehole measurements are particularly useful, as they provide information from levels below about 10-meter depth where the seasonal cycle becomes negligible. Increases in borehole temperatures over the past several decades are apparent at various locations, including Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, and northern Russia. The increases are about 3.6\u00b0F at the two stations in northern Alaska (Deadhorse and West Dock). In northern Alaska and northern Siberia, where permafrost is cold and deep, thaw of the entire permafrost layer is not imminent. However, in the large areas of discontinuous permafrost of Russia, Alaska, and Canada, average annual temperatures are sufficiently close to freezing that permafrost thaw is a risk within this century. Thawing of permafrost can release methane into the atmosphere, amplifying warming (see Supplemental Message 5), as well as potentially causing infrastructure and environmental damages.\n\nThere is evidence that the active layer (the near-surface layer of seasonal thaw, typically up to three feet deep) may be thickening in many areas of permafrost, including in northern Russia and Canada.152 Permafrost thaw in coastal areas increases the vulnerability of coastlines to erosion by ocean waves, which in turn are exacerbated by the loss of sea ice from coastal areas affected by storms.\nIncreased melt is reducing both the mass and areal extent of glaciers over much of the Northern Hemisphere. Over the past decade, the contribution to sea level rise from glaciers and small ice caps (excluding Greenland) has been comparable to the contributions from the Greenland Ice Sheet.153\nProjections of future mass loss by glaciers and small ice caps indicate a continuation of current trends, although these projections are based only on the changes in temperature and precipitation projected by global climate models; they do not include the effects of dynamical changes (for example, glacier movement). While there is a wide range among the projections derived from different global climate models, the models are consistent in indicating that the effects of melting will outweigh the effects of increases in snowfall. The regions from which the contributions to sea level rise are projected to be largest are the Canadian Arctic, Alaska, and the Russian Arctic.151\n\n774\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nPermafrost Temperatures Rising\n\nFigure 38.

The largest contributions from mountain glaciers have been from the Canadian Arctic and southern Alaska. Note that contributions from mass changes of the Greenland Ice Sheet are not available prior to the mid-1990s, but they are assumed to have been small during this earlier period because annual snow accumulation was in approximate balance with annual meltwater discharge.

Future sea level rise depends on the amount of warming and ice melt around the world as well as local processes like changes in ocean currents and local land subsidence or uplift.\n\nThe rising global average sea level is one of the hallmarks of a warming planet. It will also be one of the major impacts of human-caused global warming on both human society and the natural environment.\nGlobal sea level is increasing as a result of two different processes. First, the oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat trapped by human interference with the climate system, and this warms the oceans.155 Like mercury in a thermometer, the warmer ocean water expands, contributing to global sea level rise. Second, the warmer climate also causes melting of glaciers and ice sheets. This meltwater eventually runs off into the ocean and contributes to sea level rise as well. A recent synthesis of surface and satellite measurements of the ice sheets shows that the rate at which the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets contribute to sea level rise has been increasing rapidly and has averaged 0.02 inches (plus or minus 0.008) per year since 1992, with Greenland's contribution being more than double that of Antarctica.156 In addition, local sea level change can differ from the global average sea level rise due to changes in ocean currents, local land movement, and even changes in the gravitational pull of the ice sheets and changes in Earth's rotation.\n\nThere is high confidence that global sea level will continue to rise over this century and beyond and that most coastlines will see higher water levels. The rates of sea level rise along individual coastlines are difficult to predict, as they can vary depending on the region. For example, globally averaged sea level has risen steadily by about 2.4 inches over the past two decades. But during that time, many regions have seen much more rapid rise while some have experienced falling sea levels. These complicated patterns are caused by changes in ocean currents and movement of heat within the oceans. Many of these patterns are due in part to natural, cyclic changes in the oceans. On the West Coast of the United States, sea level has fallen slightly since the early 1990s. Recent work suggests that a natural cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation has counteracted most or all of the global sea level signal there. This means that in coming decades the West Coast is likely to see faster than average sea level rise as this natural cycle changes phase.157\nAlong any given coastline, determining the rate of sea level rise is complicated by the fact that the land may be rising or sinking. Along the Gulf Coast, for example, local geological factors including extraction of oil, natural gas, and water from under-\n\n777\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\n\nground reservoirs are causing the land to sink, which could increase the effect of global sea level rise by several inches by the end of this century.158 In some other locations, coastlines are rising as they continue to rebound from glaciation during the last glacial maximum. Predicting the future of any single coastline requires intimate knowledge of the local geology as well as the processes that cause sea levels to change at both the local and global scale.\nGreenland and Antarctica hold enough ice to raise global sea levels by more than 200 feet if they were to melt completely. While this is very unlikely over at least the next few centuries, studies suggest that meltwater from ice sheets could contribute anywhere from several inches to 4.5 feet to global sea levels by the end of this century.159 Because their behavior in a warming climate is still very difficult to predict, these two ice\n\nsheets are the biggest wildcards for potential sea level rise in the coming decades. What is certain is that these ice sheets are already responding to the warming of the oceans and the atmosphere. Satellites that measure small changes in the gravitational pull of these two regions have proven that both Greenland and Antarctica are currently losing ice and contributing to global sea level rise.160\nIn the United States, an estimated 5 million people currently live within 4 feet of current high tide lines, which places them at increasing risk of flooding in the coming decades.161 Although sea level rise is often thought of as causing a slow inundation, the most immediate impacts of sea level rise are increases in high tides and storm surges. A recent assessment of flood risks in the United States found that the odds of experiencing a \"100-year flood\" are on track to double by 2030.\n\nSea Level Rise, 1993-2012\n\nFigure 41. The patterns of sea level rise between 1993 and 2012 as measured by satellites. The complicated patterns are a reminder that sea levels do not rise uniformly.162 (Figure source: University of Colorado, Sea Level Research Group).\n\n778\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 3: CLIMATE SCIENCE\nIce Loss from Greenland and Antarctica\n\nFigure 42. Rate of local ice sheet mass loss (in inches of water-equivalent-height per year) from Greenland (left) and Antarctica (right) from 2003 to 2012. The GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites measure changes in the pull of gravity over these two regions. As they lose ice to the oceans, the gravitational pull of Greenland and Antarctica is reduced. Analyses of GRACE data have now proven that both of the major ice sheets are currently contributing to global sea level rise due to ice loss. Over the periods plotted here, Greenland lost enough ice to raise sea level at a rate of 0.028 inches per year (0.72 mm/yr), and Antarctica lost ice at a rate that caused 0.0091 inches of sea level rise per year (0.24 mm/yr).

How can we predict what climate will be like in 100 years if we can't even predict the weather next week?\nPredicting how climate will change in future decades is a different scientific issue from predicting weather a few weeks from now. Weather is short term and chaotic, largely determined by whatever atmospheric system is moving through at the time, and thus it is increasingly difficult to predict day-to-day changes beyond about two weeks into the future. Climate, on the other hand, is a long-term statistical average of weather and is determined by larger-scale forces, such as the level of heattrapping gases in the atmosphere and the energy coming from the sun. Thus it is actually easier to project how climate will change in the future. By analogy, while it is impossible to predict the age of death of any individual, the average age of death of an American can be calculated. In this case, weather is like the individual, while climate is like the average. To extend this analogy into the realm of climate change, we can also calculate the life expectancy of the average American who smokes. We can predict that on average, a smoker will not live as long as a non-smoker. Similarly, we can project what the climate will be like if we emit less heat-trapping gas, and what it will be like if we emit more.\n\nWeather is the day-to-day variations in temperature, precipitation, and other aspects of the atmosphere around us. Weather prediction using state-of-the-art computer models can be very accurate for a few days to more than a week in advance. Because weather forecasts are based on the initial conditions of the atmosphere and ocean at the time the prediction is made, accuracy decays over time. After about two weeks, the effects of small errors in defining these initial conditions grow so large that meteorologists can no longer discern what the weather will be like on any specific day or place.\nClimate is long-term average weather \u00ad the statistics of weather over long time scales, typically of 30 years or more. Climate is primarily the result of the effects of local geography, such as distance from the equator, distance from the ocean, and local topography and elevation, combined with larger scale climate factors that can change over time. These include the amount of energy from the sun and the composition of the atmosphere, including the amount of greenhouse gases and tiny particles suspended in the atmosphere. Knowing all these factors enables scientists to quantify the climate at a given place and time. Climate change occurs when these large-scale climate factors change over time.\n\nThe role of human activities in driving recent change is discussed in FAQ I. (In the context of a changing climate, the term \"human activities\" is used throughout these frequently asked questions to refer specifically to activities, such as extracting and burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture, waste treatment, and so on, that produce heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide and/or emissions of black carbon, sulfate, and other particles.) Other human activities, like changes in land use, can also alter climate, especially on local or regional scales, such as that which occurs with urban heat islands.\nU.S. Annual Average Temperature\n\nUsing our understanding of the physics of how the atmosphere works, we can estimate how climate will change in the future \u00ad in response to human activities, which are now changing Earth's atmospheric composition faster than at any time in at least the last 800,000 years. It is also possible to estimate changes in the statistics of certain types of weather events, such as heat waves or heavy precipitation events, especially when we know what is causing them to change.\n\nWe know how climate has changed in the recent past, and often we know why those changes have occurred. For example, the increase in global temperature, or global warming, that has occurred over the last 150 years can only be explained if we include the impact of increasing levels of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere caused by human activities. The present generation of climate models can successfully reproduce the past warming and therefore provide an essential tool to peer into the future.\n\nFigure 1. Climate change refers to the changes in average weather conditions that persist for an extended period of time, over multiple decades or even longer. Year-to-year and even decade-to-decade conditions do not necessarily tell us much about long-term changes in climate. One cold year, or even a few cold years in a row, does not contradict a longterm warming trend, even as one hot year does not prove it. (Figure source: adapted from Kunkel et al. 20131).\n\n792\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nB. Is the climate changing? How do we know?\nYes. The world has warmed over the last 150 years, and that warming has triggered many other changes to the Earth's climate. Evidence for a changing climate abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans. Changes in surface, atmospheric, and oceanic temperatures; melting glaciers, snow cover, and sea ice; rising sea level; and increase in atmospheric water vapor have been documented by hundreds of studies conducted by thousands of scientists around the world. Rainfall patterns and storms are changing and the occurrence of droughts is shifting.\n\nDocumenting climate change often begins with global average temperatures recorded near Earth's surface, where people live. But these temperatures, recorded by weather stations, are only one indicator of climate change. Additional evidence for a warming world comes from a wide range of consistent measurements of the Earth's climate system. It is the sum total of these indicators that lead to the conclusion that warming of our planet is unequivocal.\n\nAs the troposphere warms, Arctic ice and glaciers melt, also causing sea level to rise. About 90% of the glaciers and landbased ice sheets worldwide are melting as the Earth warms, adding further to the sea level rise. Spring snow cover has decreased across the Northern Hemisphere since the 1950s. There have been substantial losses in sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, particularly at the end of summer when sea ice extent is at a minimum (see FAQ L for discussion of Antarctic sea ice).\n\nEvidence for a changing climate is not confined to the Earth's surface. Measurements by weather balloons and satellites consistently show that the temperature of the troposphere \u00ad the lowest layer of the atmosphere \u00ad has increased. The temperature of the upper atmosphere, particularly the stratosphere, has cooled, consistent with expectations of changes due to increasing concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. The upper ocean has warmed, and more than 90% of the additional energy absorbed by the climate system since the 1960s has been stored in the oceans. As the oceans warm, seawater expands, causing sea level to rise.\n\nWarmer air, on average, contains more water vapor. Globally, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere has increased over the land and the oceans over the last half century. In turn, many parts of the planet have seen increases in heavy rainfall events. All of these indicators and all of the independent data sets for each indicator unequivocally point to the same conclusion: from the ocean depths to the top of the troposphere, the world has warmed and the climate has reacted to that warming.\n\nTen Indicators of a Warming World\n\nFigure 2. These are just some of the many indicators measured globally over many decades that demonstrate that the Earth's climate is warming. White arrows indicate increases, and black arrows show decreases. All the indicators expected to increase in a warming world are increasing, and all those expected to decrease in a warming world are decreasing. See Figure 3 for measurements showing these trends. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC; based on data updated from Kennedy et al. 20102).\n\n793\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nIn summary, the evidence that climate is changing comes from a multitude of independent observations. The evidence that climate is changing because of human activity, as discussed in FAQ I and in more detail in Chapter 2: Our Changing Climate\n\nand Appendix 3: Climate Science Supplement, comes from observations, basic physics, and analyses from modeling studies.\n\nIndicators of Warming from Multiple Data Sets\n\nFigure 3. This figure summarizes some of the many datasets documenting changes in the Earth's climate, all of which are consistent with a warming planet. In all figures except the lower two in the right column, data are plotted relative to averages over the period 1960-1999 (Figure source: updated from Kennedy et al. 20102).\n\n794\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nC. Climate is always changing. How is recent change different than in the past?\nThe Earth has experienced many large climate changes in the past. However, current changes in climate are unusual for two reasons: first, many lines of evidence demonstrate that these changes are primarily the result of human activities (see Question I for more info); and second, these changes are occurring (and are projected to continue to occur) faster than many past changes in the Earth's climate.\n\nIn the past, climate change was driven exclusively by natural factors: explosive volcanic eruptions that injected reflective particles into the upper atmosphere, changes in energy from the sun, periodic variations in the Earth's orbit, natural cycles that transfer heat between the ocean and the atmosphere, and slowly changing natural variations in heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. All of these natural factors, and their interactions with each other, have altered global average temperature over periods ranging from months to thousands of years. For example, past glacial periods were initiated by shifts in the Earth's orbit, and then amplified by resulting decreases in atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and subsequently by greater reflection of solar radiation by ice and snow as the Earth's climate system responded to a cooler climate. Some periods in the distant past were even warmer than what is expected to occur from human-induced global warming. But these changes in the distant past generally occurred much more slowly than current changes.\nNatural factors are still affecting the planet's climate today. The difference is that, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, humans have been increasingly affecting global climate, to the point where we are now the primary cause of recent and projected future change.\n\nCarbon Emissions in the Industrial Age\nFigure 4. Global carbon emissions from burning coal, oil, and gas and from producing cement (1850-2009). These emissions account for about 80% of the total emissions of carbon from human activities, with land-use changes (like cutting down forests) accounting for the other 20% in recent decades. (Data from Boden et al. 20123).\n\nRecords from ice cores, tree rings, soil boreholes, and other forms of \"natural thermometers,\" or \"proxy\" climate data, show that recent climate change is unusually rapid compared to past changes. After a glacial maximum, the Earth typically warms by about 7\u00b0F to 13\u00b0F over thousands of years (with periods of rapid warming alternating with periods of slower warming, and even cooling, during that time). The observed rate of warming over the last 50 years is about eight times faster than the average rate of warming from a glacial maximum to a warm interglacial period.\n\n1700 Years of Temperature Change from Proxy Data\n\nGlobal temperatures over the last 100 years are unusually high when compared to temperatures over the last several thousand years. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are currently higher than any time in at\n\nFigure 5. Changes in the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere from surface observations (in red) and from proxies (in black; uncertainty range represented by shading) relative to 1961-1990 average temperature. These analyses suggest that current temperatures are higher than seen globally in at least the last 1700 years and that the last decade (2001 to 2010) was the warmest decade on record.

Paleoclimate studies indicate that temperature and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been higher in the distant past, millions of years ago, when the world was very different than it is today. But never before have such rapid, global-scale changes occurred during the history of human civilization.\n\nOur societies have not been built to withstand the changes that are anticipated in the relatively near future, and thus are not prepared for the effects they are already experiencing: higher temperatures, sea level rise, and other climate change related impacts.\n\nD. Is the globally averaged surface air temperature still increasing? Isn't there recent evidence that it is actually cooling?\nGlobal temperatures are still rising. Climate change is defined as a change in the average conditions over periods of 30 years or more (see FAQ A). On these time scales, global temperature continues to increase. Over shorter time scales, natural variability (due to the effects of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events in the Pacific Ocean, for example, or volcanic eruptions or changes in energy from the sun) can reduce the rate of warming or even create a temporary reduction in average surface air temperature. These short-term variations in no way negate the reality of long-term warming. The most recent decade was the warmest since instrumental record keeping began around 1880.\n\nFrom 1970 to 2010, for example, global temperature trends taken at five-year intervals show both decreases and sharp\nShort-term Variations Versus Long-term Trend\n\ngreenhouse gases. But while there has been a slowdown in the rate of increase, temperatures are still increasing.\nIn addition, satellite and ocean observations indicate that most of the increased energy in the Earth's climate system from the increasing levels of heat-trapping gases has gone into the oceans. These observations indicate that the Earthatmosphere climate system has continued to gain heat energy.\n\nIn the United States, there has been considerable decade-todecade variability superimposed on the long-term warming trend. In most seasons and regions, the 1930s were relatively warm and the 1960s/1970s relatively cool. The most recent decade of the 2000s was the warmest on record throughout the United States and globally.\n\nFigure 6. Short-term trends in global temperature (blue lines show temperature trends at five-year intervals from 1970 to 2010) can range from decreases to sharp increases. The evidence of climate change is based on long-term trends over 20-30 years or more (red line). (Data from NOAA NCDC).\n\nGlobal Temperature Change: Decade Averages\n\nincreases. The five-year period from 2005 to 2010, for example, included a period in which the sun's output was at a low point, oceans took up more than average amounts of heat, and a series of small volcanoes exerted a cooling influence by adding small particles to the atmosphere. These natural factors are thought to have contributed to a recent slowdown in the rate of increase in average surface air temperature caused by the buildup of human-induced\n\nFigure 7.

Is it getting warmer at the same rate everywhere? Will the warming continue?\nTemperatures are not increasing at the same rate everywhere, because temperature changes in a given location depend on many factors. However, average global temperatures are projected to continue increasing throughout the remainder of this century due to heat-trapping gas emissions from human activities.\n\nThe planet is warming overall (see FAQ I), but some locations could be cooling due to local factors. Temperature changes in a given location are a function of multiple factors, including global and local forces, and both human and natural influences. In some places, including the U.S. Southeast, temperatures actually declined over the last century as a whole (although they have risen in recent decades). Possible causes of the observed lack of warming in the Southeast during the 20th century include increased cloud cover and precipitation,5 increases in the presence of fine particles called aerosols in the atmosphere (including those produced by burning fossil fuels and by natural sources), expanding forests in the Southeast over this period,6 decreases in the amount of heat conducted from land to the atmosphere as a result of increases in irrigation,7 and multi-decadal variability in sea surface temperatures in both the North Atlantic8 and the tropical Pacific9 Oceans. At smaller geographic scales, and during certain time intervals, the relative influence of natural variations in climate compared to the human contribution is larger than at the global scale. An observed decrease in temperature at an individual location does not negate the fact that, overall, the planet is warming.\nIn terms of impacts, \"global warming\" is probably not the most immediate thing most people would notice. A changing climate affects our lives in many more obvious ways, for example, by increasing the risk of severe weather events such as heat waves, heavy precipitation events, strong hurricanes, and many other aspects of climate discussed throughout this report.\n\nFor these reasons, many scientists prefer the term \"climate change,\" which connotes a much larger picture: broad changes in what are considered \"normal\" conditions. This term encompasses both increases and decreases in temperature, as well as shifts in precipitation, changing risk of certain types of severe weather events, and other features of the climate system.\nAt the global scale, some future years will be cooler than the preceding year; some decades could even be cooler than the preceding decade (though that has not happened for more than six decades; see Figure 7). Brief periods of faster temperature increases and also temporary decreases in global temperature can be expected to continue into the future. Nonetheless, each successive decade in the last 30 years has been the warmest in the period of reliable instrumental records (going back to 1850). Based on this historical record and plausible scenarios for future increases in heat-trapping gases, we expect that future global temperatures, averaged over climate timescales of 30 years or more, will be higher than preceding periods as a result of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gas emis-\nDecade-Scale Changes in Average Temperature for U.S. Regions\n\nTemperature Trends, 1900-2012\n\nFigure 8.

There are substantial regional variations in trends across the planet, though the overall trend is warming. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC).\n\nFigure 9.

A portion of the carbon dioxide emissions from human activities will remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and continue to affect the global carbon cycle for thousands of years. Year-to-year projections of\n\nregional and local temperatures are more variable than global\ntemperatures, and even at a particular location, future warming becomes increasingly likely over longer periods of time.1\n\nF. How long have scientists been investigating human influences on climate?\nThe scientific basis for understanding how heat-trapping gases affect the Earth's climate dates back to the French scientist Joseph Fourier, who established the existence of the natural greenhouse effect in 1824. The heat-trapping abilities of greenhouse gases were corroborated by Irish scientist John Tyndall with experiments beginning in 1859. Since then, scientists have developed more tools to refine their understanding of human influences on climate, from the invention of the thermometer, to the development of computerized climate models, to the launching of Earth observing satellites that, together, provide global data coverage.\n\nThe greenhouse effect is caused by heat-trapping gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane, in the Earth's atmosphere. These gases are virtually transparent to the visible and ultraviolet wavelengths that comprise most of the sun's energy, allowing nearly all of it to reach Earth's surface. However, they are relatively opaque to the heat energy the Earth radiates back outward at infrared wavelengths. Other more abundant gases in the atmosphere like nitrogen and oxygen are largely transparent to the Earth's infrared energy. Greenhouse gases trap some of the Earth's energy inside the atmosphere and prevent it from escaping to space by absorbing and re-emitting that energy in all directions, rather than just upwards. Some of the trapped energy is re-radiated back down to the Earth's surface. This natural trapping effect makes the average temperature of the Earth nearly 60\u00b0F warmer than what it would be otherwise. On other planets, like Venus, where there are much higher concentrations of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect has a much stronger influence on surface temperature, making conditions far too hot for life as we know it.\nBy the late 1800s, scientists were aware that burning coal, oil, or natural gas produced carbon dioxide, a key heat-trapping gas. They were also aware that methane, another heat-trap-\n\nping gas, was released during coal mining and other human activities. And they knew that, since the Industrial Revolution, humans were producing increasing amounts of these gases. It was clear that humans were increasing the natural greenhouse effect and that this would warm the planet.\nIn 1890, Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist, calculated the effect of increasing fossil fuel use on global temperature. This climate model, computed by hand, took two years to complete. Arrhenius' results were remarkably similar to those produced by the most up-to-date global climate models today, although he did not anticipate that atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide would increase as quickly as they have.\nIn 1938, a British engineer, Guy Callendar, connected rising carbon dioxide levels to the observed increase in the Earth's temperature that had occurred to date. In 1958, Charles David Keeling began to precisely measure atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide in the relatively unpolluted location of Mauna Loa on Hawai`i. Today, those data provide a clear record of the effect of human activities on the chemical composition of the global atmosphere. Many more sources of data corroborate the work of these early pioneers in the field of climate science.\n\nEarly Scientists who Established the Scientific Basis for Climate Change\n\nFigure 10. Scientists whose research was key to understanding the greenhouse effect and the impact of human activities on climate.\n\n798\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nG. How can the small proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have such a large effect on our climate?\nThe reason heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have such a powerful influence on Earth's climate is their potency: although they are transparent to visible and ultraviolet solar energy, allowing the sun's energy to come in, they are very strong absorbers of the Earth's infrared heat energy, blanketing the Earth and preventing some of the energy to escape to space.\n\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, natural levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere averaged around 280 parts per million (ppm), that is, 280 molecules of CO2 per million molecules of air (which is mostly nitrogen and oxygen). In other words, carbon dioxide made up about 0.028% of the volume of the atmosphere. Methane and nitrous oxide, other heat-trapping gases, made up even less, about 700 parts per billion (ppb) and 270 ppb, respectively. Over the last few centuries, emissions from human activities have increased carbon dioxide levels to about 400 ppm, or more than 3,000 billion tons \u00ad more than a 40% increase. Over the same time period, methane and nitrous oxide levels in the atmosphere have risen to around 1800 ppb and 320 ppb, respectively.\nAs the concentrations in the atmosphere of these heat-trapping gases increase due to human activities, they are absorbing greater and greater amounts of infrared heat energy emitted\n\nfrom the Earth's surface. As discussed in FAQ F, the gases then re-radiate some of this heat back to the surface, effectively trapping the heat inside the Earth's climate system and warming the Earth's surface.\nThese heat-trapping gases do not absorb energy equally across the infrared spectrum. Carbon dioxide absorption is very strong at certain wavelengths of infrared radiation, whereas water vapor absorbs more broadly across most of the spectrum. Water vapor is the most important naturally occurring heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but small increases in heat energy absorption by carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases trigger increases in water vapor that amplify the infrared trapping, leading to further warming. As a result, water vapor is considered a \"feedback\" rather than a direct forcing on climate.\n\nHuman Influence on the Greenhouse Effect\n\nFigure 11. (left) A stylized representation of the natural greenhouse effect. Most of the sun's radiation reaches the Earth's surface. Naturally occurring heat-trapping gases, including water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, do not absorb the shortwave energy from the sun but do absorb the long-wave energy re-radiated from the Earth, keeping the planet much warmer than it would be otherwise. (right) In this stylized representation of the human-intensified greenhouse effect, human activities, predominantly the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), are increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, increasing the natural greenhouse effect and thus Earth's temperature. (Figure source: modified from National Park Service10).\n\n799\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nH. Could the sun or other natural factors explain the observed warming of the past 50 years?\nNo. Since accurate satellite-based measurements of solar output began in 1978, the amount of the sun's energy reaching Earth has slightly decreased, which should, on its own, result in slightly lower temperatures; but the Earth's temperature has continued to rise. The sun can explain less than 10% of the increase in temperature since 1750, and none of the increase in temperature since 1960.\n\nPatterns of vertical temperature change (from the Earth's surface to the upper atmosphere) provide further evidence that the sun cannot be responsible for the observed changes in climate. An increase in solar output would warm the atmosphere consistently from top to bottom. Warming from increasing heat-trapping gases, on the other hand, should be concentrated in the lower atmosphere (troposphere), while the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) would cool. Satellite measurements and weather balloon records reveal that the troposphere has warmed, and the stratosphere has cooled. This observed pattern of vertical temperature change matches what we would expect from the increase in heat-trapping gases, not an increase in solar output.\nChanges in the sun's magnetic field are known to affect the intensity of cosmic rays reaching Earth's atmosphere and there is some suggestion that this could affect cloud formation; however, observations indicate that the magnitude of this effect is much smaller than the effects from the human-related changes in heat-trapping gases and from particle emissions on clouds and the changes in climate.\n\nLarge explosive volcanic eruptions can cool climate for a few years after an eruption, if the eruption is powerful enough to send particles far up into the atmosphere. In the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide from volcanoes is converted into sulfuric acid particles that can scatter sunlight, cooling the Earth's surface. Particles from exceptionally large eruptions like Mount Pinatubo in 1991 or Krakatoa in 1883 can reach all the way into the stratosphere, where they can stay for several years. Eventually, they fall back into the troposphere where they are rapidly removed by precipitation. Volcanoes also emit carbon dioxide, but this amount is less than 1% annually of the emissions occurring from human activities.\nThus, natural factors cannot explain recent warming. In fact, observed solar and volcanic activity would have tended to slightly cool the Earth, and other natural variations are too small to account for the amount of warming over the last 50 years.\n\nMeasurements of Surface Temperature and Sun's Energy\n\nFigure 12. Changes in the global surface temperature (top) and the solar flux (bottom) since 1900 (temperatures are relative to 1961-1990). The temperatures are based on thermometer observations of the Earth's surface temperature, while the solar flux at the top of Earth's atmosphere is based on satellite observations starting in 1978 and on proxy observations before then. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\n800\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nI. How do we know that human activities are the primary cause of recent climate change?\nMany lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities are primarily responsible for recent climate changes. First, basic physics dictates that increasing the concentration of CO2 and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere will cause the climate to warm. Second, modeling studies show that when human influences are removed from the equation, climate would actually have cooled slightly over the past half century. And third, the pattern of warming through the layers of atmosphere demonstrates that human-induced heat-trapping gases are responsible, rather than some natural change.\n\nScientists are continually designing experiments to test whether observed climate changes are unusual and then to determine their causes. This field of study is known as \"detection and attribution.\" Detection involves looking for evidence of changes or trends. Attribution attempts to identify the causes of these changes from a line-up of \"suspects\" that include changes in energy from the sun, powerful volcanic eruptions \u00ad and today, human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases.\nDetection and attribution analyses have confirmed that recent changes cannot have been caused either by internal climate system variations or by solar and volcanic influences (see FAQs C and H). Human influences on the climate system \u00ad including heat-trapping gas emissions, atmospheric particulates, and\n\nland-use and land-cover change \u00ad are required to explain recent changes (see Figure 14).\nDetection and attribution has been used to analyze the contribution of human influences to changes in global average conditions, in extreme events, and even in the change in risk of specific types of events, such as the 2003 European heat wave. Such analyses have found that it is virtually certain that observed changes in many aspects of the climate system are the result of influences of human activities. Scientific analyses also provide extensive evidence that the likelihood of some types of extreme events (such as heavy rains and heat waves) is now significantly higher due to human-induced climate change.\n\nHuman Influences Apparent in Many Aspects of the Changing Climate\n\nFigure 13. Figure shows examples of the many aspects of the climate system in which changes have been formally attributed to human emissions of heat-trapping gases and particles by studies published in peer-reviewed science literature. For example, observed changes in surface air temperature at both the global and continental levels, particularly over the past 50 years or so, cannot be explained without including the effects of human activities. While there are undoubtedly many natural factors that have affected climate in the past and continue to do so today, human activities are the dominant contributor to recently observed climate changes. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC).\n\n801\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nOnly Human Influence Can Explain Recent Warming\n\nFigure 14. Changes in surface air temperature at the continental and global scales can only be explained by the influence of human activities on climate. The black line depicts the annually averaged observed changes. The blue shading represents estimates from a broad range of climate simulations including solely natural (solar and volcanic) changes in forcing. The orange shading is from climate model simulations that include the effects of both natural and human contributions. These analyses demonstrate that the observed changes, both globally and on a continent-by-continent basis, are caused by the influence of human activities on climate.

Is the global surface temperature record good enough to determine whether climate is changing?\nYes. There have been a number of studies that have examined the U.S. and global temperature records in great detail. These have used a variety of methods to study the effects of changes in instruments, time of observations, station siting, and other potential sources of error.

These independently produced estimates are in very good agreement at both global and regional scales.\n\nScientists have also considered other influences that could contaminate temperature records. For example, many thermometers are located in urban areas that could have warmed over time due to the urban heat island effect (in which heat absorbed by buildings and asphalt makes cities warmer than the surrounding countryside). At least three different research teams have examined how this might affect U.S. temperature trends. All have found that\n\nFigure 16. Three different global surface temperature records all show increasing trends over the last century. The lines show annual differences in temperature relative to the 1901-1960 average. Differences among data sets, due to choices in data selection, analysis, and averaging techniques, do not affect the conclusion that global surface temperatures are increasing. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nL. Is Antarctica gaining or losing ice? What about Greenland?\nThe ice sheets on both Greenland and Antarctica, the largest areas of land-based ice on the planet, are losing ice as the atmosphere and oceans warm. This ice loss is important both as evidence that the planet is warming, and because it contributes to rising sea levels.\n\nOne way that scientists are evaluating ice loss is by observing changes in the gravitational fields over Greenland and Antarctica. Fluctuations in the pull of gravity over these major ice sheets reflect the loss of ice over time. Over the last decade, the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellites have measured changes in the gravitational pull of the continents and revealed that, on the whole, both Greenland and Antarctica are losing ice. It is clear that these ice sheets are already losing mass as a result of human-induced climate change, and the evidence suggests that Greenland and Antarctica are likely to continue to lose ice mass for centuries. How\n\nrapidly the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets will melt as warming continues represents the largest uncertainty in projections of future sea level rise.\nPaleoclimate records show that the giant ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica (as well as others, such as the Laurentide Ice Sheet that covered much of North America during the last glacial maximum) have expanded and contracted as the Earth cooled or warmed in the past. As temperature increases and precipitation patterns shift in response to human-induced climate change, scientists expect the ice sheets of Greenland and\n\n804\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nIce Loss from the Two Polar Ice Sheets\n\nFigure 17. GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite measurements show that both Greenland and Antarctica are, on the whole, losing ice as the atmosphere and oceans warm. (Figure source: adapted from Wouters et al. 201313).\n\nAntarctica to continue responding in a similar way. Over time horizons of hundreds to thousands of years, a general melting and reduction in the extent of both of these ice sheets is expected to occur in response to global warming. Over shorter time frames of years to decades, however, the response of these ice sheets is more complicated.\nThe Antarctic Ice Sheet is up to three miles deep and contains enough water to raise sea level about 200 feet. Because Antarctica is so cold, there is little melt of the ice sheet in the summer. However, the ice on the continent slowly flows down the mountains and through the valleys toward the ocean. Some parts of the ice sheet extend out into the ocean as \"ice shelves.\" Here, above-freezing ocean water speeds up the process called \"calving\" that breaks the ice into free floating icebergs. Melting and calving and the flow of ice into the oceans around Antarctica has accelerated in recent decades and is now contributing about 0.005 to 0.010 inches per year to sea level rise. It is possible that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by 10 feet, could begin to lose ice much more quickly if ice shelves in the region begin to disintegrate at the edges.\n\nGreenland contains only about one tenth as much ice as the Antarctic Ice Sheet, but if Greenland's ice were to entirely melt, global sea level would rise 23 feet. Greenland is warmer than Antarctica, so unlike Antarctica, melting occurs over large parts of the surface of Greenland's ice sheet each summer. Greenland's melt area has increased over the past several decades. Satellite measurements indicate that the Greenland Ice Sheet is presently thinning at the edges (especially in the south) and slowly thickening in the interior, increasing the steepness of the ice sheet, which causes the ice to flow toward the ocean. Several of the major outlet glaciers that drain the Greenland Ice Sheet have sped up in the past decade. Recent scientific studies suggest that warming of the ocean at the edges of the outlet glaciers may contribute to this speed-up. Greenland's ice loss has increased substantially in the past decade or two, and is now contributing 0.01 to 0.02 inches per year to sea level rise (about twice the rate of Antarctica's mass loss). This increased rate of ice loss means that Greenland's contribution to global sea level rise is now similar to the effect from smaller glaciers worldwide and from Antarctica.\n\nM. Weren't there predictions of global cooling in the 1970s?\nNo. An enduring myth about climate science is that in the 1970s the climate science community supposedly predicted \"global cooling\" and an \"imminent\" ice age. A review of the scientific literature shows that this was not the case. On the contrary, even then, discussions of human-related warming dominated scientific publications on climate and human influences.\n\nWhere did all the discussion about global cooling come from? First, temperature records from about 1940 to 1970 showed a slight global cooling trend, intensified by temporary increases in snow and ice cover across the Northern Hemisphere. Shortterm natural variations in the Earth's climate (see FAQ A) and increasing emissions of sulfur and other particles from coalburning power plants, which reflect solar energy and have a net cooling effect on the Earth, likely contributed to cooler temperatures during that time period. Several unusually se-\n\nvere winters in Asia and parts of North America in the 1970s raised people's concerns about cold weather. The popular press, including Time, Newsweek, and The New York Times, carried a number of articles about cooling at that time.\nSecond, climate scientists study both natural and humaninduced changes in climate. Over the last century, scientists have learned a great deal about what drives Earth's ice ages. Scientific understanding of what are called the Milankovitch\n\n805\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fcycles (cyclical changes in the Earth's orbit that can explain the onset and ending of ice ages) led a few scientists in the 1970s to suggest that the current warm interglacial period might be ending soon, plunging the Earth into a new ice age over the next few centuries. Scientists continue to study this issue today; the latest information suggests that, if the Earth's climate were being controlled primarily by natural factors, the next cooling cycle would begin sometime in the next 1,500 years. However, humans have so altered the composition of the atmosphere that the next glaciation has now been delayed.\n\nAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nPublished Climate Change Research Papers\nFigure 18.

Bars indicate number of articles published per year. Squares indicate cumulative number of articles published. For the period 1965 through 1979, the literature survey found seven papers suggesting further cooling, 20 neutral, and 44 warming. Even in the early years of the study of climate change, more science studies were discussing concerns about global warming than global cooling. (Figure source: Peterson et al. 200814).\n\nN. How is climate projected to change in the future?\nClimate is projected to continue to warm, with the amount of future warming ranging from another 3\u00b0F to another 12\u00b0F by 2100, depending primarily on the level of emissions from human activities, principally the burning of fossil fuels. For precipitation, wet areas are generally projected to get wetter while dry areas get drier. More precipitation is expected to fall in heavy downpours. Natural variability will still play a role in year-to-year changes.\n\nFuture climate cannot be \"predicted\" because human activities are currently the most important driver of climate change and we cannot predict what society will choose to do with regard to emissions. Rather, we can project the climate change that would result from a given set of assumptions, or future scenarios, regarding human activities (including changes in population, technology, economics, energy, and policy). Future changes also have some uncertainty due to natural variability, particularly over shorter time scales (see FAQ A) and limitations in scientific understanding of exactly how the climate system will respond to human activities (see FAQ S).\nThe relative importance of these three sources of uncertainty changes over time. Which type of uncertainty is most important also depends on what type of change is being projected: whether, for example, it is for average conditions or extremes, or for temperature or precipitation trends (see FAQ S).\nOver the next few decades, global average temperature over 30-year climate timescales is expected to continue to increase (see FAQ D), while natural variability still plays a significant role\n\nin year-to-year changes (see FAQ A). The amount of climate change expected over this time period is unlikely to be significantly altered by reducing current heat-trapping gas emissions alone or even by stabilizing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and other gases. This is because near-term warming will be caused primarily by emissions that have already occurred, due to the lag in the temperature response to changes in atmospheric composition. This lag is primarily the result of the very large heat storage capacity of the world's oceans and the length of time required for that heat to be transferred to the deep ocean. At smaller geographical scales, temperatures are projected to increase in most regions in the next few decades, but a few regions could experience flat or even decreasing temperatures. Any climate change always represents the net effect of multiple global and local factors, both human-related and natural (see FAQ E).\nBeyond the middle of this century, global and regional temperature changes will be determined primarily by the rate and amount of various emissions released by human activities, as well as by the response of the Earth's climate system to those\n\n806\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nemissions. Efforts to rapidly and significantly reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases can still limit the global temperature increase to 3.6\u00b0F (2\u00b0C) relative to the 1901-1960 time period. However, significantly greater temperature increases are expected if emissions follow higher scenarios associated with continuing growth in the use of fossil fuels; in that case, the increase in U.S. average air temperature is likely to exceed 11\u00b0F by the end of this century. This amount of temperature increase would reshape human societies in ways that are almost unthinkable to us today.\n\nObserved and Projected U.S. Temperature Change\n\nPrecipitation patterns are also expected to con-\n\ntinue to change throughout this century and\n\nbeyond. In general, wet areas are projected to\n\nget wetter and dry areas, drier. In some areas,\n\nlocated in between wetter and drier areas, the total amount of precipitation falling over the course of a year is not expected to significantly change. Following the observed trends over recent decades, more precipitation is expected to fall as heavier precipitation events. In many mid-latitude regions, including the United\n\nFigure 19. Projected average annual temperature changes over the contiguous United States for multiple future scenarios relative to the 19011960 average temperature. The dashed lines are results from the previous generation of climate models and scenarios, while solid lines show the most recent generation of climate model simulations and scenarios. Changes in temperature over the U.S. are expected to be higher than the change in global average temperatures (Figure 23). Differences in these projections are principally a result of differences in the scenarios. (Data from CMIP3,\n\nStates, there will be fewer days with precipita- CMIP5, and NOAA NCDC).\n\ntion but the wettest days will be wetter. Large-\n\nscale shifts towards wetter or drier conditions and the project-\n\ned increases in heavy precipitation are expected to be greater\n\nunder higher emissions scenarios as compared to lower ones.\n\nO. Does climate change affect severe weather?\nYes, climate change can and has altered the risk of certain types of extreme weather events. The harmful effects of severe weather raise concerns about how the risk of such events might be altered by climate change. An unusually warm month, a major flood or a drought, a series of intense rainstorms, an active tornado season, landfall of a major hurricane, a big snowstorm, or an unusually severe winter inevitably lead to questions about possible connections to climate change.\n\nFor example, more extreme high temperatures and fewer extreme cold temperatures occur in a warmer climate (although extreme cold events can and do still occur \u00ad just less frequently). In the United States, more than twice as many high temperature records as compared to low temperature records were broken in the period of 2001-2012.\nAlso, in many areas, heavy rainfall events have already, and will continue to become more frequent and severe as climate continues to change. The intensity and rainfall rates of Atlantic hurricanes are projected to increase, with the strongest storms getting stronger. Recent research has shown how climate change can alter atmospheric circulation and weather patterns such as the jet stream, affecting the location, frequency, and\n\nduration of these and other extremes. While there have always been extreme events due to natural causes, scientific evidence indicates that the probability and severity of some types of events has increased due to climate change.\nFor other types of extreme weather events important to the United States, such as tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, more research is needed to understand how climate change will affect them. These events occur over much smaller scales, which makes observations and modeling more challenging. Projecting the future influence of climate change on these events can also be complicated by the fact that some of the risk factors for these events may increase with climate change, while others may decrease.\n\n807\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nP. How are the oceans affected by climate change?\nThe oceans cover more than two-thirds of the Earth's surface and play a very important role in regulating the Earth's climate and in climate change. Today, the world's oceans absorb more than 90% of the heat trapped by increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities. This extra energy warms the ocean, causing it to expand. This in turn causes sea level to rise. Of the global rise in sea level observed over the last 35 years, about 40% is due to this warming of the water. Most of the rest is due to the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. Ocean levels are projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet over this century, with the precise number largely depending on the amount of global temperature rise and polar ice sheet melt.\n\nObservations from past climate combined with climate model projections of the future suggest that over the next 100 years the Atlantic Ocean's overturning circulation (known as the \"Ocean Conveyor Belt\") could slow down as a result of climate change. These ocean currents carry warm water northward across the equator in the Atlantic Ocean, warming the North Atlantic (and Europe) and cooling the South Atlantic. A slowdown of the Conveyor Belt would increase regional sea level rise along the east coast of the United States and change patterns of temperature in Europe and rainfall in Africa and the Americas, but would not lead to global cooling.\n\nof the carbon dioxide produced by human activities every year. The dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid, which makes the water more acidic, making it more difficult for shellfish, corals, and other living things to grow their shells or skeletons. Both the increased acidity and higher temperature of the oceans are expected to negatively affect corals and other living things over the coming decades and beyond.\nCoral Bleaching\n\nWarming ocean waters also affect marine ecosystems like coral reefs, which can be very sensitive to temperature changes. When water temperatures become too high, coral expel the algae (called zooxanthellae) which help nourish them and give them their vibrant color. This is known as coral bleaching. If the high temperatures persist, the coral die.\n\nIn addition to the warming, the acidity of seawater is increasing as a direct result of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (see FAQ Q). The oceans are now absorbing about a quarter\n\nFigure 20. (Photo) Bleached brain coral; (Maps) The global extent and severity of mass coral bleaching have increased worldwide over the last decade.

What is ocean acidification?\nAs human-induced emissions of carbon dioxide build up in the atmosphere, excess carbon dioxide dissolves into the oceans, where it reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid, which makes ocean waters more acidic and corrosive. These changes to ocean chemistry can affect many living things, and possibly the entire food web.\n\nDissolved calcium and carbonate ions are the building blocks they require CO2 to live, as do plants on land.

When shelled spe-\n\ncies are at risk, the entire food web may also be at risk.\n\nSince the beginning of the Industrial Revolu-\n\ntion, the pH of surface ocean waters has fallen by 0.1 pH units, representing approximately a\n\nOcean Acidification and the Food Web\n\n30% increase in acidity. The oceans will con-\n\ntinue to absorb carbon dioxide produced by\n\nhuman activities and become even more acidic\n\nin the future.

How reliable are the computer models of the Earth's climate?\nClimate models are used to analyze past changes in the long-term averages and variations in temperature, precipitation, and other climate indicators, and to make projections of how these trends may change in the future. Today's climate models do a good job at reproducing the broad features of the present climate and changes in climate, including the significant warming that has occurred over the last 50 years. Hence, climate models can be useful tools for testing the effects of changes in the factors that drive changes in climate, including heat-trapping gases, particulates from human and volcanic sources, and solar variability.\n\nScientists have amassed a vast body of knowledge regarding the physical world. Unlike many areas of science, however, scientists who study the Earth's climate cannot build a \"control Earth\" and conduct experiments on this Earth in a lab. To experiment with the Earth, scientists instead use this accumulated knowledge to build climate models, or \"virtual Earths.\" In studying climate change, these virtual Earths serve as an important way to integrate different kinds of knowledge of how the climate system works. These models can be used to test scientific understanding of the response of the Earth's climate to past changes (such as the transition from the last glacial maximum to our current warm interglacial period) as well as to develop projections of future changes (such as the response of the Earth's climate to human activities).\n\nClimate models are based on mathematical and physical equations representing the fundamental laws of nature and the many processes that affect the Earth's climate system. When the atmosphere, land, and ocean are divided up into small grid cells and these equations are applied to each grid cell, the models can capture the evolving patterns of atmospheric pressures, winds, temperatures, and precipitation. Over longer timeframes, these models simulate wind patterns, high and low pressure systems, and other weather characteristics that make up climate.\nSome important physical processes are represented by approximate relationships because the processes are not fully understood, or they are at a scale that a model cannot directly\n\n809\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nrepresent. Examples include clouds, convection, and turbulent mixing of the atmosphere, for which important processes are much smaller than the resolution of current models. These approximations lead to uncertainties in model simulations of climate.\nClimate models require enormous computing resources, especially to capture the geographical details of climate. Today's\n\nmost powerful supercomputers are enabling climate scientists to more thoroughly examine effects of climate change in ways that were impossible just five years ago. Over the next decade, computer speeds are predicted to increase another 100 fold or more, permitting even more details of the climate system to be explored.\n\nClimate Models and Temperature Change\n\nFigure 22. The large-scale geographical patterns and approximate magnitude of the surface air temperature trend from 1980 to 2005 from observational data (left) is approximately captured by computer models of the climate system (right). The pattern from the computer models is an average based on 43 different global climate models (CMIP5) used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report. The observations are a combination of both the human contribution to recent warming as well as the natural temperature variations. Averaging these model simulations suppresses the natural variations and thus shows mainly the human contribution, which is the reason that the smaller-scale details are different between the two maps. (Figure source: NOAA NCDC / CICS-NC).\n\nS. What are the key uncertainties about climate change?\nAvailable evidence gives scientists confidence that humans are having a significant effect on climate and will continue to do so over this century and beyond. In particular, continued use of fossil fuels and resulting emissions will significantly alter climate and lead to a much warmer world. Of course, it is impossible to predict the future with absolute certainty. The precise amount of future climate change that will occur over the rest of this century is uncertain for several reasons.\n\nFirst, projections of future climate changes are usually based on scenarios (or sets of assumptions) regarding how future emissions may change as a result of population, energy, technology, and economics. Society may choose to reduce emissions or to continue to increase them. The differences in projected future climate under different scenarios are generally small for the next few decades. By the second half of the century, however, human choices, as reflected in these scenarios, become the key determinant of future climate change. And human choices are nearly impossible to predict.\nA second source of uncertainty is natural variability, which affects climate over timescales from months to decades. These\n\nnatural variations are largely unpredictable and are superimposed on the warming from increasing heat-trapping gases. Uncertainty in the sun's future output is another source of variability that is independent of human actions. Estimates of past changes in solar variability over the last several millennia suggest that the magnitude of solar effects over this century are likely to be small compared to the magnitude of the climate change effects projected from human activities.\nA third source of uncertainty involves limitations to our current scientific knowledge. The Earth's climate system is complex, and continues to challenge scientists' understanding of exactly how it may respond to human influences.

Projected global average annual temperature changes for multiple future scenarios relative to the 1901-1960 average temperature. Each line represents a central estimate of global average temperature rise for a specific emissions pathway. Shading indicates the range (5th to 95th percentile) of results from a suite of climate models. The left panel shows results from the previous generation of climate models (CMIP3), and the right panel shows results from the most recent generation of climate models (CMIP5). Projections in 2099 for additional emissions pathways are indicated by the bars to the right of each panel. In all cases, temperatures are expected to rise, although the difference between lower and higher emissions pathways is substantial. (Data from CMIP3, CMIP5, and NOAA NCDC).\n\ntions of the climate system have expanded substantially since the beginning of the satellite era, but are still limited. Climate models differ in the way they represent various processes (for example, cloud properties, ocean circulation, and turbulent mixing of air). As a result, different models produce slightly different projections of change, even when the models use the same scenarios. Scientists often use multiple models in order to represent this range of projected outcomes.\nFinally, there is always the possibility that there are processes and feedbacks not yet being included in future projections. For\n\nexample, as the Arctic warms, carbon trapped in permafrost may be released into the atmosphere, increasing the initial warming due to human emissions of heat-trapping gases (see FAQ T).\nHowever, for a given future scenario, the amount of future climate change can be specified within plausible bounds, determined not only from the differences in the \"climate sensitivity\" among models but also from information about climate changes in the past.\n\nT. Are there tipping points in the climate system?\nMost climate studies have considered only relatively gradual, continuous changes in the Earth's climate system. However, there are a number of potential \"tipping points\" in the climate system \u00ad points where a threshold is crossed, resulting in a substantial change in the future state of the climate system, regionally and/or globally.\n\nScientists have identified several aspects of the climate system that could pass a tipping point and/or change substantially under projected climate change (see Figure 24 for key examples). These tipping points have been identified based on observations of past abrupt climate changes, recent observations showing abrupt changes underway (for example, in the Arctic), process-based understanding of the dynamics of the climate system, and climate simulations showing tipping points in future projections. There is no clear scientific consensus at this\n\ntime as to whether major tipping points, other than loss of the Arctic sea ice in summer, will be reached during this century.\nSome tipping points are more imminent, and some would have larger impacts than others. For example, the rapid decline of Arctic sea ice exposes the darker ocean surface which absorbs increasing amounts of heats and reduces the amount of new seasonal ice formed. This drastic reduction in sea ice can tip the Arctic Ocean into a permanent, nearly ice-free state in summer (Ch.2: Our Changing Climate, Key Message 11). There is some\n\n811\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nPotential Tipping Points\n\nFigure 24. Stylized map of potential policy-relevant tipping elements in the Earth's climate system overlain on population density. Question marks indicate systems whose status as tipping elements is particularly uncertain. (Figure source: adapted from Lenton et al. 200817)\n\nevidence that reductions in ice cover are already leading to changes in weather patterns affecting the U.S. and Europe.\nCurrently, the proximity, rate, and reversibility of tipping points are usually assessed through a mixture of climate modeling, literature review, and expert elicitation. However, there is a need for more research in this area. Climate scientists cannot predict when tipping points will be crossed because of uncertainties in the climate system and because we do not know what pathway future emissions will take. But an absence of\n\ncertainty does not indicate an absence of risk. To use a medical analogy, just because your doctor cannot tell you the precise date and time that you will have a heart attack does not mean you should ignore medical advice to reduce your risk by taking preventative measures like exercising more, losing weight, and changing your diet. Medical science is imperfect, just like climate science, but it can provide very useful advice regarding the risks of our actions and choices \u00ad and the benefits of preventative measures.\n\nU. How is climate change affecting society?\nMultiple lines of evidence show that climate change is happening as a result of human activities. Climate change is altering the world around us, and these changes will become increasingly evident with each passing decade. Climate change is already leading to more intense rainfall events and other extreme weather patterns. It will lead to more droughts in some areas, more floods in others, and more frequent heat waves in many areas. Changing temperature and precipitation patterns, as well as increasing sea level, are important factors affecting various parts of the United States. For example, the risks associated with wildfires in the western U.S. are increasing, and coastal inundation is becoming a common occurrence in low-lying areas. Water supply availability is changing in many parts of the United States.\n\nMany people are already being affected by the changes that are occurring, and more will be affected as these changes continue to unfold. To limit risks and maximize opportunities associated with the changes, it would be helpful for people to\n\nunderstand how climate change could affect them and what they can do to adapt, as well as what can be done to reduce future climate change by reducing global emissions.\n\n812\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nTaking actions to reduce the emissions that cause climate change has costs. Not taking those actions has much greater costs.18\nClimate change will affect ecosystems and human systems \u00ad such as agricultural, transportation, water resources, and health-related infrastructure \u00ad in ways we are only beginning to understand. Moreover, climate change interacts with other stressors, such as population increase, land-use change, and economic and political changes, in ways that we may not be able to anticipate, compounding the risks.\nIn general, the larger and faster the changes in climate, the more difficult it is for human and natural systems to adapt.\n\nThe climate system has been relatively stable during the time that human civilizations have existed. Essentially, today's built infrastructure has been developed based on the assumption that future climate will be like that of the past. This assumption is no longer valid.\nSince climate change is already occurring, adaptation in some form is inevitable. The choice is between proactive adaptation (planning ahead to limit impacts) or reactive adaptation (where responses occur only after damages are already incurred). The America's Climate Choices reports from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences discuss these issues in details.\n\nPotential Effects of Climate Change\n\nFigure 25. Climate change is likely to affect human society and the natural environment in many ways. The National Climate Assessment's sectoral impacts chapters examine these impacts by category in detail. (Figure source: adapted from Phillipe Rekacewicz UNEP/GRID-Arendal 2012, \"Vital Climate Graphics\" collection19).\n\n813\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nV. Are there benefits to warming?\nSome climate changes currently have beneficial effects for specific sectors or regions. For example, current benefits of warming include longer growing seasons for agriculture and longer ice-free periods for shipping on the Great Lakes. At the same time, however, longer growing seasons, along with higher temperatures and carbon dioxide, can increase pollen production, intensifying and lengthening the allergy season. Longer ice-free periods on the Great Lakes can result in more lake-effect snowfalls.\n\nMany analyses of this question have concluded that there will be more negative effects than positive ones. This is largely because our society and infrastructure have been built for the climate of the past, and any rapid change from that climate imposes difficulties and costs. For example, many major cities are located on the coasts where they are now vulnerable to sea\n\nlevel rise. And there has been rapid population growth in the U.S. Southwest, where increasing heat and drought threaten water supplies and cause increased wildfires. In addition, ecosystems that we rely on for our food and water are adapted to the cooler climate that our planet has experienced over recent centuries.\n\nW. Are some people more vulnerable than others?\nPeople will be affected by climate change in various ways, but some groups are more vulnerable than others. For example, the poor, the very young, and some older people have less mobility and fewer resources to cope with extremely high temperatures, increased water scarcity, environmental degradation, and other impacts. People living in flood plains, coastal zones, and some urban areas are generally more vulnerable as well.\n\nChildren, primarily because of physiological and developmental factors, will disproportionately suffer from the effects of heat waves, air pollution, infectious illness, and trauma resulting from extreme weather events. The country's older population also could be harmed more as the climate changes. Older people are at much higher risk of dying during extreme heat events. Pre-existing health conditions also make older adults susceptible to cardiac and respiratory impacts of air pollution and to more severe consequences from infectious diseases. Limited mobility among older adults can also increase\n\nflood-related health risks. Limited resources and an already high burden of chronic health conditions, including heart disease, obesity, and diabetes, will place the poor at higher risk of health impacts from climate change than higher income groups. Potential increases in food cost and limited availability of some foods will exacerbate current dietary inequalities and have significant health ramifications for the poorer segments of our population.\n\n814\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nX. Are there ways to reduce climate change?\nThe most direct way to significantly reduce the magnitude of future climate change is to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases. Emissions can be reduced in many ways, and increasing the efficiency of energy use is an important component of many potential strategies. For example, because about 28% of the energy used in the U.S. is used for transportation, developing and driving more efficient vehicles and changing to fuels that do not contribute significantly to heat-trapping gas emissions over their lifetimes would result in fewer emissions per mile driven. A large amount of energy in the U.S. is also used to heat and cool buildings, so changes in building design could dramatically reduce energy use. While there is no single silver bullet that will solve all the challenges posed by climate change, there are many options that can reduce our emissions and help prevent some of the potentially serious impacts of climate change. There will be some costs to these changes, but even very ambitious emissions reductions targets have relatively small costs over the decades it will take to implement them.\n\nBecause impacts are already occurring and anticipated to increase, adaptation to the impacts of climate change will be required. Adaptation decisions range from being better prepared for extreme events such as floods and droughts, to identifying economic opportunities that come from investments in adaptation and mitigation strategies and technologies, to integrating considerations of new climate-related risks into city planning, public health and emergency preparedness, and ecosystem management.\n\nTechnological fixes such as \"geoengineering\" may be possible, but at least some such proposals would do nothing to slow ocean acidification, and would need to be done indefinitely. There are a wide variety of potential risks of geoengineering schemes, which are very poorly understood (see FAQ Z).\n\nMultiple Pathways for Reducing U.S. Emissions\n\nFigure 26. Reducing carbon emissions from a higher pathway (here, RCP 8.5) to a lower pathway (here, RCP 4.5) can be accomplished with a combination of many technologies and policies, illustrated here based on the \"wedges\" concept pioneered by Pacala and Socolow in 2004.20 These wedges could include increasing the energy efficiency of appliances, vehicles, buildings, electronics, and electricity generation (orange wedges); reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuels by switching to lowercarbon fuels or capturing and storing carbon (blue wedges); and switching to renewable and non-carbon emitting sources of energy, including solar, wind, wave, biomass, tidal, and geothermal (green wedges). The shapes and sizes of the wedges shown here are illustrative only. (Data from Boden et al. 201221).\n\n815\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nY. Are there advantages to acting sooner rather than later?\nThe effects of current emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases on climate can take decades to fully manifest themselves. The resulting change in climate and the impacts of those changes can then persist for a long time. The longer these changes in climate continue, the greater the resulting impacts. It will become increasingly costly to adapt, and some systems will not be able to adapt if the change is too much or too fast. Thus it is not surprising that recent reports from the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, including America's Climate Choices22 and America's Energy Future,23 have concluded that the environmental, economic, and humanitarian risks posed by climate change indicate a pressing need for substantial action to limit the magnitude of climate change and to prepare to adapt to its impacts. They also concluded that substantial reductions of heat-trapping gas emissions should be among the nation's highest priorities.\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences and others have concluded that acting now will reduce the risks posed by climate change and the pressure to make larger, more rapid, and potentially more expensive reductions later. Actions taken to reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts can be considered as investments that can make sense economically, especially if they also offer protection against natural climate variations and extreme events. In addition, investment decisions made now about equipment and infrastructure can \"lock in\" emissions of heat-trapping gases for decades to come. Finally, while it may be possible to alter our responses to climate change, it is difficult or impossible to \"undo\" climate change once it has occurred.\n\nCurrent efforts at local and state levels, and by the private sector, are important, but are insufficient to limit warming to the lower scenarios described throughout this report. Thus, numerous analyses have called for policies that establish coherent national and international goals and incentives, and that promote strong U.S. engagement in international-level response efforts. The National Academy of Sciences found that the inherent complexities and uncertainties of climate change will be best met by applying a risk management approach and by making efforts to significantly reduce heat-trapping gas emissions; prepare for adapting to impacts; invest in scientific research, technology development, and information systems; and facilitate engagement between scientific and technical experts and the many types of people making America's climate choices.\n\nTwo U.S. Emissions-Reduction Pathways\n\nFigure 27. This graph shows how earlier action to reduce U.S. emissions would be less difficult than delayed action. Two pathways show how a cumulative carbon emissions budget of 265 gigatons of CO2 could be maintained by 2050. By initiating reduced emissions efforts in 2010 (blue line), a 4% per year reduction would have been required; waiting until 2020 to reduce emissions (red line) doubles the rate at which emissions must be reduced. (Figure source: Luers et al. 200724)\n\n816\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nZ. Can we reverse global warming?\nWhile we can't stop climate change in its tracks, we can limit it to less dangerous levels by reducing our emissions. Even if all human-related emissions of carbon dioxide and the other heat-trapping gases were to stop today, Earth's temperature would continue to rise for a number of decades and then slowly begin to decline. However, focusing on short-lived types of emissions, such as methane and black carbon (soot), can reduce the rate of change in the near term. Because of the complex processes controlling carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, even after more than a thousand years, the global temperature would still be higher than it was in the pre-industrial period. As a result, without technological intervention, it will not be possible to totally reverse climate change. We do face a choice between a little more warming and lot more warming, however. The amount of future warming will depend on our future emissions.\n\nIn theory, it may be possible to reverse global warming through technological interventions called geoengineering. Three types of geoengineering approaches have been proposed to alter\n\nthe climate system: 1) enhancing the natural processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere; 2) altering the amount of the sun's energy that reaches the Earth (referred to\n\nEmissions Reductions and Carbon Dioxide Concentrations\n\nFigure 28. To reduce the changes occurring in climate, we would need to stabilize atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, not simply stabilize current emission levels of carbon dioxide. Just stabilizing emissions still leads to increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, because emissions are greater than the sinks that remove it (blue lines). To stabilize levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, emissions would need to be reduced significantly, on the order of 80% or more compared to the present day (green lines). The lower graph shows how carbon dioxide concentrations would be expected to evolve depending upon emissions for one illustrative case, but this applies for any chosen target.

At this time, however, there is no indication that any of them could be implemented on a large enough scale to have a significant effect. Investments in limiting emissions, combined with capturing and storing carbon, could possibly reverse the warming trend, but it remains to be seen if this is feasible.\nArtificial injection of stratospheric particles and cloud brightening are two examples of \"solar radiation management\" techniques. The cooling effect that some types of particles have on the atmosphere has led to the proposal of an array of possible geoengineering projects, especially with the goal\n\nof offsetting the warming until more non-fossil fuel energy is put into place. However, the climate system is complex and experimenting without complete understanding could result in unintended and potentially dangerous side effects on our health, ecosystems, agricultural yields, and even the climate itself. Even if such engineering approaches were economically feasible, the potential impacts on the environment need to be better understood. One important consideration regarding solar radiation management is that ocean acidification would still continue even if warming could otherwise be reduced by reflecting light away from our atmosphere. Much more research is needed to see if such approaches could be environmentally feasible. In the meantime, there are significant concerns about ecological and other side effects of some of these technologies.\n\n818\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 4: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Different amounts of heat-trapping gases released into the atmosphere by human activities produce different projected increases in Earth's temperature. In the figure, each line represents a central estimate of global average temperature rise for a specific emissions pathway (relative to the 1901-1960 average). Shading indicates the range (5th to 95th percentile) of results from a suite of climate models. Projections in 2099 for additional emissions pathways are indicated by the bars to the right of each panel. In all cases, temperatures are expected to rise, although the difference between lower and higher emissions pathways is substantial. (Left) The panel shows the two main scenarios (SRES \u00ad Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) used in this report: A2 assumes continued increases in emissions throughout this century, and B1 assumes much slower increases in emissions beginning now and significant emissions reductions beginning around 2050, though not due explicitly to climate change policies. (Right) The panel shows newer analyses, which are results from the most recent generation of climate models (CMIP5) using the most recent emissions pathways (RCPs \u00ad Representative Concentration Pathways). Some of these new projections explicitly consider climate policies that would result in emissions reductions, which the SRES set did not.8 The newest set includes both lower and higher pathways than did the previous set. The lowest emissions pathway shown here, RCP 2.6, assumes immediate and rapid reductions in emissions and would result in about 2.5\u00b0F of warming in this century. The highest pathway, RCP 8.5, roughly similar to a continuation of the current path of global emissions increases, is projected to lead to more than 8\u00b0F warming by 2100, with a high-end possibility of more than 11\u00b0F. (Data from CMIP3, CMIP5, and NOAA NCDC).\n\nEmissions scenarios\nTwo SRES global emissions scenarios were recommended for use by the authors of this report for impact studies. One is a higher emissions scenario (the A2 scenario from SRES) and the other is a lower emissions scenario (the B1 scenario from SRES). These two scenarios do not encompass the full range of possible futures: emissions could change less than those scenarios imply, or they could change even more. Recent carbon dioxide emissions have, in fact, been higher than in the A2 scenario. Whether this trend will continue is not possible to predict because it depends on societal choices.\n\n822\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\fAPPENDIX 5: SCENARIOS AND MODELS\n\nSea Level Rise Scenarios\n\nAfter at least two thousand years of little change, global sea additional water flows into the oceans.

Historical, observed, and possible future amounts of global sea level rise from 1800 to 2100. Historical estimates4 (based on sediment records and other proxies) are shown in red (pink band shows uncertainty range), tide gauge measurements in blue,5 and satellite observations in green.6 The future scenarios displayed here range from 8 inches to 6.6 feet in 2100.3 Sea level rise lower than 8 inches or higher than 6.6 feet is considered implausible by 2100. The orange line at right shows the currently projected range of sea level rise of 1 to 4 feet by 2100. The large range primarily reflects uncertainty about how ice sheets will respond to the warming ocean and atmosphere, and to changing winds and currents.

The following are important topics that could not be adequately covered in this report. In preparation for future synthesis reports, these are some topics that could be considered.\n\nEconomic Analyses\nDocumenting the costs of climate change impacts is extremely social stresses are likely to be valued differently by different challenging because these impacts occur across multiple re- individuals and communities. Finally, it is challenging to asgions and sectors and over multiple time frames.

Also, while some types of events in the past. extreme weather events are made more frequent and/or intense by climate change, it is rare that any event has a single A number of studies have produced estimates of the economic cause. Since such events generally result from a combination damages expected from future climate change. However, of natural variability and climate change, it is difficult to assign there are currently no total economic damage estimates that a precise proportion of the costs associated with a particular are based on valuing and aggregating the various regional and event to climate change. Further, many impacts occur in ways sectoral impacts that are the focus of this assessment. Underthat are difficult to translate into precise economic costs; for standing these impacts in more detail could provide important example, impacts to biodiversity, changes in quality of life, or input for adaptation and mitigation decisions.\n\nNational Security\nThe implications of climate change for U.S. national security dent to expect that over the course of a decade some climate are significant, but they have not been analyzed in detail in this events...will produce consequences that exceed the capacity report because there are a number of recent unclassified U.S. of the affected societies or global systems to manage and that Department of Defense (DoD) reports and reports of other have global security implications serious enough to compel groups that have rigorously addressed this topic.
