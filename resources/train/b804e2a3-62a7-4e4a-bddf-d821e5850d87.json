[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Named storms can cause substantial impacts on the habitat and reproductive output of threatened species, such as marine turtles. To determine the impacts of named storms on marine turtles and inform management, it is necessary to determine the exposure of marine turtle nesting grounds to recent storm activities. To address this, remote sensing information of named storm tracks coupled with nesting ground data were used to investigate the temporal and spatial overlap between nesting grounds for four species of marine turtles in the continental United States of America. All species of marine turtles were exposed to named storms, with variation in exposure driven by the spatial distribution of each population's nesting ground, the temporal overlap between the storms and reproductive events, and nest placement on the beach. Loggerhead turtles were the most exposed species to named storms, with the northern management unit having significantly higher exposure levels than all other loggerhead management units. Kemp's ridley turtles, in contrast, were found to be the least exposed species to named storms. This study establishes a valuable current baseline against which to measure and compare future impacts that result as climate change progresses and storms become more frequent and intense. Importantly, cumulative and synergetic effects from other climatic processes and anthropogenic stressors should be considered in future analysis."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Understanding the spatial and temporal exposure of biodiversity to specific threats is crucial for targeted management and their conservation.

Marine turtle nesting and hatching seasons vary among species and locations across the eastern USA coast, but in general, the nesting season spans from May through August for loggerhead turtles [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] , June through September for green turtles [44, 45, 47] , March through July for leatherback turtles [48, 49] , and April through June for Kemp's ridley turtles [35] .

Spatial data of each named storm (n = 159 tropical storms and hurricanes; hereafter \"named storms\" for simplicity) in the North Atlantic region between 2008 and 2018 were downloaded from the National Hurricane Center database (\"Best Track\" available at https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gis/; downloaded November 2018).

We selected only the tropical storm wind force swaths (34 kt), to explore the minimum impact of each named storm across its entire geographical extent. For a small subset of named storms (8 out of 159) for which wind swaths were not available, we used the named storm tracks from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTraCS) dataset [53] ; available at https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ibtracs/index.php). Because IBTraCS datasets only include the central track of a named storm, we buffered each track by 40 km to have a representation of the minimum extent of impact of that particular named storm [13] . We summed the occurrence of named storms at each grid cell (15 km grid resolution) to create a rasterized map of the total frequency of named storms.

Hurricane Florence was accompanied by a storm surge of 2-4 meters and a devastating rainfall of 51-76 cm, which caused extensive flooding and damage to coastal areas.\nHatching success of individual nests was evaluated by examining contents of each nest 72 hours after primary emergence of hatchlings or after 70 days of incubation if there was no sign of hatchling emergence. In cases where nest markers were lost due to the hurricane, efforts were made to find any remaining contents of the nests by digging in the sand near the nest's recorded GPS location. If no nest contents were found, the nest was assumed to have been lost to erosion associated with the storm and assigned 0% hatching success. Eight nests could not be assigned hatching success due to other circumstances (e.g., coyote predation around the time of expected emergence) and were removed from the analyses. Nests were grouped as pre-hurricane Florence if they had been laid on or before 19 July, which is 57 days prior to September 10, and as post-hurricane Florence if they were laid after 19 July.

Named storm frequency along Kemp's ridley nesting grounds was on average one named storm every three years."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "All species of marine turtles nesting in the continental USA are exposed to named storms and associated impacts. Variation in exposure to named storms was driven by the spatial distribution of each population's nesting grounds, with populations nesting in the northern extent of the eastern USA from Georgia to North Carolina being the most exposed. Consequently, loggerhead turtles were found to be the most exposed species, with the northern management unit having significantly higher exposure levels than all other loggerhead management units. Kemp's ridley turtles, in contrast, were found to be the least exposed species to named storms given their restrained geographic extent, with nesting only on the western coast of the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe impact that each nesting ground species, and ultimately populations will experience from named storms is a function of their exposure to the storms, the temporal overlap between the storms and nesting and hatching, the importance of each of the nesting grounds in terms of numbers of incubating eggs during the storm, and nest placement on the beach [13, 14] . In our study, a significantly higher number of named storms occurred during the summer months which overlaps with marine turtle nesting and hatching season in the region. However, leatherback turtles and Kemp's ridley turtles have been less exposed to storms as they nest earlier in the season (the first half of their nesting season occurs outside the hurricane season) and thus their eggs are exposed to storms for a shorter period (only the beginning of the storm season, which historically has had fewer storms). Nevertheless, our work indicates that storm frequency is becoming more evenly distributed throughout the storm season, due to the increased duration of storm effects, which could have a larger effect on all marine turtle nesting and hatching in the southeast USA due to the prolonged duration of storm effects.\nThis increase in exposure can have negative impacts on the reproductive output of marine turtles at each nesting ground. As indicated by our case study and other studies, named storms can dramatically decrease hatching success and overall productivity [18, 20, 59] . Impacts on the overall productivity of nesting populations will be driven by the importance of the nesting ground (in terms of the percentage of turtles from a population that nests on that site) that the named storm hits. Indeed, Fuentes et al. [13] found that the impacts of named storms to the northern Great Barrier Reef green turtle population can be 100 times higher if it hits the main nesting sites for this population rather than a trivial nesting ground. In our study, high levels of exposure to named storms were recorded in very high-density nesting grounds used by the northern management unit (Cape Island and Lighthouse Island) and high-density nesting grounds (Cape St. George and St. Joseph Peninsula) used by the north-western management unit. Aperiodic impacts from named storms might be an issue particularly for the north-western management unit as it is one of the smallest loggerhead management units within the Northwest Atlantic Ocean Distinct Population Segment [60] . Thus, any impact to this management unit can have severe implications for population stability.\nNest placement on a beach will also affect the impact that named storms will have on overall reproductive output, with nests being placed closer to the high tide line being more vulnerable [61, 62] . In our case study, distance (i.e., km) from where the hurricane made landfall seems to have made little impact on the overall hatching success of loggerhead nests deposited post-Hurricane Florence.\nIn contrast, green turtle eggs on beaches further away from the hurricane had significantly higher hatching success. This might be due to species-specific differences in nest-site selection relative to the dune line: on the same nesting grounds, green turtles tend to lay their eggs closer to the dune line than loggerhead turtles, which tend to nest closer to the high tide line [63] . This difference may protect green sea turtle nests from excessive washover.\nEven though named storms can directly impact nests that are incubating at the time of landfall, some of the reproductive strategies used by marine turtles can help mitigate the impacts of these discrete events and allow faster than expected recovery from disturbances [14] . Traits include large clutches (approximately 100 eggs/clutch), laying multiple clutches within a nesting season (2-7 clutches depending on species) which are spaced throughout the season (2-3 weeks apart), and extended nesting seasons (several months) [64] . Nevertheless, despite marine turtles having these traits and the ability to withstand the loss of a single cohort of eggs [65] , frequent disturbances to incubating eggs (and thus low hatching success over time) from named storms can potentially have a profound effect on the longer-term reproductive output of a population, potentially exerting substantial selective pressures [13, 66, 67] . This might have been the case for marine turtles nesting in the eastern Queensland coast of Australia, as they currently nest in areas with historically low incidence of tropical cyclones [13] . It was hypothesized by the authors that areas with a high incidence of tropical cyclones might have substantially affected nesting and/or hatching success over time, reducing the number of turtles that return to nest in these areas over several generations [13] , which would mean that cyclone activity was an important factor in shaping the distribution of marine turtle nesting grounds along the eastern Queensland coast. Such effects still need to be assessed in the USA.\nAs climate change progresses, storms may become more frequent and intense [68] and sea level may continue to rise, potentially causing significant alteration of the physical structure of nesting grounds. This coupled with contemporary anthropogenic threats (e.g., coastal development, pollution), may hinder the ability of marine turtle traits to buffer impacts from named storms. This highlights the need to understand how predicted changes in named storm frequency and distribution may affect marine turtle populations; studies such as the present one will provide baseline information for comparison. Future studies should also explore how different pressures (e.g., storm surge, temperature, rainfall), associated with named storms affect hatching success to provide further insights into how named storms with different characteristics may affect marine turtle reproductive output at a site. Importantly, cumulative and synergetic effects from other climatic processes and anthropogenic stressors also need to be considered. Climate processes will not act in isolation and they may produce unexpected changes in combination with local conditions and other pressures [69, 70] . For example, seawalls and other structures to protect beaches in Florida from erosion associated with named storms can impede reproductive female marine turtles from accessing nesting habitat [71] . Additionally, the number of structures placed on some beaches increased following named storms [72] , suggesting that in the future nesting females may face impediments to nesting grounds more frequently, as the frequency of named storms increases."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Remote sensing information on named storm track proved useful in determining the exposure of marine turtle nesting grounds to named storms and identifying populations and species at most risk from impacts. Our broad-scale assessment allowed us to identify areas with higher exposure to named storms, which warrants site-specific assessments of impacts.
