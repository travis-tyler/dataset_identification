[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In early October 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 10% of the global population has been infected with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 [1] . Since its declaration as a pandemic seven months earlier, COVID-19 has inflicted substantial health and economic burden around the world [2, 3] . As of 21 November 2020, there have been around 56 million confirmed cases and 1.36 million deaths attributed to COVID-19 [4] . Specifically, 3,763,231 confirmed cases (of whom 3,096,119 have recovered) and 95,558 deaths were reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) [5] .\nPrior to SARS-CoV-2 emergence, six human coronavirus (HCoV) strains were known to infect humans: two of which caused fatal respiratory diseases (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV), while the remaining four circulate annually and cause 15-29% of all common colds (HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63 and -HKU1) [6] . SARS-CoV-2 gains access to the host cell by binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) through its spike (S) protein. SARS-CoV-2 S receptorbinding domain (RBD) has a 10-to 20-fold higher hACE2 binding affinity than SARS-CoV-1 [7] .\nYet, SARS-CoV-2 RBD is less accessible such that the overall S-hACE2 interaction is similar or weaker than that of SARS-CoV-1. Nonetheless, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein possesses a polybasic cleavage site making it accessible to furin protease which enhances cell entry [8] . Similar to other beta-coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense RNA genome that is around 30-kb in length with six functional open reading frames (ORFs). ORFa and -b constitute nearly twothirds of the genome and produce 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs), including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or NSP12) and a helicase (NSP13). The structural nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E), and S proteins are encoded by the remaining stretch of the RNA genome along with other accessory proteins [9] .\n.

SARS-CoV-2 evolves at an estimated rate of around 6 x 10 -4 nucleotides/genome/year [10] . Numerous variants have emerged but only a handful of them have been fixated such as the S_D614G that has prevailed globally. S_D614G was shown to alter infectivity and virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and was associated with an increase in mortality [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Recently, Sallam et al. reported in a preprint an increase in the incidence of S_D614G variant between February and June 2020 in the Middle East and North Africa [15] . However, a detailed genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 in EMR is still lacking. It also remains not clear whether the case fatality rates (CFRs) in EMR are associated with any of the prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 wholegenome sequences collected in EMR and examined the temporal and country-level associations between the predominant variants and CFRs.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 6, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.21249332 doi: medRxiv preprint detected (here defined as found in 3 other countries or less, and not listed in other countries' most common mutations). For instance, NSP5_G71S was found in 67% of Oman's sequences, NSP12_G823S in 24% of Egypt's sequences, and NSP12_M666I in 75% of Palestine's sequences ( Figure 2 ). NSP12_P323L and S_D614G were predominantly detected in 10 out of 15 countries.\nS_D614G was also dominant in Bahrain. In Kuwait and Iran, NSP6_L37F and NSP2_V198L were the most frequently reported variants.\nNext, we used the Nextclade tool from Nextstrain to assign clades (GISAID nomenclature) to the sequences ( Figure 3A ) [20] . Of all sequences from EMR countries, 65.6% belonged to the G (20A per Nextstrain clades), GR (20B), and GH (20C) clades, which emerged following the introduction of the S_D614G variant ( Figure 3B , [21] ). Moreover, these clades were almost exclusively represented as early as February and March in Saudi Arabia. In UAE and Egypt clade distribution was heterogeneous with multiple clades cocirculating between February through August ( Figure   3C ). In Oman, multiple clades were introduced into the country in February and March, but GH predominated as of April.\nMore specimens were sequenced from males in the EMR (2.05:1 male-to-female in top four represented countries, independent t-test p < 0.004): Saudi Arabia (4.44:1), UAE (2.25:1), Oman is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted January 6, 2021. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.21249332 doi: medRxiv preprint 59 and >60 years), we report no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of the Wuhanlike or any of the identified variants (multivariate ANOVA for all variants, F < 0.906, p > 0.487) ( Figure 4D) We next sought to determine whether a correlation exists between the incidence of the ten most common variants and countries' CFRs. Only seven countries were included in this analysis -Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE, Bahrain, Palestine, Morocco, and Jordan, where none of the variants was significantly correlated with an increase in CFR ( Figure 5) . Consistent with previous studies [22, 23] , we confirm that NSP12_P323L seems to have quickly co-evolved following S_D614G introduction, as they are more often co-detected among SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences ( Figure   6A ). This double variant 'D614G & P323L' is found to be evenly distributed among different age groups in the top four represented countries (Figure 6B) . After repeating the correlation analysis while accounting for the single versus double occurrence of D614G and P323L, we found that neither single nor double variants were significantly correlated with CFR ( Figure 6C) .\nFinally, since sequences of Saudi Arabia and Oman were preferentially collected before July and those of Morocco and Jordan before May (Figure 1C) , we reran our analysis but this time accounting for the cumulative incidence of the 'D614G & P323L' double variant and the CFR at the end of each month. We observed no association between these two variables from March through September (Supplementary Figure 2) .

Hou et al. further showed that the S_D614G variant displayed faster transmission and increased competitive fitness in vivo compared to wild-type virus in hamsters [32] . These findings were also confirmed in hACE2 knock-in mice as well as in ferrets [33] . On a molecular level, S_D614G allows for more efficient infectivity by shifting the spike protein to a more 'open' conformation that is more favorable of ACE2 binding [30] .\nSeveral studies reported a positive correlation between S_D614G incidence and mortality (CFR) [11, 19, 24] . However, a more recent study of 25,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the United Kingdom did not associate the incidence of this mutation with higher COVID-19 mortality or with clinical severity in patients [34] . Similarly, Korber et al. did no find an association between S_D614G and increased disease severity or hospitalization [31] . In our sequence set, we saw no association between any of the ten most common mutations, including S_D614G, and CFRs of select EMR countries ( Figure 5) . However, our data as well as others' [22, 23] show that the S_D614G is frequently coupled with another substitution, NSP12_P323L, suggesting co-evolution of these variants ( Figure 6A) . In contrast to the well-studied S_D614G, the effect of NSP12_P323L on viral fitness is much less understood [35, 36] . One study speculated that it negatively impacts NSP8's association with RdRp leading to an attenuated polymerase activity [22] , while another suggests it enhances hydrophobic NSP8-RdRp interactions leading to improved processivity of RdRp and enhanced viral replication overall [23] . In all cases, it is speculated that the 'epidemiological success' of the GH, G, and GR lineages could be attributed to the combined viral fitness advantage conferred by both NSP12_P323L and S_D614G [22] .\nTherefore, it makes more sense to consider the combined effect of the 'D614G & P323L' double variant on mortality and disease outcomes. Nonetheless, we found no correlation between the .

Interestingly, we found a positive, albeit non-significant, correlation between 'D614G & P323L' incidence and COVID-19 CFR in Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Egypt, but a statistically significant negative correlation in UAE (Figure 7B ). This suggests that the reported correlation between these variants and increased CFR might be a mere coincidence rather than true causation. Noteworthy, our method of calculating daily/monthly CFR is credited for accounting for a 13-day lag between cumulative cases and deaths [18] . Yet, it overestimates the case fatality risk early on in the pandemic [37] , a limitation that would apply to our final analysis. Then again, considering the overwhelming discrepancy in fatality correlations between countries (especially in UAE versus Oman with similar sequence counts (Figure 7B) ), it is unlikely that early bias in CFR estimation would have altered our conclusion. Additionally, a more accurate method to estimate COVID-19 mortality would be the infection fatality rate (IFR), inferred from seroprevalence studies. However, such data is only available for Iran, Pakistan, and Qatar out of all EMR countries according to a recent WHO review [38] .\nOn a final note, other genomic mutations were associated with milder disease, such as a major deletion (\u0394382; nucleotide positions: 27,848 to 28,229), which results in truncated ORF7b and arrested transcription of ORF8 [39] . Patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 \u0394382 variant had less .

This variant, however, was not present in any of our sequence cohort (data not shown). Additionally, we did not detect an S_ N439K variant, which enhances spike binding to its protein hACE2 and results in immune escape from a panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [41] .\nOverall, our analysis reveals the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in EMR and emphasizes the importance of considering temporal incidence and concurrent mutations in disease correlations. Our study is limited by the relatively low number of specimens sequenced per country spanning ten months of COVID-19 pandemic. There is a critical need for continuous and consistent surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variations in the EMR region.\n.

Bahrain had the highest sequence to population ratio (44.1 in 1 million), while Oman had the highest number of sequences per reported COVID-19 cases (15.4 per 10,000 cases) ( Figure 1B) .

Significant data gaps are notable, whereby sequences were lacking for seven EMR countriesthe majority of which are in war conflict zones (e.g., Syria, Libya, and Yemen [25] ).\nIn general, large disparities in the availability of sequences are observed across EMR. Only four countries reported >100 sequences spanning several months of the pandemic, with Saudi Arabia exceeding 500 sequence submissions. These data gaps highlight the challenges for monitoring the pandemic in developing countries particularly in conflict zones. It also emphasizes the importance of building regional sequencing capacities for timely and continuous monitoring of viral evolution during the pandemic [26, 27] .\nDespite the diversity in the substitutions detected across countries, only a handful of variants predominated. For instance, a mere 6 out of 260 non-synonymous mutations (2.3%) in Saudi Arabia and 5 out of 138 mutations (3.6%) in Oman were detected in more than 10% of the respective total of sequences (Figure 2) . This suggests that consistent with other studies, most SARS-CoV-2 mutations are neutral or deleterious [10] . Although a random founder's effect cannot be ruled out, the increased frequency of certain substitutions might be attributable to a fitness advantage [12, 23, [28] [29] [30] . For instance, the S_D614G was found to predominate all viral strains globally (78% of sequences by May 2020) and was associated with increased viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients [31] .
