[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Cohort and cross-sectional data were reviewed to describe the changes in dietary intake with age. Total energy intake decreases varied substantially with age, by 1000 to 1200 kcal in men and by 600 to 800 kcal in women. This resulted in concomitant declines in most nutrient intakes. For some nutrients, substantial numbers of older Americans consumed only one fifth to one third of the recommended dietary allowance. For most nutrients, research is lacking with which to judge the health impact of reduced nutrient consumption with age, although there is some evidence of an age-related decline in absorptive and metabolic function. With the aging of the population, more research is needed on nutrient requirements and health outcomes, and public health efforts are needed to increase physical activity and food intake among older people."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "A LTHOUGH there is a growing understanding of the importance of diet in health promotion and disease prevention, our present knowledge of nutrient requirements of elderly individuals and changes in dietary intake with age is limited. This study presents data on how nutrient intakes and dietary habits change from adulthood through old age."}, {"section_title": "Knowledge About Requirements of Older Persons", "text": "Although our science base is growing, knowledge of the nutrient requirements of elderly people remains inadequately documented. At present, the most widely accepted standards used for interpretation of dietary data are the National Academy of Sciences Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) (1) . The RDAs are defined as the levels of intake of essential nutrients that, on the basis of scientific knowledge, are judged by the Food and Nutrition Board to be adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all healthy persons (1) . There are several important considerations in assessing the adequacy of the RDA standards for older people. The RDAs provide for a single category of older people, applying a single set of standards to all persons aged 51 years and older. However, with the advancement of the aging process, changes in physical abilities, and the presence of chronic conditions, nutritional needs may be quite different as people progress from their 50s through the second half of their life span.\nAlthough the RDAs have been the accepted reference available to health professionals and researchers for assessing diets of individuals and groups, they were not ideally suited for some of these purposes (2) . In the near future, dietary reference intakes (DRIs) will be replacing the last issue of the RDA report. The decision to establish revised reference intakes was based on the following needs: (i) to critically review the underlying estimates and the criteria for adequacy; (ii) to assess new scientific evidence from a range of studies, including epidemiological studies of chronic disease; (iii) to include the concept of reduction in the risk of chronic disease; and (iv) to move away from deficiency diseases to more functional outcomes related to health and diseases. DRI is used as a collective term to accommodate various nutrient-based reference values, as shown in Table 1 (3) .\nFor the DRIs, two categories for older adults were chosen: individuals aged 51 through 70 years and those aged older than 70 years. Although recent studies provide data on several nutrients that may inform future recommendations for older adults (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) , it remains to be seen if the scientific data are plentiful enough to provide a strong basis for establishing DRIs for the elderly groups beyond the estimated average requirement. A more focused research agenda may evolve as a result of the process of establishing the DRIs. For the present report, mention of recommended intakes will refer to the RDAs, or to the DRIs, as appropriate."}, {"section_title": "Issues in Estimating Change in Intake With Age", "text": "Data collection methods and databases.-Assessing dietary change over time is limited by a number of methodological issues. Data collection methods differ (e.g., a single 24-hour recall vs multiple-day diet diaries). Even if the same dietary assessment method is used, there may be important differences from one time to another. Nutrient composition databases change with time. For instance, fiber values previously appeared as crude fiber (a subset of total fiber) and fiber data were available for only a limited number of food items. At present, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) food tables contain values for total dietary fiber, not crude fiber, and for all food items. There have also been technological advances made in methods of measuring components of fiber. Valid comparisons of fiber intake over time are at best difficult to make. Similar problems exist in assessing changes in fat intake. For example, changes in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) methods that may have influenced nutrient estimates included automated data collection, improved protocol for probing for information about food sources of dietary fat, and a different nutrient database (10) .\nLongitudinal versus cross-sectional data.-What we know about dietary intake and patterns in elderly persons compared with younger adults comes from longitudinal and crosssectional studies.\nMost dietary data are cross-sectional. That is, data on intake in different age groups are obtained from different individuals, rather than by observing the same individuals as they age.\nIn a cross-sectional study, it is virtually impossible to separate changes attributable to cohort differences in food preferences from actual physiologic changes due to aging. As people age, they not only undergo physiological changes, but they also bring with them food behaviors that have evolved from the social, cultural, economic, and environmental history of their lifetime experiences. With the aging population, other issues also interfere with interpretation of cross-sectional studies. Nonresponse rate increases in the older age groups, potentially biasing the estimates. Fading memory may make it more difficult to report food intake accurately. Another issue is selective mortality, and the possibility that persons with certain dietary patterns may have better survival; in that case, we cannot be sure that those who have reached older ages-the survivors-demonstrate a pattern that represents changes with aging or one that is related to survival. In addition, food habits in older people are determined not only by lifetime preferences and physiological changes, but also by living arrangements, aloneness, finances, transportation access, and disability, among other issues. Thus, differences seen in cross-sectional studies must be interpreted with these issues in mind.\nLongitudinal studies, which follow the same individuals through the life cycle, may seem to offer the best approach to examine changes over time. However, these studies, too, have shortcomings. As noted previously, dietary collection methods also evolve over time, making observed differences difficult to interpret. Nutrient intake is influenced not only by physiological factors associated with aging, but also by changes in the food supply (such as the availability of low-fat food items) and in public perceptions about what constitutes a desirable diet (such as recent emphasis on fiber intake). In addition, as noted previously, age-related changes in cognitive ability and differences between survivors and nonsurvivors can also make interpretation of longitudinal studies difficult.\nIn any longitudinal study, sample selection and representativeness of the cohort are issues that limit our confidence in the generalizability of these studies' results to the population at large. Most members of such cohorts are bettereducated and more health-conscious. Finally, there are few longitudinal studies with large samples and with comprehensive dietary data collected over several decades, and even fewer with published results in the scientific literature.\nDespite the problems with both types of data, both provide useful information and afford useful comparisons. Where findings are similar, our confidence in the interpretation of the cross-sectional studies is enhanced. Dissimilarities may also be useful, in aiding our understanding of factors such as cohort and survival effects. Despite the difficulty in attributing dietary changes to physiological, cohort, or cultural effects, the large national cross-sectional representative surveys provide the major source of accurate information on dietary intake of people at different stages of the life cycle."}, {"section_title": "Description of the Data Sets", "text": "Longitudinal studies.-There are several longitudinal studies that examine intakes of specific nutrients in a sample and health outcomes at a later date, including the Honolulu Heart Program, Nurses Health Study, Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, Adventists Health Study, Iowa Women's Study, and the Cardiovascular Heart Study (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Emphasis in these studies is on health outcomes, and no published information was found on changes in nutrient intake in these populations over time. Cross-sectional results from the Framingham Study (17) have been reported on trends in diet over time, but no results have been published on changes with age. The sample included the original cohort, spouses, and offspring. For these reasons, data from the previously mentioned studies are not reported here.\nOnly a few longitudinal studies were identified that include dietary data on the whole diet, collected at more than one point in time, and on which results on dietary change over time have been published (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . The studies are summarized in Table 2 .\nGarry and colleagues (18) followed a sample of 304 healthy men and women, between the ages of 60 and 85 (mean age, 71.5 years), in the New Mexico Study of Nutrition and Aging. The sample was primarily white, physically active, middle income, well-educated, without chronic disease, and not taking any medication. Dietary changes were examined over 6 years. The dietary assessment method included 3-day food records. At the end of the 6 years, 213 of the original sample remained in the study; results were reported on 159 of those participants, 77 men and 82 women, who completed the diet records. Results of the analyses re- vealed little change over time. The major limitations of the study were the short duration of the follow-up period, the small sample size, and the select, very healthy convenience sample. Because of the small sample size, the cohort was grouped into a single age cohort. In the 9-year longitudinal follow-up, analyses showed significant decreases in total fat and cholesterol consumption in the women (19) . In the men, in addition to decreases in fat intake, there were decreases in energy and protein, whether expressed as absolute consumption or per kg of body weight.\nThe Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (20) gathered data between 1960 and 1987. The sample consisted of 180 men, who were predominately white, highly educated, upper-middle class, and living in the community. Their ages ranged from 35 to 74 years at entry into the study. Seven-day diet records were collected from 1961 to 1975. Subsequently, Hallfrisch and colleagues (21) conducted a longitudinal analysis on the sample of 105 men who completed at least 3 to 8 days of food records, over 3 decades. The strength of this study lies in the long duration of follow-up and in the fact that the same diet method and nutrient database was used for all analyses. Limitations arise from the nature of the sample, which represented primarily white, highly educated men.\nIn a longitudinal study of 20 years, Flynn and colleagues (22) assessed diet change over time. The convenience sample included 144 University of Missouri male faculty members and staff. At entry, their ages ranged from the late 30s through 60s. The dietary assessment method consisted of 4-day diet records, every 4 to 6 years. Again, the follow-up period was long, but the sample size was small and unrepresentative.\nNational follow-up studies.-Persons aged 55 years and older at the time of the NHANES I (1971) (1972) (1973) (1974) (1975) were interviewed again in 1984 in the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study (NIEFS) (23) . A total of 2653 individuals with appropriate data were reexamined (1103 men, 1550 women; 2264 whites, 373 African Americans and 16 of other races). Of these, 922 were 55 to 64 years old and 1731 were aged 65 years and older at the NHANES I examination. At the time of the NIEFS, the subjects were 10 years older. The assessment instrument used in the NHANES I baseline was a 19-item food group questionnaire. The dietary assessment instrument used in the NIEFS analyses was an extensive 93-item food frequency questionnaire. Consequently, it is difficult to draw conclusions about dietary changes with any confidence.\nNational cross-sectional surveys.-The National Center for Health Statistics and the USDA conduct periodic surveys of the health and nutritional status of representative samples of Americans. National-level cross-sectional surveys with comprehensive dietary data on the older American population include the Nationwide Food Consumption Surveys (NFCS), the National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS), the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII), and the NHANES (24) (25) (26) (27) . The surveys are summarized in Table 3 .\nThe strength of these national surveys lies in their sample sizes and representativeness. All included thousands of per- sons over the age of 50 years, and in some surveys, there were substantial numbers of the very old. All of these studies were conducted using rigorous sampling procedures; in most of these surveys, the response rate was very high; sample weights corrected for factors such as nonresponse in certain subgroups; and carefully trained interviewers applied comparable assessment methods to all persons in the study. These characteristics result in confidence in the representativeness of the data.\n\u2022 The NHIS (1987 and 1992 NHANES II (1976 II ( -1980 . The study population over the age of 50 totaled approximately 9200; 40% of those were aged 66 to 74 years. NHANES III (1989 III ( -1994 . In NHANES III, there were over 6830 participants in the age categories of 50 years and older. HHANES (1982) (1983) (1984) . The HHANES was a survey of three major Hispanic subgroups in the United States: Mexican Americans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans. The sample consisted of civilian, noninstitutionalized Hispanics up to the age of 74. Respondents in the 50-to 74-yearold age bracket included 1413 Mexican Americans, 679 Cubans, and 575 Puerto Ricans. The Cuban population resided in Florida, the Puerto Rican population lived in the New York City metropolitan area, and the Mexican population resided in the five southwestern states. Samples of Cuban and Puerto Rican older adults were relatively small. There are no publications of findings on diet and the elderly population from this data set.\n\u2022 The NFCS (1977-1978 and 1987-1988 (1994) (1995) (1996) . The CSFII has been conducted by the USDA since 1985. The 1985 and 1986 surveys included adults aged up to 50 years. Older persons were not included until 1989. Both the 1989 to 1991 and 1994 to 1996 surveys provide information on at least 2 days of food intakes among individuals of all ages. The 1994 to 1996 survey was completed by more than 15,000 individuals and included a larger sample of elderly individuals compared with the 1989 to 1991 survey. The 1994 to 1996 CSFII included more than 4700 men and approximately 4370 women aged 60 years and older. Only data from the later survey are reported here. Figure 1 , from NHANES II (30) illustrates the energy intake pattern seen in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal studies: energy intake declines substantially across the age spectrum. The oldest age category in NHANES II, 70 to 74 years, had the lowest energy intakes. At all ages, men consumed more than women, but this difference decreased with age, as energy intake decreases faster in men than in women."}, {"section_title": "R ESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Energy and Macronutrients", "text": "Among the longitudinal studies, energy intake and macronutrient intake decreased with age for the two studies, which spanned 2 decades or longer. In the BLSA, Elahi and colleagues (31) examined nutrient intake of the same cohort of individuals over three periods of time : 1961 to 1965, 1966 to 1970, and 1971 to 1975 . The most significant change over the 3 decades was an overall decrease in caloric intake and, as expected, concurrent decreases in the macronutrients (fat, protein, and carbohydrates). The percentage of calories from total fat and cholesterol decreased over time ( Table 4 ). The percentage of calories from protein was relatively constant at 15% to 16%, and calories from carbohydrates increased from 38.4% to 44.5%. The other longitudinal study lasting 2 decades or more also found that intake of calories decreased with a concurrent and consistent decrease in all other nutrients examined (22) .\nAs noted previously, it is difficult in longitudinal studies to separate changes associated with aging from changes that simply reflect temporal trends. The changes in the total fat and cholesterol in the diets of the men of the BLSA certainly reflect changes that had been occurring nationwide. However, we have found that the longitudinal studies are consistent with the cross-sectional studies, leaving no doubt that there is a substantial decrease in food intake with increasing age. Mean intakes of energy and macronutrients (fat, protein, and carbohydrates) from the first phase of NHANES III (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) are reported in detail in Table 5 (32), for the entire age spectrum. Consistent across races, and for women and men, total food energy intake and macronutrients decreased with age. The percentage of calories from fat tended to be lower in those older than 60 than in younger age groups, usually reaching its lowest value in the oldest age groups. Although the percentage of calories from fat declined with age, the proportion of calories from protein tended to be higher than that of younger adults. Dietary cholesterol declined with age in both men and women and in all ethnic groups.\nAfrican Americans and Mexican Americans tended to have lower mean energy intake than whites, with African Americans having the lowest. This observation of lower caloric intakes among African Americans was also seen in NHANES II (30) and in the 1987 NHIS (28) . In NHANES II, African Americans consistently consumed fewer calories, less total fat, and fewer total saturated fat acids, oleic, and linoleic acids on average than did whites. On the other hand, African Americans consumed more dietary cholesterol for most age-sex groups except for the 65-to 74-yearold women and the 55-to 64-year-old men (30) . In NHANES III, Mexican American men had the highest cholesterol intakes, followed by African American men.\nEstimates of nutrient intake are consistently lower in the CSFII (1994) (1995) (1996) than NHANES III, but patterns of intake with age are similar to NHANES III. Total energy intake and macronutrients decreased with age.\nThe NHIS (28) , used an abbreviated food frequency questionnaire, and thus the absolute values are underestimates. The relative intakes, however, are consistent with the findings of the longitudinal and national survey data. Energy estimates decreased as age group increased with concurrent decreases in mean intake of macronutrients. This, in turn, has a considerable impact on intake of micronutrients."}, {"section_title": "Nutrient Density", "text": "As total energy intake decreases with age, the absolute amount of most nutrients also decreases. However, it is sometimes useful to consider the nutrient density of diets, that is, the nutrient intake as a proportion of total calories. It is often the case that energy intake declines more substantially than does intake of micronutrients. Fiber is a good illustration of this fact. In the Figure 2A data from NHANES II (33) , it can be seen that absolute grams of fiber decrease with age in men. However, Figure 2B shows fiber intake expressed as grams of fiber per 1000 kcal. It can be seen that, in terms of nutrient density, the proportion of dietary intake that is composed of fiber increases with age in men.\nThis increase in nutrient density with age has two components: the decline in the denominator, kcal, and for some nutrients, the actual increase in absolute amount of intake with age. Thus, men's absolute intake of fiber declined with age, but their energy intake declined more; in NHANES III as well, fiber was seen to decrease slightly with age in white men. On the other hand, women's intake of fiber actually increased with age, in addition to their declining energy intake, resulting in an even steeper increase in fiber per 1000 kcal. This increase in fiber intake among older women was also seen in NHANES III. This paradoxical increase in some food components with age is seen for a number of nutrients, particularly those derived from fruits and vegetables or other fiber sources, although usually primarily in women (33) . In addition to this observation from cross-sectional data, Elahi and colleagues (31) saw an increase in total fiber intake with age, among the well-educated men in the BLSA. Table 6 presents the mean intake of several minerals, and Table 7 presents vitamins, by age group, from NHANES III (32) . With few exceptions, mineral intake declines with age after age 50, usually reaching its lowest point in the oldest age group. Decreases in calcium, iron, and zinc intake with age were seen in the following surveys: NHANES III, NHANES II, and CSFII (1994) (1995) (1996) , all based on 24-hour recalls; and in the NHIS, based on the food frequency questionnaire. In NHANES III data, white men aged 70 to 79 years obtained 832 mg of calcium and 12.2 mg of zinc, while white women obtained only 651 mg of calcium and 8.8 mg of zinc. Levels in other ethnic groups were lower. The current recommendations call for 1200 mg for calcium and 12 and 15 mg for zinc for women and men, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Micronutrients", "text": "The intake of most B vitamins tended to decline with age in men and to remain fairly constant in women (Table 7) . A similar pattern was seen for vitamin E: In NHANES III, it appeared that men's intake of vitamin E declined with age (except in the oldest age group), while for women it was fairly constant. Mean and median intakes of vitamin E declined with increasing age for both sexes in NHANES II, which had data only up to age 74 (34) , and in the NHIS (28) . Folate intake was fairly constant over the age span, with means of 310 g/day in men and 274 g in women.\nThe current recommendation calls for 400 g/day. In contrast to the general fall in micronutrient intake with age, vitamin C and vitamin A or carotene intake did not decrease with age and, in fact, tended to increase with age. This pattern was consistent in NHANES II, NHANES III, and CSFII, all by 24-hour recall, and in NHIS by food frequency questionnaire. Vitamin A and carotene intake increased with age in both genders until the oldest age group, 80 years and older. Among whites and African Americans, vitamin C intake tended to decrease with age in men, but increased with age in women."}, {"section_title": "Distributions of Nutrient Intake", "text": "Distributions are of interest since they present a more accurate and complete picture of the population's nutrient intake. Distributions for most nutrients are not normally distributed, but are skewed to the right-that is, there is a long \"tail\" to the right, with some people consuming very high levels. This skewness drags up the mean, producing a higher mean than would be the case in a normal distribution. Consequently, means give an inflated estimate of the central tendency of the population. Medians are more appropriate, representing that value for which half the population consumed more and half the population consumed less of a nutrient.\nThe single 24-hour recall data collected in the NHANES surveys can provide precise estimates of mean intakes of nutrients, but are less appropriate for describing the distribution of intake. With 24-hour recall data, the distribution is wider (a wider, flatter bell-shaped curve), resulting in an exaggerated impression of the proportion of the population with very high or very low intakes. The 2-day nonconsecutive 24-hour recalls used in CSFII can provide more appropriate data on distributions, because intraindividual variability is somewhat smoothed over 2 days and there are fewer of the extreme values often seen in 24-hour recall data. (Several nonconsecutive 24-hour recalls would be ideal for describing distributions. With 2 days, the distribution of intakes obtained will still be wider for some nutrients than the distribution of true intakes.) Figure 3 illustrates the distribution of intakes of protein, vitamin A, and energy from the 2-day CSFII data. For protein, both the median and the entire distribution shift downward with age, for both men and women. Among young men, the median protein intake is slightly less than 100 g, although 10% of young men consume only about 50 g. In contrast to the pattern for protein intake, the distribution of vitamin A intake is shifted upward with age. Although the 75th percentile for young women is about 900 retinol equivalent (RE), the 75th percentile for older women is almost 1300 RE. Table 8 presents nutrient distributions for women, and Table 9 presents these distributions for men, from the 2-day CSFII (1994) (1995) (1996) data. It can be seen that by age 70 to 79 years, the median (50th percentile) energy intake of women is only 1358 kcal. That is, 50% of women in that age group consume that amount or less. Among women aged 80 years and older, the median is only 1296 kcal. The lower percentiles are also illuminating. By age 70 to 79 years, 10% of men consumed less than 1000 kcal per day, and 10% of women consumed less than 768 kcal per day. Again, these values represent the average of 2 nonconsecutive days of intake.\nDistribution data indicated 50% of women consume less than 13 g of fiber and 50% of men consume less than 17 g of fiber. The National Cancer Institute recommends consumption of 20 to 30 g per day.\nOnly about 5% of older women consume the DRI recommendation for calcium (1200 mg), and only 10% of older men consume the recommended 1200 mg of calcium. In addition, 75% of women do not regularly consume the 12 mg RDA for zinc. Seventy-five percent of men aged 50 to 69 years and 90% of men older than 70 years do not consume the recommendation of 15 mg of zinc. Twenty-five percent of older women and 10% of older men consume only 5 mg or less.\nAs many as 75% of older women and men consume less than the RDA for vitamin E-8 and 10 \u2423-tocopherol equivalents, respectively. Approximately 95% of older men and 90% of older women do not consume the DRI of folate, which is 400 g. For the B vitamins, thiamin and riboflavin, more than 25% of both men and women have marginal levels compared with their respective DRIs. Over half of men and women meet the current RDA for Vitamin C of 60 mg. However, a substantial minority of the population consumes far less, based on an average of 2 nonconsecutive days. Ten percent of older women consume only two thirds of the current RDA, and 10% of older men consume only about one fourth of the RDA."}, {"section_title": "Eating Patterns", "text": "One of the earliest publications characterizing the eating patterns of the elderly population in the United States, by Fanelli and Stevenhagen (35) , was based on data from the 1977 to 1978 NFCS. There were 159 participants older than 85 years. Core foods, those routinely consumed by a population group, were identified, and there were no marked differences between men and women or among three different age groups (55-64, 65-74, and 75 years and older). Whole milk, white bread, coffee, and sugar were the most frequently mentioned foods. Orange juice and bananas were the most frequently mentioned fruits. The most commonly used vegetables were tomatoes, potatoes, and lettuce. Eggs and milk were the more frequent protein-rich foods reported.\nMurphy and colleagues (36) examined diets of those aged over 65 years in this same data set and reported a higher percentage of the older age group, 85 years and older, had poorer quality diets. Diet quality was defined as a diet that provided two thirds or more of the RDA for nine selected nutrients.\nFood group consumption and dietary patterns in elderly individuals were examined using data from NHANES I and the NIEFS (37). Subjects were 55 years and older at baseline, and 65 and older at follow-up. NHANES I used a 19-item food frequency questionnaire representing broad food groups, while NIEFS used a 93-food-item questionnaire. The daily number of servings of food groups was calculated from these instruments. The later survey produced higher estimates of intake of milk and cheese, butter and/or margarine, salty snacks, fish and/or shellfish, servings of fruits and vegetables, cereals, and legumes and/or nuts, and lower estimates of servings of sweets and alcoholic beverages. Because the number and specificity of food items on a questionnaire influence responses, these results are difficult to interpret.\nPopkin and colleagues (38) reported on dietary changes in older Americans based on cross-sectional data from the 1977 to 1978 and the 1987 to 1988 NFCS. They found that the top ten sources of energy, fat, and fiber in 1977 re- 358  243  320  213  366  250  30-39  391  268  297  213  364  266  40-49  361  359  286  201  348  247  50-59  358  259  242  211  312  257  60-69  333  265  246  208  299  216  70-79  308  247  222  219  274  201  80\u03e9  282  221  -205  --Phosphorus, mg  20-29  1751  1141  1613  1082  1748  1207  30-39  1728  1151  1390  997  1678  1222  40-49  1464  1081  1333  928  1549  1118  50-59  1471  1025  1028  936  1338  1117  60-69  1395  1074  1111  832  1298  919  70-79  1259  962  948  908  1126  859  80\u03e9  1167  895  -795  1047  -Potassium, mg  20-29  3353  2289  3105  2019  3263  2333  30-39  3627  2583  2710  1965  3153  2424  40-49  3386  2465  2654  1903  3075  2262  50-59  3397  2515  2247  2023  2841  2421  60-69  3145  2630  2280  1964  2747  2046  70-79  2978  2412  2209  2052  2591  1957  80\u03e9  2635  2247  -1976  --Sodium, mg  20-29  4780  2996  4801  3277  3924  2863  30-39  4520  2980  4145  2907  3792  2820  40-49  3933  2835  4039  2672  3673  2755  50-59  3713  2553  3041  2563  3465  2704  60-69  3429  2634  2879  2221  3138  2076  70-79  3192  2379  2604  2200  3098  2013  80\u03e9  2912  2274  - mained the top ten in 1987. The investigators reported shifts from consumption of high-fat to low-fat milk and milk products, and from high-fat beef and pork to low-fat chicken and fish. Similar data were derived from NHANES III by Alaimo and colleagues (32) . Table 10 lists the top 50 sources of energy intake for persons aged 20 to 30 years and those aged 70 years and older.\nInformation on self-reported changes in food patterns was obtained by Sobell and colleagues (39) . Participants in the BLSA were interviewed in 1985 about changes over the previous 12 to 15 years in their consumption of eight food categories (beef, chicken, fish, butter/cream, whole milk, fruits, vegetables, and high-fiber breads/cereals). Approximately two thirds of the participants reported having made changes in five to eight of these items, usually in the \"desirable\" direction.\nThe most recent data on food patterns from a national survey come from the CSFII (1994) (1995) (1996) (40) . Information collected included sources of food, eating-occasion variables, patterns, and other health-related variables. A higher proportion of elderly persons eat breakfast than do younger adults. Over 90% of both men and women aged 60 years and older eat breakfast, with breakfast contributing over 20% of daily calories, 17.2% to 19.0% of daily total fat for men, and 16.7% to 17.8% of daily total fat for women. Among adults, calories from foods obtained and eaten away from home are highest among those aged 20 to 29 years (approximately 37% of energy for men and 34% for women) and lowest among those aged 70 years and older (approximately 16% for men and 11% for women).\nPatterson and colleagues (41) reported on the U.S. population's consumption of fruits and vegetables. The proportion of those meeting the recommended servings was higher among older than among younger persons, and this was true for both whites and African Americans. Nevertheless, fewer than one third of older persons ate the recommended servings of vegetables, and fewer than half ate the recommended servings of fruit. Among older persons, more men had adequate numbers of servings of vegetables (including potatoes) than did women. Women, on the other hand, were more likely than men to have adequate servings of fruit. Even fewer African Americans than whites met the USDA guidelines for recommended servings of fruits and vegetables. Among African Americans, less than one fourth of those in the older age group ate the recommended servings of vegetables, and fewer than one third ate the recommended servings of fruit.\nIn general, the cross-sectional studies on food patterns described previously have found that older people are less likely to consume red meat, whole milk, and other fatty foods than younger people, and are more likely to consume fruits and vegetables than are younger people. That this represents actual age differences and not just a cohort effect is supported by the longitudinal data cited above (21, 22, 31) and Sobell and colleagues (39) . This obviously reflects temporal trends to some extent (as in reference 38) that cannot be clearly separated from the changes due to the aging process. However, it appears that these changes in desirable directions may be larger among older than younger persons, and are larger and more consistent among older women than among older men."}, {"section_title": "Supplement Use", "text": "A significantly larger proportion of older persons than younger persons take vitamin supplements (42) . In data from NHANES I (1971-1975) , persons aged 65 to 74 years consumed more supplements than persons in each of the younger age categories. Exceptions were for vitamin E, which was consumed more commonly in the middle years, and iron supplements, which were consumed most among young women. The proportion consuming single-entity supplements regularly was approximately twice as high in the oldest as compared with the youngest age groups. 29  218  32  54  100  172  278  455  553  50-59  207  32  56  97  165  268  431  537  60-69  213  43  58  99  167  287  442  538  70-79  194  43  61  101  154  249  373  485  80\u03e9  192  33  52  92  158  260  386 More recent data on supplement use were obtained from the 1987 NHIS. As in earlier surveys, older people were significantly more likely to consume vitamin supplements (43) . Women were more likely to consume supplements regularly than were men of the same age and race. Daily usage among white women was highest within the age range of 55 to 65 years (39.9%) and 65 to 74 years (38.4%) and Slesinski and colleagues (44) reported on the trends in use of vitamin and mineral supplements in the U.S. population based on the 1987 and 1992 NHIS. There were few meaningful changes in the older age groups of 55 years and older, with the exception of calcium use, which declined between 1987 and 1992.\nTotal intake of nutrients, intake from supplements added to nutrient intake from food, is not available from most surveys because supplement data were not obtained in detail."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The most important observation from the information reviewed previously is also one that comes as no surprise: The data from both cohort and cross-sectional surveys are consistent in indicating a very substantial decline with age in energy intake and quantity of food consumed. Mean energy intake declines by 1000 to 1200 kcal in men and by 600 to 800 kcal in women between those aged in their 20s and those in their 80s (Table 5) . By age 80, 10% of men consume 890 kcal or fewer per day, and 10% of women consume 750 kcal or fewer (Tables 8 and 9 ), based on data from 2 nonconsecutive days of intake. This decline presumably follows in part from a decrease in physical activity and in part from the decline in muscle mass with age. This results in a lower requirement for energy. (Substantial decrements in energy intake may, in turn, result in lower physical activity, a declining cycle.) Potential problems arise because, as total food intake declines, for most nutrients there is a concomitant decline in nutrient intake. Tables 8 and 9 suggest potentially important declines with age in median protein, zinc (both down by approximately one third in men), calcium, vitamin E, and other nutrients, especially in men. Further examination of the lower end of the distribution (e.g., the 10th percentile) suggests that a substantial number of minority elders consume grossly less than the RDA. In the 2-day data in Table 9 , 10% of men obtained only one fifth to one third of the recommendations for protein, zinc, calcium, vitamin E, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12.\nUnfortunately, there is little evidence on which to base a judgment about the adequacy of these nutrient intakes that are concomitant with lower energy intakes in elderly individuals. For protein, the RDA committee notes that \"there is surprisingly little information on which to base recommendations for protein intake in the elderly.\" Similar statements are made for other nutrients.\nFurthermore, it is noted repeatedly by the RDA committee that there is no current evidence for most nutrients that absolute requirements decrease with age. Indeed, there is some evidence that absorption and utilization efficiency declines with age for some nutrients, potentially resulting in increased rather than decreased requirements for intake.\nOccasionally, nutrient intake is expressed as a proportion of energy intake (i.e., nutrient intake per 1000 kcal). When expressed this way, it is clear that for at least some nutrients, the nutrient density of the diet does not decrease with age. That is, the energy intake declines with age at a faster rate than the specific nutrient intake. However, there is no evidence that this is an appropriate reflection of nutrient needs, for most nutrients. For example, women in their 20s consume approximately 0.36 mg of calcium per 1000 kcal, while for women in their 80s, this figure is 0.40 mg of calcium per 1000 kcal. Expressed this way, calcium intake in older women appears no less than that in younger women. However, it seems more important from a health standpoint to note that 524 mg of calcium (the median among women in their 80s) is both severely insufficient and is lower than that of younger women.\nAnother observation of interest in these data is the apparent health consciousness of older women. Although energy intake declines with age, the absolute value of certain nutrients actually increases with age. Vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium intakes are all substantially higher in women in their 80s compared with those in their 20s (Table 8) . These nutrients are found especially in fruits and vegetables, and this observation is consistent with the food pattern data cited previously. Older people, particularly older women, are more likely to consume fruits and vegetables. This general health consciousness is also seen in the much higher proportion of older women who consume vitamin supplements regularly.\nAgain, however, it is always important to observe the distribution of intake. Not all older women eat healthfully. For vitamin C, for example, 10% of women in their 80s obtained only 19 mg of vitamin C or less (about one third of the RDA) in a 2-day average."}, {"section_title": "RECOMMENDATIONS", "text": "Nutrition research is urgently needed to determine metabolic changes and nutrient needs of older people.\nOutcomes research is needed to determine prospectively whether persons who maintain a higher nutrient intake with age have better health outcomes.\nIntervention research is needed to determine whether providing increased macro-and micronutrients to elderly individuals can prevent or mitigate some of their health problems.\nPublic health efforts are needed to promote the maintenance of physical activity levels and food intake in elderly persons."}]
