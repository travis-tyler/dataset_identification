Furthermore, studies conducted in cognitively normal individuals revealed amnestic and non amnestic cognitive declines in individuals with co-occurrence of abnormal amyloid-\u03b2 load and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau pathology, brain atrophy or hypometabolism. [5] [6] [7] [8] A conceptual framework proposes that amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathologies synergistically potentiates subsequent downstream neurodegeneration. 9 This synergistic framework challenges previous AD pathophysiological theories emphasising amyloid-\u03b2 or tau pathologies as the major driving forces of disease progression, the so-called baptist and tauist perspectives, respectively. 10 In fact, a cross-sectional study conducted in cognitive normal individuals suggested brain atrophy of temporoparietal and occipital cortices as a function of the interaction between abnormal CSF amyloid-\u03b2 and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarker status. 11 Similarly, the deleterious associations between CSF amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 and brain structure or cognition are dependent on the presence of abnormal CSF p-tau levels. 12, 13 In fact, data supporting molecular synergistic interactions between amyloid-\u03b2 and tau peptides, leading to downstream toxicity, have been described in the recent animal model literature. 14 17 Although brain metabolism is vulnerable to AD pathophysiology, the relationship between amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathologies as determinants of brain hypometabolism is still unclear. Few longitudinal imaging studies have supported a link, albeit a modest one, between amyloid-\u03b2 or tau pathology and metabolic decline. 18, 19 Although the pathogenic synergism between brain amyloidosis and tau pathology has been postulated as a determinant of AD progression, no previous study so far has been tested whether the interactions between amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathologies are associated with developing brain hypometabolism.\nHere, in a longitudinal study of cognitively normal elderly individuals, we test the hypothesis that [ 18 F]FDG metabolic decline depends on the synergistic interaction between, rather than the sum of independent effects of, amyloid-\u03b2 and tau biomarkers."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Database description and study participants", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

We further found that the interaction between brain amyloid-\u03b2 deposition and total tau biomarkers did not predict metabolic decline.\nThe synergistic interaction between brain amyloid-\u03b2 deposition and CSF p-tau biomarkers concentrations found in our study has to be carefully interpreted from the pathophysiological perspective. In the statistical model proposed, in terms of such interaction within the study population, the density of the brain amyloid-\u03b2 deposition and CSF concentrations of p-tau synergistically amplify the severity of the subsequent brain hypometabolism. As such, individuals with the highest baseline concentrations of [ 18 F] florbetapir SUVR and p-tau had the highest rate of metabolic decline in AD-related regions over a time frame of 24 months. One might claim that this interaction supports the conceptual framework that amyloid-\u03b2 and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates synergistically, rather than independently, potentiate downstream neurodegeneration. 9, 21, 22 The combined effect between amyloid-\u03b2 and hyperphosphorylated tau has been supported by animal model literature. 23 For example, p-tau potentiates amyloid-\u03b2-induced neurotoxicity 24 and molecular interactions between amyloid-\u03b2 and p-tau have shown to amplify synaptic and neuronal damage in AD. 25 Indeed, deleterious interactions between peptide aggregates have already been described in other proteinopathies such as Lewy body disease (alpha-synuclein) 26 and frontal temporal lobar degeneration (TDP-43 inclusions). 27 Fast metabolic decline in mesial temporal regions is not considered part of the normal aging process. 28, 29 Indeed, the mesial temporal metabolic decline found in the present study is consistent with the idea that mesial temporal hypometabolism may be an early metabolic abnormality linked to the AD pathophysiological process. 30, 31 Furthermore, the hypometabolic areas reported here converge to the brain circuits that are affected early by neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-\u03b2 plaques. [32] [33] [34] Such convergence between metabolic and neuropathological abnormalities in limbic regions further supports a synergism between amyloid-\u03b2 and tau pathologies leading to hypometabolism. Recently, a hypothetical model in which the interaction between amyloid-\u03b2 and tau aggregates potentiates mesial temporal synaptic dysfunction in the preclinical stages of AD has been suggested. 35 One may claim that brain amyloid-\u03b2 measurements represent a proxy of oligomeric amyloid-\u03b2. 36 As such, the deleterious effects of amyloidosis 1.14 (0.14)\nAbbreviations: CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; MMSE, mini-mental state examination; p-tau, phosphorylated tau; SUVR, standardized uptake value ratio.\nreported here might be mediated by amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers rather than fibrillar conformations. In addition to recent findings supporting the claim that the synergism between brain amyloidosis and neurodegeneration is associated with AD progression; 3,4 here we demonstrate that [ 18 F] florbetapir PET rather than CSF amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 -and CSF p-tau rather than total tau-better predict mesial temporal metabolic decline. The motivation to explore these effects using amyloid-PET in our study is derived from its close association with A\u03b2 plaques load, 37 whereas CSF total tau and p-tau may provide additional information regarding neurodegeneration and neurofibrillary tangles load, respectively. 38, 39 Therefore, our results support the concept that the interaction between brain amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles drives downstream neurodegeneration in early disease stages. In addition, the better prediction obtained with CSF p-tau as compared with total tau might be explained by the possible higher specificity of p-tau to AD pathophysiology. Although high concentrations of p-tau better characterize the AD pathological process, 40 abnormal CSF total tau may be found in several brain disorders associated with axonal death and neuronal loss. 41 Indeed, two previous studies conducted in ADNI participants also found that CSF p-tau, but not total tau, modulates the link between amyloid-\u03b2 pathology and brain atrophy or cognitive decline. 12, 13 Although CSF amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 is considered an effective biomarker for representing disease status, direct measurements of brain amyloid-\u03b2 deposition, as measured with amyloid-PET imaging, might be more strongly associated with eminent disease progression in early AD stages. 42, 43 Alternatively, the lack of association of CSF total tau and CSF amyloid-\u03b2 with metabolic decline may be due to the characteristics of the participants of the study population or the CSF assay.\nClinical insights can be derived from the present results. For example, the combination of abnormalities of CSF p-tau and amyloid-PET biomarkers might serve as a strategy for population enrichment, whereas [ 18 F]FDG PET may serve as a biomarker of efficacy in disease-modifying clinical trials that focus on individuals in the preclinical stages of AD.\nThe major methodological strength of the present results constitutes the use of continuous variables in our statistical analysis. In fact, biomarkers are naturally continuous measurements and dichotomization techniques, such as establishment of abnormalities thresholds have been constantly debated 44 and might not be ideal way to evaluate a disease with a continuous spectrum as AD. Another strength in our analysis was the conservative multiple comparison correction threshold using a significance level of 0.001 to interpret the data, which helped to avoid false positives results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the synergism between amyloidosis and neurodegeneration without assuming a threshold for biomarker abnormalities or artificial dichotomization techniques.\nMethodological aspects limit the interpretation and external validity of the present results. It is important to mention that ADNI participants are highly educated; therefore mechanisms of brain and cognitive reserve may have a role in the [ 18 outcomes reported here. 45 The study population is composed of a group of individuals who accepted to participate in a study focusing on AD. Therefore, our population may be a self-selected group of individuals who worry about cognition. It would be highly desirable to replicate these results in a larger population-based cohort. The observations reported here are purely phenomenological and do not intend to prove a biological synergy between amyloidosis and tau pathology. Our statistical model might have captured a sequence of events, involving amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation, and subsequent tau phosphorylation and metabolic decline. Certainly, molecular biology approaches involving cell cultures and in vivo studies combining long-term sequential imaging of amyloid-\u03b2, tau and brain metabolism in animal models, and in humans could better assess a causal relation between these pathological proteins and brain metabolic decline. We presented the PET data without correcting for partial volume effects. Although partial volume correction had an impact on our SUVR values, this effect did not translate into significant differences in our final results. Previous studies suggest that hypometabolism is more related to APOE \u03b54 status than to amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation. 46 Interestingly, we found no interactive effects between APOE \u03b54 status and tau biomarkers, leading to hypometabolism. However, despite recent evidence suggesting no effect of APOE \u03b54 status in the metabolism of AD-related brain regions in 'preclinical' individuals, 30 one should be cautious regarding the influence of APOE \u03b54 in the present results due to our relatively small sample size to detect genetic influences in early disease stages.\nIn conclusion, the proposed synergistic interaction between amyloid-\u03b2 and tau supports the idea of a more integrative model of AD, although it does not explicitly refute the baptist or tauist perspectives."}]
