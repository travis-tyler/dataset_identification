The basis of this imaging is grounded on the fact that the hallmark of AD is the histological detection of beta amyloid plaques (A\u03b2) at post mortem autopsy. Currently, there are three FDA approved amyloid radiotracers used in clinical practice. This review aims to take the readers through the array of various indications for performing amyloid PET imaging in the management of AD, particularly using 18F-labelled radiopharmaceuticals. We elaborate on PET amyloid scan interpretation techniques, their limitations and potential improved specificity provided by interpretation done in tandem with genetic data such as apolipiprotein E (APO) 4 carrier status in sporadic cases and molecular information (e.g., cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) amyloid levels). We also describe the quantification methods such as the standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) method that utilizes various cutoff points for improved accuracy of diagnosing AD, such as a threshold of 1.122 (area under the curve 0.894), which has a sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 90.5%, whereas the cutoff points may be higher in APOE \u03b54 carriers (1.489) compared to non-carriers (1.313).

Conventionally, neurologists and psychiatrists depended on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to help diagnose probable AD, particularly in atypical cases, by identifying typical anatomical changes that are characteristic of AD [1] . This type of structural imaging, however, has its limitations due to naturally occurring variations in brain volume caused by the aging process and co-existing conditions that can cause medial temporal lobe atrophy, such as depression [2] . Hence, functional imaging such as positron emission tomography (PET) offers an irresistible enticement for increased accuracy of diagnosis. PET is very important in providing a one-stop solution and its function is not limited only to the oncology field [3] . testing to objectively assess for cognitive impairment, i.e., Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scoring [18] . For instance, in the absence of secondary causes, using MMSE scoring helps to grade the severity of cognitive decline with subjects scoring < 15/30 as having severe AD, < 24/30 being more likely to have mild AD, as well as subjects with reported memory deficits, and normal or slightly low scores but preserved ADL (activities of daily living), of having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [17] . Moreover, subject education level has to be factored in when interpreting the assessment score. A set of standards created in 1984 by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA) known as the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria had a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 70% of diagnosing AD [19] . However, due to new developments in the field, Knopman et al., proposed recommendations in 2001 [20] , which were later revised in 2011 [21] .\nThe National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) workgroups involved in preparation of diagnostic guidelines for AD, set a revised guideline that took into account distinguishing features of other dementing/neurocognitive deficit causing conditions that occur in a similarly aged population, which were not completely recognized in the past [21] . These criteria could help differentiate NCD subtypes such as DLB, VaD, and FTD from AD, as they have inherently different clinical characteristics, as well as unique pathophysiological features. The criteria propose the use of two classes of biomarkers to help diagnose AD, namely biomarkers for brain amyloid A\u03b2 protein deposition detection and the biomarkers for downstream neuronal injury identification [21] . The former class includes two major biomarkers namely detection of reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 42 levels and positive PET amyloid imaging, whereas the latter includes three major biomarkers, namely elevated CSF tau, reduced [ 18 F]FDG uptake on PET in the temporoparietal lobes, and disproportionate atrophy at the medial, basal, and lateral temporal lobes on structural MRI scans [21] . Nevertheless, the criteria have their limitations with regards to absolute classification of subtypes due to the presence of certain inherent heterogeneity within the groups. For example, it is difficult to differentiate NCD subjects who have tauopathy disorders such as FTD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and cortico-basal degeneration [22] .\nIn addition, the International Working Group (IWG) and the US NIA-AA have contributed criteria for the diagnosis of AD that better define clinical phenotypes and integrate the role of neuroimaging, genetic profiling, and CSF biomarkers [23] . Some of the recommendations are stated as a guideline and others are given as an option to be utilized at the discretion of the clinician. At present it is accepted that a good clinical assessment yields fairly good sensitivity and specificity to diagnose the different subtypes of NCDs and is reasonably on par with other types of investigations to diagnose AD. The IWG has proposed revisions to the diagnostic algorithm for defining typical and atypical AD, identifying mixed type of AD and preclinical states of AD [23] .\nThe objective of this review is to expound on the various arrays of indications for performing amyloid PET imaging in the management of AD, how to interpret the scans, and the limitations of the test. PET quantification methods used to assess A\u03b2 plaque load in the brain will also be clarified."}, {"section_title": "The Role of PET Amyloid Imaging in the Management of AD", "text": "There are various radiotracers that have been experimented with to enable in vivo detection of amyloid depositions in the brain. Among the main indications for performing an amyloid scan is to confirm the diagnosis in indeterminate or atypical cases, to aid in early detection of AD among subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and to enable quantification of progressive changes in brain amyloid load in response to anti-amyloid therapy. Currently, there are several compounds detected to have a high affinity to bind with fibrillary A\u03b2 plaques that have received FDA approval. There is also a newer benzofuran derivative for the imaging of A\u03b2 in vivo, i.e., [18F]FPYBF-2 (5-(5-(2-(2-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)benzofuran-2-yl)-N-methylpyridin-2-amine), which is chemically stable, does not photodegrade, and has been tested for feasibility in distinguishing AD patients [24] ."}, {"section_title": "[ 11 C]Pittsburgh Compound-B", "text": "In January 2004, Klunk et al. published the first human amyloid PET study using 11 C-labeled Pittsburgh Compound-B ([ 11 C]PiB), also known as 2-(4-N-[ 11 C]methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole. This compound, which is radiolabeled to 11 C, has approximately 20-minutes half-life. Therefore, its use is restricted to centres that have an on-site cyclotron facility. Compared with healthy controls, AD patients typically showed marked retention of [ 11 C]PiB in areas of cerebral cortex that have been identified to contain substantial amounts of deposition of fibrillar A\u03b2 plaques in AD patients [25] . Interestingly, an inverse relationship was noted between [ 11 C]PiB cortical retention with cerebral glucose metabolism determined with [ 18 F]FDG, which was most prominent in the parietal lobes [25] .\nUsing distribution volume ratio (DVR) method, Rowe et al. demonstrated that there was higher [ 11 C]PiB binding in neocortical areas in AD and DLB patients when compared with healthy control subjects, and no cortical binding in FTD [26] . Although almost all AD patients have significantly positive [ 11 C]PiB scans, especially in later stages of the disease, even healthy adults can have falsely positive scan results, e.g., up to 12% of adults in their 60s, 30% of adults in their 70s, and a minimum of 50% of adults in their 80s [26] .

[ 18 F]FBP received the U.S. FDA approval in 2012, to be the initial nuclear medicine imaging radiotracer allowed to be utilized for subjects who are being investigated for AD or other causes of cognitive decline [30] . It has an advantage over [ 11 C]PiB because it has a longer half-life, which is approximately 110 min that makes it possible to transport it from site of production to regional PET scanner facilities.\nIt also demonstrates excellent specificity to A\u03b2 detection and has favorable pharmacokinetics, whereby it is quickly cleared from the blood circulation with approximately 10% of the radiotracer remaining at 20 min post injection.

Although A\u03b2 pathology is consistently detected in post mortem studies of AD patients, it has been reported to be present in 25-45% of normal elderly individuals [37] . This finding depends on the age of the cohort and the pathological criteria employed. It has been suggested that the presence of this pathology reflects the earliest stage in the development of AD [38] . Proving this hypothesis is a real challenge, caused by limitations inherent in post mortem analysis. Fortunately, recent developments of functional amyloid imaging that binds to fibrillar A\u03b2 plaques, provides a unique opportunity to quantify this pathology in the ante mortem state.\n[ FMT all have good affinity to bind with A\u03b2 plaques, and are potentially excellent non-invasive tools for in vivo imaging of NCDs. In familial hereditary AD, significant brain amyloid burden appears years before symptoms of NCD [39] , plus accumulation of amyloid deposits may start earlier than in sporadic AD. Amyloid imaging, particularly using the cerebellar grey matter or cerebral grey matter, has the potential clinical utility for aiding in differential diagnosis in early-onset AD and to support the clinical diagnosis of subjects with probable AD with improved diagnostic accuracy [1, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] (Table 1) .\nAlzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging convened the Amyloid Imaging Taskforce (AIT) to gather empirical evidence that can help support the clinical utility of amyloid imaging. The AIT agreed upon a set of specific appropriate use criteria (AUC), ultimately empowering authorized medical practitioners to identify the types of patients and clinical circumstances in which amyloid PET could be used. It is recommended that patients who have persistent unexplained MCI, patients with atypical presentations of AD, and patients at an atypically early age who develop progressive NCD symptoms are more likely to benefit from this test [45] . As it is a very sub-specialized imaging tool, it is recommended that AD experts decide on the patients that would best benefit from an amyloid scan. The expert for this purpose should be self-identified as a physician trained and board-certified in neurology, psychiatry, or geriatric medicine who actively devotes a substantial proportion (\u226525%) of patient contact time to the evaluation and care of adults with acquired mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD, as confirmed by peer recognition [45] .\nAlthough almost all AD patients have significantly positive amyloid scans, especially in the later stages of life, even cognitively normal elderly adults can have falsely positive scan results, which acts as a caveat for the interpretation of positive amyloid scans. Notably, the annual incidence of healthy subjects becoming amyloid scan positive, as reported in a recent study from the Mayo Clinic, evaluating elderly subjects, was estimated to be 13% per year [27] ."}, {"section_title": "Prognostication of Disease and Detecting Potential MCI Converters", "text": "In patients who are diagnosed with MCI, it may be beneficial to perform amyloid PET imaging to assess the plaque burden. This imaging has been known to detect high plaque burden, which can indicate a higher chance of the individual to convert to AD. Furthermore, many recent studies postulate that perhaps imaging is not a stand-alone test and the addition of CSF biomarkers, genetic information, and glucose metabolism to aid in the diagnosis may help improve the accuracy of interpretation of results [24, [46] [47] [48] [49] (Table 2 ). The role of amyloid PET imaging in MCI subjects has been extensively researched with variable results. Nevertheless, it is important to note that amyloid imaging is contraindicated in asymptomatic individuals because there are potentially more harmful than beneficial effects on the subject due to inaccurate assumptions made about the risks of developing AD and future outcomes on the basis of scan results per se.

VA can be used for assessing the likelihood of significant fibrillar A\u03b2 burden in the brain. A systematic qualitative VA of images is necessary, so that evidence of standardized interpretation protocols that lead to acceptable levels of inter-rater agreement can be achieved. The interpretation of amyloid scans needs to be conducted by an imaging expert, to determine the presence or absence of A\u03b2 plaque deposition. The imaging expert is usually a nuclear medicine specialist or radiologist with specific training in the interpretation of amyloid PET [45] . The amyloid PET data must be technically adequate and must be acquired at a fully qualified and certified facility for it to be of diagnostic quality.\nThe criteria for interpreting the [ 18 F]FBP scan as positive for AD by the VA method is identifying the presence of amyloid binding in the cortical regions relative to the cerebellum, which gives a poor grey-white matter contrast in the affected cerebral cortex. Among the brain areas affected by familial type of AD, which is related to the presence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Presenilin gene mutations, the striatal regions have been reported to have the highest amyloid depositions [50] . Sporadic type of AD that is related to APOE \u03b54 carrier status does not seem to have any regional predilection for amyloid burden; however, the amyloid deposition tends to have an earlier appearance in ApoE epsilon 4 carriers than non-carriers [50] . In a study performed by Newberg et al., [ 18 F]FDG PET scans were interpreted as positive if they displayed the classic pattern of hypometabolism in the temporo-parietal regions [51] . Based on that criterion, scans were classified as either positive or negative for AD. In addition, relative scoring systems have been used to assess the degree of either FDG hypometabolism or increased amyloid binding characteristic of specified regions based on a priori knowledge. Cluster analysis by La Joie et al. revealed distinct subsets of regions [52] :\n1.\nin the hippocampus, atrophy exceeded hypometabolism, whereas A\u03b2 load was minimal, 2.\nin posterior association areas, A\u03b2 deposition was predominant, together with high hypometabolism and lower but still significant atrophy, and 3.\nin frontal regions, A\u03b2 deposition was maximal, whereas detection of structural and metabolic alterations was low.\nAtrophy and hypometabolism significantly correlated in the hippocampus and temporo-parietal cortex, whereas A\u03b2 load was not significantly related to either atrophy or hypometabolism. Thus, they postulated that these findings probably reflect the differential involvement of region-specific pathological or protective mechanisms, such as the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), disconnection, as well as compensation processes."}, {"section_title": "Quantitative Interpretation of Cortical A\u03b2", "text": "The quantitative assessment of amyloid plaques requires consistent efforts for standardization of protocols. The steps involved include proper subject selection and management, calibrated dosage of radiotracer administration, image analysis and quality control, selection of brain reference region, and optimization of various image processing and segmentation methods [50] . Technical factors can be attributed to lead to variability in measurements, and can affect interpretation of the scans, e.g., scanner parameters, injected dose, movement correction methods, and uptake time.\nAmong the regions of the brain that have the lowest fibrillary amyloid plaques are the cerebellar white matter and almost none in the cerebellar grey matter. Thus, these regions are preferentially used to calculate SUVr values. Particularly, the cerebellar cortex was selected as a reference standard for the very first clinical study using [ 11 C]PiB PET due to its absence of Congo red and thioflavin-S stained plaques [51] . In addition, the clearance of amyloid radiotracers from cerebellar grey matter is considered more similar to its clearance from the cerebral grey matter target regions [52] . Similarly, Schmidt et al. described quantitative assessment of cortical amyloid signal (reflecting amyloid plaque deposition) relative to a reference region that is believed not to accumulate amyloid (normal reference area), producing the SUVr measurement [50] . Wong et al. employed parametric reference region method or a simplified SUVr calculated from 10 min of scanning, 50-60 min after [ 18 F]FBP administration [29] .\nA step by step approach at assessment of amyloid scans is to scrutinize the CT scan images for abnormalities in the structure. Subsequently, ROIs will be selected to evaluate cortical regions associated with significant amyloid burden in MCI and AD patients. By using the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) atlas on SPM software the scans are normalized to the standard brain template and mean cortical and cerebellar values are calculated to give the SUVr data. Routinely, six (6) cortical grey matter regions are targeted for the ROI analysis, i.e., anterior and posterior cingulate, medial orbital frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, and the precuneus [53] .\nThere have been many preset threshold SUVr values that have been proposed to improve the sensitivity and specificity of amyloid PET scans (Table 1, column 8 and Table 2 , column 9). Among the initially recommended preset cutoff points of SUVr \u2265 1.17 was indicated to reflect amyloid levels in the pathological range based on separate in vivo PET studies and autopsy reports from nineteen (19) end-of-life patients [54] . Hence, they were able to portray that [ 18 F]FBP PET SUVr values can potentially be used to characterize fibrillary amyloid levels in clinical cases having probable AD, MCI, and among cognitively normal older adults, by using continuous and binary visual read measures of A\u03b2 load. Frequently, concurrent MRI scans are used to normalize the PET data and improve on the anatomical localization of AD pathology.\nConversely, qualitative visual reads assessment using amyloid PET scans have been noted to have a sensitivity of approximately 84.6% (95% CI 0.55-0.98) and a specificity of approximately 38.1% (95% CI 0.18-0.62) for differentiating AD patients from healthy control subjects [55] . Nevertheless, improved scan parameters and the combination of other biomarkers have aided in improving the test accuracy (Table 1; Table 2 ). Although the quantitative assessment of the global cortex SUVr-despite being more time consuming-is advocated to be more accurate, with improved sensitivity of 92.3% and specificity of 90.5% using a threshold value of 1.122 (area under the curve, AUC 0.894) [55] , much work is needed for the standardization of scanning and the reporting techniques, the protocol for global regional uptake assessment, and the selection of the region of reference.\nIn view of visual assessment and SUVr assessment having a discrepancy of approximately 10%, it is evident that we need to look elsewhere for further improvements in the diagnostic confidence of interpreting amyloid PET scans. Quantification is particularly useful in equivocal cases and for the purpose of providing numerical data that can reflect the change in amyloid load that is related to anti-amyloid therapy.\nFinally, it is important to be aware that AD occurs as a spectrum of impairment in various levels of cognitive function, sometimes with additional confounding neuropsychiatric symptoms, which makes it difficult to have a standardized tool or threshold for confirming the diagnosis. As a matter of fact, it is well known that there are discordant areas of sites of atrophy noted on structural MRI, regional hypometabolism noted on 18 F-FDG PET with areas of amyloid deposition detected by amyloid PET imaging. This phenomenon is likely due to the longitudinal evolution of hypometabolism, which occurs in the cerebral regions that are remotely located but connected by functionality with areas of increased amyloid burden [56] . Hence, it is evident that various imaging data, clinical, molecular, and genetic information are required to be evaluated in tandem as they provide complementary information for improved management of AD."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The prevalence of amyloid PET positivity among healthy older adults is among the main limitations of this diagnostic imaging. It is speculated that age-specific positivity rates for amyloid PET are less than 5% in those 50-60 years old, 10-12% in those 60 to 70 years old, 25-30% in those 70-80 years old, and increases exponentially to more than 50% in persons aged 80-90 years [57] .\nAnother major caveat is that a positive amyloid scan can also be seen not only in AD, but also in other medical conditions. For example, amyloid PET is frequently positive in DLB [58] . Nevertheless, [ 18 F]FDG scans can play a role in identifying the 'cingulate island sign' (CIS), which is present in DLB and demonstrates increased glucose metabolism in the posterior cingulate cortex [59, 60] . The CIS is highly specific for DLB (97-100%) but with lower sensitivity (62-86%) [60] . The sensitivity of detecting DLB by neuroimaging can be improved by presynaptic dopaminergic imaging using [ 123 I]FP-CIT (DaTSCAN, GE Healthcare), which can give a pooled sensitivity of 86.5% (95% CI: 72-94.1%), but with relatively lower specificity of 93.6% (95% CI: 88.5-96.6%) [61] . Conversely, amyloid PET scans may, in certain instances, underestimate the brain amyloid plaque burden, especially in the setting of low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A\u03b2 42 levels and mild NCD of the AD type [62] . In cases of FTD, which has a similar insidious onset as AD but with predominantly language and behavioral abnormalities, [ 18 F]FDG PET may detect hypometabolism more frequent in the frontal, anterior cingulate, and anterior temporal regions, as opposed to the temporo-parietal and posterior cingulate regions in AD [63] . Although there can be some overlapping areas that demonstrate [ 18 F]FDG, PET amyloid scans often can differentiate FTD from AD as these cases demonstrate significantly lower amyloid uptake in frontal, temporo-parietal, and occipital lobes as well as in the putamen [64] ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The aim of performing imaging scans in AD is to non-invasively aid in the diagnosis and provide objective confirmatory evidence of the cause of the neurocognitive deficit.
