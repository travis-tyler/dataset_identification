[{"section_title": "2", "text": "To Be or Not to Be Major Choices in Budding Scientists Eric Bettinger"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Over the last forty years, the supply of US-born scientists and engineers has dropped dramatically. In 1970, 3,547 US citizens received doctoral degrees in the physical sciences. By 2005, this number had fallen to 1,986. Over the same period, the number of Americans earnings doctorates in math fell from 1,088 to 541, and the number in engineering fell from 2,957 to 2,284. 1 From 1966 to 2000 the proportion of US-trained doctorates born in the United States declined from 77 percent to 61 (Freeman, Jin, and Shen 2004). These trends in science and math, coupled with the increase in foreignborn, US-trained doctorates in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fi elds have led to great consternation among policymakers and industry analysts. The National Academy of Science (2007,3), for example, stated, \"Having reviewed trends in the United States and abroad, the committee is deeply concerned that the scientifi c and technological building blocks critical to our economic leadership are eroding at a time when many other nations are gathering strength. . . . [W]e are worried about the future prosperity of the United States. Although many people assume that the United States will always be a world leader in science and technology, this may not continue to be the case inasmuch as great minds and ideas exist throughout the world. We fear the abruptness with which a lead in science and technology can be lost-and the difficulty of recovering a lead once lost, if indeed it can be regained at all.\" Similar pronouncements have come from the American Council on Competitiveness, the American Association of Universities, and other government agencies. Many of the statements bring up the concern that the increased reliance on foreign-born scientists may have ramifi cations for national security. For example, the Hart-Rudman Commission on National Security (2001, ix) claimed that the \"U.S. government has seriously underfunded basic scientifi c research in recent years\" and that the \"inadequacies of our systems of research and education pose a greater threat to U.S. national security over the next quarter century than any potential conventional war that we might imagine.\" There are several possible reasons for the decrease in US-born students pursuing advanced studies in STEM 2 fi elds. One possibility is that US schools have become worse in either fostering interest in the sciences or in actually teaching the material. For example, over the last forty years, a period in which the overall number of students attending college increased by 84 percent, the number of US-born students intending to major in a science or engineering fi eld has either been constant (through 1995) or falling (since 2001) (ACT 2006). Additionally, indicators of students' aptitude in science and math in primary and secondary school provide similar hints that the United States is lagging behind other countries. In the 2003 math scores on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), fourth graders scored twelfth out of twenty-four countries and sixth among the ten participating Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Eighth graders performed similarly, ranking nineteenth of the forty-four participating countries and tenth of the twelve participating OECD countries. 3 Another potential explanation for the decline in US-born students pursuing advanced studies in STEM fi elds is that students have become more attuned to labor market outcomes and the rewards for pursuing STEM careers. Indeed, the annual survey of college freshmen conducted since 1966 by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA suggests a high and growing attention to pecuniary rewards as a life goal. In 1966, 54 percent of freshmen claimed that it was important to them to be \"very well-off fi nancially\" and by 2006 this fi gure had climbed to 73 percent (Pryor, et al. 2007). 2. The defi nition of STEM is somewhat amorphous. Many early studies on the shortage of STEM workers focused on \"scientists and engineers.\" Modern defi nitions focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics although the range of included fi elds can also include economics. For the purpose of this chapter, our defi nition of STEM includes computer science, mathematics, engineering, engineering technologies, and the physical and biological sciences. When we refer to \"scientists and engineers,\" we include all workers included in our defi nition of STEM workers. 3. The TIMSS results are accessible at http:/ / nces.ed.gov/ timss/ . Over that same period, salaries in many non-STEM fi elds have increased more rapidly than salaries in STEM fi elds. Some have argued that, despite the falling numbers, there is no \"shortage\" of US-born scientists. Addressing Sputnik-era concerns over STEM pipelines, articles by Alchian, Arrow, and Capron (1958), Arrow and Capron (1959), and Blank and Stigler (1957) argued that a key distinction of the labor market for scientists and engineers was the high degree of inelasticity in the short run supply of engineers. The training of new engineers and scientists can take years as students progress through four to fi ve years of undergraduate training, eight to ten years of graduate training, and then postdoctoral work. As a result, the supply of scientists may take years to respond to shifts in demand, and the labor market conditions may change between the time that students enter the labor market and the time that they fi nish their training (Freeman 1976). Because supply may take years to respond, the labor market can go through periods of surplus and shortage-called \"cobwebs\" in the labor market literature. Indeed, the market for scientists and engineers has fl uctuated between shortage and surplus throughout the last half century. While many academics and policymakers have argued that there is a shortage of scientists and engineers (e.g., NSF 1989;Atkinson 1990), others (e.g., Teitelbaum 2007;Ryoo and Rosen 2004) have suggested that the STEM labor market continues to function as one might expect. This chapter focuses on an earlier point in the pipeline of scientists and engineers-specifi cally, the development of scientists and engineers in undergraduate studies. As the labor market models underscore, the decision to become a scientist or engineer largely starts when students enter their undergraduate study and choose their major. For many students, this may even start in high school as they develop skills and interest in science and engineering and start to choose a major. As students progress through college, they have the opportunity to stay in their major or change. Once they graduate, the probability that students will pursue careers in science and engineering is quite small if they do not major in a relevant fi eld during their undergraduate careers. This chapter seeks to do four things. First, we review what is meant by the \"STEM pipeline,\" specifi cally focusing on how students' major choice plays a role in the development of scientists and engineers. Second, we present a number of frameworks that may shed light on students' major choices and the perceived shortage of STEM professionals. We focus extensively on how relative earnings have changed in different professions. Third, we present new data showing that many of the brightest undergraduate students who are arguably the most prepared to pursue graduate studies in STEM fi elds are systematically moving away from the hard sciences into fi elds where earnings might be 5 to 15 percent higher (e.g., fi nance and accounting). While we make few statements about the state of science and math instruc-tion in primary and secondary education, we show that there is a signifi cant pipeline of students who are prepared to enter careers in the sciences. Finally, we examine how women and minorities choose STEM fi elds. Over the last forty years, the number of women and minorities majoring in STEM fi elds has dramatically increased (see fi gures 2.3 and 2.4). The trends for women and minorities seem to be opposite that of the overall profession. Yet among the top performing students in our sample, we fi nd that African Americans are more likely than other top performers to persist in STEM majors while top performing women are less likely to do so."}, {"section_title": "The STEM Pipeline", "text": "Our focus is on a particular part of the STEM pipeline-students' major choices. To help motivate why major choices are central to the STEM pipeline, we fi rst review what we mean by the STEM pipeline and the role that major choice plays in that pipeline. Then to help shed light on why students choose STEM majors, we discuss the three key phases of career selection. We discuss when and how students make initial indications as to what major they want to pursue, how major choices evolve in college, and how career choices change after college."}, {"section_title": "STEM Major Choices and the STEM Pipeline", "text": "The STEM pipeline is the phrase used to describe STEM education throughout schooling levels and eventually culminating in the labor force. The development of a new scientist begins quite early and can only be effectuated through a series of steps. It starts with primary and secondary school, where students have to acquire both the skills and the interest in STEM fi elds to be successful in postsecondary studies. It continues grade by grade as students continue to acquire the skills and interests that might shape their decision as to whether or not to study STEM fi elds after secondary school. 4 At any level, students must acquire the skills and the interest in STEM fi elds which will enable them to continue progressing in the fi eld and help qualify them for the next level. Once students enter a postsecondary school, students in the STEM pipeline may continue to prepare for graduate school admission in a STEM postgraduate program. Similarly, a student's performance in their graduate program helps them attain productive employment related to their STEM training. As the STEM pipeline has been popularized, the failure at any level of schooling to spawn interest or to prepare students academically leads to decreased supply of STEM workers. Alarm over the state of the pipeline largely focuses on the fact that the supply of US-born scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees is extremely low relative to the levels from the early 1970s, as shown in fi gures 2.1 and 2.2. In the various STEM fi elds, there was a systematic and constant decline in the number of doctorates throughout the 1970s. In the physical sciences, the downward trends begin to level off in the late 1970s. Since 1980, the trend has been relatively constant, refl ecting a 50 percent decline from the 1970 peak."}, {"section_title": "Fig. 2.2 Growth of total doctorates among US citizens relative to 1970", "text": "Source: Data from NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates."}, {"section_title": "Fig. 2.1 Growth of total doctorates among US citizens and permanent residents relative to 1970", "text": "Source: Data from NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates. In engineering, the downward trend in the number of earned doctorates continued through the early 1980s. In the early 1980s, the trend started to reverse itself and more and more students began entering doctoral studies in engineering. This upward trend continued through the mid-1990s, where it actually surpassed the level from 1970. Thereafter, the number of students earning doctorates declined again. In math, the drop in the number of earned doctorates continued throughout the 1970s and most of the 1980s. In its lowest years, the decline in math doctorates among US citizens had gone from 1,030 awarded in 1970 to 342 in 1988. While the number of math doctorates awarded each year has failed to reach its 1970 level it has also increased to around 500 per year from its low in 1988. The decline in earned doctorates contrasts dramatically with the college enrollment patterns from 1970 to 2005. Over that time, undergraduate fulltime enrollments increased by 86 percent, and the total number of college students increased by 104 percent (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES] 2008). Yet enrollments in STEM fi elds have had more modest growth. The number of undergraduate engineering students increased by 14 percent from 1979 to 2002 (National Science Foundation [NSF] 2004), and the number of engineering degrees awarded between 1979 and 2000 increased by 11 percent. Although the number of STEM majors increased by 31 percent between 1977 and 2002, this increase masks substantial heterogeneity: while the number of bachelor degrees awarded in the physical sciences and in math decreased over this period, the number of students majoring in computer science increased by 482 percent (NSF 2004). The proportion of students stating that they wanted to major in science and engineering increased from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s; however, most of this growth can be explained by an increase in the numbers of women who are now pursuing careers in science and engineering. As fi gure 2.3 shows, the number of males who were awarded degrees in STEM fi elds decreased between 1977 and 2000 by about 1 percent. By contrast, the number of women who were awarded degrees in STEM fi elds increased by 91 percent (NSF 2004). The number of white students receiving bachelor degrees in STEM fi elds decreased over this same period from 292,800 in 1979 to 270,420 in 2000. By contrast, as fi gure 2.4 shows, the number of minority students receiving bachelor degrees in STEM fi elds increased dramatically. While we have good data on degree completion through the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), we have less data on the dynamics of major choice when students arrive at college. The Beginning Postsecondary Student Survey (BPSS) tracked beginning freshmen over six years. At the start of students' careers in 1995, about 20 percent of all students indicated a desire to major in a STEM fi eld. Among students who indicated a major, 28 percent indicated a desire to major in a STEM fi eld. By 2001, only about 48 percent of those who had started out in the biologi-cal sciences had persisted in the major and only 71 percent of students in physical sciences, engineering, and math had stayed in the major. Additionally, upon entering college, students lack signifi cant coursework in math and science (ACT 2006). The ACT estimates that only 26 percent of students met the necessary benchmarks in terms of the science curriculum that they took in high school in preparation for college. Only 41 percent of students took the ACT's recommended classes in math. Given that these percentages of students focus only on students who actually took the ACT exam, they likely overestimate the preparedness of students in math and science in the overall population. Worries about the STEM pipeline have been the motivation for policy decisions affecting education at all levels-primary, secondary, undergraduate, and postgraduate. For example, according to the Academic Competitive Council (ACC 2007), the federal government invested $574 million across  twenty-four programs focused on elementary and secondary school students. The federal government allocated $2.4 billion across seventy undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate programs. The federal government funded an additional eleven informal projects with an overall budget around $137 million. Additionally, the United States introduced the National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (SMART) Grant in the 2006 and 2007 school year. This grant augments a Pell Grant by up to $4,000 per year if students are US citizens, have a grade point average (GPA) over 3.0, and are enrolled in a key STEM fi eld. 5 While these statistics certainly suggest a level of unpreparedness for many students, they shed little light on the choices and decisions made by the most prepared students. In section 2.4 of the chapter, we present some data on students who are seemingly prepared to enter STEM fi elds upon entry into college. Before moving on to those results, we fi rst outline how students choose careers and theories of how students aim to choose majors."}, {"section_title": "Major and Career Choice", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Frameworks for Major Choices", "text": "We focus on two conceptual frameworks that researchers have used to characterize students' choice of majors and careers. The fi rst framework is attributed to Holland (1966Holland ( , 1973 and is widely used by colleges to help students choose between majors. The second framework comes from the economic model of human capital development. We discuss these in turn. Holland's model has its foundations in psychology and sociology. 6 Holland's theory is that there are six personality types (Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, and Conventional). People with each personality type have competencies and values that draw them to specifi c activities and give them a certain self-perception. When a student is trying to decide on a major, college career centers usually offer a battery of questions aimed at deriving competencies, activities, self-perceptions, and values that interest or characterize a specifi c student. These competencies, activities, self-perceptions, and values are then mapped into specifi c careers. 7 Specifi c environmental characteristics are similarly linked to specifi c \"environment types\" using the same six personality descriptors. Batteries and surveys that attempt to help students choose majors and occupations try to identify specifi c majors and specifi c occupations/ settings that bring together both students' internal personality and an appropriate environment. 5. As of June 2009, Congress was strongly considering eliminating this program. 6. Holland's theories are reviewed extensively by Smart, Feldman, and Ethington (2000) and Pascarella and Terenzini (2005). Holland's early work is among the most cited papers in psychology on occupational choice. 7. There are a number of resources that map job titles to college majors including Rosen, Holmberg, and Holland (1989) and Gottfredson and Holland (1996). According to the theory, students persist or initially adopt majors if their personality characteristics and their environment are compatible. For example, an investigative student in an investigative environment will be able to pursue a major compatible with their interests (e.g., engineering). By contrast, a student who is not in a \"compatible\" environment will likely switch majors multiple times and is at risk of not succeeding. Much of the application of Holland's theory to choice of major has focused on the degree to which an institution creates an environment that fosters students' personality development (e.g., Feldman, Smart, and Ethington 2004). Because Holland's theory focuses heavily on the institution and its compatibility, it has led policymakers and scholars in psychology and sociology to focus extensively on institutional characteristics in the retention of students in specifi c majors and their development within majors. Research in both education and economics has shown that institutional characteristics matter for major choice. For example, Bettinger and Long (2009) fi nd that college remediation affects students' major choice. Feldman, Smart, and Ethington (2004) shows that institutions can affect competencies, values, and self-perceptions, which in turn can alter students' dominant personality traits. Other research in economics fi nds that peer effects infl uence students' study habits and perceptions (e.g., Sacerdote 2001;Kremer and Levy 2003). Another theory of major choice comes from models of human capital formation (e.g., Manski 1993). The standard idea is that students will choose a specifi c major (or course/ degree in education) if the expected, presentvalue of lifetime utility for choosing that major is higher than the expected value of any other. Equation (1) demonstrates this relationship in more mathematical terms: where R is the discount rate, T represents the working lifetime of an adult, K i is the length of training in the fi eld of study i, E [.] is the expectation operator, and y i and c i refer to the earnings and cost of training in the fi eld of study i. The equation shows that a student will choose fi eld j so long as the expected earnings in that fi eld net of the cost of training exceed that of another fi eld i. The length of training, the earnings, and costs can differ by fi eld. Supporting the relevance of the human capital model to decision making of students is the fact that American students have become more focused on vocational offerings. Many have noted that the students' shifts away from STEM majors have often gone toward more \"market-based utilitarianism\" (Smart, Feldman, and Ethington 2006). Several authors have noted that over the last two decades students are increasingly pursuing more vocational course offerings (e.g., Adelman 1995;Brint 2002;Grubb and Lazerson 2005). Students are moving toward majors related to specifi c professions, a trend that is consistent with the rise, noted previously, in the percentage of American college freshmen who highly value being \"very well off fi nancially\" in their future and the decline in the percentage who count as an important goal to \"develop a meaningful philosophy of life\" (Pryor et al. 2007, ?). Similarly, work by Montmarquette, Cannings, and Mahseredjian (2002) fi nd that expected earnings is the major determinant of students' college choices. Del Rossi and Hersch (2008) fi nd that double majors that include business are even more lucrative to students than double majors not involving business. This may also explain why business accounts for half of students who eventually move away from STEM majors. In the human capital model, students' discount rates play a vital role in helping balance the trade-offs between current costs and future rewards. The more impatient that students are, the more they will eschew long periods of training before entering the labor force. Additionally, the years of training and the earnings profi le within careers can also discourage investment in specifi c careers. In science and engineering, especially in the case of students pursuing doctoral careers, the median completion time for students to complete their doctorate following their bachelor degree work is high, ranging from 8.5 in engineering, 8.0 years in mathematics, and 8.1 years in the biological sciences, to 9.5 years in computer science (NSF 2004). A student's choice of careers can be costly. It takes time to search through several possible fi elds of study, and the costliness of the search may encourage students to reduce the amount of search that they do (e.g., Oi 1974) or to trust other students. In the standard model, students incur search costs as they try to identify the optimal career. They may be content to take a \"lesser\" career rather than to continue searching. Alternatively, they may overvalue information from their peers and allow peer effects (or \"herd\" behavior) to infl uence their choices of careers. A variation of the search cost model is one of limited information. Students may not have full access to information about careers when they make their decisions to study. A student who pursues business and commits early on may not explore other fi elds in which the student may have experienced similar success. Students, especially those who wish to study in high credit degree areas like in the sciences, must commit to their fi eld of study early in order to complete the degree requirements and to graduate in a timely fashion. The rigidity of the degree requirements in science and engineering fi elds often discourages exploration of other disciplines. Holland's model and the human capital model are not mutually exclusive. For example, suppose that students compute the expected value of a profession given their current information about their skills. As students acquire new information about their abilities or as institutions improve students' capabilities in a specifi c dimension, students will have new information about their skills and potential returns in a given fi eld. If students are Bayesian updaters, then they will reevaluate equation 1continuously. If the expected value of an alternative major (given students' current beliefs about their abilities) exceeds that of their current major, students will change majors. Both of these frameworks provide conceptualization about both the process of initially choosing a major and about persistence within that major. We now turn our attention to the timing of initial major choices and subsequent persistence in the major."}, {"section_title": "Timing of Major Choice", "text": "Students initially decide on a major at the end of high school or the beginning of college. College admissions tests and application forms ask students to indicate a potential fi eld of study when they enter college. When UCLA began surveying incoming students in 1966, only 2 percent of students were undecided as to what major they wanted to pursue when they entered college. Over time, this has increased to over 8 percent of students entering without majors chosen (Astin et al. 1997). Although an overwhelming majority of students have indicated a potential major, there is much less certainty about whether they will persist in the major. According to UCLA's survey of fi rst-year students, 49 percent of students entered college saying that there was \"some chance\" or \"a very good chance\" that they would change their major at some point in college (Saenz and Barrera 2007). Similarly, 55 percent of students thought that they would change their choice of careers. The large number of students who think that they may change fi elds suggests that students are consciously and actively considering multiple major and career options as they enter college. Students' movements across majors begin in their fi rst semesters. Within the fi rst year of college, 30 percent of students change their major (Saenz and Barrera 2007). What has changed in that fi rst year? According to the UCLA student survey, there have been increases in students' reported computer skills, public speaking ability, and writing. Students also report higher levels of cooperation and \"self-understanding.\" By contrast, students report less mathematical ability, less \"drive to achieve,\" and less academic ability than they thought they had when they fi rst arrived. Holland's model would predict that these changes should push students toward majors requiring less mathematical ability and where the competitive environment is less intense. Once students formally choose a major (typically by the start of the second year), they still frequently switch majors. One institution, for example, found that 51 percent of students changed their majors at least once after formally indicating a major, and 19 percent of students changed their major two or more times after formally declaring a major (Sethi and Shi 2008). Given that the formal declaration of a major need not be the same major as indicated on a student's application or college entrance exam, it is clear that there is substantial mobility across majors once students arrive at school. Even if a student enters a specifi c STEM major, there is no guarantee that their eventual career will be in a STEM fi eld. To illustrate, about 50 percent of engineering majors aim to pursue an advanced degree in business or law. Similarly, 50 percent of students in biology and physics pursue advanced degrees in fi elds other than biology or physics. Medical degrees are the most common training among these students, although many also pursue advanced degrees in business or law. Depending on the fi eld of study, only 30 to 40 percent of engineering, physical or computer science, or math students go on to study these same fi elds in graduate school."}, {"section_title": "The Role of Relative Wages", "text": "The heart of the human capital model is the idea that individuals make educational decisions by comparing their lifetime utilities in alternative prospective careers. This calculation applies to major choice as well. Generally speaking, economists have largely used earnings as the measure of the overall lifetime utility of careers, and so economics typically examines major choice by comparing the returns to earnings across many disciplines. Identifying the economic returns to a particular major is difficult since students' choices of majors may be correlated with students' underlying abilities. Perhaps the best measures of returns to various disciplines come from Donald and Hammermesh (2004). Using data from a single, large university, they tracked earnings profi les across majors. They control for students' ability to separate the fi nancial rewards from a specifi c major and those from students' abilities. Their estimates appear in table 2.1. The estimates represent the percent differences in wages across majors relative to majoring in education. The highest earning fi eld was \"hard\" business. This category included the more quantitative fi elds in business, including accounting, fi nance, and business engineering. Hard business majors earned about 52 percent more than students in education. Students in the \"soft\" business majors, which include management and marketing, made 41 percent more than students in education. Social science majors earned 31 percent more than education. The STEM fi elds fared far better than education, with engineers making 37 percent more and natural science majors making 29 percent more, but in both cases students make less money than they do in the business fi elds. Similarly, older data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics seem to support Donald and Hamermesh's evidence. Hecker (1995) reports that there was very little difference between the earnings of business majors and STEM majors. In fact, women in business and accounting earned more money than women whose degrees were in chemistry, biology, or mathematics. They earned less than those with degrees in architecture or engineering. Women in economics earned more than women in any of the STEM fi elds. Men in accounting and business had similar earnings to those in the highest-paid STEM fi elds-engineering, math, physics, and computer science-and they had higher earnings than men who had majored in biology and chemistry. Business majors had similar earnings to those in biology and chemistry. For both males and females, majors in business and economics had higher earnings than majors in the other social sciences, humanities, and education. Not only are the absolute wages of non-STEM fi elds often higher than those in STEM fi elds, the wage growth has also been higher. From 1991 to 2001, business wages increased by 27 percent, compared to only 19 percent for engineering and 21 percent for math and computer science. These divergent wage increases are not only indicative of demand shocks, but they may also provide one key input to students' decision making. They help students project future earnings in a given profession, making business even more attractive relative to STEM fi elds. As we show following, at least half of students who started as STEM majors and eventually moved to other majors ended up pursuing business as a major. There are still other job-related differences that could contribute to the attractiveness of non-STEM majors over STEM majors. For example, one factor that infl uences major decision and labor market participation is the duration of the training needed to enter a career. Each additional year that a student needs to pursue training means another year of foregone earnings. Since the returns to majors may be dynamic, students have to project into the future their potential earnings in a given career. Arrow and Capron (1959) were among the fi rst to explore how labor supply responded given the fact that training took time. They published their paper shortly after Sputnik had been launched and at a time when the United States was heavily encouraging the development of more US-born scientists. They claimed that a model of \"dynamic shortage\" could explain the labor market for scientists. As noted before, the type of labor market adjustments described by Arrow and Capron is an example of a cobweb model. In Arrow and Capron's model, an increase in labor demand leads to a shortage of engineers and an increase in real wages. This wage increase makes a career as a scientist or engineer more attractive to potential students. As students' expected earnings in STEM fi elds increase relative to other majors, college students should respond accordingly by switching their majors. As more workers respond to the higher wages by changing careers, the labor supply curve shifts out leading real wages to decline. As each person fi nishes their training, they lead the supply curve to shift out, but there is no guarantee that the supply curve will not shift \"too far\" out. The duration of training in STEM fi elds is longer than that of other fi elds. For example, the eight to ten years that students typically spend earning a doctorate in a STEM fi eld is quite a bit longer than the two years needed for a business degree or the three years needed for a law degree. Not only do students forego more years in the labor market, but the labor market conditions may have changed dramatically from when they entered their training to the end of their training, and while workers are getting their training. If the labor supply curve shifts too far, it could actually lead to declining real wages among scientists and engineers. It could also lead to periods of surplus and shortage in the market for scientists and engineers-cobwebs left over from the previous shift in supply. The key factor in the adjustment is the elasticity of the supply of scientists and engineers. The cobweb model has been tested over and over again. Freeman (1971Freeman ( , 1975Freeman ( , 1976 and Breneman and Freeman (1974) provided early tests examining the market for engineers. It has also been applied to the market for lawyers (Freeman 1975, Pashigian 1977. More recent work by Ryoo and Rosen (2004) extends these models with advances made in economic theory. As in the earlier studies, Ryoo and Rosen (2004) fi nd that the cobweb model of supply and demand accurately characterizes the market for engineers. They note that there have been several periods of surplus in the market over the last four decades. They also pay special attention to identifying the lifetime earnings that an engineer can reasonably expect at the time that they commit to a specifi c area of study. They fi nd that the supply of engineers closely corresponds with variations in the lifetime earning cycle of engineers at the time that engineers commit to their career. Periods of shortage and surplus correspond to unexpected demand shocks in the labor market for engineers. One important consequence of the resulting gyrations in wages has been to make engineering a riskier, and thus less attractive, career option for American students."}, {"section_title": "Major Choices and Transitions", "text": "To shed some light on the STEM pipeline during college, we present some evidence based on students' transcripts in college. We do not present any new evidence on the STEM pipeline leading to college. Instead, we focus on how college students make decisions about major choice once enrolled in college. The data that we use come from the Ohio Board of Regents and represent students who entered college for the fi rst time during the 1998 and 1999 school year. Beginning in the 1998 and 1999 school year, the Ohio Board of Regents began tracking students' transcripts at all of Ohio's fi fty-two public colleges and universities. Additionally, the Ohio Board of Regents collaborates with the College Board to match students' collegiate records to the students' ACT exam scores and survey. Hence, for each student, we observe the students' ACT exam scores and self-reported high school transcript data from the ACT survey. During the ACT survey, students indicate which majors they intend to pursue while in college. With the transcript data from the Ohio Board of Regents, we observe all of the classes that they take in college, and ultimately we observe their major choices. Our sample consists of students who fi rst enrolled in the 1998 and 1999 school year at one of Ohio's four-year campuses. We further restrict our sample to those students who took the ACT exam when they entered college and who designated a major at that time. 8 We need this last restriction to identify students who have interests in STEM fi elds. The Ohio data are advantageous in that we can track students across schools within the Ohio public higher education system (four-year and twoyear institutions). If a student transfers and changes majors, we can observe the outcome. We cannot track students who leave the state, although previous work has suggested that any bias from this is small (Bettinger 2004). Table 2.2 shows the pre-college major choices for students in our data. We show this for a variety of samples. For example, only about 2 percent of the sample claims that they want to major in the humanities at the start of college. The social sciences attract 13.3 percent while the sciences attract 8.0 percent of students. Business and education are the most attractive precollege majors, with 23.4 and 17.5 percent of students choosing these topics, respectively. Engineering also attracts a signifi cant number of students, with nearly 11.7 percent of students choosing this major before college. The other columns of table 2.2 refi ne the sample somewhat. The second column focuses on students scoring 25 or over on their ACT exams. This represents the top 28 percent of all students taking the ACT exam. This is likely a subsample that is more likely to pursue the sciences or engineering in college. Similarly, the other columns of table 2.2 include, respectively, students with science ACT exam scores 25 and over, with math ACT exam scores 25 and over, and with high school GPAs 3.5 and over in math. Of these subsamples, each of them is more likely to major in science and engineering than the overall sample. For example, of the students scoring over 24 on the ACT science exam, 12.6 percent hope to major in science and 19.9 percent hope to major in engineering. As a whole, science and engineering are more attractive than education and business combined. In thinking about the STEM pipeline, these subsamples of students are likely the ones who may eventually pursue careers in science and engineering and go on for study in those fi elds. Table 2.3 shows some descriptive statistics for these samples. We have restricted our sample to full-time, traditional age (i.e., eighteen to twenty), fi rst-time students, so students' age at the start of college is around eighteen. About 86 percent of students are white. This is slightly higher than the Ohio's overall system, but given that we are focused on students who took the ACT exam, this is not surprising. About 7 percent of students are African American and 52 percent of students are female. The average ACT score is 22 and this is true for the math and science tests as well. About 78 percent of the sample currently or last attended a four-year college. Twenty-two percent of this sample took math remediation during their college careers. The subsamples of students, generally speaking, have fewer minority students, fewer women, higher ACT scores, higher likelihoods of attending four-year colleges, and lower likelihoods of attending math remediation Notes: Data are from the Ohio Board of Regents and include traditional-aged (age eighteen to twenty) students who entered a four-year Ohio public college in the fall 1998. The sample is further restricted to students who declared a major on their ACT survey. than the overall sample. The one point that table 2.3 accentuates is that women and minorities continue to be underrepresented among students who enter college highly prepared to study in science and technology. Similar to national patterns, at least at this point in the pipeline, these groups are continuing to be underrepresented. Our focus is to see what majors students eventually choose. To do that, we focus simply on whether students intended to major in a STEM fi eld or not. 9 In table 2.4, we compare students' pre-college choices of major to their college decisions. For students originally desiring to major in STEM fi elds, only about 43 percent of them actually go on to major in STEM fi elds. The rest transfer to non-STEM majors. For students who originally desired to major in non-STEM fi elds, most (95 percent) stay in non-STEM fi elds. Only 5 percent of them ever transfer into STEM fi elds. As we focus on a more science-and/ or math-oriented population, there is some improvement, but STEM majors have a poorer retention rate than non-STEM majors. The STEM majors retain only between 50 and 54 percent of students interested in STEM fi elds. The retention rate is highest Notes: Data are from the Ohio Board of Regents and include traditional-aged (age eighteen to twenty) students who entered a four-year Ohio public college in the fall 1998. The sample is further restricted to students who declared a major on their ACT survey. The STEM includes computer science, mathematics, engineering, engineering technologies, and the physical and biological sciences. 9. We include math, sciences, computer science, engineering, and engineering technology as the key STEM fi elds. among the sample of students with high math scores. The STEM majors attract away 7 to 9 percent of students who originally wanted to major in non-STEM fi elds. One way to examine major choice and STEM retention is to look at the timing of students' defections from STEM majors. When we observe students at the end of high school, we know their major intentions. The nature of our data allows us to then track their course schedules as they start college. We focus on the fi rst semester schedules, as these are likely the most exogenous to institutional efforts to increase STEM participation. Students commit to these schedules when they arrive at college, and we focus on the classes that they attempt rather than those that they complete successfully. In fi gure 2.5, we plot the proportion of STEM courses that students take during the fi rst semester. Students who are interested in STEM fi elds clearly take more STEM classes than students who expressed interest in another major. The STEM majors take, on average, 52 percent of their fi rst semester courses in STEM fi elds, compared to 28 percent for non-STEM majors. Figure 2.6 repeats the previous exercise, but it divides the pre-college students who were interested in STEM into two categories: those who eventually majored in STEM and those who did not. Students who would stay in STEM majors took about 63 percent of their credit hours in STEM fi elds in their fi rst semester, whereas those who would eventually abandon STEM majors averaged only 42 percent. Figure 2.7 plots the difference between STEM \"stayers\" and \"defectors.\" This difference in the content of students' fi rst semester schedules can be seen not just in the overall sample, but also within subsamples of highachieving students. For example, if we restrict our sample to students with the highest ACT scores, the highest ACT math scores, the highest ACT science scores, or high school math GPAs greater than 3.5, we fi nd similar differences between eventual STEM majors and those who abandon STEM Notes: Data are from the Ohio Board of Regents and include traditional-aged (age eighteen to twenty) students who entered a four-year Ohio public college in the fall 1998. The sample is further restricted to students who declared a major on their ACT survey. The STEM includes computer science, mathematics, engineering, engineering technologies, and the physical and biological sciences. fi elds (fi gures 2.8 through 2.11). Even from the fi rst semester, differences emerge in the types of schedules that students take. It is not clear which way the causality runs in these cases. On the one hand, students who take fewer STEM courses may be identifying themselves as students who want to defect. On the other hand, taking more courses may generate more interest and consequently more commitment to the STEM major. Regardless, we see that students who more fully immerse themselves in STEM classes at the start are more likely to persist in the major. Although we do not present the fi gures here, the differences between those who stay in STEM majors and those who defect increases with each successive semester, as one might expect. What about the other students who switch to STEM fi elds from other fi elds? At least in the fi rst semester, they look quite similar to the students who originally declared a STEM major and then left. We plot their distribu- To Be or Not to Be: Major Choices in Budding Scientists 89 tions in fi gure 2.12. The distributions also look similar when we focus on students with higher ACT scores. Another way to view the same results is to fi gure out the probability that students eventually major in STEM according to the proportion of the courses they took in STEM fi elds during their fi rst semester and according to whether they indicated before college a desire to major in STEM fi elds. This is plotted in fi gure 2.13. Declaring a major in STEM fi elds before college automatically increases the probability that a student eventually majors in STEM fi elds. There is also a positive association of the proportion of STEM courses in the fi rst semester and eventual major choice for both groups. So what do we make of these results, and why do STEM fi elds have such 12 Proportion of fi rst-semester courses in STEM fi elds for students who later switch to STEM fi elds and those who switch out lower retention rates? One possible explanation is that students formulate their interest prior to college and only deviate slightly thereafter. For example, many studies (e.g., NAC 2007) report that students in STEM majors decided to pursue this major prior to college. These fi ndings are supported in fi gures 2.5 through 2.13 in that the differences between individuals' commitment to STEM already appears in students' fi rst semesters. Students who originally declared that they wanted to be a STEM major take a more STEM-fi lled schedule in their fi rst semester than other students. Students who are moving either away from STEM fi elds or toward them seem to take a lighter STEM load, but one that is still signifi cantly larger than students who have never expressed interest in STEM and eventually major in non-STEM fi elds. Another possible explanation is based on the rigidity of STEM majors. The STEM majors typically have high credit requirements. For example, engineering fi elds at the Ohio State University, the largest campus in our sample, require between 150 and 165 quarter hours for the core major requirements and technical electives. 10 Students have an additional requirement to complete roughly forty hours of general education requirements. A majority of students' fi rst couple of years at the university are spent taking prerequisites for upper-division classes, so a student majoring in one of these fi elds would have little space to explore other majors in their early careers. By contrast, a student majoring in economics or political science at Ohio State has substantial fl exibility. They must take forty-fi ve to fi fty quarter credits within their major. Students in these majors must complete an additional forty to forty-fi ve credit hours in general education as well. Given that the university requires 180 credit hours for graduation, students have almost two quarters of \"free time\" to explore other majors. In the fi rst year, a student in the sciences takes only required classes. If after that fi rst year the student chooses to pursue a program outside the sciences, he or she can still graduate in a timely fashion. On the other hand, a student who begins by exploring a major in one of these popular social studies majors will not complete the prerequisites necessary to change majors to the sciences. Changing to a STEM-related major would necessarily extend the time such students must wait for their degree. If hours were the sole criterion for shifting major choices, then the largest shifts of students would likely be toward the social sciences and humanities, but that is not the case. As Table 2.5 shows, of students who started as STEM majors and then eventually switched majors, 21 percent changed to the social sciences and 8 percent to the humanities. In comparison, 60 percent of defectors chose either business or education, majors that are much more demanding in terms of hours than the social sciences. For example, an accounting major at Ohio State must complete eighty-eight hours within the major and ninety-fi ve general education hours, and an education major needs at least 101 hours within the major and ninety-fi ve general education hours. While the general education hours may provide more fl exibility (and interchangeability with other majors), the hours in the major are almost twice that required in most social science or humanities majors. The same pattern appears when we look at high performing students who Notes: Data are from the Ohio Board of Regents and include traditional-aged (age eighteen to twenty) students who entered a four-year Ohio public college in the fall 1998. The sample is further restricted to students who declared a major on their ACT survey. The STEM includes computer science, mathematics, engineering, engineering technologies, and the physical and biological sciences. decided to change their major from a STEM fi eld to another. Half of these students choose business, while 20 to 24 percent of them choose social studies. As before, most of the transitions are going to hour-intensive majors. Part of the criticism of the hour-intensity of STEM majors is that students have little chance to explore other majors. While there may be some validity to this, we fi nd that many students who did not indicate interest in STEM prior to college are in fact able to switch to STEM majors. Students who switch out of STEM are not forced to do so because they took too many non-STEM classes in their fi rst semester. Another fact that undercuts the rigidity argument is that a number of students who are switching into STEM fi elds take similar schedules and are able to complete the hours needed for a STEM major. However, there are two facts that might still suggest some rigidity. First, when we look at fi gure 2.13, we see that the probability of majoring in STEM fi elds is quite low for students who did not indicate interest in STEM prior to college and who take less than about 60 percent of their fi rst semester schedule in non-STEM fi elds. Second, we have only examined students' fi rst semester schedules. It could be that students have very little fl exibility after the fi rst semester. What are the implications of these patterns in major choice on the STEM pipeline? On the one hand, the defection of many top students suggests that the STEM pipeline is leaky. Only about half of students in the top of the ability distribution who wanted to major in sciences before college continue in those majors through the end of college. On the other hand, many talented students who are prepared for and in a position to major in STEM fi elds make seemingly rational decisions to do otherwise. Signifi cant numbers have taken the early courses in STEM majors and switch majors to fi elds that are almost or perhaps even more lucrative both contemporaneously and in the long run."}, {"section_title": "Changing Patterns for Women and Minorities", "text": "As we have already shown, much of the growth in STEM majors over the last thirty years has taken place among women and minorities. Over that period, the number of women majoring in STEM fi elds increased by 91 percent. The number of African Americans and hispanics majoring in STEM fi elds increased dramatically as well. To examine how gender and race predict the likelihood that students major in STEM fi elds, we run linear probability models comparing the likelihood of switching out of a STEM major to the covariates in table 2.3. Our purpose is not to obtain causal estimates of any individual factor but to determine what correlates with the likelihood that students persist in a STEM major. Our sample focuses solely on students who indicated that they intended to major in STEM fi elds prior to college. The results appear in table 2.6. In the fi rst column, we report results for the full sample. In the full sample, females and older students are less likely to stay in STEM majors. African Americans are more likely to persist in STEM majors than other students. Students' overall ACT scores are negatively correlated with the likelihood of staying in a STEM major after controlling for students ACT math and science scores. These other scores are strongly and positively correlated with persistence in STEM fi elds. In column (2) we add fi xed effects for the specifi c major that students indicated prior to college. The results are very similar to those in column (1). In the third column, we focus only on students whose ACT scores are high. Within that group, women are about 11 percentage points less likely to stay in STEM majors, a result that is statistically signifi cant. This is similar to the fi nding by Dickson (2010) that women are less likely to major in STEM fi elds even after controlling for SAT scores and high school rank. The coefficient on being African American is positive but not statistically signifi cant. The ACT math scores remain the strongest indicator among the Notes: Sample \u03ed students indicating STEM major before college. Dependent variable \u03ed Probability of persisting in STEM major.

The sample is further restricted to students who declared a major on their ACT survey. The STEM includes computer science, mathematics, engineering, engineering technologies, and the physical and biological sciences. achievement variables. Remediation also seems to matter. Math remediation is marginally signifi cant, suggesting that it decreases the likelihood that students persist in STEM fi elds. English remediation seems to have the reverse relationship but is not signifi cant. It is hard to decipher the causal relationship of these remediation estimates, although work by Bettinger and Long (2009) shows that math remediation causes a decrease in the probability that students major in math fi elds. The results in the other columns of table 2.6 are similar. In every case, females, even among the top students who previously indicated an interest in STEM fi elds, are less likely to major in STEM fi elds. The ACT math scores seem to predict greater likelihoods of persistence in STEM fi elds. The coefficient on African Americans is always positive, suggesting that, among high achievers, African Americans are more likely to persist in STEM majors, but it is not always statistically signifi cant. The only results that are robust across all of the specifi cations are those for gender and ACT math scores. Those for ACT math scores seem fairly obvious: STEM fi elds require higher math skills and students' retention in these fi elds is tied to their abilities. On the other hand, the gender result is less obvious. The fact that women are underrepresented has long been discussed in academic literature. What is different here is that we have focused on the highest ability students; among them, women who have previously expressed interest in STEM fi elds are 9 to 14 percentage points less likely to stay in STEM majors than men."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "This chapter presents new descriptive evidence on the STEM pipeline. Using data from Ohio's four-year colleges, the chapter shows that STEM fi elds retain only about half of their students, and this retention rate does not improve signifi cantly when we restrict the analysis to top performing students. Even among top performing students, almost half of the students who indicated interest in STEM majors did not persist in STEM majors. Almost half of them switched and became business majors. Detection from STEM fi elds is particularly acute among high performing women. We also show how students' experimentation of STEM fi elds varies in the fi rst semester with their early and ultimate interest in STEM fi elds. During students' fi rst semester in college, the proportion of courses that they take in STEM fi elds is directly correlated with their eventual major. It is not clear which direction causality runs: students with less commitment to a STEM major may take fewer courses, or taking fewer courses may lead to less commitment. Nonetheless, students who eventually major in STEM fi elds take, on average, over 60 percent of their fi rst semester courses in STEM topics. To be sure, there are some students who take less than 60 percent of their sched-ule in STEM fi elds who still may major in STEM fi elds; however, students' chances of successfully completing STEM majors decline signifi cantly if they take less than 60 percent of the fi rst semester courses in STEM fi elds. What are the implications for the STEM pipeline? The fi rst observation is that some strongly prepared students who are interested in STEM fi elds nevertheless depart from STEM majors. Often they move to other fi elds that are more lucrative; as we showed in the previous section, wages in business can often be 5 to 15 percent higher than in STEM fi elds. These defections appear to be rational decisions. Evidence from other economists suggests that periods of surplus and shortage are endemic to the STEM market because of the prolonged training required. Given the responsiveness of students to wages, it may be that, as Ryoo and Rosen (2004, S110) observe, public policies that \"build technical talent ahead of demand are misplaced unless public policy makers have better information on future market conditions than the market participants do.\" The second observation is that students who depart STEM majors tend to do so early in their careers. As early as students' fi rst semesters, there is already a separation between the STEM course-taking intensity of eventual majors compared to the STEM intensity of students who previously expressed interest in STEM fi elds but eventually depart. If indeed the decision to depart from STEM fi elds occurs early in students' careers, public policy or institutional efforts aimed at improving retention in STEM majors must happen early in students' careers, or in enough time so that students can incorporate their expectations of the effects of such efforts in their career decision making. Third, women even at the top of the ability distribution are not pursuing STEM majors. In part because many are switching to more lucrative majors, they remain underrepresented in STEM fi elds. Other research by Bettinger and Long (2005) suggests that women's early experiences in STEM subjects in college affects their likelihood of persisting in these subjects. Finally, as other chapters in this volume have highlighted, the United States remains a net importer of scientifi c talent. While fewer US citizens are pursuing doctoral degrees in STEM fi elds, the US continues to lead the world in the production of doctorates and a signifi cant proportion of these students stay in the United States (NSF 2004). These facts, coupled with the choices that students make in choosing college majors, support the claims of Teitelbaum (2007) and others that the shortage of scientists and engineers is overstated."}]
