[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "ABSTRACT: Release 2.5 of the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) is a major update (covering 1662-2007) of the world's most extensive surface marine meteorological data collection. Building on extensive national and international partnerships, many new and improved contributing datasets have been processed into a uniform format and combined with the previous Release 2.4. The new data range from early non-instrumental ship observations to measurements initiated in the twentieth century from buoys and other automated platform types. Improvements to existing data include replacing preliminary Global Telecommunication System (GTS) receipts with more reliable, delayed mode reports for post-1997 data, and in the processing and quality control (QC) of humidity observations. Over the entire period of record, spatial and temporal coverage has been enriched and data and metadata quality has been improved. Along with the observations, now updated monthly in near real time, Release 2.5 includes quality-controlled monthly summary products for 2\u00b0latitude \u00d7 2\u00b0longitude (since 1800) and 1\u00b0\u00d7 1\u00b0boxes (since 1960), together with multiple options for access to the data and products. The measured and estimated data in Release 2.5 are subject to many technical changes, multiple archive sources, and historical events throughout the more than three-century record. Some of these data characteristics are highlighted, including known unresolved errors and inhomogeneities, which may impact climate and other research applications. Anticipated future directions for ICOADS aim to continue adding scientific value to the observations, products, and metadata, as well as strengthen the cooperative enterprise through expanded linkages to international initiatives and organisations."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) contains marine surface data spanning the past three centuries. The observational archive and monthly summary products were first made available 25 years ago (Slutz et al., 1985; Woodruff et al., 1987) . Each subsequent release (see Appendix) has brought notable improvements that have benefited research, education, and commercial operations. The continuing objectives that remain are to collect as much original estimated (non-instrumental) and measured in situ data as possible; to treat each observation systematicallypreserving data source identification and measurement metadata with each record, and converting units and coding schemes to a uniform set -to perform basic quality checks; and to freely distribute the data and products worldwide. As it contains observations from many different observing systems encompassing the evolution of measurement technology over hundreds of years, ICOADS is probably the most complete and heterogeneous collection of surface marine data in existence.\nThe expanding national and international community providing data, and otherwise contributing to ICOADS Copyright \uf6d9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society and Crown Copyright. development, is reviewed in Section 2 of this paper. Section 3 describes ICOADS Release 2. 5 (1662-2007) and the continuing monthly observational updates for 2008 onwards. Section 4 discusses selected data characteristics of Release 2.5 and highlights some outstanding data issues. Sections 5 and 6 briefly review access to ICOADS data and products and community-derived products respectively. Section 7 covers future goals and challenges for ICOADS and conclusions are in Section 8."}, {"section_title": "The national and international contributing community", "text": "ICOADS has grown from a US-centric effort between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -its Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) and National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) -and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to an expanded United States and international partnership. This growth has added value to ICOADS in many ways. New data sources have been uncovered and contributed; expert knowledge has enabled data improvements spanning the early sailing fleets, ship and measurements metadata, and quantification of data uncertainty; to name just a few examples. Data provision, collation, and distribution remain the responsibility of the founding partners, but other countries and international organisations -including the Joint World Meteorological Organisation (WMO)-Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) -now make noteworthy contributions.\nFrom the operational and research areas, ICOADS incorporates observations from a variety of existing activities. Real-time Global Telecommunication System (GTS) data are provided by the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), marine surface meteorological observations and near-surface profile temperatures are contributed by the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) through the World Ocean Database (WOD), and environmental US moored buoy and Coastal Marine-Automated Network (C-MAN) data are provided by the NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC).\nData from tropical moored buoy arrays -specifically, the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean/TRIangle Trans-Ocean buoy Network (TAO/TRITON) array in the Pacific (McPhaden et al., 1998) and the Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Atlantic (PIRATA) (Bourl\u00e8s et al., 2008) -are provided by NDBC, the NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) and the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAM-STEC). The Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS) at Florida State University contributes high-resolution measurements from some ocean research vessels (R/Vs) (Gould and Smith, 2006) . Integrated Science Data Management (ISDM), of Fisheries and Oceans -Canada, provides quality controlled (QCd) drifting (plus some moored) buoy data.\nThe JCOMM global collecting centres (GCCs) distribute worldwide delayed mode (DM) (i.e. paper or electronic logbook) Voluntary Observing Ship (VOS) data on a quarterly basis, currently from about 26 contributing members . The National Oceanography Centre, Southampton -UK, contributes quality-checked WMO (1955) ship metadata . Beyond the most active recent and ongoing major programs noted above, there are many others, including substantial contributions from Europe and Asia (see e.g. Worley et al., 2005 and Woodruff et al., 2005) .\nIn the historical arena, the RECovery of Logbooks And International Marine data (RECLAIM; Wilkinson et al., 2010) , Climatological database for the World's Oceans (CLIWOC) (Garc\u00eda-Herrera et al., 2005) , and Atmospheric Circulation Reconstruction over the Earth initiative (ACRE; http://www.met-acre.org/) are all multinational efforts that have augmented ICOADS with seventeenth to twentieth century data and metadata. For example, in recent joint projects, the UK Met Office and NOAA Climate Data Modernization Program (CDMP) (Dupigny-Giroux et al., 2007) have provided digitised and quality-checked data from logbooks (e.g. Brohan et al., 2008) and historical publications held in UK archives.\nContinuity and coordination for ICOADS have been promoted by two series of meetings that began over a decade ago: The JCOMM Workshops on Advances in Marine Climatology (CLIMAR) were held in Vancouver, Canada, 1999 , Brussels, Belgium, 2003 , Parker et al., 2004 and Gydnia, Poland, 2008 (Charpentier et al., 2008 . Alternating approximately biennially with CLI-MAR, the Workshops on Advances in the Use of Historical Marine Climate Data (MARCDAT) have been held in Boulder, USA, 2002 , and Exeter, UK, 2005 . Sponsors of past meetings have included WMO, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and the Climate Variability and Predictability Project (CLIVAR). These meetings have done much to guide the development of ICOADS."}, {"section_title": "Release 2.5", "text": "Release 2.5 (R2.5) data processing was completed in July 2009. This marks a major update where 238 million (M) reports from the preceding Release 2.4 (R2.4) were merged together with new data, subjected to duplicate analysis and elimination, quality checked against climatologies, and preconditioned to fix specific problems and remove suspect data. The resultant output was then compared with R2.4. R2.5 has 261M records in the International Maritime Meteorological Archive (IMMA) format covering 1662-2007. This archive is a blend of DM and GTS data, where DM records are preferentially selected in cases where duplicates are detected.\nThe IMMA format (Woodruff, 2007) has been recommended as a standard to JCOMM and is ideal for marine surface data spanning many centuries. It is an 953 ASCII-based format with a fixed 'core' set of the most commonly reported meteorological variables sufficient for most users, also including the time, location, and individual platform identification (e.g. ship callsign or WMO buoy number, if available). In addition to the IMMA core, an arbitrary number of data 'attachments' can be made. Ship metadata, original data records, QC flags, special ICOADS source-tracking information, platform type, and a variety of other ancillary metadata are preserved in these attachments.\nA new procedure to extend ICOADS to near real time is also coincident with R2.5 providing IMMA records based on the best available GTS receipts (currently based exclusively on NCEP data). This forward extension to ICOADS is updated monthly, and lags real-time by 2 to 6 weeks. These data are subjected to basic quality checks and the IMMA core fields are populated to the maximum extent possible. This product is replacing an existing near-real-time ASCII-formatted product containing only a limited selection of data fields.\nR2.5 greatly improved ICOADS by extending the period of record backward to 1662 (i.e. by 122 years, albeit with sparse coverage), and forward through the end of 2007, and generally increasing the number of available records over the whole period. Twelve major new or replacement historical data sources were incorporated ( Figure 1) 1950 Woodruff et al., 2003) partially duplicated reports already in ICOADS, but also provided some unique or improved contributions. Based purely on the number of records, regardless of which parameters might be available, R2.5 has increased the global spatial coverage. Figure 2 illustrates important increases in global sampling in R2.5 distributed over the full period since the 1860s. The 1880s shows outstanding improvement (up to 9%), primarily due to addition of the MMJ collection (Figure 1 ), which provides extensive observations throughout the diurnal cycle (plus accompanying detailed instrumental metadata and instructions). Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) historical archive subsets helped increase coverage from the late 1800s through 1914, and the 2003 Edition of the Japanese Kobe collection accounts for major increases around the 1920s. The UK Royal Navy Ship's Logs (Brohan et al., 2008) helped fill in the data-sparse period (1938) (1939) (1940) (1941) (1942) (1943) (1944) (1945) (1946) (1947) around World War II, and the UK MDB helped enhance coverage particularly during the 1960s and 1970s.\nWhile these increases had limited impact on total ocean area sampled (still peaking at about 60% around 1980), they should add confidence to long-term climate estimates. Focusing on the 1880s, for example, three important variables -sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure (SLP), and relative humidity (RH) -show greatly increased global coverage relative to Release 1 and to the previous update of that period ( Figure 3 ). The nearly void RH coverage prior to R2.5 was addressed by a QC modification discussed in Section 6."}, {"section_title": "Data characteristics and unresolved issues", "text": "An important objective with each new Release is to replace GTS data with higher quality DM data. Normally this has limited effect on temporal and spatial coverage, but occasionally DM data can more appreciably augment coverage. This is illustrated for the 1998-2006 period, where global coverage increased 2% or more with respect to R2.4 ( Figure 2 ). This effect arises largely because no DM ship data had been added to ICOADS for that period (owing to project resource limitations) since 2002.\nThis impact can be segregated into three broad platform categories: observations from ships, moored buoys, and drifting buoys. In R2.4, all ship data from 1998 and onward were derived from GTS receipts, whereas in R2.5 about 50% of data in this period are from DM collections ( Figure 4 ). Here DM data from the GCCs (and other sources) have replaced the GTS data for 1998 onward and additional new data have been added from historical sources throughout the period of record (e.g. numbers of reports increased 30% or more around World War II through blending the UK Royal Navy Ship's Logs; Figure 4 ).\nThe differences in moored buoys between R2.4 and R2.5 are relatively minor when contrasting annual record counts and data sources ( Figure 5 ). It is noteworthy though that minor decreases in R2.5 have been achieved with better duplicate elimination, e.g. [2005] [2006] . The mixture of sources has not changed much, but the tropical moored buoys were replaced with a new DM version . However, it is interesting to note that a few GTS records remain unique, augmenting global coverage during 1998-1999. This highlights the importance of including all available data sources and using robust duplicate elimination procedures and rules to arrive at the 'best' possible set of observations to support a wide range of applications (e.g. both drifting and moored buoy SSTs are critical for calibrating and validating infrared and microwave satellite retrievals).\nIn addition to ship and buoys, ICOADS encompasses data from a variety of other in situ observing systems (Figure 7 ). Until the middle of 1970s, ship-recorded data (mostly VOS plus some R/Vs) dominate. Since then, the contribution from buoys and other automated platforms has rapidly increased, while ship records begin decreasing in 1990 (Kent et al., 2006) . Superficially this appears satisfactory, but sampling characteristics of these different systems reveal important concerns. VOS equipped with observers and instruments typically report measurements for many different variables, and mostly sample along the world's major shipping routes. Meteorological and oceanographic R/Vs explore a wide range of ocean areas, but generally do not visit the same locations with the regularity of the VOS fleet. Moored buoys sample only a small portion of the global ocean, but do so with high frequency, an increasing compliment of instruments over time, and potentially with good accuracy in the post-recovery calibrated DM archives. Drifting buoys have near ubiquitous coverage, but sample only a few parameters, and, since they are generally not recovered, some measurement sensor drift might go undetected and result in decreased accuracy. Because ICOADS incorporates so many data sources, it is very difficult to address all the issues related to observing system changes and anomalies that indicate potential error. R2.5 has resolved or improved upon many outstanding issues, but some still remain (and some, surely, are as yet undiscovered). The following are several known outstanding major issues (traceable back to individual sources in ICOADS using Tables AII and AIII in the Appendix):\n(a) SLP biases have been previously identified [Mitchell T. in Diaz et al. (2002) , Ansell et al. (2006) ] in the US Maury collection (1784-1863). These are among the earliest available SLP data, and thus are crucial for estimation of early global fields (e.g. K\u00fcttel et al., 2010) . Further evaluation and testing of schemes to correct the problem are needed, also prior to future blending of additional German Maury (1845-1867) data (Wilkinson et al., 2010) possibly impacted by similar biases. (b) Data from oceanographic profiling instruments are an important supplement to the near-surface data. However, data from each instrument type have different characteristics that can create time-and spacedependent biases. For R2.5, near-surface profile temperatures were selected from the depth closest to 4 m and \u226410 m. In previous Releases, the scheme started at the shallowest depth in a profile and used the first temperature value at any depth \u22643 m. Neither approach is ideal. Better schemes, which could be instrument type dependent, are needed. This is especially important to take greatest advantage of shallow depth measurements from the ARGO array. Tape (IMMT) format data from the GCCs were assumed by ICOADS processing to be ship data, with platform type set accordingly, but many recent data were subsequently found to come from other platform types. A separate 'Observation Platform' field shows the magnitude of this incorrect assumption (Figure 8 ). The problem is greatest from the late 1990s through 2007 when some buoys and other automated ocean stations have been designated as ships. (e) The three historical archives of NDBC moored buoy and C-MAN data within NOAA (NDBC, NCDC, and NODC) need to be thoroughly intercompared and reconciled. There are gaps, and possibly errors, among all three archives, stemming from independent maintenance at the three centres for more than 30 years. (g) Some undetected duplicates exist in ICOADS due to spatial mislocations or other differences in reported time/space location. We do not currently have a good estimate on the frequency of embedded duplications (nor of the inverse problem of removal of reports erroneously identified as duplicates). This difficult problem could be better addressed with the application of track-checking software including parameter value checks against climatologies and accurate land-sea masks, when resources allow. (h) The association of metadata with some recent VOS reports is being obstructed by GTS (and to a more limited extent DM) callsign masking for commercial and security reasons. Solutions meeting the requirements of ship operators, NMHSs, and climate users are urgently being sought . Meanwhile, however, one impact has been the complete masking since December 2007 of all ship reports in the NCEP data used as the primary GTS input to ICOADS (since NCEP does not have the mandate to implement selective unmasking based on confidential time-varying lists). (i) Recent GTS data also contain other important problems or data omissions, which should be addressed through reprocessing as resources permit, including the following:\n\u2022 A special total cloudiness code (N = 9, indicating 'Sky obscured by fog and/or other meteorological phenomena') is important for cloud analyses (e.g. Hahn et al., 1995 Hahn et al., , 1999 "}, {"section_title": "Data and product access", "text": "ICOADS data and products are maintained by the founding US partners with free and open access worldwide, and no restrictions on redistribution. There are a variety of access schemes and data formats available through the project website (http://icoads.noaa.gov/). The observations (e.g. of available SST and air temperatures, humidity, SLP, wind speed and direction, wind wave and swell heights, directions and periods, cloud cover, types and heights, and weather codes; plus reported metadata elements) are available in the IMMA format or as simple ASCII format text files. The monthly summary statistical products are available in binary, netCDF, and ASCII text files. Parameter, temporal, and spatial subsetting are available for the observations and statistics that result in ASCII-formatted files. Subsetting and plotting also augment the service of netCDF files. These services address the requests of over 400 distinct users each year. The data processing performed to create new ICOADS Releases is largely driven by availability of additional DM data. To support research that extends beyond the formal end date of a new Release (e.g. R2.5's 2007 end date) basic ICOADS format conversion and data processing is applied to the GTS datastream received from NCEP. This processing is carried out on a monthly basis and provides users with a near-real-time ICOADS option for the observational data (IMMA format). Routine production and updating of the monthly summary statistical products is also planned once sufficient resources can be located. These updates are integrated into the services described above."}, {"section_title": "Community data products derived from ICOADS observations", "text": "ICOADS forms the basis for many derived data products, and is regarded worldwide as the long-term marine surface reference dataset. There is a wide product range that includes the simple statistical summaries of the observations, gridded analyses, bias-adjusted analyses, multi-source blended analyses where ICOADS is one component, and assimilation input for global atmospheric reanalyses.\nThe ICOADS' monthly summary statistics are produced for 2\u00b0latitude \u00d7 2\u00b0longitude (since 1800) and 1\u00b0\u00d7 1\u00b0boxes (since 1960). Eight 'observed' variables (SST and air temperature, winds, SLP, total cloudiness, and RH; after the climatological outlier trimming) and 14 derived variables are summarised with a set of 10 statistics, e.g. mean, median, and number of observations . No attempt is made in these products to account for observing system changes and measurement biases, but the many variables are treated consistently and the observation types grouped in different ways and with different levels of outlier trimming applied to provide a good first-order environmental assessment.\nOne major QC change was made in the processing of RH for R2.5. For a data value to be used in the monthly summaries, it must pass a check against climatological 'trimming' (QC) limits (Slutz et al., 1985) . However, the available 1854-1909 trimming limits are essentially missing (Figure 9 ), hence RH during this period could not be checked and monthly summaries of humidity variables (all dependent on RH) were not calculated. To mitigate this problem, the climatological trimming limits for 1910-1949 were used for all RH data prior to 1910. R2.5 therefore, for the first time, offers humidity fields extending back into the nineteenth century (Figure 3 ). Other variables are impacted to a lesser degree, as illustrated by the presently available January long-term trimming median values for SST, SLP, and RH, for the three consecutive trimming periods, 1854-1909, 1910-1949, and 1950-1979 (Figure 9 ). These data voids in the trimming limits exist because insufficient ICOADS data were available over those regions when they were constructed by 1985, and project resources have not been adequate yet to upgrade those original limits, e.g. making use of newly rescued data in those regions.\nInternational research teams have taken special interest in specific variables and continue to improve upon the basic ICOADS statistics. There have been many significant works published and data made available to the public. We highlight just a few as a representative set. The visual estimated wave data have been processed and summarised for the global ocean (Gulev and Grigorieva, 2006) . Similarly, a widely used climate research cloud data product, the Extended Edited Synoptic Cloud Reports from Ships and Land Stations Over the Globe (EECRA) (Hahn et al., 1995 (Hahn et al., , 1999 , has been created.\nNOAA incorporates ICOADS as a component of several global gridded SST products : Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) 1854-present (Smith et al., 2008) , Weekly Optimum Interpolation SST 1982-present , and Daily Optimum Interpolation SST 1985-present . Complementary work using ICOADS is done at the Met Office Hadley Centre to create the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and SST Figure 9 . January smoothed long-term median values for relative humidity (RH; %), sea level pressure (SLP; hPa), and sea surface temperature (SST;\u00b0C). The values are plotted separately for the three Release 1 (Slutz et al., 1985) trimming periods (1854-1909, 1910-1949, 1950-1979) from top to bottom (note: limits from the closest period are currently used for trimming data prior to 1854 or later than 1979). As discussed in the text, the general absence of RH trimming information for the earliest period was resolved for R2.5 processing by utilization of the trimming limits for the following period for data prior to 1910.\n(HadISST) 1870-present (Rayner et al., 2003) and associated products , the ocean portion of SLP in HadSLP 1850 , and other global temperature assessments. Fluxes at the ocean-atmosphere interface are critically important for understanding the earth system. Although modern instrumental systems are relatively accurate for measuring fluxes, in situ estimates for the long term and with wide area coverage are only possible from VOS that record a full compliment of sea surface conditions, i.e. SST, air temperature, wind, humidity, cloud, and weather information. In these circumstances, instrument type and placement are critical metadata that can lead to improved accuracy. Many global ocean flux datasets have been derived from ICOADS in the past two decades (da Silva et al., 1994; Josey et al., 1999; Smith et al., 2004; Bourassa et al., 2005; Berry and Kent, 2009) .\nDuring the past decade, a significant portion of our scientific climate change understanding has come from projects that have produced global atmospheric reanalyses. The models used in these projects assimilate vast quantities of in situ and remotely sensed data. Invariably ICOADS has been a significant part of the reference dataset for the ocean surface. NOAA, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have all taken advantage of ICOADS for their reanalyses. Communication between reanalysis centres and the ICOADS developers is excellent. Each new reanalysis is based on the most recent ICOADS update, thereby taking advantage of any improvements in data quality or quantity based on the efforts of marine data experts. ICOADS therefore reduces efforts required for data preparation and quality control for reanalysis projects. In a complimentary manner, reanalyses efforts (e.g. Compo et al., 2006) also uncover data problems in ICOADS that feedback to the developers and lead to future improvements.\nOverall, as ICOADS has been regularly sustained as an international collection of global ocean observed data and widely utilised in all of these key applications, it has had significant influence on a wide spectrum of research and understanding of the earth system."}, {"section_title": "Future plans", "text": "Many new historical ship datasets exist in various stages of preparation and should be added to ICOADS as soon as feasible in order to continue to support the wide range of community data products as well as critical downstream applications (e.g. international climate change assessments). The datasets that are most ready for addition are in digital form and require format translation and quality checks to prepare them for the data processing steps that merge new sources into the archive. Other datasets exist only as document images and are yet to be fully digitised. Even further removed from being available, there are many collections in printed (or published) form that if imaged and then digitised would improve the historical coverage. The ICOADS project, together with programs including RECLAIM, ACRE, and CDMP, helps discover and track these sources, and when possible arranges for imaging, digitisation, and ultimately contribution to ICOADS (see Wilkinson et al., 2010) .\nWe also seek to improve the representation of modern ship and buoy data in ICOADS. The meteorological and oceanographic R/Vs are under-represented in the archive. Recent work at COAPS and through the Shipboard Automated Meteorological and Oceanographic System (SAMOS) initiative is improving upon this situation and has added data from the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (1990 Experiment ( -1998 into R2.5 (Figure 1 ). Expansion and support for this effort would be an important asset for ICOADS, and procedures are being developed to make this a routine part of SAMOS data archival. We anticipate that additional R/V observations (from 2005 to present) will be available for inclusion in a planned 2011 ICOADS update. The inclusion of meteorological observations from the WOD has also been helpful in this regard.\nFor DM moored buoy data and metadata, ICOADS could benefit significantly from more tightly coordinated international data management. Currently the DM data are heavily fragmented and lack a uniform format and metadata standards. In contrast, many drifting buoy data are well managed internationally through ISDM in their role as the Regional Oceanographic Data Center/Drifting Buoys.\nDM data from VOS and from the VOS Climate (VOSClim) project are critical components for ICOADS. A planned modernisation of the DM VOS system under JCOMM ) could lead to multiple benefits: increasing the quantity of full meteorological reports from ships, providing a secure environment for the handling of time-sensitive information such as ship identifiers, creating more accurate marine reference data and products, and potentially even better observational data as new QC schemes are initiated.\nThe longstanding need for general QC improvements for ICOADS (Wolter, 1997) , coupled potentially with improved standardisation in conjunction with JCOMM data management changes , remains an important and under-resourced problem, as the results of QC can have broad impacts on the data and products provided for research. As discussed in Section 6, globally complete climatological trimming fields could be highly beneficial, facilitating the blending and prompt utilisation of newly recovered data from remote regions. ICOADS has experimented with modernised 'adaptive' QC of SST, based on advanced techniques described by Smith and Reynolds (2003) . But these techniques proved complex to implement operationally, and for other variables appeared likely to require substantial retooling.\nData collected over multiple centuries use many different observation methods and a variety of modern observing systems. These changes will reduce data assessment accuracy unless the observing system heterogeneities can be addressed. Metadata about ships, buoys, instrument locations, sampling methods, and observing practices and codes are necessary to begin making bias adjustments, corrections, and error estimates. ICOADS has traditionally captured and carried the basic metadata that is attached to each reported record. However, the amount of metadata available this way is highly dependent on the observing system. We have improved upon this basic set by including selected VOS metadata (WMO, 1955; , but much more work is needed. Improvement and expansion of the ship metadata would be helpful and, critically, methods and formats need to be devised (operationally under JCOMM) so a time history of buoy metadata can be archived and uniquely linked to the individual records.\nReanalysis (and operational Numerical Weather Prediction) data assimilation models are another source of untapped metadata. For example, differences between the observed value and the final model analysis can serve as a quality check on the observed data. Random and systematic outliers often stand out against the model field. Metadata of this type can serve multiple purposes: to evaluate and possibly correct the archive, e.g. as systematic errors can sometimes easily be accounted for by mispositioned records; provided to users as additional QC feedback information that can be factored into their studies; and likewise so that subsequent reanalyses can take advantage of previous reanalyses.\nAdding data from the nineteenth century and before to ICOADS is also presenting new challenges in metadata handling. There is often considerable uncertainty about how these early data should be processed and converted to the standard IMMA format. As a result, it is crucial to preserve the original data along with the IMMA reports and to maintain records of how conversions were done. This is likely to require refinements to the IMMA data format as well as the technology for storing the observations.\nThe international community has had organised discussions about a program that would create an 'advanced' version of ICOADS. Community experts have done significant work on specific variables and time periods to enhance homogeneity across observing systems, estimate the uncertainty of observations, and improve QC (e.g. track checking). These activities typically result in analysed (gridded) datasets. The proposed idea is to make the underlying observations used in these improved datasets readily available to all ICOADS users. Although plans are in an early stage, it is envisaged that a group of active researchers with experience using ICOADS would assume responsibility for making data adjustments, metadata, and other derived information available alongside the original data fields, which will remain unaltered. Proposed contributions would be vetted by a coordination group, and a unified interface would inform the users about the latest updates, and provide flexible data access. The proposed system would be dynamic and would evolve as recommended adjustments are evaluated, reviewed, and refined. These observations could support a new broad set of statistical or analysed summary products, but there are many details to be fleshed out and suitable funding across the international groups needs to be identified.\nMore can also be done to aid users in accessing the data. Rapidly served queries can easily be supported by the combination of a web interface and connected databases holding all the ICOADS data. NCDC plans to initiate such a system in the future. Also, interoperability can be supported by OPeNDAP and THREDDS servers; technologies made available by Unidata (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/). Another option includes the GrADS Data Server (GDS, http://www.iges. org/grads/gds/). Currently neither option is offered for ICOADS from the US partners both because funding support is not available and because computer security concerns need to be addressed. To better facilitate international availability of ICOADS data and products, links between these technologies and the new WMO Information System (WIS) and WMO Integrated Global Observing Systems (WIGOS; http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/ www/wigos/) are also planned."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "ICOADS continues to be significantly improved through periodic Releases, including contributions from a supportive and growing international community, and new linkages developing with JCOMM and WMO operational programs such as WIGOS. The user community is substantially larger, and greatly benefits from this freely available sustained data collection integrated together from many heterogeneous, in situ observing systems. Support for ICOADS at the current set of contributing institutions and laboratories should be proudly recognised and additional support should be added if possible. This is an open community and new participants are welcomed.\nAs part of this involvement, we hope that nations and organisations taking and holding marine surface observations can continue to examine the pathways by which their information is shared. As far as possible, all such observations (historical and contemporary) should be added to ICOADS. Similarly, research projects and research vessel operators should take account of the marine surface data they collect and ensure there is a data pathway for it to be included in ICOADS.\nThese high-quality and possibly high-resolution data can have the effect of increasing the accuracy of large-scale analyses.\nThe importance of ocean observing system metadata cannot be overemphasised. We are at the beginning of, hopefully, a long improving trend to use metadata to better understand the ocean measurements and to reduce the uncertainty in environmental assessments. Legacy metadata need to be collected, systematically organised (formatted), and eventually made available with the ICOADS reported observations. This is also true for metadata for today's operational systems. Metadata for all types of buoys and automated stations are currently not easily included or linked with large global collections like ICOADS. The existing VOS platform and instrumental metadata (WMO, 1955) only become available in DM and do not cover as many vessels as would be optimal, but represent a substantial resource. JCOMM and the international community should continue to take action to improve collection and digital distribution of observing system metadata for all platform types.\nThe CLIMAR and MARCDAT meeting series are invaluable in sustaining the international community around ICOADS and guiding its future. These meeting series should continue. Increased investment should also be made in the ICOADS US core team. There are numerous readily available benefits: contributions from international researchers could be capitalised to support all users, data preparation for insertion into ICOADS could be accelerated, additional data-access tools could be deployed to further expand easy data use in the growing community doing earth system research, and more frequent Release updates and near-real-time archive extensions would bring improvements to the users more rapidly.
