[{"section_title": "", "text": "Methods-Meta-analyses of the associations between the 11 MI-associated SNPs and IS were performed using 6865 cases and 11 395 control subjects recruited from 9 studies. SNPs were either genotyped directly or imputed; in a few cases a surrogate SNP in high linkage disequilibrium was chosen. Logistic regression was performed within each study to obtain study-specific \u2424s and standard errors. Meta-analysis was conducted using an inverse variance weighted approach assuming a random effect model. Results-Despite having power to detect odds ratio of 1.09 -1.14 for overall IS and 1.20 -1.32 for major stroke subtypes, none of the SNPs were significantly associated with overall IS and/or stroke subtypes after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Conclusions-Our results suggest that the major common loci associated with MI risk do not have effects of similar magnitude on overall IS but do not preclude moderate associations restricted to specific IS subtypes. Disparate mechanisms may be critical in the development of acute ischemic coronary and cerebrovascular events. (Stroke. 2012; 43:980-986.)\nKey Words: cerebral infarct \u2162 genetics \u2162 ischemia I schemic strokes (IS) comprise 87% of all strokes. 1 Nearly 800 000 individuals in the United States have a stroke each year, making stroke one of the leading causes of serious, long-term disability in developed countries. 1, 2 The tendency of stroke to aggregate within families implies a genetic etiology, although few genetic variants have as yet been unequivocally linked to the common forms of IS.\nSome of the difficulty in identifying stroke susceptibility genes may arise from heterogeneity within the stroke phenotype, making it imperative to carry out genetic studies within specific subtypes of IS. IS syndromes can, in fact, be recognized by experienced clinicians with a high degree of inter-rater agreement. 3 The major categories, which are based on the presumed stroke mechanism, include atherosclerotic (ie, large-artery) stroke, cardioembolic stroke, and smallvessel (lacunar) stroke. Given disparate mechanisms, it is likely that different risk alleles would contribute to these different stroke subtypes. Previous studies showing that a family history of stroke is more common in younger compared with older age of onset strokes 4 -6 raise the additional possibility that the genetic contribution to stroke may differ by age of onset.\nIS shares many risk factors with myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery disease (CAD), including smoking and high blood pressure. The possibility that common susceptibility genes might predispose to both IS and MI/CAD prompted us to examine whether genetic variants previously associated with MI/CAD might also be associated with IS. To address this hypothesis, we evaluated whether DNA sequence variants at 11 different loci recently associated with MI or CAD through genome-wide association (GWA) studies were also associated with IS. Our analysis included 6865 IS cases from 9 different studies, allowing us to test whether the genetic variants were associated not only with overall IS, but also with the major IS subtypes and with age of stroke onset."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Populations", "text": "This analysis includes 6865 IS cases and 11 395 control subjects from 9 different studies: Australian Stroke Genetics Collaborative (ASGC), Bio-Repository of DNA in Stroke (BRAINS), Besta Cerebrovascular Diseases Registry (CEDIR), Genes Affecting Stroke Risk and Outcomes Study (GASROS), Genetics of Early Onset Stroke (GEOS), Graz Stroke Study (GRAZ), Ischemic Stroke Genetics Study and Siblings with Ischemic Stroke Study (ISGS/ SWISS), Risk Assessment of Cerebrovascular Events (RACE), and the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) study.

A genotype risk score was also computed for each individual by summing the number of MI/CAD-risk alleles across each of the 11 loci (score 1). Each SNP was given equal weights rather than weights based on their effect sizes (\u2424) for MI/CAD in the risk score calculation given that we do not know the effects of these SNPs on stroke and the assumption that they would have similar effects on stroke as they do on MI seems unjustified. Additionally, we computed a genotype risk score that summed the number of MI/CAD-risk alleles across 10 loci, excluding SNP rs4977574 on chromosome 9, because SNPs near this locus have previously been reported to be associated with large-artery stroke (score 2). 14 Each genotype risk score was used as a continuous independent variable in the logistic regression model to obtain the joint additive effects of all MI/CAD-associated SNPs on the risk of IS. The \u2424 of the genotype risk score represents the increase in log odds of stroke associated with having one additional MI/CAD-risk allele. The GRAZ study was not included in the score analyses because three of the 11 SNPs were not genotyped directly and could not be imputed with acceptable quality scores (rs6725887, rs9818870, and rs9982601). Overall, about 35% of the individuals in whom 1 or more SNPs were not genotyped or imputed were removed from the genotype risk score analysis. For ease of result interpretation, all odds ratios were designated with the previously published nonrisk allele as the reference so that the odds ratio reflects the effect of the MI-associated risk allele. Association analyses were adjusted for study-specific covariates (eg, age, sex, and population structure; online-only Data Supplement Table S2 ).\nMeta-analysis was performed using a variance-weighted approach assuming a random effect model (DerSimonian and Laird method), 15 which takes heterogeneity of the genetic effects across studies into account. Between-study heterogeneity was estimated using Cochran Q statistic, which is the summation of the squared, weighted difference between the study-specific effect and the overall effect size (estimated by the fixed effect), as well as I 2 statistics, which represent the percent of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity after accounting for variability due to chance. All meta-analyses were performed using the metan module implemented in STATA 10 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

This association would not have withstood a conservative Bonferroni correction (\u2423\u03ed0.05/11, or 0.0045). Although there was no significant evidence for heterogeneity of effect size across studies for rs11206510, the direction of effect was not consistent across studies with ORs ranging from 0.80 (RACE study) to 1.12 (CEDIR study) (Cochran Q statistic\u03ed8.1, P\u03ed0.4) (onlineonly Data Supplement Figure S1 ). rs3184504, on the other hand, showed significance evidence for heterogeneity (Cochran Q statistic\u03ed20.9, P\u03ed0.01) with 1 study (BRAINS) showing opposite effect as compared with other studies. We also examined the joint effect of these MI/CAD-associated SNPs by testing for association with the genotype scores and found no significant effect for either genotype score 1 or score 2 (OR, 1.02; P\u03ed0.2 for both scores).

Figure S2 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "It is of interest to consider whether common loci influence susceptibility to MI/CAD and stroke to the extent that such loci could elucidate common genetic and/or biological pathways. Given that the 11SNPs tested in this study were associated with MI/CAD in previous GWA studies, they probably are among the common SNPs having the largest effect sizes. The risk alleles at these loci were associated with increases of 12-20% in MI risk, with the exception of rs4977574 in ANRIL, for which the risk allele was associated with a 28% increase in Europeans. 7, 8, 13 In contrast, none of the MI/CAD risk alleles at these loci were significantly associated with risk of overall IS, with the estimated odds ratios ranging from 0.92-1.11 (ie, 8% reduction to 11% increase in odds of stroke per allele). It is possible that failure to detect associations of these SNPs with the combined IS end point might be partially attributable to the heterogeneity of the IS phenotype. The large size of our sample provided us with the opportunity to evaluate the association of these SNPs to subtypes of ischemic stroke. Similar to the combined IS end point, we did not find any significant associations of MI/CAD SNPs (or the joint genotyping risk scores) with any of the stroke subtypes. Given that this study included more than 6800 total cases and more than 1000 cases for the major stroke subtypes, we have sufficient power to detect even small effects on overall stroke although more modest power to detect associations with stroke subtype. Therefore, our findings suggest that these MI/CAD-associated SNPs do not have effects of similar magnitude on overall stroke as they do on MI/CAD. If an association does exist, it is likely to be very modest for overall IS or restricted to a single stroke subtype.\nAlthough the SNP associations with stroke subtypes did not reach statistical significance, it is interesting that the strongest associations we observed in the subtype analysis were genes involved in cell regulation or signaling. For example, the strongest association with cardioembolic stroke was the MI-risk allele at rs9818870 in MRAS (OR, 1.17; P\u03ed0.03). MRAS, an intracellular signal transducer, is highly expressed in the cardiovascular system and may be involved in cell adhesion. 7, 8, 16 The strongest association with smallvessel stroke was the MI-risk allele at rs17465637 in MIA3 (OR, 1.12; P\u03ed0.05), which encodes melanoma inhibitory activity 3 and is associated with cell adhesion and migration in inflammatory pathways 17 It should also be noted that rs4977574 near ANRIL was very modestly associated with the large-artery subtype (OR, 1.09; P\u03ed0.09). Although the association did not achieve statistical significance in our study, other SNPs in the ANRIL region on chromosome 9p21 have previously been associated with large-artery stroke, with the strongest signal found with SNP rs1537378 (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.09 -1.35; P\u03ed0.0005). 14 Interestingly, rs1537378 is not in high LD with our target SNP rs4977574 (r 2 \u03ed0.5), suggesting these 2 SNPs may represent different association signals or each of them may be tagging the causal variant imperfectly (assuming the association is indeed true). ANRIL encodes an antisense noncoding RNA that may disrupt other genes in the region, including CDKN2A and CDKN2B, 2 genes that play a key role in regulating cell proliferation, senescence, and apoptosis. We also observed the MI-associated risk allele at rs3184504 in SH2B3 to be nominally significantly associated with strokes due to other known causes (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.02-1.72; P\u03ed0.04). It has been hypothesized that this SNP could reduce the anti-inflammatory activity of SH2B3, which is expressed in the vasculature, thereby leading to the development of plaque development and/or progression in coronary arteries. 13 In contrast, SNPs whose effects on MI are likely to be mediated though lipid metabolism, for example, rs1122608 at SMARCA4/LDLR (19p13), rs646776 at the CELSR2/PSRC1/ SORT1 locus (1p13), and rs11206510 at PCSK9 (1p32), have minimal effects on IS or any of its subtypes, and in some cases, even showed opposite effects on stroke. For example, the MI/CAD-associated risk allele of rs11206510 at PCSK9, a gene involved in cholesterol homeostasis, was modestly associated with decreased risk of overall stroke (OR, 0.92; P\u03ed0.03) or strokes due to undetermined causes (OR, 0.86; P\u03ed0.03). Our analyses suggest that genes involved in lipid metabolism do not predispose individuals to increased stroke risk as they do for MI, although replications will be needed to confirm these associations.\nTaken together, our results suggest that the major common loci associated with MI/CAD risk do not have large effects on stroke. However, although our analyses did not reveal any significant associations between MI/CAD SNPs and stroke, the chromosomal regions harboring these loci might still contain stroke-related SNPs that are not in high LD with the MI-associated SNPs, as the example of chromosome 9p region. 14 A limitation of our meta-analysis is that all included studies are case-control-based, and some have included recurrent stroke, thus allowing for the possibility of selection toward milder strokes (due to survival bias). It is possible that these genetic MI/CAD variants could be associated with more severe forms of stroke, but longitudinal studies that follow healthy cohorts for stroke occurrence prospectively would be needed to address this issue. Finally, our analyses were based on 11 SNPs unequivocally associated with MI and/or CAD identified from the first wave of meta-analyses for these traits. A second wave of even larger meta-analyses of these traits is in progress that will probably generate additional associations. We can expect most of these newly associated SNPs to have even smaller effect sizes on MI and CAD. In fact, in September 2011, 17 additional CAD-associated SNPs were identified by even larger meta-analyses, and the reported effect sizes for these newly identified SNPs, as expected, were smaller (ranging from 1.06 -1.17) than the original 11 SNPs used in the present analysis. 18 -21 However, this does not necessarily mean that these SNPs will have smaller effect sizes on stroke. Indeed, it is very possible that such SNPs may be in gene pathways that are more relevant to stroke than are the pathways associated with the currently known MI SNPs. Thus, it will be important to monitor new SNPs identified, even those with small effect sizes, as they may generate new biological insights into the etiology of stroke."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Common variants previously associated with MI/CAD risk do not have effects of similar magnitude on overall IS but do not preclude moderate associations restricted to specific IS subtypes."}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "text": "Australian population control data were derived from the Hunter Community Study.

Controls with a history of CAD were ineligible to participate in the study. Cases with a history of CAD (11% of all cases) were excluded from analysis. Diagnosis of CAD was based on clinical history and electrocardiogram.\nVISP was a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial that enrolled patients aged 35 or older with Homocysteine levels above the 25th percentile at screening and a non-disabling cerebral infarction (NDCI) within 120 days of randomization (P.I. James Toole, MD, Wake Forest University School of Medicine (WFU); R01 NS34447) 17, 18 . NDCI was defined as an ischemic brain infarction not due to embolism from a cardiac source, characterized by the sudden onset of a neurological deficit. The deficit must have persisted for at least 24 hours, or if not, an infarction in the part of the brain corresponding to the symptoms must have been demonstrated by CT or MRI imaging. The trial was designed to determine if daily intake of a multivitamin tablet with high dose folic acid, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 reduced recurrent cerebral infarction (1\u00b0 endpoint), and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or mortality (2\u00b0 endpoints). Subjects were randomly assigned to receive daily doses of the high-dose formulation (n=1,827), containing 25mg pyridoxine (B6), 0.4mg cobalamin (B12), and 2.5mg folic acid; or the low-dose formulation (n=1,853), containing 200\u03bcg pyridoxine, 6\u03bcg cobalamin and 20\u03bcg folic acid. Enrollment in VISP began in August 1997, and was completed in December 2001, with 3,680 participants enrolled, from 55 clinic sites across the US and Canada and one site in Scotland. A subset of VISP participants gave consent and were included in the GWAS component of VISP, supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Grant U01 HG005160, as part of the Genomics and Randomized Trials Network (GARNET). Samples were genotyped at the Johns Hopkins Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR), and genotyping was performed using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad_v1-0_B BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Individuals were excluded if they were unexpected duplicates or had gender discrepancies. All VISP participants are stroke cases, therefore we obtained GWAS data (dbGAP) for ~1000 external controls from the High Density SNP Association Analysis of Melanoma: CaseControl and Outcomes Investigation (Study Accession: phs000187.v1.p1). These samples were also genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad. 17.3% of the cases were removed from analyses because of a prior history of MI based on medical questionnaire.

BRAINS was adjusted for sex and population structure only because age was unavailable for controls. CEDIR was adjusted for age only because very few controls are women (12.5%) and the population was from the more genetic homogeneous northern Italy region. GEOS was adjusted for age, recruitment periods and population structure since different genders were recruited during different study periods. GRAZ was adjusted for age and sex only because there was minimal population heterogeneity in the region. n: number of cases; OR: odds ratio; P: p-value * OR: odds ratios reflects the effect of the MI-associated risk allele with the previously published MI non-risk allele as the reference allele defined in Table 1 .
