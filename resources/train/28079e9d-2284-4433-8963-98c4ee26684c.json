The study was carried out to determine possible sites for Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC), assuming that the minimum usable gradient is 20 \u2022 C and the maximum profitable distance from the extraction site to the shore is 10 km. Geographic Information System tools were used to compute thermal gradients and distances to shore all along the Mexican coast. Then, the optimal sites were identified. The results show that the best sites for OTEC exploitation are found in the southern Pacific coast on the littoral of the states of Guerrero and Oaxaca."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Mexican economy is still largely dependent on fossils fuels (87%), with the subsequent environmental consequences and the imminent loss of these nonrenewable resources. It is therefore imperative to harness new sources of energy. Given that the ocean surface in tropical zones receives considerable solar radiation, one feasible alternative is Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC). OTEC plants take advantage of the difference in temperature between surface water and deep-sea water for the generation of electrical energy. For optimum generation needs, the difference should be at least 20 \u2022 C [1] . The OTEC concept was developed in the late 1880s and, since then, France, the USA, Japan and South Korea have excelled in the research and generation of energy from oceanic thermal gradients [2, 3] .\nThe beginnings of this technology began with the work of the French physicist Jacques Arsene D'Arsonval in 1881, although it was not until 1926 that the French physicist Georges Claude, of the Paris Academy of Sciences, presented a scale model, which demonstrated the means of using a thermal gradient to generate energy. He went on, in 1930, to construct a small plant that was capable of generating 22 kW in the Bay of Matanzas (Cuba).\nAround the world, different OTEC projects have obtained satisfactory results in both the generation of energy and the improvement and adaptation of new technologies, lowering the construction and operational costs of such plants. Currently, Japan is the country that has developed OTEC technology the most, improving thermodynamic cycles, such as the Kalina and Uehara hybrid cycles, as well as developing components of the plants, such as the internal coatings in the plant pipes (biofouling), capacitors, evaporators and turbines."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Area", "text": "The Mexican Pacific Ocean (MPO) is the area studied, as the geographic and oceanic conditions are suitable for the installation of OTEC plants according to several studies [3, [8] [9] [10] [11] . All of these authors highlight the thermal gradient potential, which can be exploited for the generation of electrical energy as well as secondary by-products such as potable water, air conditioning, aquaculture and cold-water agriculture. To better understand this, the most relevant aspects of the Mexican Pacific Ocean related to OTEC development are described, i.e., temperatures, the temperature gradients between 0 and 1000 m depths, and the seasonal variations of the sea surface temperature."}, {"section_title": "Temperature", "text": "A strong and shallow thermocline characterized the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) [12] [13] [14] . This area is located between the subtropical zones of the North and South Pacific and both the east Pacific equatorial current system [15] and the eastern Pacific warm pool occur within it [14] (see Figure 1) .\nEastern boundary currents flow in this region from the north (California Current) and from the south (Peru Current). The eastern part of the Tropical Pacific Ocean is influenced by \"El Ni\u00f1o\" (ENSO), which is important in climate variability, in fish production and in the global carbon cycle [14] . The annual variation in the sea surface temperature fluctuates between 26 and 30 \u2022 C [3, 14] . The intrusion of the Costa Rica Coastal Current causes annual variations of 5 \u2022 C or more in the area near Cabo Corrientes, while, in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, the temperature varies between 3 \u2022 C and 4 \u2022 C (see Figure 2) . The warm waters of the Tropical Pacific are subject to net surface heating, which generates convection currents, in a constant mixing process within a layer of 20 to 50 m. The thermocline is not in the mixed layer, but below it [3, 14, 16, 17] . Eastern boundary currents flow in this region from the north (California Current) and from the south (Peru Current).

The annual variation in the sea surface temperature fluctuates between 26 and 30 \u00b0C [3, 14] . The intrusion of the Costa Rica Coastal Current causes annual variations of 5 \u00b0C or more in the area near Cabo Corrientes, while, in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, the temperature varies between 3\u00b0 and 4 \u00b0C (see Figure 2 ). The warm waters of the Tropical Pacific are subject to net surface heating, which generates convection currents, in a constant mixing process within a layer of 20 to 50 m. The thermocline is not in the mixed layer, but below it [3, 14, 16, 17] . Due to the shallow depth of the Mexican Pacific coastal zone, the thermohaline structure is affected by processes such as local winds, river discharge, rainfall, and evaporation [18] . On the coasts of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean, the mean sea surface temperature is 28 \u00b0C and, at 1000 m depth, it is 4 \u00b0C; in other cases, the temperatures vary from 28.5 \u00b0C at the sea surface to 3-5 \u00b0C at 1000 m [14, 18, 19] .\nBecause of the small breadth of the continental shelf (12 km), the thermohaline structure of the Due to the shallow depth of the Mexican Pacific coastal zone, the thermohaline structure is affected by processes such as local winds, river discharge, rainfall, and evaporation [18] .

However, the Gulf of Tehuantepec is characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of the surface temperature due to the effect of the wind. In the winter, the sea surface temperature is low (10 to 13 \u2022 C) where wind speeds are high and in the areas immediately adjacent, indicating that there is a diffusion of cold water to neighboring areas. During the summer, the winds are generally weak and blow in an easterly direction; sea surface temperature ranges between 28 and 30 \u2022 C [14, 17, [20] [21] [22] . In the winter, it is also evident that the temperature drops considerably due to the winds \"Tehuanos\" and the thermocline moves between 90 and 100 m."}, {"section_title": "Graphic Representation of the Thermal Gradient, According to Their Vertical Profiles (0-1000 m Depth)", "text": "Using the databases of the Mexican Navy (SEMAR), the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) of the United States of America and the World Ocean Database 2013 (WOD) of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), through the Ocean Data View (ODV), historical and seasonal data of temperatures in the Mexican Pacific Ocean was compiled in order to determine the changes of oceanic thermal gradient occurring over time.
