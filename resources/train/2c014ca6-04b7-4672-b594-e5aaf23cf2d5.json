[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2 is a member of the Betacoronavirus genera in the 49 subfamily Coronavirinae, which is known to cause respiratory illness and gastroenteritis 50 in humans and other mammals [1, 2] . Two other Betacoronavirus that have met with 51 global attention are SARS-CoV (2002) and MERS-CoV (2012) . An outbreak of IC within one reaction, allowing for higher throughput testing compared to the CDC assay. 6 2 inactivated virus or RNA spiked into artificial or real clinical matrix was acceptable, as 141 long as the matrix was from the most difficult specimen type accepted for testing on the 142 clinical assay (in decreasing order of difficulty: sputum, other lower respiratory tract 143 specimens, and NP or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs collected and transported in viral 144 transport media). NP and sputum samples were tested on the altona RealStar\u00ae rRT-PCR 145 assay to ensure the absence of SARS-CoV-2 and pooled for use as a matrix for spiking 146 in RNA for LOD studies and accuracy studies. Six ten-fold serial dilutions (1 x 10 1 to 1 x 147 10 7 ) were performed with three replicates at each concentration by spiking WRCEVA 148 RNA reference material (60,000 pfu/\uf06dL stock WRCEVA RNA reference material; ~6:10 7 149 genomic copies/\uf06dL) into NP and sputum eluates obtained from pooled-negative patient 150 NP or sputum specimens. The dilutions at the LOD were performed by spiking 1 \uf06dL of 151 1:10 5 dilution to 60 \uf06dL eluate, yielding a concentration of 0.01 pfu/uL=10pfu/mL 152 (~10,000copies/mL). Assay performance at the determined LOD was confirmed with at 153 least 20 additional replicates for each type of sample (sputum and NP). For the accuracy studies, a total of 64 positive (34 NP and 30 sputum specimens, 156 respectively) specimens and 60 negative (30 NP swabs and 30 sputum) specimens that 157 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 were used. Positive specimens were either contrived 158 positive samples generated by spiking WRCEVA RNA reference material into pooled 159 leftover negative NP or sputum specimens or real patient specimens, as described above. 160 Twenty of the contrived clinical specimens were spiked at a concentration of 1x-2x LoD, 161 with the remainder of samples spanning the assay testing range. FDA defines the 162 acceptance criteria for the performance as 95% agreement at 1x-2x LOD, and 100% 163 agreement at all other concentrations and negative specimens [6]. 164 165 Inclusivity and cross-reactivity studies used a combination of in silico and in vitro 166 approaches. As the primer and probe sequences were proprietary to the kit 167 manufacturer, we included the results of their in silico analysis in our EUA application. 168 Additional studies to determine cross-reactivity were performed in our laboratory by 169 testing 10 NP samples that were positive by the RP2 for the four human coronaviruses 170 All rights reserved.

Dilution series studies on pooled negative NP specimens spiked with WRCEVA RNA 183 reference material, with three replicates across a viral range of 1 gene copy/reaction to 184 1,000,000 gene copies/reaction (1 to 6 log10), demonstrated an accurate and linear 185 response across five logs of detection for NP and four logs of detection for sputum (Table   186 1, Figure 1 ). Probit analysis was applied to the NP data after an additional five replicates 187 of testing were performed at 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, and 0.2 gene copies/reaction, and 188 narrowed the LOD to 2.7 gene copies/reaction at 95% detection rate (Figure 2) The in silico analysis for inclusivity that was performed by the manufacturer of the kit 197 found 100% homology of the E gene and S gene forward and reverse primers and probes 198 with 563 whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 published in GISAID and NCBI as of 199 3/16/2020 [9] . The in silico analysis for cross-reactivity that was performed by the 200 manufacturer found that the S gene and E gene forward and reverse primers and probes 201 All rights reserved.

In cases with greater than 80% homology, 203 cross-reactivity was not a concern as only the forward or reverse primer, but never both 204 primers were affected, thus rendering amplification impossible. Additionally, all ten 205 samples that had human coronaviruses NL63, 229E, OC43, or HKU1 detected by RP2 206 panel tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on the RealStar\u00ae rRT-PCR assay. All 30 NP specimens that tested negative on the RP2 panel also tested negative on the 210 SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR assay ( Table 2) . Leftover VTM from these negative specimens 211 was pooled to create a sample matrix for the LOD and contrived positive sample studies. Means of turn-around-times from test order to result and time-in-lab to result were 19.8 261 (13.1-26.2) hours and 11.9 (7.0-24.0) hours, respectively. The percentage of tests with 262 detected SARS-CoV-2 increased as the weeks progressed, and settled at approximately 263 All rights reserved.

Most of the samples were from the ED 264 (n=911), followed by inpatient wards (n=492) and outpatient clinics (n=113) ( Table 4) , 265 and the highest positivity rate was in the ED with 50% of patients with detected SARS- 266 CoV-2 (p=0.0005).

In the cohort of patients tested over three weeks by our assay, positive results were seen 348 more frequently in older males compared to younger and female patients, which has been 349 supported by several studies [14, 15] . Post-menopausal women have been reported to 350 have a greater risk of hospitalization compared to non-menopausal women attributed to 351 the protective effect of estrogen [16] . In this study, older women were more likely to test 352 positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to younger female patients. However, the difference 353 in detection rate between older and younger women was diminished after removing 354 obstetrics patients screened universally regardless of symptoms, highlighting the 355 All rights reserved.
