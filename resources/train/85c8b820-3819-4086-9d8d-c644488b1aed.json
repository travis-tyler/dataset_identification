[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background and Purpose-The relationship between the thickness of the carotid intima (IMT) and brain function remains unclear in those without clinical manifestations of cerebrovascular disease. Understanding the neural correlates of this vascular measure is important in view of emerging evidence linking poorer cognitive performance with increased IMT in individuals without clinical cerebrovascular disease. Methods-Seventy-three participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (70.9 years; SD, 7.3) were evaluated with carotid artery ultrasound and resting [ 15 O]H 2 O positron emission tomography. Results-After adjusting for age, gender, and gray and white matter volumes in the regions where IMT is related to regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), we found that higher IMT was associated with lower rCBF in lingual, inferior occipital, and superior temporal regions. Higher IMT was also associated with higher rCBF in medial frontal gyrus, putamen, and hippocampal-uncal regions (P\u03ed0.001). Whereas women had lower IMT (P\u03ed0.01) and mean arterial pressure (P\u03ed0.05) than men, they showed more robust associations between IMT and rCBF. The relationship between IMT and rCBF was only minimally affected by additional adjustment for mean arterial pressure. Conclusions-IMT is related to patterns of resting rCBF in older adults without clinical manifestations of cerebrovascular disease, suggesting that there are regional differences in CBF that are associated with subclinical vascular disease.

Because rCBF is a marker of brain function and IMT is a modifier of rCBF changes that occur as individuals age, we hypothesized that rCBF and IMT may be directly related in older individuals, even in the absence of cerebrovascular disease symptoms. Given that preventative measures and treatment may decrease or even arrest progression of atherosclerosis at early stages, understanding of accelerated aging and its cerebral correlates is important.\nIn the present study, we examined the cross-sectional relationship of IMT and rCBF in 73 older adults without overt cerebrovascular disease from the neuroimaging study of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. 8 We hypothesized that rCBF patterns would differ in individuals with higher IMT compared with lower IMT, even in the absence of clinically diagnosed cerebrovascular disease. Given that there are differences between men and women in both IMT 9 and rCBF, 10 gender differences in the relationships between IMT and rCBF were examined. We also evaluated the effects of mean arterial pressure (MAP) on the relationship between IMT and rCBF, because pathophysiological circulatory changes affecting arteriolar tone might be related to the association between IMT and rCBF.

We have shown that:\n(1) IMT is related to resting rCBF patterns; (2) greater IMT is associated with lower rCBF in occipitotemporal regions and with higher rCBF in the frontotemporal regions; (3) there are gender differences in relationship between IMT and rCBF; (4) in individuals with wellcontrolled blood pressure, MAP only minimally affects the relationship between IMT and rCBF; and (5) WML burden is not associated with IMT in this sample of individuals.\nWe found that higher IMT is related to lower rCBF in the lingual, inferior occipital, and superior temporal gyri. These findings suggest that accelerated vascular aging may be related to rCBF decreases in occipitotemporal regions. Based on the involvement of these areas in memory function, 17, 18 decreased rCBF in occipitotemporal regions may be related to previous reports of a relationship between cognitive function and IMT. 2 A recent study of Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants that included the subset of neuroimaging study of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging participants in our report found that higher IMT was associated with declining verbal and nonverbal memory performance over time, 7 supporting this relationship.\nWe also found that higher IMT was associated with higher rCBF in the medial frontal gyri, putamen, and hippocampal-uncal regions. This anterior medial temporal finding complements that of another recent functional MRI study in which IMT was positively associated with amygdala activation and connectivity. 19 Whereas the association of IMT with lower rCBF in the posterior occipitotemporal region suggests that these areas may be negatively impacted during accelerated vascular aging, relative increases in rCBF in frontal and medial temporal regions associated with higher IMT may represent an attempt to preserve function. The findings of both increased and decreased rCBF in relation to IMT support functional compensation theories 20, 21 and may play a role in the posterior-anterior shift in age-related activation patterns characterized by decreases in occipital activation and increases in prefrontal cortex activation. 22 Because the spatial distribution of the rCBF correlates is very similar to "}, {"section_title": "Sojkova et al", "text": "Intima-Media Thickness and rCBF in Older Adultsregional differences in vasodilatory capacity during hypercapnia in older adults, 23 this distribution may reflect regional differences in neuronal vasoresponsivity through nitric oxide, and possibly in angiotensin system expression with subclinical vascular disease. We further investigated gender differences in the relationship between IMT and rCBF. Although women had lower IMT, they exhibited a robust relationship between IMT and rCBF. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of rCBF correlates with IMT in women was very similar to the pattern seen in the entire group, suggesting that women significantly contributed to the overall relationship between IMT and rCBF. In women, higher IMT correlates with lower rCBF in temporal, occipital, and parietal regions, and the correlates of higher rCBF with higher IMT are seen in medial frontal, superior temporal, and insular regions, and in bilateral putamen. These findings are in contrast with regional correlates in males, in whom higher IMT correlates with lower rCBF only in the superior temporal gyrus and with greater rCBF in the putamen and right inferior frontal gyrus. The differences in location and spatial extent of the rCBF correlates for men and women may reflect gender differences in nitric oxide and angiotensin system expression 24 -28 in the brain and at the common carotid artery. 29, 30 Differential susceptibility to angiotensin induced attenuation in rCBF by neural activity, 31 and differences in gender hormone levels that may affect other endothelial factors, such as prostanoids and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, 27 may further contribute to the gender differences observed here, because many of these factors are related not only to rCBF but also to IMT.\nBecause increased blood pressure can modify cerebral autoregulation, we also evaluated whether MAP significantly affects the relationship between IMT and rCBF. In this study, additional adjustment for MAP only minimally affected the relationship between rCBF and IMT, primarily influencing the spatial extent of the regional correlations. In females, MAP adjustment had a more pronounced impact on the relationship between IMT and rCBF, with decreased spatial extent primarily in the occipitotemporal region. These findings are of interest because women had, on average, lower MAP, and fewer women in this study were using antihypertensive medications. Overall, however, in this group of older adults, we found that MAP adjustment has a limited effect on the relationship between IMT and CBF when blood pressure is well-controlled. This attenuated effect suggests that, at least in individuals with well-controlled blood pressure, the relationship between carotid IMT and neuronal function is not greatly affected by levels of distending blood pressure.\nFinally, the relationship between IMT and WML burden was examined. In a subset of our sample for which WML data were available, we did not observe associations between IMT and WML. Although cross-sectional 4 and longitudinal studies 32 have reported strong associations between IMT and WML, recent findings suggest that IMT measured at the internal carotid artery 33 and presence of arterial plaque in addition to increased IMT 34 may be stronger predictors of WML load and silent cerebral infarcts than IMT alone. This, in conjunction with lower WML load in our sample than in studies of community-dwelling elderly, 8 may account for the lack of relationship between IMT and WML load.\nA limitation of our study is that participants are not representative of the general population with respect to their vascular health. Individuals who had histories of myocardial infarction, bypass surgery, or angioplasty were not accepted into the neuroimaging study of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging at the time of initial enrollment. In addition, 44% of the study participants were using antihypertensive therapy and nearly 10% were using statin treatment, which are medication classes shown to decrease IMT. 35 Finally, we used a statistical threshold of P\u03ed0.001 with spatial extent of 100 voxels as compromise between type 1 and type 2 errors attributable to the limited power afforded by only a single resting PET scan per individual in these analyses."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Although our results require replication in other samples, investigation of associations between carotid IMT and rCBF is important for our understanding of the cumulative effects of subclinical vascular disease in the brain.
