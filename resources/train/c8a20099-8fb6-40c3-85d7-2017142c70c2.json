It includes aggression that occurs both inside and outside of school\" (MEXT 2006c ). This definition is similar to the definition used widely in Europe. 3 The Ministry of Education collects annual data on the number of Ijimecases reported by principals in elementary (grades 1-6), middle (grades 7-9), and high schools (grades 10-12). According to this national statistics, the number of Ijime cases has declined from 60,096 cases in 1995 to 20,143 cases in 2005 20,143 cases in (MEXT 2006b ). These numbers correspond to the decrease in the percentage of schools with at least one case of Ijime from 40.6 percent to 19.4 percent (MEXT 2006b ). In 2005, 11.3 percent of elementary schools, 34.6 percent of middle schools, and 30.0 percent of high schools reported Ijime cases. However, official reports of Ijime do not accurately n1easure the rates of Ijime because many Ijime cases are not reported to school adrninistrators. The decrease in these statistics may silnply show the underreporting of (jime cases in n10re recent years with an increased pressure on schools to reduce Ijime cases. Therefore, it is important to look at student reports of Ijime cases to accurately understand the rates of Ijime.\nWe exalnined the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), in which a nationally representative sample of 4,833 Japanese eighth graders reported their victimization from school bullying. Based on the question, \"In school, did any of these things happen during the last month?\" 28.8 percent responded that they were \"lnade fun of or called names,\" 19.5 percent were \"hit or hurt by other student(s) (e.g., shoving, hitting, kicking) ,\" and 6.1 percent were \"left out of activities by other students\" (percentages computed based on a secondary analysis of the TIMSS data). In addition, a national student survey of Ijime was also conducted by the NIinistry of Education in 1997 (Morita et al. 1999a ). For students in middle schools (grades 7-9),10.2 percent reported that they experienced teasing and verbal threats, while 6.5 percent reported social exclusion or being ignored (Morita et al. 1999a) . Physical violence was less con1mon, and only 4.0 percent of students reported that they experienced hitting or kicking. The percentages were sin1ilar an10ng fifth and sixth graders.\nDue to the different time spans for Ineasuring Ijime between the TIMSS :I Olweus (1999, 11) defined bullying as\" 1) aggressive behavior or intentional harm doing 2) which is carried out repeatedly and over time 3) in an interpersonal relaLionship characterized byan imbalance of power.\" .\n(l 1110nth) and this national survey (4 months), these statistics cannot be compared. However, these statistics showed that Iji1Tw is con1mon both at elelnentary and middle schools, and it most frequently takes the forms of verbal abuse, physical violence, and social exclusion. As for tl1e location of Ijime, 74.9 percent of students reported that it happened \"in hon1eroo111\" and 29.7 percent reported that it took place \"in hallway[sJ or around stairs,\" based on Inultiple-response choices (Morita et a1. 1999a ). These findings support the studies conducted by Akiba (2004) and Kanetsuna and Smith (200.2) , which showed that most Ijime cases occurred within a peer group in the same classroon1."}, {"section_title": "Individual Characteristics of Students Involved in School Bullying", "text": "Japanese bullies most often target students of the salne gender, and male and female students have different patterns of bullying and violent behaviors. Research on gender differences in the nature of Iji17le has revealed that girls are more likely to engage in peer exclusion tl1an boys and that boys are more likely to engage in physical violence and violent threats than girls (Morita et a1. 1999b; Akiba 2004; Shimizu et al. 2006) . The san1e gender pattern applies to students in Israel (Last and Avital 1995; Benbenishty and Astor 2005) , France (Fabre-Cornali et a1. 1999), Germany (Losel and Bliesener 1999) , and the United States (Crick and Grotpeter 1995) .\nResearch findings on the relationship between parents' education level or socioeconomic status (SES) and bullying have been inconsistent. On the one hand, studies in Scotland (Mellor ] 999), France (Fabre-Cornali et al. 1999) , and the Netherlands (Veenstra et a1. 2005) showed that both bullies and victims are frOln low-SES or unelnployed fan1ilies. On the other hand, SES or parents' education level had no or weak association with students' perpetration or victimization of bullying in Norway and Sweden (Olweus 1999), Gennany (Losel and Bliesener 1999) , and Canada (Ma 2001 (Ma ,2002 .\nLittle is known about the SES of bullies or victims in Japan because school administrators are reluctant to let researchers collect data on socioeconomic status or parental education levels. The students with low SES have . limited access to outside school learning opportunities through Juku (cram schools) or tutoring to enhance their chances for success in high school entrance examinations. If this inequality is associated with students' involvement in Ijime, it is possible that bullies are likely to come froin low-SES families.\n. Ando et a1. (2005) found that self-reported acadelnic performance was not significantly associated with student perpetration of physical, verbal, or indirect bullying after controlling for other factors in a survey of2,923 n1iddle school students. A survey of 922 students in two middle schools conducted by Akiba and Shimizu (2006) similarly found no association between perfonnance on a standardized exam and Ijime victin1ization or perpetration, although Ijime perpetrators did have lower academic aspirations. In the United States, South Korea (Kim and Kim 1999; Park and Kim 2001) , and European countries (Junger-Tas et al. 1994) , low academic achievement is associated with both victimization and bullying.4\nAnother important individual characteristic of students involved in Ijime is their value of schooling. It is often argued that acadelnic pressure over high school entrance examinations causes students to lose interest in and devalue the academic experience, which in turn may lead thenl to engage in ljirne (Yoneyama and Naito 2003) . Akiba and Shimizu (2006) showed that bullies were more likely than other students to perceive that their school work was not important for their future success. This tendency for bullies to devalue schooling is also consistent with the previous findings that lower levels of sense of school belonging or bonding, school maladjustment, and school alienation were associated with bullying in Australia (Rigby and Slee 1991) , Norway (Natvig et al. 2001) , the United States (Haynie et al. 2001) , as well as in a comparative study of 25 countries (Nansel et al. 2004 ). Thus, we could expect that bullies in Japan are likely to report a negative value of schooling. Little is known about the value of schooling alnong victims in other countries. In Japan, Akiba and Shimizu (2006) found that there was no statistically significant relationship between the value of schooling and victimizati\"on.\nBased on these previous empirical studies, we decided to include as control variables six individual characteristics of victims and bullies: gender, grade level, SES, academic aspiration, grade point average (CPA), and student value of schooling. Our Inajor focus is on the association bet\\AJeen student-teacher relationships and student involvement in Ijime. We also considered the students' grade levels (grades 7-9) to control for different rates in victimization and bullying.\nJapanese Teachers' Roles and iji1ne\nHomeroom teachers have unique roles in Japan because they provide guidance in students' psychological and social development in addition to the students' acadenlic developlnent.\n5 When a student in the homeroom engages in a problern behavior such as Ijirne or vandalism, the homeroom teacher will be notified first. The homeroom teacher then discusses the problem with the students in the honlerooln and seeks a group decision on hmAJ to solve the problem. This intervention is based on the widely held assunlption that problem behaviors emerge as a result of detachment from the homerOOln and the belief of Japanese teachers in general that a homer00111 as a group can most effectively deal with student problems (Lewis 1995; -1 For the United Stales, see Buhs and Ladd (2001) , Graham et al. (2003) , Juvonen et al. (2000) , and Schwartz et al. (2005) . S See LeTendre (1994 LeTendre ( , 1995 LeTendre ( ,2000 and Fukuzawa and LeTendre (2001) . LeTendre 2000) . When a problen1 is serious and the honleroon1 teacher judges that it is beyond the homeroOln's ability to solve, the teacher brings the issue to a grade conlmittee con1posed of the teachers in the same grade level or to the student guidance conlmittee, which is composed of homeroom teachers and the student guidance chair. The teachers on the grade com-. mittee support the hon1eroom teacher by discussing strategies and keeping an eye on the victim or bully's behaviors during club activities or class periods while the homeroOln teacher is not around. Thus, while other teachers support the hOlneroom teacher to deal \"vith [.lime, the h0111eroom teacher takes responsibility for solving the Ijime case by directly working vlith tlle students involved.\nWith the emergence of serious problems such as [.lime and Futoko (longterm absenteeism) since the 1980s, the honleroom teacher systenl may no longer be effective in addressing these serious problelns. Middle school teachers face challenging tasks in their multiple responsibilities of promoting students' acadelnic, social, and psychological development as well as helping students make sense of the conflicting environnlents of promoting group connection and identity, on the one hand, and developing individual academic goals to prepare for the academic cOlnpetition of high school entrance examinations, on the other hand. In this study, we focus on three inlportant aspects of student-teacher relationships in Japanese n1iddle schools: (l) teacher bonding, (2) student guidance, and (3) instructional support based on the institutional and cultural enviromnents of Japanese middle schools."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Bonding", "text": "Teacher bonding describes how close students feel to their homeroom teachers and is characterized by students' trust of and respect for their teachers. Strong emotional ties between homeroom teachers and students are considered a critical element of a successful educational process inJapanese schools (Fukuzawa and LeTendre 2001) . When Japanese n1iddle school students have strong bonds with their homeroom teachers, characterized by trust, respect, and the perception of fairness, they have strong emotional ties with them and feel supported in this critical transition phase from elementary school to high school. They are more likely to succeed in making sense of the two competing values of collectivism and individual cOlnpetitions over high school entrance examinations. Because they are likely to internalize values instilled by the hOlneroom teachers, they would perceive Ijime as wrongdoing and would be less likely to bully others. In contrast, when students have weak bonds with their homeroom teachers, they perceive that their homeroom teachers are not supportive or helpful. These students may be n10re likely to engage in Ijime as a result of their deviation from teacher values as well as their struggles with transition and the development of a coherent identity. I.lime victims may also have weaker bonds with teachers because they may perceive that their teachers could not protect them from bullies."}, {"section_title": "Student Guidance", "text": "When the homeroom teacher is successful in guidance, students '''li11 feel that she or he understands their problems and can be asked for help. The students would also trust that their homeroom teacher can effectively solve the problems they are facing, including Ijirne. Furthermore, the homeroom teacher would effectively form a homeroom community (Gakkyu-zukuri) by promoting collaboration and harmony among students. Therefore, students would be less likely to be involved in Ijirne when they belong to a homeroom community supported by the effective student guidance of the homeroonl teacher. We expected to find that bullies and victims were less likely than nonbullies and nonvictims to view their homeroom teachers as effective in student guidance."}, {"section_title": "Instructional Support", "text": "While homeroom teachers provide extra lessons to prepare students for high school entrance examinations before and after school and during the summer, daily instruction is provided mainly by other subject teachers. Only one study from Norway examined the relationship between instructional support and school bullying. Based on a survey of 2,002 students and 99 teachers in Norwegian primary schools, Roland and Galloway (2002) found that successful classroom n1anagement was significantly associated with lower classroom rates of bullying. Competence in teaching-student reports of teacher competence in explaining subject matter and pedagogy, group activities, and individual work-was part of the measure of classroom 111anage-n1ent along 'with caring for pupils, monitoring, and intervention. They also found based on a path analysis that the relationship between classroom Inanagement and classroom rates of bullying was mediated by social structure of the class measured by peer relations, shared nonns, and focus on schoolwork.\nWe expect that students who perceive their teachers as supportive would be less likely to be involved in bullying. These students receive sufficient guidance and support for overcoming the pressure and stress associated with high school entrance exalninations. However, the students who receive little guidance or help from teachers face a daunting challenge to succeed acadell1ically and to go smoothly tllrough this high-stakes process, which ll1ay lead thenl to be involved in 1.Jirne. Thus, bullies in Japanese middle schools would likely report that they do not receive sufficient instructional support from their teachers. As there is no apparent explanation of how the perceived level of instructional support could lead to victimization, we expect that there \",rill be no significant relationship between instructional support and victimization."}, {"section_title": "BULLIES IN J'\\PA.NESE MIDDLE SCHOOLS Survey Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "We surveyed students v,rith.in a single school district located in a central region of Japan. The city served by this school district had a population of 206,661 in 2007, which is larger than the average population size of 134,677 in cities across Japan (ShityousonJichi Kenkyukai 2007) . The city has a major national university that offers a large nUlnber of jobs, and its population has grown rapidly during the past 10 years. It has a lower unenlployment rate but a higher crinle rate than the national average in 2007 (Keisatsucho 2008) .\nThe school district serves 5,269 students in 14 middle schools (grades 7-9). There are 38 elementary schools in the district, and each middle school has between one and six feeder elenlentary schools. Five Iniddle schools are in urban areas, four are in suburban areas, and five are in rural regions. Nearly all the 111iddle school students in this district advanced to high schools in 2005. The average school size across the 14 middle schools is 452 students, which is larger than the national average of 329 students. However, the student-teacher ratio is similar to the national average. The city enrolls a growing number of nonjapanese citizens due to the increasing number of children of international students enrolled at the university. As of 2007, there were 68 nonjapanese students (1.3 percent) out of the total of 5,269 students in 14 middle schools, which is about twice as many as the national average (0.6 perc en t; MEXT 2008).\nThe district offers various programs for supporting schools to deal with Ijirne. School counselors are assigned to all middle schools, and they spend 1 day a week in each school. In addition, the district assigns school assistants who help students struggling with learning and provide individual consultations to students facing problems. The district also offers telephone and face-to-face counseling 5 days a week on Ijime, Futoko, delinquency, and other student problems. The district officers visit schools fron1 tinle to time to provide advice on student guidance with regard to Ijime and Futoko-the two most prevalent student problems in the district.\nVve used a multistage sampling method to select students for our survey. Out of 14 middle schools in the district, seven middle schools were randomly selected, and all students in these schools were invited to participate. Three schools are located in urban areas, two schools in suburban ar.eas, and two schools in rural areas. The survey was administered by teachers during the spring of 2006. Teachers were asked to explain to the students that the survey participation is voluntary, to give students sufficient time to cOlnplete the questionnaires, and to collect the questionnaires immediately after completion. Teachers then handed the packet to the school administrator who shipped the questionnaires to us.\nA total of 3,161 students were invited to participate, and 2,999 students turned in the questionnaires. For the data analysis, missing data were imputed.\ni\\J<lBA, SHIMIZU, AND ZHUANG Missing cases in six variables-aspiration, CPA, value of schooling, teacher bonding, student guidance, and instructional support-were estimated based on the value of SES. There were no missing cases in SES and Ijime variables (victimization and bullying). Because gender was analyzed as dichotomous variables (l or 0) and cannot be accurately ilTIputed, the missing cases in gender were left as they were. After the imputation of the above-listed six variables, 2,970 cases had complete data, with the final response rates of 94 percent. We used 2,999 cases for the analyses that did not involve the gender variable, and we used 2,970 cases in the analyses of the relationship between gender and Ijime involvement.\nOUf survey instrument was based on the major constructs on studentteacher relationships and bullying identified through a literature review on Japanese education and school bullying. The questionnaire included three constructs: teacher bonding, student guidance, and instructional support. There were three further subscales of teacher bonding: trust, respect, and fairness. For the items on victimization and bullying, the questionnaire asked students about the three most common types of Ijime: verbal abuse, physical violence, and peer exclusion. Finally, based on the previous ljime literature and international school bullying literature, the questionnaire included items on the value of schooling and individual characteristics such as gender, grade level, socioeconon1ic status, academic aspiration, and CPA. The survey items and coding on Ijime, student-teacher relationship, and student value of schooling are presented in the appendix (available in the online version of this article) ."}, {"section_title": "Questionnaire Design", "text": "We developed and analyzed separately three types of ljime: verbal abuse, physical violence, and peer exclusion. 6 In addition to these three types of Ijime, we also created an overall measure of victimization and bullying to differentiate the students who had never been involved in Ijime and students who had been involved in at least one type of Ijime. An examination of three lypes of {jime as well as overall Ijime allows us to examine whether the predictors of Ijirne differ or resen1ble across types of ljime.\nVictimization.-Three variables measuring verbal abuse, physical violence, and peer exclusion were created based on student responses to the follo\\v1ng question: \"During the previous 12 months, how often did tl1e follo\\ving tl1ings happened to you: (1) someone verbally abused you, (2) SOlneone hit, slapped, or pushed you, and (3) your friends excluded you fro111 the peer group?\" The answer choices were never, 1-2 ti111es, 3-4 tin1es, 5-9 tilnes, and 10 or more times.

Table 1 presents the overall rates of victilllization and bullying for four Ineasures: (1) overall Ijime, (2) verbal abuse, (3) physical violence, (4) peer exclusion, and disaggregated rates by gender and grade level. Chi-square tests of percentage differences were conducted between boys and girls, and aillong seventh graders, eighth graders, and ninth graders, and the results are presen ted in table 1 as well. When we look at the overall rates, 31.7 percent of students experienced Ijirne victin1ization and 30.6 percent of students bullied another student at least once during the previous 12 months. A national survey of Ijirne by Morita et al. (l999a) showed that 11.1-19.3 percent of students reported that they bullied another student, and 9.0-14.2 percent of students reported having become a victirn of Ijirne during the previous 4 months. As our survey asked students about Ijime involvement during the previous 12 months, it is natural that greater percentages of students in this study reported victimization and bullying.\nThe overall rates of Ijime by gender showed that a higher percentage of boys (32.7 percent) than girls (28.1 percent) reported having bullied another student, but there was no statistically significant difference in victimization between boys and girls. By grade level, seventh graders had the highest level and ninth graders had the lowest level of victimizatiol1 and bullying, and the differences were statistically significant. \\t\\lhen we look at the level of victimization and bullying by specific type of Ijime, we can see that 29.9 percent of students reported that they had been verbally abused during the previous 12 months, and 28.5 percent of students reported that they had verbally abused another student during the san1e period. s The rates of physical violence and peer exclusion were lower than those of verbal abuse. The percentage of students who reported that they had been victims of physical violence-hitting, slapping, or pushing-was 15.7 percent, and 12.4 percent reported that they had hit, slapped, or pushed another student. 9 The percentage of students who reported that they had been excluded from the peer group was 18.8 percent, and 18.1 percent of students reported that they had excluded a friend from the peer group.l0\nTable 1 also shows that gender and grade patterns differ by the type of school bullying. Boys are significantly lnore likely than girls to be involved in physical violence as victims or bullies, and girls are significantly n10re likely than boys to be involved in peer exclusion as victims or bullies. There was no statistically significant difference between boys and girls for verbal abuse. Seventh graders are Inost likely to be involved in verbal abuse and physical violence, and ninth graders are least likely to be involved in verbal abuse and physical violence. There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of peer exclusion by grade level. These data show the san1e gender pattern as the previous studies on Ijime (Morita et al. 1999b; Akiba 2004; ). The higher rates of overall I.lime among seventh graders cOlnpared to eighth and ninth graders were also reported by Morita et al. (1999a) . Our data further revealed tl1at there are different gender and grade patterns by the type of I.li'tne. 8 The breakdowns of the percentages by frequency of verbal abuse not reported in table 1 are 5.2 percenl (1-2 times); 6.2 percent (3-4 times), 4.7 percent (5-9 times), and 13.7 percent 00 or more limes) for victimizatjon and 6.3 percent (1-2 times), 6.7 percent (3-4 times), 3.8 percent (5-9 times), and 11.7 percent (10 or more times) for bullying.\n\\} The breakdovvns of the percentages by frequency of physical violence not reported in table 1 are 4.5 percent (1-2 tirnes), 3.4 percent (3-4 times), 2.1 percent (5-9 times), and 5.7 percent (10 or more times) for victimization and 4.7 percent 0-2 times), 2.7 percent (3-4 times), 1.7 percent (5-9 limes), and 3.2 percent (10 or more Limes) for bullying.\nto The breakdowns of the percentages by frequency of peer exclusion not reported in table 1 are 4.8 percent 0-2 limes), 3.6 percent (3-4 times), 3.4 percent (5-9 times), and 6.9 percent (10 or more times) for victimization and 6.5 percent (1-2 times), 3.7 percent (3-4 times), 2.6 percent (5-9 times), and 5,4 percent (10 or more times) for bullying. \nAssociation between Student-Teacher Relationship and Victimization/Bullying\nTo address our first research question, \"\\Nhat relationship do {jimevictims and bullies have \\vith school teachers?\" we conducted multiple regression analyses separately for three types of student-teacher relationships: (1) teacher bonding, (2) student guidance, and (3) instructional support as dependent variables. We included three types of Ijime as independent variables in the models. We conducted the analyses separately for victimization and bullying and presented six models (three models each for victimization and bullying). Standardized coefficients (beta) and coefficient of determination (R2) were also reported for each model. Table 2 presents l11ultiple regression results of the association between student-teacher relationship and student involvement in ljime as victims or bullies.\nAfter statistically controlling for other types of victimization for each type of victimization, none of the victimization variables was associated with teacher bonding, student guidance, or instructional support. The perceived levels of teacher bonding, student guidance, and student guidance do not differ between victilns and nonvictims of ljime. However, for the models for bullying, we found that students who excluded another student from the peer group were likely to have weaker teacher bonding and perceived less instructional support from teachers than other students who are not involved in peer exclusion. The proportions of variation in student-teacher relationship variables explained by victimization or bullying variables were minimal, ranging from .001 to .016.\nFor the second research question, \"How is the student-teacher relationship associated with victimization and bullying, controlling for student background characteristics and attitudes toward schooling?\" multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted Mth the dependent variables of overall measure of Ijime and each of the three types of Ijime and with independent variables of three measures of the student-teacher relationship (teacher bonding, student guidance, and instructional support). Student gender, grade level, socioeconomic status, academic aspiration, GPA, and student value of schooling were included as control variables. A total of eight models were estimated, with four models each for victi1nization and bullying. Based on these estimates, we computed the increased probability of victimization or bullying associated with a one-unit increase in each independent variable. A Negelkerke R2 (coefficient of determination for multiple logistic regression) is reported for each lnodel. The results for victimization are presented in table 3, and the results for bullying are presented in table 4.\nWe can see frOln table 3 that, controlling for other variables, boys are more likely than girls to become the victims of physical violence, and girls are more likely than boys to becOIne the victims of peer exclusion. Table 4 also showed that boys are more likely than girls to inflict physical violence on another student, and girls are more likely than boys to exclude a friend from the peer group. Boys were also found to verbally abuse another student more frequently than girls, once all the other variables were controlled. The overall lTleaSUre of Ijime showed that while there was no gender difference in victimization, boys are more likely to become bullies than girls. The differences by grade level showed the same pattern as in table 1, that seventh graders have the highest level of involvement in victin1ization or bullying, and ninth graders have the lowest level of Iji117,e involven1ent in overall Ijime, verbal abuse, and physical violence. There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of peer exclusion by grade level, both for victimization and bullying.\nLower socioeconomic status increases the probability of becoming a bully but not of beco111ing a victim. Students with low SES were more likely than students with high SES to bully others using physical violence and peer exclusion. This pattern applied to overall Ijime as well. Academic aspiration was not significantly associated with eitl1er victin1ization or bullying, except that bullies of physical violence had significantly lower aspirations than nonbullies. Grade point average, however, was significantly associated with victimization. Victin1s of every type of Ijime had lower GPA than nonvicti1ns, while there was no statistically significant relationship between GPA and student involvemen t in Ijime as bullies.\nStudent value of schooling, measured by the extent to which students see the importance of schooling, was significantly associated with both victimization and bullying. Victims of verbal abuse, physical violence, and peer exclusion, as well. as overall Ijime, possessed lower value of schooling than nonvictin1s. Bullies also share the same characteristic-those who verbally abuse and inflict violence on another student are less likely than non bullies to see tl1e value of schooling, although bullies involved in peer exclusion did not have a different value of schooling from nonbullies. ''The probability increase in victimization with a one-unit increase in each independent variable controUing for other independent variables was computed based on the equation\nJ -.50. The negative sign in the probability indicates that the probability of victimization decreases for the indicated amount with a one-unit increase in X. \"The probabilit)' increase in bullying with a one-unit increase in each independent variable controlling for other independellL variables was computed based on the equation\nJ -.50. The negative sign in the probabilit), indicates that the probability of bullying decreases for the indicated amount with a one-unit increase in X.\n*/)< .05."}, {"section_title": "**j)<", "text": ".01. ***jJ< .OOL When three measures of student-teacher relationship were estin1ated in the same equation (i.e., controlling for one another), only teacher bonding showed a statistically significant relationship \"vith victin1ization and bullying. Victims reported a significantly higher level of teacher bonding than nonvictims, and bullies reported a significantly lower level of teacher bonding than nonbullies. This pattern was consistent across three types of Ij\u00a3me as \"veIl as overall measure of ljime. There was no statistically significant relationship betlveen ljime involvement and student guidance or instructional support. These results show the in1portance of teacher bonding as a predictor of student involvement in victimization and bullying.\nWe can see from the probabilities for teacher bonding in table 3 that when the level of teacher bonding increases one unit, the probability of becoming victims of Iji1Tte increases as much as .06 to .07. This translates into a .24-.28 difference in the probability of becoming victims between the students with the lowest level of teacher bonding (coded as I) and the students with the highest level of teacher bonding (coded as 4). The relationship betlVeen teacher bonding and bullying was even stronger as we can see from table 4. With a one-unit increase in teacher bonding, the students' probability of bullying another student decreases as much as .09-.12. This n1eans that the students ,<\\rith the weakest teacher bonding have .36-.48 higher probabilities ofbecOlTIing bullies than the students 'mth the strongest teacher bonding. Negelkerke R2 values showed that the proportion of variation explained by the independent and control variables ranged from .08 to .27 for victimization and from .11 to .36 for bullying. The largest proportions of variation were explained for physical violence victilTIization (.27) and perpetration (.36) .\nIn sum, these analyses revealed important characteristics of victilTIS and bullies in Japanese middle schools. In general, physical violence is more' COlTIlTIOn among boys than girls, and peer exclusion is lTIOre common an10ng girls than boys. Seventh graders have a higher probability to be invoh:ed in Ijime as victims or bullies than eighth or ninth graders. Victilns and bullies share the same characteristic in their devaluation of schooling. However, victims reported strong teacher bonding, while bullies reported weak teacher bonding. Bullies tend to come from low-SES falTIilies, but they did not have low acadelnic aspirations or GPAs. Socioeconomic standing and academic aspiration did not predict students' likelihood for becOlning victims, but victims have lower GPAs than nonvictims."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study focused on an in1portant yet often overlooked aSSOCIatIon between student-teacher relationships and victimization and bullying. We found that students who excluded another student from their peer group were likely to have weaker teacher bonding and to perceive less instructional support than the students not involved in peer exclusion. VVhen these relationships were exal11ined through multiple logistic regression analyses controlling for student gender, grade level, SES, academic aspiration, CPA, and value of schooling, we found that only teacher bonding was significantly associated with student victimization and bullying.\nIjime victims and bullies had an opp<?site characteristic in the level of teacher bonding, with victims showing stronger teacher bonding than nonvictims and bullies showing weaker teacher bonding than nonbullies. This study does not directly explain why bullies have weaker teacher bonding and victims have stronger teacher bonding than other students. However, the findings that victims are low achievers and bullies tend to come from low-SES families 111ay help understand the different level of teacher bonding between victims and bullies.\nJapanese middle school teachers tend to pay attention to low achievers because these students struggle the most in developing self-confidence in the environment with an increasing focus on academics during the middle school years (LeTendre 2000) . This teacher attention on low-achieving students may have led to stronger bonding between the victims and the homeroom teacher. Bullies are not low achievers, thus they do not receive such attentions frOl11 their hon1eroom teachers. Yet, they COl11e frOlll low-SES families, and they 111ay perceive that they are disadvantaged in academic competition over high school entrance examinations because their parents may not be able to afford a high Juku tuition or tutoring expense. Bullies may perceive that the students who are low achievers but do not COllle from low-SES families are receiving unfair attention and support of the homeroom teacher, which gives them an advantage in their entrance into high school. Bullies may also perceive that the student who devalues schooling yet shows strong teacher bonding is being contradictory or a traitor. These perceptions of bullies could lead to bullying as a strategy or a reaction to gain back a power over the victil11 in the peer group.\nArlOther interpretation is that the victims could have developed stronger teacher bonding as a result of the teacher's successful intervention of bullying. However, this interpretation is unlikely to be supported because victin1s did not report positive guidance from teachers, as shown in the lack of a significant relationship between student guidance and victin1ization status explained below. The previous case studies of Ijime also showed, despite the expected cultural role, the lilllited actual role played by teachers to intervene in cases of {jime (Alziba 2004; LeTendre 2000) due to the complexity of the problen1 that requires involven1ent of specialists such as counselors, social workers, or police. 'While we cannot establish a causal relationship between teacher bonding and students' involvement in Ijime from our data, teacher bonding is an important factor we need to pay attention to in our efforts in Ijimg prevention and intervention. Student reports of student guidance and instructional support were not significantly associated with victin1ization or bullying once individual characteristics were controlled. The lack of a significant relationship bep;,veen student guidance and victilnization or bullying was surprising given tl1e inlportant role homeroom teachers play in supporting tlleir students' mental health and developing classroom comnlunity. However, when compared to teacher bonding, perceived effectiveness in student guidance rnay not be as ilTIportant as how close students feel to their h0111erOO1l1 teachers. Students may perceive that their teachers are effective in student guidance, but they may not feel the connection vlith theITI unless they trust and respect their teachers.\nThe role of school teachers to provide instructional support may not be as critical for students' success in high school entrance examinations when many students are receiving instructional support from Juku instructors or tutors. It is also a COmlTIOn understanding among students and their families that school work alone is never sufficient for success in high school enu-ance exanlinations, and national statistics showed that 51 percent of middle school students were attending Juku in 2005 (Shimizu et a1. 2006) . Therefore, tlle level of instructional support provided by their teachers may not have a major impact on students' preparation for high school entrance examinations.\nBefore discussing the implications of these findings, it is important to point out the limitation of this study. We used cross-sectional survey data collected from a single district, thus the generalizability of the findings is limited. While this district shared similar characteristics in many aspects as the national average, it is located in a relatively large city \"vith lower unen1-ployn1ent rates and yet with higher crin1e rates than the national average. Thus, the findings are only applicable to silnilar cities inJapan. It is ilTlportant that future studies on Ijime attenlpt to collect data from a nationally representative sample to understand accurate national rates of Ijime.\nDespite this limitation, the study is the first to closely examine the studentteacher relationship in relation to student involvelnent in Ijime in Japanese n1iddle school contexts. This study is also unique because of the inclusion of data on students' socioecononlic status-a factor rarely examined in previous Ijime studies. A large sample size also allowed the authors to control for student characteristics in examining the association between studentteacher relationships and victimization or bullying.\nThe findings froITI this study have important inlplications for policy and practice on Ijime prevention and intervention. Our data showed that both victin1s and bullies are more likely than other students to devalue schooling. V'/hen students do not see the value of schooling, they are Inore likely to experience boredom and frustration at school. It would be important for homeroom teachers to be cognizant of students who show the signs of devaluation of schooling. Japanese middle schools have traditionally empha-sized the balance between academic and social development by providing rich social experiences through club activities, school events, and school trips. With the reforms during the past 20 years of school week reductions from 6 days to 5 days, and the reduction of club activities on weekends, it has been reported that less time is dedicated for social development at school than before (Akiba 2004) . These refon11 directions pose a challenge for schools and teachers to enhance students' opportunities for social developl11ent. Despite the challenge, offering social activities that are aligned with students' interests is a promising way to help students see the value of schooling and to prevent further detachment from school. Dealing with each Ijime case requires a significant al110unt of time and energy frol11 homeroom teachers. With about one-third of students in the homeroom experiencing victil11ization and one-third acting as bullies, it is not realistic to expect the homeroom teacher to take the responsibility for all Ijime cases. There needs to be a system to divide responsibilities among homeroom teachers, adl11inistrators, and psychological professionals, while keeping hOl11eroom teachers well infon11ed of the process and progress once the case leaves the hands of homeroom teachers. The fact that teacher bonding is an important predictor of student victin1ization and bullying shows that homeroom teachers need to play an il11portant role in the prevention of Ijime through constant coml11unication with students. The reduction ofhornerool11 size or the assignment of l11ultiple hOl11eroon1 teachers to each homeroom would be necessary to enhance student-teacher cOl11munications. However, once Ijime occurs in a homeroOl11, it should be reported to an administrator or a guidance con1111ittee, and the homeroom teacher should consult with school counselors, social workers, or police, depending on the nature of Ijime.\nThe findings frOl11 this study also provide an important research il11pli-cation for other countries that struggle with school bullying. Most existing studies have overlooked the in1portance of teachers' roles in predicting student involvement in school bullying and instead focused on student characteristics and fan1ily background. As school bullying occurs in a confined school environl11ent, school staff plays a critical role in the identification, prevention, and intervention of bullying.\nPrevious studies examined student-teacher relationships only as part of school belonging or adjustment and did not separate teacher effect5 from school effects. Teachers spend the largest amount of til11e with students in any school context, thus they can most effectively identify any signs of bullying happening among students. It is in1portant that school bullying research in other countries investigate the associations between student-teacher relationships and student involven1ent in school bullying.\nIn addition, it is in1portant to identify the specific nature of studentteacher relationships based on teachers' roles in each sociocultural context and to exan1ine specific aspects of student-teacher relationships in relation to student involvement in school bullying. InJapan, developing sn-ong bonds vvith students is important for an effective educational process. However, in other countries, teachers may mainly take the instructional responsibility and leave disciplinary decisions involving bullying to school counselors or administrators. If so, a measure ofhO'vl teachers refer cases and \"\"ork with school counselors or administrators needs to be exalnined instead of examining how teachers deal \\vith bullying cases by themselves. Our study showed that there is strong relationship between teacher bonding and student involvement in victimization and bullying in Japan. It is important to examine whether this relationship holds true in other national contexts. This relationship was revealed probably because of the unique nature of homeroom teachers' responsibilities and their relationship \\vith students inJapan. In other contexts, the role of school counselors or adlninistrators Inay prove 1l10re important than teacher bonding. Continued investigation of specific roles of teachers, school counselors, and administrators in educating studen ts academically and socially in relation to student involvelnent in school bullying will have important practical implications for creating safe classroOln and school environments free from school bullying."}]
