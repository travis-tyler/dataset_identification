[{"section_title": "November 2004", "text": "Dropping out of high school is not necessarily the end of a student's formal education. Some students who drop out return a short time later to earn a diploma, some may pursue an alternative credential such as a General Educational Development (GED) certificate, and others may enroll in a postsecondary institution without having earned a high school credential. Using data on public and private school students from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), Berktold, Geis, and Kaufman (1998) examined the educational attainment of the 21 percent of 1988 eighth-graders who had dropped out of high school at least once between eighth grade and the spring of 1994, 2 years after they would have graduated if they had finished with the majority of their cohort.\n1 They found that about 44 percent of these dropouts had received a high school diploma or an alternative high school credential by 1994. Of the 56 percent of all dropouts who had not completed high school by 1994, 43 percent indicated that they were working on a high school credential.\nThis Issue Brief extends Berktold, Geis, and Kaufman's analysis of the NELS:88 cohort another 6 years, by examining dropouts' high school completion status and postsecondary experiences as of the year 2000-8 years after the cohort's expected graduation from high school."}, {"section_title": "2,3", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Defining Dropouts", "text": "There are a number of ways to define dropouts. For the purposes of this analysis, students were considered dropouts if they ever reported dropping out of high school or passing the GED exam, if their high school transcripts showed that they had dropped out or passed the GED exam, or if in the 1994 or 2000 follow-up surveys they reported that they were working on an alternative credential or that they had not completed high school and were not working on an alternative credential. Generally, a student absent from school for 4 consecutive weeks or more and not absent due to accident or illness was considered to have dropped out (see Ingels et al. 1994) .

Among students who had ever dropped out, 43 percent earned a high school diploma or alternative credential by spring 1994 (14 percent earned a high school diploma and 29 percent earned a GED or certificate). An additional 20 percent earned a high school diploma or alternative credential after spring 1994 but by spring 2000 (5 percent earned a high school diploma and 15 percent earned a GED or certificate). Thus, 63 percent of students who had ever dropped out earned a high school credential by 2000. Forty-four percent of students who dropped out of high school at least once earned a GED or certificate and 19 percent earned a diploma by 2000. As of 2000, 37 percent of dropouts had not earned a high school diploma or alternative credential, with 5 percent reportedly working towards a high school diploma or equivalent and 32 percent reportedly not enrolled or not working towards a diploma or equivalent. 6 Consistent with Berktold, Geis, and Kaufman's (1998) analysis of high school completion status as of 1994, this analysis shows that high school dropouts' characteristics as of eighth grade (socioeconomic status, test performance, and expectations of eventually earning a bachelor's degree or higher) were associated with earning a high school diploma or alternative credential as of 2000. As shown in table 2, 7 percent of dropouts whose families were in the highest socioeconomic status quarter in 1988 had not attained a high school \nAs of 2000, 43 percent of dropouts whose NELS reading and mathematics composite test score was in the bottom quarter had not earned a diploma or alternative credential and were not working towards a diploma or equivalent, compared to 26 percent of dropouts who scored in the middle range and 16 percent of dropouts who scored in the highest quarter.\nDropouts who reported in eighth grade that they expected to complete a bachelor's degree or higher were more likely to have earned a high school diploma or alternative credential by 2000 than their peers with lower educational expectations. As shown in table 2, some 50 percent of dropouts who expected in eighth grade that they would finish high school or less had not earned a high school diploma or alternative credential as of 2000; in contrast, 25 percent of dropouts who expected in eighth grade that they would earn a bachelor's degree or higher had not earned a high school diploma or alternative credential as of 2000. By 2000, 23 percent of dropouts who expected in eighth grade that they would earn a bachelor's degree or higher had not earned a high school credential and were not working towards one; by comparison, 44 percent of dropouts who expected in eighth grade that they would finish high school or less had not earned a high school credential and were not working towards one."}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Experience of Dropouts", "text": "By 2000, 43 percent of students who dropped out of high school at least once reported having enrolled in a postsecondary institution (table 3) . Of these students, 13 percent reported first enrolling in a 4-year institution, 58 percent in a public 2-year institution (i.e., a community college), and 29 percent in some other type of institution. Dropouts who had earned a high school diploma or alternative credential by spring 1994 were more likely to have attended a postsecondary institution than dropouts who had done so after spring 1994 but by spring 2000 (66 percent compared with 45 percent). Fifteen percent of students who had not earned a high school diploma or alternative credential as of 2000 nevertheless reported having attended a postsecondary institution, and of those students, 9 percent reported first enrolling in a 4-year institution, 38 percent in a public 2-year institution, and 54 percent in some other type of institution. Among dropouts who had some postsecondary experience, 27 percent reported earning a certificate or license and 9 percent reported obtaining an associate's degree or higher by spring 2000 (not shown in tables)."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Overall, the results presented in this Issue Brief suggest that a majority of students who drop out of high school at least once go on to earn a high school diploma or alternative credential within several years (63 percent), and many enroll in a postsecondary institution (43 percent). These estimates offer an early look at the postsecondary experiences of students who ever dropped out of high school, particularly for those who delayed entry into a postsecondary institution. Some dropouts who were enrolled in a postsecondary institution in 2000 may eventually earn a certificate or degree, and others who dropped out of high school may decide to further their education at a later date. Future research could use NELS respondents' postsecondary transcripts to investigate the types of postsecondary coursework engaged in by students who ever dropped out of high school. Table 2 .

For more information about the base-year sample and for a discussion of issues of eligibility, inclusion, and the effect of exclusion on national estimates, see Spencer et al. (1990) and Ingels (1996) . 2 The estimates in this Issue Brief were produced using F4PNLWT, the panel weight for 8 th -grade members of the NELS:88 base-year sample who also participated in the first, second, third, and fourth follow-ups. The unweighted sample size was 10,827 cases, representing the approximately 2.9 million people living in the United States in the year 2000 who were members of the 8 th -grade class of 1988. This sample size is smaller than that used in Berktold, Geis, and Kaufman's (1998) analysis and may yield slightly different results. 3 The data on postsecondary educational experiences presented in this Brief in table 3 are based on respondents' reports. These self-reports may encompass some error in recall and thus may differ from information based on the respondents' postsecondary transcripts, which became available after this analysis was completed."}]
