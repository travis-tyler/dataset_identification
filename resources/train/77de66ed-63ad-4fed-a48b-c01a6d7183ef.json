III What are the challenges that educators, both international and national, are facing to expand apprenticeship programs? IV What perspectives should school districts consider when developing apprenticeship programs? The concept of apprenticeship remains a practical and effective method of teaching a trade to young people, but technology in the 21 st century has changed what apprentices learn and do during the apprenticeship program In this section, we provide some contextual information pertaining to apprenticeships in the United States Our reviews focus on apprenticeship-related policies, national trend of apprenticeships, youth apprenticeship, federal funding system that supports apprenticeships in K-12 education, and apprenticeship information management at federal and state level A brief review of apprenticeship-related policies \u2022 Historically, the boom or decline of apprenticeship programs has been related to industry needs and economic change \u2022 The current national goal for expanding apprenticeship programs is not only to prepare workers to fill both existing and newly created jobs, but also to prepare workers for the jobs of the future \u2022 Both previous and current administrations have stressed the need to expand access, equity, and career awareness when promoting, funding and regulating apprenticeship programs"}, {"section_title": "I.
