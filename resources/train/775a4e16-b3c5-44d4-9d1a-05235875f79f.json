[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Recent research has generated a large body of knowledge about students who are the first members of their families to attend college (referred to as \"first-generation students\" in this report). 1 The results show that such students are at a distinct disadvantage in gaining access to postsecondary education. Even those who overcome the barriers and do enroll have difficulty remaining enrolled and attaining a degree (Horn and Nu\u00f1ez 2000;Nu\u00f1ez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998;Warburton, Bugarin, and Nu\u00f1ez 2001). What has not been well studied, however, are the coursetaking experiences of first-generation students after entering college. What do firstgeneration students study in college? How well do they do in their coursework? Is their coursework different from that of their peers whose parents went to college? This report explores these questions by using data from the Postsecondary Education Transcript Study (PETS) of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) to examine the majors and coursetaking patterns of first-generation students and to compare their postsecondary experiences and outcomes with those of students whose parents went to college. 2 This analysis focuses on a subset of the NELS 1992 12th-graders who had 1 See, for example, Choy (2001). 2 Two comparison groups were included in this report: those who had at least one parent with some college education, but neither parent attained a bachelor's degree; and those who had at least one parent who earned a bachelor's or advanced degree. The latter group was also frequently referred to as \"students whose parents were college graduates\" in this report. enrolled in postsecondary education between 1992 and 2000 and who also have complete postsecondary transcripts available; in addition, the analysis also required that parents' education levels be reported. The findings of this study contribute to earlier research by distinguishing between first-generation students and their counterparts with respect to major fields of study chosen, the types of courses taken, amount of coursework completed, academic performance, and postsecondary outcomes. The major findings are summarized below. 3"}, {"section_title": "First-Generation Students in Postsecondary Education: A Brief Portrait", "text": "About 28 percent of the NELS 1992 12thgraders were first-generation students (figure A). However, they represented 22 percent of those who entered postsecondary education between 1992 and 2000, indicating that first-generation students were less likely than other students to attend college within 8 years after high school. 4 Roughly 4 in 10 (43 percent) first-generation students who entered postsecondary education during this period left without a degree by 2000, while 24 percent had graduated with a bachelor's degree (figure A). The opposite pattern was observed for students whose parents were college graduates: a large majority (68 percent) had completed a bachelor's degree, while 20 percent left without a degree. As in earlier studies (Ishitani 2003), this report found that first-generation students had some family and background characteristics that are associated with attrition. Compared with their peers whose parents were college graduates, firstgeneration students were more likely to be Black or Hispanic and to come from low-income families (table 1). They were less prepared academically for college as demonstrated by their lower rates of taking higher-level mathematics courses in high school, their lower senior achievement test scores, and their lower college entrance examination scores. They were also more likely to delay postsecondary entry, begin at a 2year institution, and attend part time and discontinuously (table 2). These characteristics, as shown in earlier research, put them at potential risk for not persisting in their postsecondary studies and completing a degree (Nu\u00f1ez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998)."}, {"section_title": "Remedial Coursetaking", "text": "Reflecting their weaker high school academic preparation, many first-generation students needed remedial assistance after they enrolled in college. A majority of first-generation students (55 percent) took some remedial courses during their   (table 3). In particular, 40 percent of first-generation students took remedial mathematics courses, and 13 percent took remedial reading courses, compared with 16 and 6 percent, respectively, of students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher. The higher need for remedial education among firstgeneration students was apparent in many major fields of study.\nMany high school graduates lack adequate academic preparation for higher education and need remedial assistance to do college-level work (Parsad and Lewis 2003). Among the 1992 12th-graders who had enrolled in postsecondary education in 1992-2000, 4 in 10 (40 percent) took at least one remedial course, about 3 in 10 (27 percent) took remedial mathematics courses, and nearly 1 in 10 (9 percent) took remedial reading courses (figure 4). First-generation students, in particular, needed remedial help: 55 percent took remedial courses during their college years, compared with 27 percent of their counterparts whose parents held bachelor's or advanced degrees (figure 4). Among those with bachelor's degree goals who attended 4-year institutions, 45 percent of first-generation students took at least one remedial course, compared with 21 percent of students whose parents had at least bachelor's degrees. Examining specific types of courses revealed that 40 percent of first-generation students took one or more remedial mathematics course, and 13 percent took one or more remedial reading course during their college years, compared with 16 and 6 percent, respectively, of those whose parents had at least bachelor's degrees. As shown in table 3, the greater need for remedial education for first-generation students was also apparent in many major fields of study. 4 For example, 59 percent of first-generation students majoring in social sciences/journalism/ communications took at least one remedial course, compared with 17 percent of students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher. It should be noted that taking remedial courses in college was also common among students whose parents had just some college experience: 44 percent of these students took at least one remedial course, and close to one-third took at least one mathematics course during their college years (figure 4)."}, {"section_title": "Undergraduate Major", "text": "Choosing an undergraduate major appeared to pose a greater challenge for first-generation students than for other students. One-in-three firstgeneration students (33 percent) had not identified a major after entering postsecondary education, compared with 13 percent of students whose parents had a bachelor's or advanced degree (figure B). Among those with a major, business and social sciences were the two most popular undergraduate fields for all three groups of students: between 7 and 14 percent of students majored in these two fields. Despite this similar pattern, the differences in the choice of majors were evident among the three comparison groups. For example, firstgeneration students were more likely to choose a major in a vocational or technical field, whereas their counterparts whose parents had a bachelor's or advanced degree were more likely to choose a major in science, mathematics, engineering and architecture, humanities, arts, or social sciences. Many factors are associated with a student's choice of major. Weak academic preparation, for example, may deter first-generation students from choosing certain \"high-skill\" fields, such as mathematics and science. Perceived low-earning potential may also deter them from entering such fields as humanities, arts, and social sciences (Montmarquette, Cannings, and Mahseredjian 2002).\nDuring the early stage of an undergraduate education, every student must choose a major field of study (Montmarquette, Cannings, and Mahseredjian 2002). To fulfill graduation requirements, students must earn enough credits in their major. Thus, to a large extent, students' coursetaking is concentrated in those courses that fit into their major field of study. While choosing a major is difficult for many students, it may pose a greater challenge to first-generation students because their parents may be less able to offer them guidance.

First-generation students earned an average of 18 credits in their first year, compared with 25 credits earned by students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher (figure C). First-year credit accumulation bears an important relationship to long-term postsecondary outcomes. For example, earning fewer credits in the first year may not only prolong the time to degree, but is strongly associated with leaving postsecondary education without earning a degree (table 7). As they progressed through postsecondary education, first-generation students continued to lag behind their peers in credit accumulation: overall, they earned an average of 66 credits during their entire enrollment, compared with an average of 112 credits earned by students whose parents were college graduates (figure C). The discrepancy in credits earned is due in part to firstgeneration students' higher rates of late starts, disrupted enrollment, part-time attendance (table  2), and leaving college without a degree (figure A).\nPrevious research has found that students from disadvantaged backgrounds do not earn as many college credits as their more advantaged peers (McCormick 1999). They trail their peers in credit accumulation as early as the first year of their enrollment. Because first-generation students are more likely to come from low-income families and have similar risk characteristics, they exhibited the same patterns. As shown in figure 5, first-generation students trailed their peers in the number of credits earned beginning in their first year of college: on average, they earned about 18 credits in the first year, compared with 25 credits earned by students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher. One-in-three first-generation students (33 percent) earned 10 or fewer credits in the first year, compared with 12 percent of those whose parents had at least a  (table 6). Like earlier studies demonstrating the relationship between credits earned and postsecondary outcomes (Adelman 1999;McCormick 1999), the current analysis shows that the fewer credits earned in the first year was associated with a reduced likelihood of attaining a degree and an increased time to degree for those who earned one (table 7). First-generation students continued to trail their peers in overall credit accumulation as they progressed through postsecondary education: they earned an average of 66 credits during their entire period of enrollment through 2000, compared with an average of 112 credits earned by students whose parents were college graduates (figure 5). Part of this difference reflects the fact that first-generation students were more likely than students whose parents had graduated from college to start college late, disrupt their enrollment, attend part time (table 2), and leave without a degree within the time period of the study (figure 2). The gaps in credits, both overall and in the first year, were also found among those with bachelor's degree goals who attended 4-year institutions (figure 5).

They also tended to earn fewer credits if they took courses in these areas. Taking mathematics as an example, 55 percent of first-generation students took at least one mathematics course in college, compared with 81 percent of students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher (figure D). Among those who took any mathematics, first-generation students earned an average of 8 credits, compared with 11 credits earned by their counterparts. Moreover, the gap in advanced mathematics coursetaking (in both the likelihood of taking courses and credits earned) remained even among those who majored in mathematics and science (table 8)."}, {"section_title": "Postsecondary Performance", "text": "In line with their greater need for remediation, first-generation students did not perform as well as their peers whose parents were college graduates as early as the first year of college. First-generation students had lower first-year undergraduate grade point averages (GPAs) (2.5 versus 2.8) (figure E). This lower performance persisted throughout their entire undergraduate careers and was evident in many academic areas (e.g., mathematics, science, foreign language, history; table 14). In addition to having lower GPAs, firstgeneration students were more likely than other students to withdraw or repeat courses they attempted. In all undergraduate courses attempted  Courses withdrawn or repeated"}, {"section_title": "Percent", "text": "Executive Summary ix by students, the proportion of courses with withdrawal and repeat grades was 12 percent for first-generation students and 7 percent for students whose parents held a bachelor's degree or higher."}, {"section_title": "Factors Related to Degree Completion and Persistence", "text": "First-generation students were less likely than students with college-educated parents to earn a bachelor's degree even after taking into account many related factors, including students' demographic backgrounds, academic preparation, enrollment characteristics, credit production, and performance (table 15). This difference was observed even among students who attended a 4year institution with the intention of earning a bachelor's degree. When the analysis included persistence as the outcome, before taking into account related variables, first-generation students were less likely than their peers whose parents attended college to persist in postsecondary education (i.e., they were less likely to earn any postsecondary credential or to be still enrolled as of 2000) (table 16). However, unlike the results for bachelor's degree attainment, the difference in persistence disappeared after controlling for related factors. This finding differs from those of earlier studies, which found that first-generation students were less likely than other students to persist (e.g., Nu\u00f1ez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998;Warburton, Bugarin, and Nu\u00f1ez 2001). The reason for the change in results between the earlier studies and the current study may in part be due to the additional postsecondary coursetaking and performance variables introduced in the current analysis. These variables were not available for analysis in the previous studies and therefore, were not controlled for. Finally, this analysis demonstrated important associations between early credit production and academic performance and students' success in postsecondary education. More credits completed and higher grades earned in the first year, and fewer withdrawn or repeated courses throughout enrollment were strongly associated with postsecondary degree attainment and persistence.\nThe tabular analyses described above revealed obvious differences between first-generation students and those with college-educated parents in terms of major fields chosen, number of credits completed, types of courses taken, amount of coursework completed, and academic performance. While these differences are noteworthy, college administrators, state legislators, parents, and, most importantly, students are most concerned with degree completion. The fact that 4-in-10 first-generation students left college without earning a credential is of concern (figure 2). When a student drops out, much is lost in terms of both financial resources and individual potential (Tinto 1993). To address some of these issues, the next stage of the analysis examines students' degree completion. Because many factors related to degree completion are interrelated, an analysis was conducted to examine the unique relationship of each individual factor with selected outcomes while taking interrelated factors into account. This approach is sometimes referred to as \"commonality analysis,\" in which multiple linear regression is used to adjust for the common variation among a group of independent variables. 13 This analysis focused on two main questions: How do the gaps between first-generation students and other students change after controlling for all the relevant variables? Are students' coursetaking behaviors and academic performance ultimately related to degree attainment after taking such factors as demographic characteristics, academic preparation, and enrollment behaviors into account? For the purposes of this study, two separate commonality analyses were performed. 14 The first analysis examined factors related to whether 12th-graders who had enrolled in postsecondary education in 1992\u22122000 had earned a bachelor's degree by 2000. The second analysis broadened the definition of degree completion to include students who had completed any postsecondary credential or were still enrolled (referred to as persistence to a degree) as of 2000. The independent variables included in each commonality analysis were as follows: 15"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The findings from this report indicate that compared with students whose parents attended college, first-generation students consistently remained at a disadvantage after entering postsecondary education: they completed fewer credits, took fewer academic courses, earned lower grades, needed more remedial assistance, and were more likely to withdraw from or repeat courses they attempted. As a result, the likelihood of attaining a bachelor's degree was lower for first-generation students compared to their peers whose parents attended college. This finding also held after taking into account variables related to degree completion including postsecondary credit production, performance, high school academic preparation, and student background characteristics. Even for students who attended a 4-year institution with the intention of earning a bachelor's degree, first-generation students were less likely to earn a bachelor's degree than were their counterparts whose parents held a bachelor's or higher degree.

"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The college environment presents new academic, social, and personal challenges to many first-time students, but these challenges are often greater for students who are the first members in their families to attend college (referred to as \"first-generation students\" in this report) (London 1989;Levine and Nidiffer 1996;Weis 1992). The difficulties that such students experience are reflected in many indicators of postsecondary education success (Choy 2001). For example, compared with their peers who had college-educated parents, students from families in which neither parent attended college are at a distinct disadvantage in gaining access to postsecondary education (Berkner and Chavez 1997). Even those who overcome these barriers and do enroll have difficulty remaining enrolled and attaining a degree\u23afa disadvantage that persists even after controlling for a wide range of demographic, academic, and enrollment characteristics (Horn and Nu\u00f1ez 2000;Nu\u00f1ez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998;Warburton, Bugarin, and Nu\u00f1ez 2001). Taken together, these results suggest that growing up in a family in which neither parent has gone to college may have long-term consequences on students' success in postsecondary education. What has not been explored in depth, however, are a number of questions that pertain to first-generation students' coursetaking experiences. What do they study in college? How well do they do in their coursework? Is their coursework different from that of their peers whose parents went to college? Does coursetaking play a role in postsecondary outcomes? So far, answers to these questions are limited. Analyzing first-year data from 23 colleges (both 2-and 4-year institutions), Terenzini et al. (1996) found that compared with other students, first-generation students completed fewer first-year credit hours, took fewer humanities and fine arts courses, studied fewer hours, and were less likely to participate in an honors program. Similar findings were reported in another study that focused on first-generation students attending five community colleges located in five different states (Pascarella et al. 2003). While these studies are informative of first-generation students' coursetaking in college, they are limited by the fact that they used small-scale local data or followed students only during the first year of college. Introduction 2 courses students actually take and the data are less error prone and more objective than selfreported data, all of which permits a more accurate analysis (Adelman 2004b). To be consistent with earlier studies (Nu\u00f1ez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998;Horn and Nu\u00f1ez 2000;Warburton, Bugarin, and Nu\u00f1ez 2001), this report defines students' generation status according to the highest level of education attained by their parents. First-generation students are defined as those from families where neither parent attained any education beyond high school. These students are compared with two groups of students whose parents went to college: those with at least one parent who had some college education, but neither attained a bachelor's degree; and those with at least one parent who earned a bachelor's or advanced degree.\nThe data collection for the postsecondary transcripts began in fall 2000 and targeted approximately 9,600 students who participated in the 2000 fourth follow-up study and reported having attended at least one U.S. postsecondary institution (Adelman, Daniel, and Berkovits 2003). Transcripts were requested from a total of 3,200 postsecondary institutions that students reported having attended. Based on the transcripts received and, when they were not, other corroborating sources from the National Student Loan Data System files, Advanced Placement and College Entrance Examination Board tests, and other student responses, about 9,400 students were identified as \"likely postsecondary participants.\" For more information about the NELS PETS data collection and design, see Adelman, Daniel, and Berkovits (2003). The analysis sample for this report includes students who were in 12th grade in 1992 because that year marked the modal year of high school graduation and date of their initial entry into postsecondary education. Because this report focuses on coursetaking and requires full information on courses taken across all institutions attended, the sample was further restricted to NELS postsecondary participants who had a complete transcript record in the PETS file. 2 Finally, the definition of first-generation students requires the sample members to have valid information on their parents' education. Thus, students who did not have such information were excluded. These selections resulted in a final analysis sample of about 7,400 students, accounting for about 87 percent (weighted) of all the NELS 1992 12th-graders who entered postsecondary education between 1992 and 2000. For most tables presented in this report, a parallel analysis was also conducted for a subsample of students who attended a 4-year institution at any time between 1992 and 2000 and expected to attain a bachelor's or higher degree. 3 This restriction allows examination of differences between first-generation students and their peers within the group of individuals who intend to earn a bachelor's degree and, therefore may be more comparable academically. The findings for this group may also reduce potential effects of some confounding factors such as type of institutions attended, expectations, and degree goals. 2 A complete transcript record means receiving all transcripts from all institutions students reported attending. Including incomplete transcripts may distort analysis of students' coursetaking. 3 These students are referred to as \"students who attended a 4-year institution with bachelor's degree goals\" in this report. This group accounted for 59 percent (weighted) of all the NELS 1992 12th-graders who had enrolled in postsecondary education between 1992 and 2000. Throughout this report, students' educational expectations in 1994 (as opposed to 1992) were used because 1994 expectations were probably more likely than 1992 expectations to reflect students' current expectations in relation to their postsecondary coursetaking."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "The report begins with a brief description of the background characteristics of firstgeneration college students and their enrollment behaviors, postsecondary persistence, and degree attainment.

Next, the report examines students' academic performance by focusing on two measures of performance: undergraduate grade point average (GPA) and the proportion of all attempted courses either withdrawn or repeated.

The focus of this report is on the 21 percent of the NELS cohort who became first-generation college students by enrolling in postsecondary education by 2000 and who also had a complete transcript, and comparing their postsecondary experiences and outcomes with those of students in postsecondary education whose parents went to college.  \nConsistent with findings reported previously (Choy 2001), first-generation students in the NELS cohort did not do as well as their peers in terms of postsecondary persistence and attainment. Of first-generation students who had enrolled in postsecondary education between 1992 and 2000, nearly one-half (43 percent) had left without a degree by 2000 and one-quarter had attained a bachelor's degree (figure 2). By contrast, roughly two-thirds (68 percent) of students whose parents had a bachelor's degree or higher finished their undergraduate education with a bachelor's degree, and 20 percent left without a credential. These differences held even among students who expected to earn a bachelor's degree and attended a 4-year college. As reported in earlier research (Ishitani 2003), the family and background characteristics of first-generation college students were typically associated with characteristics that placed them at risk for attrition. For example, compared with their peers whose parents were college graduates, first-generation students were more likely to be Black or Hispanic and come from low-income families (table 1). They were less prepared academically for college as demonstrated by their   lower rates of taking higher-level mathematics courses in high school, their lower senior achievement test scores, and their lower college entrance examination scores. Although firstgeneration students had relatively lower educational expectations compared with their counterparts whose parents went to college or graduated with a bachelor's degree, three out of four first-generation students expected to attain a bachelor's degree. This high expectation, however, did not translate into a high bachelor's degree completion rate: just 24 percent of firstgeneration students attained a bachelor's degree by 2000 (figure 2). Academic preparation is associated with student persistence toward long-term degree completion. As shown in figure 3, completing only low-level mathematics courses or earning low test scores in high school decreased all students' likelihood of obtaining a bachelor's degree and increased their likelihood of leaving college without a degree. However, academic preparation did not entirely explain the differences between first-generation students and their peers in postsecondary attainment and persistence. Even among those who were considered well prepared academically (i.e., those completing calculus, pre-calculus, or trigonometry in high school or earning high scores on achievement tests), first-generation students were less likely to attain a bachelor's degree and more likely to leave college without a degree than their counterparts whose parents graduated from college. Table 2 displays students' postsecondary enrollment characteristics. Compared with the two groups of students whose parents went to college, first-generation students were less likely to begin their postsecondary education at a 4-year institution, enter college immediately after high school, and enroll full time and continuously. These enrollment characteristics may reflect firstgeneration students' relatively poor academic preparation, insufficient family and financial resources, as well as their personal goals and preferences; and have been shown in earlier research to have negative consequences for postsecondary persistence, performance, and attainment (Nu\u00f1ez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998;Terenzini et al. 1996;Warburton, Bugarin, and Nu\u00f1ez 2001).

Among those with a major, the most popular field for first-generation students was business: 14 percent chose this field as their major. Following business, the next most popular fields were health science/services and social sciences: 8 and 7 percent, respectively, of firstgeneration students majored in these areas. Business and social sciences were the two most frequently selected fields for other students as well: between 10 and 14 percent of students whose parents went to college majored in these two fields. Despite this similar pattern, the differences in the choice of majors were evident among the three comparison groups. For example, although a relatively small percentage of students major in a vocational or technical field, first-generation students were more likely to do so than their peers whose parents attended college or held bachelor's degrees (6 versus 4 and 2 percent). In contrast, students whose parents held bachelor's degrees were more likely to choose a major in science, mathematics, engineering/architecture, humanities, arts, social sciences, and journalism/communication than first-generation students. Such differences were also observed among students with bachelor's degree goals who attended 4-year colleges at any time during 1992\u22122000: first-generation students were less likely than those whose parents were college graduates to have a classified major and to choose a major field in science, mathematics, humanities, arts, and social studies in particular. Many factors are associated with a student's choice of major. For example, poor academic preparation may limit the ability of first-generation students to choose certain \"high-skill\" fields, such as mathematics and science. The perceived low-earning potential of certain fields may also deter them from entering such fields as humanities, arts, and social sciences (Montmarquette, Cannings, and Mahseredjian 2002;Nu\u00f1ez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998). Comparing degree attainment by major field revealed some obvious differences in outcomes. Regardless of their parents' education levels, students without a major or who had majored in human/protective services/vocational fields or \"other\" fields were consistently less likely than other students to earn a bachelor's degree (table 5). 6 Also, at least 81 percent of students without a major and at least 56 percent of students who had majored in \"other\" fields left college without earning any credential. Looking at the first-generation group, students with the highest rate of bachelor's degree completion included those who had majored in education/library science/social work (72 percent), social sciences/journalism/communications (67 percent), and mathematics and science (66 percent).

The difference existed at both introductory and advanced levels. Among students who took mathematics courses, first-generation students completed fewer credits in the subject than other students: an average of 8, compared with 10 to 11 credits earned by students in the two groups whose parents had attended college. This discrepancy was mainly due to the difference in credits earned in advanced mathematics courses, because no differences were detected between first-generation students and their counterparts in the number of credits earned in introductory mathematics courses. When examining mathematics coursetaking within major, 9 differences were also evident. For instance, first-generation students majoring in business, social sciences/journalism/communication, humanities/arts, health sciences/services, and human/protective services/vocational fields were all less likely than their counterparts whose parents were college graduates to take 7 The analysis in this section excluded students who earned just 10 or fewer credits during their postsecondary education. This criterion has been applied in many analyses of postsecondary transcripts (e.g., McCormick 1999;Adelman 1999Adelman , 2004aAdelman , 2004b.

This is probably due to students who took only remedial mathematics courses, which were not counted as college-level mathematics courses, students who dropped or stopped out before taking any mathematics course, or students with science majors who used advanced/AP mathematics credits earned in high school to fulfill their degree requirements for mathematics coursework in college. any mathematics courses (table 8). The gaps in advanced mathematics (both in the likelihood of taking courses and credits earned) between first-generation students and those whose parents were college graduates remained, even among those who majored in mathematics or sciences.

In addition to parents' education levels, credit completion and performance in the first year bore an important relationship with students' success in completing their bachelor's degree programs.

However, in this analysis, this finding was not observed after controlling for all other variables (table 16). The reason may be attributed to the fact that additional transcript-based coursetaking and academic performance variables were included in this analysis, which were not available to the previous studies. In addition to generation status, there were other variables that were significantly related to bachelor's degree completion but not significantly related to persistence. These variables include family income, education expectations, type of first institution, time between high school graduation and enrollment, and enrollment status. As with degree completion, after controlling for all other variables, postsecondary coursetaking and academic performance were still significantly related to students' persistence.

Earlier research indicates that first-generation students are at a disadvantage in terms of their access to, persistence through, and completion of postsecondary education. While the results from this report were consistent with those of earlier research, this study further revealed that once in college, the relative disadvantage of first-generation students continued with respect to coursetaking and academic performance. For example, first-generation students were less likely than their peers whose parents were college graduates to major in academic fields such as mathematics and science, humanities and arts, and social sciences, and were more likely to have no major or to major in vocational and technical fields. First-generation students also completed fewer credits, were less likely to take academic courses, and lagged behind their peers in academic performance. Furthermore, they needed more remedial help for college-level work and were more likely than their peers to withdraw from or repeat the courses they attempted to study. As with earlier research, this study demonstrated that first-generation status was significantly and negatively associated with lower bachelor's degree completion rates even after controlling for a wide range of interrelated factors, including students' demographic backgrounds, academic preparation, enrollment characteristics, postsecondary coursetaking, and academic performance. On the other hand, when combining degree attainment and persistence as the outcome (i.e., students either earned a credential or were still enrolled as of 2000), after controlling for the variables mentioned above, no significant differences were detected between first-generation students and their peers whose parents attended college. This result differs from those of earlier studies, which found that first-generation students were less likely than other students to persist (e.g., Nu\u00f1ez and Cuccaro-Alamin 1998;Warburton, Bugarin, and Nu\u00f1ez 2001). The change in outcomes between the earlier studies and the current study may in part be attributed to the additional postsecondary coursetaking and performance variables introduced in the current analysis.

Most items had a high response rate (i.e., above 85 percent). For these variables, it is unlikely that reported differences are biased because of missing data. Two variables that had relatively lower item response rates (below 85 percent) are the highest level of mathematics completed in high school (84 percent) and senior achievement test score in 1992 (80 percent). These two variables were used as row variables in table 1, which shows the distribution of first-generation status according to selected demographic and academic characteristics. However, a bias analysis on these two variables did not find significant differences between first-generation students and the two other groups in terms of the proportion of missing cases on these two variables. Therefore, the statements drawn from these two variables based on table 1 should not be biased due to missing data on these two items."}, {"section_title": "Differences Between Means", "text": "The descriptive comparisons were tested in this report using Student's t statistic. Differences between estimates are tested against the probability of a Type I error, 3 or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the Student's t values for the differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing (p<.05). Student's t values may be computed to test the difference between estimates with the following formula: (1) 3 A Type I error occurs when one concludes that a difference observed in a sample reflects a true difference in the population from which the sample was drawn, when no such difference is present. (3) where p is the proportion of the total group contained in the subgroup. 5 The estimates, standard errors, and correlations can all be obtained from the DAS. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of respondents in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of respondents would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests is the possibility that one can report a \"false positive\" or Type I error. In the case of a t statistic, this false positive would result when a difference measured with a particular sample showed a statistically significant difference when there is no difference in the underlying population. Statistical tests are designed to control this type of error, denoted by alpha. The alpha level of .05 selected for findings in this report indicates that a difference of a certain magnitude or larger would be produced no more than one time out of 20 when there was no actual difference in the quantities in the underlying population. When we test hypotheses that show t values below the .05 significance level, we treat this finding as rejecting the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two quantities. Failing to reject the null hypothesis (i.e., finding no difference), however, does not necessarily imply the values are the same or equivalent."}, {"section_title": "Multivariate Commonality Analysis", "text": "There are many ways for members of the public and other researchers to make use of NCES results. The most popular way is to read the written reports. (Other ways include obtaining and analyzing public use and restricted use data files. These allow researchers to carry out and publish their own secondary analyses of NCES data.) It is very important when reading NCES reports to remember that they are descriptive in nature. That is, they are limited to describing some aspect of the condition of education. These results are usefully viewed as suggesting various ideas to be further examined in light of other data, including state and local data, and in the context of the large research literature elaborating on the many factors predicting and contributing to educational achievement or to other outcome variables of interest. However, some readers are tempted to make unwarranted causal inferences from simple cross tabulations. It is never the case that a simple cross tabulation of any variable with a measure of educational achievement is conclusive proof that differences in that variable are a cause of differential educational achievement or that differences in that variable explain any other outcome variable. The old adage that \"correlation is not causation\" is a wise precaution to keep in mind when considering the results of NCES reports. Experienced researchers are aware of the design limitations of many NCES data collections. They routinely formulate multiple hypotheses that take these limitations into account and readers of this volume are encouraged to do likewise. As part of the Institute of Education Sciences, NCES has a responsibility to try to discourage misleading inferences from the data presented and to educate the public on the genuine difficulty of making valid causal inferences in a field as complex as education. Our reports are carefully worded to achieve this end. This focus on description, eschewing causal analysis, extends to multivariate analyses as well as bivariate ones. Some NCES reports go beyond presenting simple crosstabulations and present results from multiple regression equations that include many different independent (\"predictor\") variables. This can be useful to the reader, especially those without the time or training to access the data on their own. Because many of the independent variables included in descriptive reports are related to each other and to the outcome they are predicting, a multivariate approach can help users to understand their interrelation. For example, students' generation status and delayed enrollment are associated with each other and are each predictors of bachelor's degree attainment. What happens to the relationship between students' generation status and bachelor's degree attainment when delayed enrollment differences are accounted for? This question cannot be answered using bivariate techniques alone. One way of answering the question is to create three variable tabulations. This method is sometimes used in NCES reports. When the number of independent variables increases to four or more, however, the number of cases in individual cells of such a table often becomes too small to find significant differences simply because there are too few cases to achieve statistical significance. To make economical use of the many available independent variables in the same data display, other statistical methods must be used that can take multiple independent variables into account simultaneously. Multiple linear regression is often used for this purpose: to adjust for the common variation among a list of independent variables. 7 This approach is sometimes referred to as commonality analysis, 8 because it identifies lingering relationships after adjustment for \"common\" variation. This method is used simply to confirm statistically significant associations observed in the bivariate analysis while taking into account the interrelationship of the independent variables. Thus, this multiple regression approach is descriptive. Significant coefficients reported in the regression tables indicate that when the variable is deleted from (or added to) the set of independent variables, it results in a non-zero change in R-squared, which is the basis of the commonality analysis. In other words, a significant coefficient means that the independent variable has a relationship with the outcome variable that is unique, or distinct from its relationship with other independent variables in the model. Multivariate description of this sort is distinct from either a modeling approach in which an analyst attempts to identify the smallest relevant set of causal or explanatory independent variables associated with the dependent variable or variables or an approach using one of the many varieties of structural equation modeling. In contrast, a multivariate descriptive or commonality approach provides a richer understanding of the data without needing to make any kind of causal assumptions, which is why descriptive multivariate commonality analysis is often employed in NCES statistical reports. When should commonality analysis be employed? It should be used in statistical analysis reports when independent variables are correlated with both the outcome variable and with each other. This will allow the analyst to determine how much of the effect of one independent variable is due to the influence of other independent variables, since in a multiple regression procedure these effects are adjusted for. For example, since the strength of the statistical relationship between students' generation status and bachelor's degree attainment may be affected by time of enrollment, computing a multiple regression equation that contains both variables allows the analyst to determine how much if any difference in bachelor's degree attainment between first-generation students and other students is due to differences in the time of enrollment. As discussed in the section \"Data Analysis System\" above, all analyses included in PEDAR reports must be based on the DAS, which is available to the public online (http://www.nces.ed.gov/DAS). Exclusively using the DAS in this way provides readers direct access to the findings and methods used in the report so that they may replicate or expand on the estimates presented. However, the DAS does not allow users access to the raw data, which limits the range of covariation procedures that can be used. Specifically, the DAS produces correlation matrices, which can be used as input in standard statistical packages to produce least squares regression models. This means that logit or probit procedures, which are more appropriate for dichotomous dependent variables cannot be used. 9 However, empirical studies have shown that when the mean value of a dichotomous dependent variable falls between 0.25 and 0.75 (as it does in this analysis), regression and log-linear models are likely to produce similar results. 10 The independent variables analyzed in this study and subsequently included in the multivariate model were chosen based largely on earlier empirical studies (cited in the text), which showed significant associations with the key analytic variable, bachelor's degree attainment. Before conducting the study, a detailed analysis plan was reviewed by a Technical Review Panel (TRP) of experts in the field of higher education research and additional independent variables requested by the TRP were considered for inclusion. The analysis plan listed all the independent variables to be included in the study. The TRP also reviewed the preliminary results as well as the first draft of this report. The analysis plan and subsequent report were modified based on TRP comments and criticism."}, {"section_title": "Missing Data and Adjusting for Complex Sample Design", "text": "The DAS computes the correlation matrix using pairwise missing values. In regression analysis, there are several common approaches to the problem of missing data. The two simplest approaches are pairwise deletion of missing data and listwise deletion of missing data. In pairwise deletion, each correlation is calculated using all of the cases for the two relevant variables. For example, suppose you have a regression analysis that uses variables X1, X2, and X3. The regression is based on the correlation matrix between X1, X2, and X3. In pairwise deletion, the correlation between X1 and X2 is based on the nonmissing cases for X1 and X2."}]
