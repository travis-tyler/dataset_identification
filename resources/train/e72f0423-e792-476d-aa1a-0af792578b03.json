For example, the identifi cation of new tumor-suppressor genes (TSG) has important implications for both diagnosing and treating cancer. One of the ongoing efforts to identify the genes responsible for tumor formation is partial or complete sequencing of cancer genomes (reviewed in ref. 1 ) . Although this approach has revealed and will continue to reveal genes involved in tumorigenesis, there are specifi c challenges for the discovery of TSGs solely by sequence analysis of cancer genomes. First, the genomes of cancer cells are error prone (reviewed in ref. 2 ) , and thus many of the mutations found in cancer cells are not causally related to the transformed phenotype. Second, in many instances, TSGs are inactivated by transcriptional repression (commonly referred to as epigenetic silencing) rather than a mutational event, and thus would not be identifi ed by conventional genome-sequencing methods. Transcriptionally silenced TSGs bear several hallmarks, including repressive histone modifi cations and hypermethylated CpG-rich promoter regions (reviewed in ref. 3 ) .\nFunctional genomics approaches for TSG discovery are highly complementary to cancer genome sequencing efforts. Here, we describe and demonstrate a large-scale RNAi-based functional screen for TSG discovery."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A Large-Scale shRNA Screen Identifi es Candidate TSGs", "text": "To identify TSG candidates, we performed a large-scale shRNA screen for tumorigenesis in mice, which is summarized in Fig. 1A and discussed below. We used mouse NIH 3T3 fi broblasts, which are immortalized but not transformed and can be rendered tumorigenic by a wide range of oncogenic events (for examples, see refs. [4] [5] [6] [7] . We fi rst performed a reconstruction experiment to determine the minimal number of transformed NIH 3T3 cells required for tumorigenesis. To this end, 1,000, 100, or no Kras -transformed NIH 3T3 cells were added to 1 \u00d7 10 6 nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells and injected into the fl anks of nude mice. Figure 1B shows that 100 transformed NIH 3T3 cells (and likely fewer) are sufficient for detectable tumor formation.\nFor the primary screen, a genome-wide mouse shRNA library comprising 62,400 shRNAs ( 8 ) was divided into 10 pools, which were packaged into retrovirus particles and used to stably transduce NIH 3T3 cells. For each of the 10 stable cell populations, 1 \u00d7 10 6 cells were injected subcutaneously into the fl ank of a nude mouse. Thus, each of the 6,240 shRNAs in each pool was present in approximately 160 cells, which is greater than the 100 Kras -transformed NIH 3T3 cells that enabled tumor formation. We found that seven of the 10 shRNA pools gave rise to detectable tumors. After 2 weeks, tumors were dissected and genomic DNA was extracted. To identify the candidate shRNAs, the shRNA region of the transduced virus was PCR amplifi ed, cloned, and sequenced."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH ARTICLE", "text": "In total, 39 independent shRNAs were recovered from the seven tumors.\nTo validate the candidates, single shRNAs directed against each gene were stably transduced into NIH 3T3 cells to derive NIH 3T3 knockdown cell lines. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) confi rmed in all cases that expression of the target gene was decreased in the corresponding NIH 3T3 knockdown cell line ( Supplementary Fig. S1A ). We then tested the ability of the NIH 3T3 knockdown cell lines to form tumors following subcutaneous injection into nude mice. Figure 1C shows that 32 of the 39 shRNAs promoted tumor formation. We also tested the ability of the NIH 3T3 knockdown cell lines to form colonies in soft agar. As expected, knockdown of all 32 genes markedly increased anchorage-independent growth ( Supplementary Fig. S1B ).\nFor all 32 genes, a second, unrelated shRNA directed against the same target gene also promoted colony formation in soft agar ( Supplementary Fig. S1C ) and decreased the expression of the target gene ( Supplementary Fig. S1D ), ruling out off-target effects. For 17 of the genes that we analyze in greater detail below, we also tested the ability of a second, unrelated shRNA to promote tumor formation in mice. In all 17 cases, knockdown of the TSG with the second shRNA also resulted in tumor formation (Supplementary Fig. S1E ). Of the 32 candidate TSGs, unambiguous human homologs could be identifi ed in 28 cases ( Table 1 ) .

The results in Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2 show that 24 of the 28 candidate TSGs were downregulated greater than 2-fold in \u226570% of the hLSCC samples analyzed. In contrast, only fi ve candidate TSGs were downregulated greater than 2-fold in \u226570% of the lung adenocarcinoma samples ( Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Consistent with our results, eight candidate TSGs ( DAPP1 , GZMA , IGF2R , NAA38 , NME4 , NUP205 , SDF2L1 , and STK11 ) are located in the deletion peaks identifi ed in a recent hLSCC genomic characterization study ( 13 ) ."}, {"section_title": "TSG Promoter Hypermethylation in hLSCC Samples", "text": "To determine whether TSG downregulation was a result of epigenetic silencing, we analyzed promoter DNA methylation in paired primary hLSCC and normal lung squamous cell samples from 18 individuals.

We therefore hypothesized that some of the candidate TSGs might function as hLSCC tumor suppressors by repressing FGFR signaling. We fi rst asked whether repressors of FGFR signaling could be isolated in our primary screen by testing whether increased FGFR signaling would render NIH 3T3 cells tumorigenic. Figure 3A shows that NIH 3T3 cells ectopically expressing FGFR1 formed a tumor following subcutaneous injection into a nude mouse, consistent with a previous report that FGFR1 can transform NIH 3T3 cells ( 21 ) .\nWe next asked whether knockdown of each TSG (Supplementary Fig. S5A ) resulted in increased FGFR signaling. Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C) . Moreover, the level of pFRS2-Y436 in several of the SA knockdown cell lines was comparable with that observed in NCI-H520 cells, an hLSCC cell line containing amplifi ed FGFR1 ( 19 ) . Notably, the level of total FRS2 (tFRS2) in these 17 SA knockdown cell lines was not increased. Increased FGFR signaling following knockdown of these 17 TSGs was confi rmed using two alternative markers of FGFR signaling, pFRS2-Y196 and phospholipase C-\u03b3 (PLC-\u03b3; Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B); similar results were obtained with a second, unrelated shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S6C and S6D). We also analyzed a representative subset of the 17 TSGs in NIH 3T3 cells, which were used in the primary screen. In all cases analyzed, knockdown of the TSG also resulted in increased FGFR signaling (Supplementary Fig. S6E ).\nPhosphorylation of FRS2 activates the MAPK signaling pathway ( 23 ) . We therefore monitored the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) in the 24 SA knockdown cell lines. The results of Fig. 3B show that all of the 17 SA knockdown cell lines with elevated pFRS2 also had increased pERK1/2 levels. Interestingly, of the seven SA knockdown cell lines that had normal pFRS2 levels, six had increased pERK1/2 levels (IGF2R, NAA38, MAP1A, PIGH, SEMA3B, and ZNF22), indicative of FGFR-independent activation of the MAPK pathway. Consistent with our results, IGF2R ( 24, 25 ) and SEMA3B ( 26 ) are known to negatively regulate MAPK signaling through an FGFR-independent pathway.\nFor the 17 SA knockdown cell lines with elevated pFRS2, we analyzed the levels of phosphorylated and total FGFR1 (pFGFR1 and tFGFR1, respectively) to delineate the step in the FGFR signaling pathway that is repressed. The results of Fig. 3C show that seven of these SA knockdown cell lines had increased pFGFR1 and tFGFR1 levels, four had increased pFGFR1 levels but normal tFGFR1 levels, and six had normal levels of pFGFR1 and tFGFR1. For the seven TSGs that affected tFGFR1 levels, we found that in some but not all cases, shRNA-mediated knockdown increased FGFR1 mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B), compared with an empty vector control.

We therefore predicted that ectopic expression of TSGs that encode repressors of FGFR signaling would inhibit proliferation of NCI-H520 cells. We obtained cDNAs for 14 of the 17 TSGs that encode repressors of FGFR signaling and found in all cases that ectopic expression ( Supplementary Fig. S8A and S8B) reduced proliferation, as measured in a soft-agar colony formation assay ( Supplementary Fig. S8C ). As expected, the decreased colony formation resulting from ectopic expression of the TSG was counteracted by coexpression of FRS2 ( Supplementary Fig.  S8D ). Also, as expected, ectopic expression of representative TSGs in NCI-H520 cells repressed FGFR signaling, as evidenced by decreased pFRS2-Y436 levels ( Supplementary Fig.  S8E ). In contrast, ectopic expression of the TSGs in HRAStransformed SA cells, which lack FGFR1 amplifi cation and whose growth is not dependent upon FGFR signaling (see below), had no signifi cant effect on colony formation (Supplementary Fig. S8F) .\nWe also selected a representative subset of eight of these 14 TSGs and tested their ability to inhibit tumor growth in mouse xenografts. Retroviral vectors coexpressing GFP and one of eight TSGs were transduced into NCI-H520 cells, and GFP-positive cells were isolated by fl uorescence-activated cell sorting 24 hours later and injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Supplementary Fig. S8G shows that ectopic expression of all eight TSGs tested markedly suppressed tumor growth.\nNext, we asked whether knockdown of TSGs that encode repressors of FGFR signaling would transform SA cells. We fi rst tested whether increased FGFR signaling was suffi cient for the transformation of these cells. SA cells ectopically expressing FGFR1, but not empty vector, formed colonies in soft agar ( Fig. 4A ) and tumors following subcutaneous ( Fig. 4B ) . Knockdown of all 17 TSGs that encode repressors of FGFR signaling enabled SA cells to form colonies in soft agar ( Fig. 4C ) . Following knockdown, 14 of these 17 TSGs increased colony formation >5-fold and were further analyzed in a tumorigenicity assay. Notably, all 14 SA knockdown cell lines formed tumors following subcutaneous injection into nude mice ( Fig. 4D ) . As expected, pFRS2-Y436 levels were higher in all 14 tumors compared with those formed from HRAS -transformed SA cells, indicative of increased FGFR signaling (Supplementary Fig. S9A ). Comparable results were obtained with a second, unrelated shRNA targeting each TSG ( Supplementary Fig. S9B-S9D )."}, {"section_title": "Knockdown of FGFR Signaling Repressors Sensitizes HBECs to FGFR Pharmacologic Inhibition", "text": "Human cancer cell lines in which FGFR1 is amplifi ed or contains an activating mutation are sensitive to FGFR pharmacologic inhibitors ( 27 ) . We therefore hypothesized that knockdown of TSGs that encode repressors of FGFR signaling would sensitize cells to FGFR inhibitors. In these experiments, we used ponatinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that displays potent pan-FGFR inhibition at nanomolar concentrations ( 27 ) . As controls, we used HRAS -transformed SA cells, whose ponatinib sensitivity is similar to that of parental SA cells (Supplementary Fig. S10A ), as well as NCI-H520 cells, which are highly sensitive to FGFR inhibitors. In these experiments, we analyzed the 24 TSGs that were downregulated in hLSCCs, 17 of which repress FGFR signaling and the other seven of which provided important negative controls.\nThe ponatinib titration experiment of Fig. 5A and B shows that SA knockdown cell lines that have increased tFGFR1 or pFGFR1 were highly sensitive to ponatinib treatment (see also Supplementary Fig. S10B and S10C ). In fact, the ponatinib sensitivity of several of these SA knockdown cell lines was comparable with that of NCI-H520 cells. In contrast, most SA cell lines depleted of TSGs that encode FGFR1-independent FRS2 activators, or that do not affect FGFR signaling, were, in comparison, relatively ponatinib insensitive. As expected, SA cells in which FGFR1 was ectopically overexpressed were also ponatinib sensitive (Supplementary Fig. S10D ).\nPonatinib can inhibit multiple tyrosine kinases in addition to FGFR1 (see, for example, ref. 27 ). As an additional control for specifi city, we analyzed the effect of shRNA-mediated depletion of FRS2, a downstream effector of all FGFRs, in the SA knockdown cell lines. Figure 5C shows that SA knockdown cell lines with increased tFGFR1 or pFGFR1 were sensitive to FRS2 depletion (see also Supplementary Fig. S10E ). This result strongly suggests that the ponatinib sensitivity in these SA knockdown cell lines was as expected, due to inhibition of FGFR signaling. Notably, SA cell lines depleted of TSGs that encode FGFR1-independent FRS2 activators were also sensitive to FRS2 depletion. Finally, the majority of SA cell lines depleted of TSGs that do not affect FRGR signaling were, as expected, relatively insensitive to FRS2 depletion.\nThese fi ndings raise the possibility that some hLSCCs without FGFR1 amplifi cation or activating mutations may be sensitive to FGFR inhibitors. To test this possibility, we analyzed A427 cells, a human lung carcinoma cell line that lacks FGFR1 amplifi cation or activating mutations but is unexpectedly sensitive to FGFR inhibitors ( 20 ) . We fi rst analyzed the expression of the 24 TSGs that were downregulated in hLSCCs (see Fig. 2 ) and found that three-DAPP1 , MYD88 and STK11 -were substantially downregulated in A427 cells compared with SA cells ( Fig. 5D ) or an independent immortalized but not transformed HBEC cell line ( Supplementary  Fig. S11 ). We then knocked down these three TSGs in SA cells, both singly and in combination, and measured ponatinib sensitivity in a soft-agar colony formation assay. The results of Fig. 5E show that TSG knockdown resulted in increased ponatinib sensitivity, and this effect was greater with multiple compared with single knockdowns. Notably, the ponatinib sensitivity of SA cells depleted of all three TSGs was comparable with that of A427 cells. TSG knockdown also increased the proliferation rate of SA cells, and again this effect was greater with multiple compared with single knockdowns (Supplementary Fig. S12 )."}, {"section_title": "The Splicing Regulator SRSF9 Represses FGFR Signaling through the Cytoplasmic Adaptor Protein SH3BP2", "text": "One of the TSGs, SRSF9 , encodes a member of a family of RNA-binding proteins that regulate pre-mRNA splicing ( 28 ) . We were intrigued by how a splicing factor could modulate tFGFR1 levels (see Fig. 3 ) and hypothesized that SRSF9 might regulate splicing of a pre-mRNA encoding a protein involved in FGFR1 expression or stability. We therefore performed transcriptome profi ling (RNA-Seq) experiments to identify pre-mRNAs whose splicing is altered by the loss of SRSF9. Briefl y, total RNA was isolated from SA cells stably expressing an SRSF9 shRNA or nonsilencing control, and RNA samples were processed and amplifi ed followed by paired-end deep sequencing ( Fig. 6A ) . Using stringent selection criteria (see Methods), we identifi ed 10 pre-mRNAs whose splicing was signifi cantly altered in SRSF9 knockdown cells, several of which, including EIF3C ( 29, 30 ), BCL2L11 ( 31 ), and APC ( 32 ), encode proteins that have been implicated in transformationrelated activities (Supplementary Table S4 ). However, we thought that the most potentially relevant to FGFR signaling was SH3BP2 pre-mRNA, which encodes a cytoplasmic adaptor protein previously reported to interact with several tyrosine kinases, including FGFR1 ( 33 ) .\nThe RNA-Seq analysis indicated that knockdown of SRSF9 led to the exclusion of SH3BP2 exon 10. To validate the RNASeq results, we analyzed SH3BP2 pre-mRNA splicing in two independent SRSF9-knockdown SA cell lines derived using unrelated SRSF9 shRNAs. Consistent with the RNA-Seq data, the qRT-PCR results of Fig. 6B show that following SRSF9 knockdown the level of SH3BP2 exon 10 was substantially reduced, whereas total SH3BP2 mRNA levels, monitored by analysis of unaffected exons 7 and 8, were normal. Exon 10 exclusion results in a frameshift that creates a premature stop codon ( Fig. 6C ) . Accordingly, the immunoblot results of Fig. 6D show that full-length SH3BP2 protein levels were reduced in SRSF9 -knockdown SA cells. Notably, the expected truncated SH3BP2 isoform was not detected, suggesting that it was unstable. Consistent with this idea, in an ectopic expression experiment, full-length SH3BP2 could be readily detected, whereas an engineered truncated SH3BP2 protein was again undetectable (Supplementary Fig. S13A and S13B).

Conversely, ectopic expression of SH3BP2 led to reduced tFGFR1 levels ( Fig. 6F ) . Finally, the coimmunoprecipitation experiment of Fig. 6G shows, consistent with the previous report ( 33 ) , that SH3BP2 and FGFR1 are physically associated in SA cells."}, {"section_title": "P T G I S S R S F 9 S P A S T D A P P 1 F P R", "text": "3 N M E 4 P T P N 4 C D K 5 R 1 D D X 5 2 S D F 2 L 1 S P O P S T K 1 1 T X N R D 1 I G F 2 R M A P 1 A N A A 3 8 P I G H S E M A 3 B P K D 1 L 3 Z N F 2 2 N C I -H 5 2 0 A N G P T 1 F L N A G A P V D 1 M Y D\nNotably, similar to SRSF9 knockdown, knockdown of SH3BP2 promoted colony formation in soft agar ( Fig. 6H ) and tumor formation in mice ( Fig. 6I ) , strongly suggesting that SH3BP2 is the key target through which SRSF9 suppresses ( Fig. 6J ) in which SH3BP2 interacts with FGFR1, resulting in decreased FGFR1 levels. Loss of SRSF9 alters SH3BP2 premRNA splicing, leading to decreased levels of SH3BP2 and a corresponding increase in FGFR1 levels, resulting in increased FGFR signaling and transformation. Consistent with this idea, knockdown of FRS2 or treatment with ponatinib signifi cantly suppressed growth of tumors derived from SRSF9 -knockdown SA cells (Supplementary Fig. S14A-S14C ), indicating that tumor growth is dependent upon FGFR signaling. Although it is possible that mis-splicing of pre-mRNAs other than SH3BP2 may contribute to activation of FGFR signaling and transformation, our results indicate that mis-splicing of SH3BP2 premRNA is suffi cient to promote both of these activities.\nFinally, to determine the clinical relevance of these results, we analyzed the SH3BP2 splicing pattern in hLSCC patient samples. The results of Fig. 6K show that in hLSCC samples in which SRSF9 was markedly downregulated (see Fig. 2A ), there was also substantial SH3BP2 exon 10 exclusion. In contrast, the extent of SH3BP2 exon 10 exclusion was signifi cantly less in lung adenocarcinoma samples in which SRSF9 was only modestly downregulated (see Fig. 2B ). Collectively, these results reveal a strong correlation between SRSF9 downregulation and SH3BP2 exon 10 exclusion in human lung cancers."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "An RNAi-Based Mouse Tumorigenesis Screen for Identifying TSGs", "text": "Here we have described an experimental strategy for the systematic identifi cation of candidate TSGs. Analysis of the original 28 human TSG candidates using the NCBI SKY/M-FISH and CGH database (National Center for Biotechnology Information Spectral Karyotyping, Multiplex Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization and Comparative Genomic Hybridization; ref. 34 ) revealed that all the genes have been found to harbor deletions in either one or both copies in multiple cancer types (Supplementary Table S5 ). Similarly, analysis of the COSMIC (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer) database ( 35 ) revealed that all of the TSG candidates have been found to have loss of heterozygosity in one or more cancer types, six have been found to undergo homozygous deletions, and 11 have been found to be recurrently mutated in various cancers (Supplementary Table S6 ). In addition, a query of The Cancer Genome Atlas Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma project database ( 36 ) revealed that eight of the TSGs have high-frequency promoter hypermethylation in hLSCC samples (Supplementary Table S7 ). These fi ndings provide additional support for the role of these genes as clinically relevant tumor suppressors.\nSeveral of the genes we identifi ed were previously unrecognized TSGs, with well-established roles in processes other than growth suppression. For example, MYD88 is a gene best known for its role in innate immunity (reviewed in ref. 37 ) and, as described above, SRSF9 encodes a pre-mRNA splicing factor ( 28 ). Our results highlight the power of unbiased, large-scale functional screening for cancer gene discovery.\nOur screening strategy did not emphasize reaching saturation but rather sought to follow up, by directed experiments, candidate TSGs isolated in the primary screen. Our reconstruction experiment indicates that, in principle, the design of the primary screen was suffi cient to analyze all 62,400 shRNAs in the library. However, we suspect that our screen, like other large-scale shRNA screens (see, for example, ref. 38 ), did not achieve saturation for reasons including suboptimal effi cacy of some shRNAs ( 39 ) , unequal representation of shRNAs in the primary screen, and an insuffi cient depth of sequencing.\nIn addition, intrinsic limitations of the cell line used in the primary screen prevented identifi cation of all TSGs. For example, in NIH 3T3 cells, the TP53 pathway is inactivated because of biallelic deletion of the INK4A / ARF ( CDKN2A / CDKN2B ) locus. Thus, although TP53 and CDKN2A are TSGs that are frequently inactivated in a variety of cancers, including hLSCC ( 35 ), they would not have been isolated in our screen."}, {"section_title": "New hLSCC Tumor Suppressors That Repress FGFR Signaling", "text": "Following the identifi cation of candidate TSGs from the primary screen, we then carried out a series of bioinformatic, comparative expression, and functional experiments in human lung cancer samples and cell lines, which revealed that many of the genes identifi ed in the primary screen were hLSCC TSGs. We speculate that NIH 3T3 cells are particularly effective in identifying hLSCC TSGs because they are a fi broblast cell line and, as discussed above, FGFR signaling plays an important role in hLSCC development. Consistent with this idea, both NIH 3T3 cells and HBECs are transformed by the ectopic expression of FGFR1 or knockdown of FGFR signaling repressors ( Figs. 1C , 3A and 4A-D ) .\nUnexpectedly, we found that 17 of the 24 hLSCC TSGs encode repressors of FGFR signaling. For several of the TSGs, the mechanism by which FGFR signaling is repressed can be readily envisioned. For example, PTPN4, which we found inhibits FGFR1 phosphorylation, is a known tyrosine phosphatase ( 40 ) , suggesting that FGFR1 is a substrate of PTPN4. GAPVD1 has been shown to mediate ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR ( 41 ) and may similarly regulate tFGFR1. However, for most TSGs, the basis by which FGFR signaling is repressed remains to be determined, and could occur through either direct or indirect mechanisms.\nSeveral considerations allow us to conclude that the basis of transformation of HBECs following knockdown of the 17 TSGs that encode repressors of FGFR signaling is, in fact, increased FGFR signaling. First, ectopic expression of FGFR1 is suffi cient to transform HBECs ( Fig. 4B ) . Second, following knockdown of the TSG, FGFR signaling is increased ( Fig. 3B ) . Third, the transformed HBEC lines are sensitized to inhibition of FGFR signaling either by ponatinib addition ( Fig. 5A and B ) or FRS2 knockdown ( Fig. 5C ).\nAn important implication of our results is that aberrantly increased FGFR signaling may drive tumorigenesis of many hLSCCs that lack FGFR1 amplifi cation or activating mutations. Moreover, the increased FGFR signaling could render these hLSCCs sensitive to FGFR pharmacologic inhibitors, as we found in our cell culture experiments. Consistent with these ideas, a recent study analyzed a large collection of more than 500 human cancer cell lines for sensitivity to the FGFR inhibitor NVP-BGJ398, and found that 37.5% of the drugsensitive cell lines lacked genetic abnormalities in FGF and "}, {"section_title": "Functional Genomic Approaches for Identifi cation of Epigenetically Silenced TSGs", "text": "Functional genomics approaches for TSG discovery are highly complementary to cancer genome sequencing efforts. For example, a recent hLSCC genomic sequencing study ( 13 ) reported statistically recurrent mutations in 11 genes but only one of these, STK11 , was in common with the 24 TSGs identifi ed in this study.
