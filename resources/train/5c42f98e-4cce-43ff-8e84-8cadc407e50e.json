To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks and state-level changes in the number of pigs weaned along with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Flows are found to be correlated with cross correlations in outbreak time series. We illustrate when such a relationship might be expected with simulation of a simple model of farm-to-farm spread. We then use stability selection to determine that balance-sheet variables and the number of farms in a state are relevant predictors of PED burdens.

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), the causative agent, acutely infects the intestine and causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting. 2 Currently, the earliest known U.S. outbreak occurred in April, 3 and in less than a year PED outbreaks were confirmed in 27 states, 4 states that together produce 95 percent of the U.S. pig crop. 5 Farms experiencing outbreaks have suffered 90 percent and higher losses of the number of infective farms because each infected farm will submit a limited number of samples for testing. We work with the assumption that positive accessions are correlated with the number of PEDV-positive farms because data on the number of PEDV-positive farms did not become available until June 2014. These more recent data do support our assumption that positive accessions and positive farms were correlated in 2013: positive accessions and positive farms have a Spearman rank correlation of 0.74 with data from June 2014 to February 2015. 24 Although it might seem preferable to analyse the 2014 data on positive farms instead of positive accessions, the 2013 data may be more informative of transmission routes because farms protected by immunity rather than lack of exposure were most likely less frequent in 2013.\nThird, as a proxy variable for all pathways of spread involving shipment of live swine, we use estimates of swine transport flows. We define these flows as the total number of swine moved between pairs of states each year for purposes other than slaughter. These flows vary greatly in size but generally the larger ones move swine into the Midwest (Fig. 1c) . A detailed description of the data we have analysed appears in Supplementary Note 2. "}, {"section_title": "Correlation tests of pairwise relationships", "text": "As a first step in evaluating the relationship between transport flows, space, and the spread of PED, we analysed pairwise correlations. To quantify the extent to which the infections in one state were associated with those in another, we computed the cross correlation with a lag of 1 week between all pairs of states reporting cases (Fig. 1d) . The cross correlation is the correlation between the values of one time series and corresponding values in another time series shifted by some lag. Often coupling of population dynamics is measured by cross correlations with a lag of zero, which is indicative of the extent to which time series are synchronized. Here we used a lag of 1 week because we were interested in whether one time series was predictive of another, which would be suggestive of causality. As we discuss in Supplementary Note 4, it is reasonable that farms experience an outbreak within a week of being exposed.\nWe conducted one-tailed Mantel tests with a significance threshold of \u03b1 = 0.05 to determine if there were significant positive correlations between corresponding elements of matrices of cross correlations, negative geographic distances, state with shared borders, and flows. The Mantel test evaluates the significance of such an association via a permutation procedure that accounts for the intrinsic dependence among elements of distance matrices. 25 Descriptive statistics for the analysed data appear in Supplementary Note 1.\nWe found that cross correlations were positively correlated with the logarithm of transport flows. This relation held whether flows and cross correlations were treated as directional (Fig. 2a) , were averaged over both directions ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), or were ranked ( Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3 ). The p values for these correlations were all below 0.05 / 6, which means that they would remain significant after using a Bonferroni method of limiting the probability that any false positives occurred in our tests to 0.05. On the other hand, in no case would the correlations between geographic distance and cross correlations remain significant after such a correction. The correlations between an indicator variable of whether a pair of states shared borders and cross correlations were similar to or weaker than those of distance, were not significant after Bonferroni correction, and were not included in the plots to keep them simpler.\nThe correlation between flows and cross correlations seemed to be driven in part by concentration of both high cross correlations ( Fig. 1d ) and large flows (Fig. 1c) in Midwestern states. The cross correlations of these states results from the presence of a small wave of positive accessions early in the outbreak and a much larger wave toward the end of our observations (Fig. 2b, left column) . Also, Kansas and Oklahoma share a distinctive period of high positive accessions in the middle of the time series and fairly large flows ( Supplementary Fig. S4 and Fig. 2b ).\nThe flows were themselves correlated with the geographic distance between states, and these distances were in turn correlated with cross correlations (Fig. 2a) . Thus we also examined the partial correlation of flows and cross correlations, controlling for geographic distance. This partial correlation was around 0.31 whether directed or undirected relationships were used, and thus controlling for distance does not greatly diminish the correlation.\nHaving considered the significance of the correlation, we now consider its size. A Pearson correlation of 0.36 ( Fig. 2a) indicates that there is not a strong linear relationship between the logarithm of flows and cross correlations. For example, North"}, {"section_title": "4/21", "text": ". Carolina's time series did not correlate strongly with many other states in spite of North Carolina being a major source of swine for many other states ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). We next use modeling to provide us with a possible explanation for these observations and, more generally, what observations we might expect."}, {"section_title": "Simulation study of cross correlations", "text": "It may at first seem obvious that if transport of animals is associated with transmission, then cross correlations in the number of infected farms between states should increase as transport flows increase. However, the relationship may be more complicated when one considers that the flow may be partitioned among pairs of farms in different ways between different pairs of states.\nThus, to aid interpretation of the above correlation, we conducted simulations to clarify how farm-level variation within states could affect the apparent relationship between state-level flows and cross correlations.\nOur model tracked the infection status of individual farms and included the full set of relationships by which farms could infect each other. Farms were represented as nodes in a network, and the set of transmission routes as undirected edges. A pair of states was represented by partitioning the nodes into two disjoint sets.\nTo obtain a simple model of the dynamics of PED, we use a stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model in which the states of the vertices are either susceptible to infection from any of its neighbours (i.e., other vertices that share an edge with it) or infective and able to spread infection to any of its neighbours. (Full model specifications appear in Methods.)\nThe use of an SIS model is a simplification that does not include the immune state farms are likely to experience following an outbreak, in which no clinical signs are visible and farms may be less infectious. However, the eventual return to a susceptible state in our model is supported by reports 26 of farms experiencing two PED outbreaks within about one year of each other.\nSuch reinfections are to be expected because, unless controlled oral exposure or vaccines are regularly used, a farm's immunity will wane as animals that were exposed to the virus are replaced.\nIf we consider sets of vertices in each of two partitions, any edges that link vertices in each of the partitions are members of what is called the edge cut set of those partitions-removing those edges would cut off all paths between them. We refer to this set of edges as the cut set for brevity. Our study consists in calculating the cross correlation (with a lag of 1 time step) of the number of infected farms in two states with varying cut sets. The goal is to see how the cross correlation in infected farms between a pair of states depends on both data we have (the flows of swine) and data we do not have (how the flow is distributed among pairs of farms). Clearly, the total flow, size of the cut set, and the number of vertices incident to edges in the cut set are all important variables. We use three schemes to tune these variables systematically to provide insight into how they work together to determine the cross correlation between a pair of states. These schemes, fully described in Methods, cover extreme scenarios in the distribution of cut-set edges among nodes and thus allow for a wide range of possible outcomes. In brief, there is a balanced scheme in which cut-set edges are distributed evenly among all farms in both states, an unbalanced scheme in which one state has hubs which connect to all farms in the other state, and a reciprocally-unbalanced scheme in which both states have such hubs.\nAs seen in models that assume homogeneous mixing, 27 the largest cross correlations typically occur when the population of infected nodes is near critical levels necessary for subsistence and transient flare-ups in the number of infected nodes occasionally occur in one population and move to the other. In such cases, the R 0 baseline parameter (defined in Methods) is near 1, and Fig. 3a shows a decrease in the cross correlation as this parameter changes from 1 to 2. In a similar manner, intermediate values of the capacity factor, which we define as the average weight of edges between farms in two states, lead to the largest cross correlations (Fig. 3b) .\nIn contrast to the previous two variables, the cross correlation is a non-decreasing function of the number of edges in the cut set (Fig. 3c) . It seems that a certain threshold number of edges is necessary for large cross correlations to occur and that this threshold depends on the wiring scheme of the network. The controlling parameter for this threshold appears to be closely rated to the vertex connectivity of the network (Fig. 3d) . The vertex connectivity of a network may be defined as the number of vertices that must be removed to disconnect part of the network, and it has a close connection to the number of vertex-independent paths between pairs of non-adjacent vertices. 28 How do these simulations results help us interpret the results of our analyses? First, Fig. 3c clarifies that for a given transport flow, the cross correlation can vary widely depending on how many pairs of farms the flow is distributed among and the extent to which the flow is evenly distributed among those farms. Thus to expect that cross correlations should increase with flows when comparing different pairs of states we must assume that the farm-level relationships are similar in those respects. Second, Fig. 3b illustrates that that we actually can expect cross correlations to decrease with flows if the system is is a steady state with many farms infected. It not clear whether PED has reached such a steady state for any of the data we analyse, but we cannot rule out the possibility. These two points highlight some of the assumptions necessary for a straightforward interpretation of the above correlation analysis as well as for the parameters of the regression model that we later use to estimate the effects of flows on transmission rates. These assumptions are not clearly satisfied, which is one reason we conducted the next analysis of"}, {"section_title": "6/21", "text": ".

To address that limitation, we performed variable selection on a panel of candidate variables to identify those with the most robust associations with cumulative burdens of PED. Candidate variables were chosen based on availability and expected effects on either reporting rates or risk. In addition to transport-associated risk, we considered risk dependent on climate, as PEDV is an enveloped virus, and on farm density and geographic distance, as spatial clusters of infection have been reported. Table 1 Most of our predictors were correlated with other predictors as well as with the total positive accessions in each state. For such data, fitting regression models with an elastic net penalty allows groups of correlated variables to be given similar effect sizes whereas other modelling approaches, such as stepwise approaches and the use of a lasso penalty, may lead to one variable in a correlated group being singled out and being given a too-large effect size. 29 In general for elastic net regression, the weight given to the penalty determines whether any variable is selected. Often, the goal of a regression analysis is to obtain a model with good predictive performance and the weight is chosen by cross validation. 29 By contrast, we have no need of a predictive model and are instead more interested in determining what variables are important to include in a model. Stability selection 30 provides a general method of identifying relevant variables. The main idea is to select variables that across many random subsamples of the data are selected with high probability by the elastic net with a given set of weights for the penalty. This procedure is less likely to select noise variables than cross validation. 30 Further details are in Methods.\nWe considered cumulative burdens to be an appropriate response variable because many of the candidate variables were not time-varying. Also, cumulative measures of burden may be more robust measures of incidence. Using the data on positive farms available after June 2014, 24 we found the Spearman rank correlation between positive accessions and positive farms to equal 0.91, as compared to 0.74 for the weekly counts.\nWe used absolute burdens rather than prevalence as the response variable because of uncertainty in the correct denominator for calculation of prevalence. Our analysis of the positive accessions by age class, available in Supplementary Note 3, indicates that sampling of positive accessions may be highly biased toward farms with suckling pigs, which is reasonable because such farms would likely observe the most mortality in an outbreak. 31 However, we did not attempt to correct for this bias because we cannot rule out the possibility that in fact there was not bias but real increased risk to the farms with suckling pigs. Assuming that each time a trailer arrives for a pick-up there is a similar risk of infection, and that pigs typically spend about one month on sow-farms being weaned versus three months on finishing farms being fed to market weight, a sow farm of a certain size inventory would have a time-averaged risk 3-fold greater than a finishing farm of the same size inventory.\nUsing stability selection with data from 42 observations, we found that the number of farms in a state was the only variable selected as a predictor of whether it reported any positive accessions. Among the 22 states reporting positive accessions, swine inventory and marketings were selected as predictors of the total number of positive accessions. Marketings is the total number of swine shipped out of a state or slaughtered.\nBecause estimates of average pig litter size are available and PED has high mortality among newborn pigs, we considered percent decrease in pig litter size as a second cumulative burden. We fit a model for the probability that a state's decrease exceeded 2 percent, which split the decreases into two loose clusters. For this model and 42 observations, swine inventory was the only variable selected.\nIn summary, the most important predictor of whether a state had reported any positive accessions was the number of farms in the state. Among those states having positive accessions, the most important predictors of the number of accessions or the decrease in litter sizes were balance-sheet variables."}, {"section_title": "8/21", "text": "."}, {"section_title": "Regression models of effects of flows and farm density on transmission rates", "text": "A state's swine inventory was selected as a predictor of the total number of positive accessions among those states having any positive accessions and as a predictor of the percent decrease in litter size. The number of farms in a state was not selected as a predictor for these outcomes, but rather only for whether a state had any positive accessions. Thus one has some reason to doubt that the inventory variable's predictive value rested simply on its correlation with the number of farms at risk for a PED outbreak and some reason to instead consider that inventory may be correlated with the risk level of farms in a state.\nGiven that transport flows must increase with inventories, we propose that increasing flows increases risk. To more precisely state this hypothesis and obtain a rough estimate of the association of risk with flows, we fitted the case data to time series susceptible-infected-recovered models. See Methods for the derivation of these models. Among those models containing flows, undirected models, which assumed that flows increased contact rates in both source and destination states, fit best, and directed models, which assumed that flows increased contact of susceptible farms in the destination state to infective farms in the origin state, fit worst (Table 2) . However, the parameter estimates were generally similar for all of these models, with flows having an appreciable effect (Fig. 5) . Table 2 . Summary of models. The models chiefly differ by how contact is assumed to depend on flows. In the null model, denoted by none, contact was independent of flows. In the internal model, contact was a function of within-state flows. In the directed model, contact was a function of flows moving into a state and within-state flows. In the undirected model, contact was a function of within-state flows and both flows into and out of a state. The column \"Fit \u03b7?\" indicates whether we estimated the value of \u03b7, which corresponds to risk that is independent of the number of infective farms. The symbol \u03b8 denotes the dispersion parameter of the negative binomial response. The symbol \u03c3 denotes the standard deviation of the random effect of (geographic) state on transmission rates. The abbreviation d.f. is for degrees of freedom (i.e., the number of parameters estimated). \u2206AIC gives the AIC (Akaike information criteria) of a model minus the lowest AIC of all models. "}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We have estimated the effects of several features of state-level population structure on the time and location of PED outbreaks.\nWe first found that cross correlations in the time series of positive accessions became more similar as transport flows and geographical closeness increase. Simulations confirmed that such a positive association can occur when the distribution of interstate contacts is distributed among farms in the same way among different pairs of states. We then screened several candidate predictors of the cumulative burden of PED and found the relevant ones to be total number of farms and swine balance-sheet variables. We finished by fitting a model that provides a hypothesis of how the balance-sheet variables identified as relevant may be affecting transmission via their relationship with transport flows of swine.\nThe hypothesis that transportation is associated with the risk of PED transmission is not new, but our analysis does provide a new argument in support of it as well as parameters for a model of spread via transportation based on field data. From Fig. 5 we have the estimate for the directed model that one factor in the average pairwise transmission rate from farms in one area to those in another increases with the annual transport flow raised to the power of about 3.2/4.3. In general, transmission rate parameters have a strong effect on the output of models of livestock disease spread and modellers must rely on expert opinion to set them. 32, 33 Estimates such as ours may thus be key for determining what parameter values are consistent with"}, {"section_title": "10/21", "text": ". one state to another must generally be reciprocated if we suppose that the number of trucks in each state is stable over time.\nGiven a constant average shipment size, the rate of these contacts will be proportional to our undirected flows.

In summary, the directed and undirected models each imply their own mechanism of transmission, and those interested in using the parameters for later analyses should be aware of the difference between them.\nAny consumers of the parameter estimates should also consider the limitations of the analysis producing them.

This limitation may in part explain the weakness of the correlation of flows with cross correlations. At any rate, the common assumption that movements of animals to slaughter represent a dead end for disease spread may well be invalid for PED, and more data about these movements and the sharing of trailers among farms could allow for estimation of any associated risks.\nA related limitation is the coarseness and age of our flow estimates. In support of them being sufficiently informative, previous phylogeographic analysis 34 has found evidence that the same flow data we used was predictive of the movement of H1 influenza A virus among swine. This result suggests that in spite of ongoing change in the population structure of the swine estimates. 35 Of course, updated flow estimated are desirable for future modelling.\nThe main limitation of this analysis is that flows are correlated with several other variables, and we cannot rule out that these other variables are the true drivers of the observed effect of flows. We have formulated our time series SIR model based on the relationship between flows and inventory. These two variables are closely related both because more swine are moving through the farms with larger inventory and because swine often have shorter residence times on larger farms, since larger farms tend to specialise on specific production stages. But if larger farms did not experience more PED outbreaks but only reported them with higher probability, that could provide a false signal that flows are associated with risk. A phylogeographic analysis or analysis of suitably structured epidemiological data could establish an association between flows and spread of PEDV that is not subject to such confounding.\nBoth the objectives, identifying variables relevant to the risk of infection, and challenges of our data analysis, uncertain reporting rates and many correlated candidate predictors, are common in epidemiological studies. Two reasonable steps toward such an objective are to assemble as many relevant explanatory variables as possible about reporting rates and measures of exposure based on prior scientific knowledge and then to determine if the available data support the conclusion that these variables are relevant. Our general contribution has been to provide a worked-out example of how variation in the structure of the population across a large scale may lead to the formulation of candidate variables with potential relevance to mechanisms of spread or reporting. We have also demonstrated the use of stability selection and regularised regression for the task of filtering out noise variables from a set of candidates. These examples may serve to provide analysts with new ideas about how to make the most efficient use of often limited epidemiological data, hopefully leading to more rapid understanding of transmission and how to stop it."}, {"section_title": "12/21", "text": "."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The data on transport flows comes from a study by the USDA Economic Research Service, 36 Sixteen states had individual pig litter estimates, and a group average is reported for the other states.

The edge weight A i j represents the amount of infective material that vertex i may receive from vertex j and the transmission rate is the expected number of infections per unit of this infective material. In the case of livestock diseases, we might think of the edge weight as proportional to the number of animals moved from one farm to another and the transmission rate as the rate at which the probability of a farm avoiding infection decreases for a given number of animals introduced from an infective farm.\nWe set the transmission rate in terms of an R 0 baseline parameter, which we define as \u03b2 (N \u2212 1), where N is the number of vertices in the network. Thus we do not change the transmission rate as the number of edges is changed, which we find makes the results easier to interpret.\nFor simplicity, we assume infective vertices recover in one time step. To allow for highly stochastic dynamics without extinction, we assume that all vertices have some constant probability of infection from vertices outside of the simulated population. We describe this parameter in terms of the expected number of introduced infections, which is equal to the number of vertices in the network times the per-time-step probability of any one of them being infected from an external source.\nWe calculate lag-1 cross correlation using a window of 500 time steps that follows a warm-up period of 500 time steps that allowed the model to reach a stationary distribution.

The wiring schemes differ in which edges are added as we increase the size of the cut set, which is most easily described in terms of non-zero elements of the adjacency matrix of the network. We begin with a block-diagonal adjacency matrix where the blocks on the diagonal contain weights of within-partition edges and the complementary blocks contain the weights of edges in the cut set. We consider only undirected networks so a particular cut set can be described in terms of one of the cut-set blocks. In the balanced scheme, the degree distribution (i.e., the probability mass distribution for the number of neighbours of each vertex) of the two partitions is kept as balanced as possible. Thus cut-set edges are added by forming bands on the diagonal of the block of increasing width. In the unbalanced scheme, the degree distribution is kept as unbalanced as possible. Thus cut-set edges are added by filling in the cut-set block column by column. Consequently, one of the partitions contains vertices with many cut-set members incident to them, which we refer to as hubs. In the reciprocally-unbalanced scheme, cut-set edges are added by filling in columns and rows in an alternating manner. Thus hubs appear in each partition in an alternating manner.\nIn all schemes, we distribute the total weight of cut-set edges evenly among them. The total flow is set to n 2 c, where n is the size of each of the partitions and c is a tuning parameter we refer to as a capacity factor. The weight of edges outside of the cut set was fixed at 1.

Thus we chose to fit the data to a hurdle model in which the probability of a state having a confirmed case and the number of positive accessions, given that there is at least one case in the state, are described by separate regression models. We used binomial generalised linear models for the probability responses and a least-squares linear model for the response of the log of positive accessions. Predictors were put onto the same scale by dividing by standard deviations.\nThe elastic net penalty includes a tuning parameter, denoted by \u03b1, that determines the extent to which groups of correlated variables are selected together. We set \u03b1 to 0.8 to allow for highly correlated variables to be grouped for selection while still keeping the total number of selected variables small.\nThe choice \u03b1 = 0.8 was made subjectively, but we checked that the results were not sensitive to this choice by also looking at the results with \u03b1 \u2208 {0.01, 0.2, 0.5, 1}. For \u03b1 = 1, only additional balance sheet variables were selected for all models. When \u03b1 = 1, inventory and resource region 4 were selected as predictors of both litter rate decrease and total positive accessions, and no variables were selected as predictors of whether any positive accessions occurred.

For most states with large inventories, the logarithms of these two estimates were similar relative to estimates from other states, and we averaged the log-transformed estimates to generate a single estimate. For the other states, one of the estimates was negative, and we simply used the positive estimate. We suspect the negative estimates and the difference between the positive estimates stem in part from us not being able to use 2001 sales data or to account for internal supplies of and demand for breeding animals. Coarse as these estimates may be, it still seems reasonable to us that they will permit detection of large, state-level associations.\nTo fit the model, we form a linear predictor of log E(I i,t+1 ) by substituting Eq. 2 into Eq. 1 and taking logarithms to obtain log E(I i,t+1 ) = c 0 + Z i + c 1 t + c 2 log(N 2 i d i ) + c 3 log f i + \u03b1 log(\u2211 j w i, j I i,t + \u03b7)\n+ log S i,t \u2212 2 log N i .\nWe fit this model to data from all 48 contiguous states with the assumption that the observed positive accessions I i,t+1 have a negative binomial distribution with an unknown, but constant, dispersion parameter which we denote with \u03b8 . This parameter is related to the variance by Var(I i,t+1 ) = E(I i,t+1 )[1 + E(I i,t+1 )/\u03b8 ]. We assume that the random effect Z i is normally distributed.\nThen the likelihood is fully specified. We calculate marginal likelihoods with the Laplace approximation and numerically find the parameters that maximise it. In some cases we fixed \u03b7 to 0.5, which allowed the model to be fully fit with both the lme4 44 and glmmADMB 45 packages in R. 46 To make sure our results were not sensitive to \u03b7 = 0.5, we used R's optimise function to"}, {"section_title": "16/21", "text": ".
