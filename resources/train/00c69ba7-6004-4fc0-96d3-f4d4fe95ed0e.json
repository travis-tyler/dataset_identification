Data on plans to stay in the United States are collected by the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). A \"plan to stay\" means that a student intends to remain in the United States after graduation and a \"firm plan to stay\" means that a student has accepted a definite offer of a postdoctoral appointment or employment in the United States. The number of foreign doctoral recipients with firm plans to stay in the United States is a good indicator of those who actually stay 2 and is referred to in this report as a \"stay rate.\" Summary tables used for this analysis (combining all countries from the three regions) are provided in Appendix A.  1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Foreign S&E doctoral recipients"}, {"section_title": "With plans to stay", "text": "With firm plans to stay "}, {"section_title": "FOREIGN DOCTORAL RECIPIENTS WITH PLANS TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES", "text": "In the last decade, the number of students from countries of Europe, Asia, and North America earning S&E doctoral degrees at U.S. institutions has been increasing faster than the overall number of S&E doctoral degrees awarded by U.S. institutions. The number of S&E doctoral degrees earned in the United States by students from these regions increased from 2,400 in 1985 to over 8,000 in 1996, an average annual growth rate of 11.6 percent. During the same period, the total number of S&E doctoral degrees earned in the United States increased from 18,000 to 27,000, representing an annual increase of 3.4 percent 3 (table  A- 1). Paralleling the increase in the number of S&E doctoral recipients from these three regions is an increase in those who plan to remain in the United States after receiving their degrees (figure 1). Between 1988-96, students from the major countries of Asia, Europe, and North America earned more than 55,000 S&E doctoral degrees at U.S. institutions. During 3 The average annual increase in the number of degrees awarded to U.S. citizens was 1.8 percent.

About 39 percent of foreign doctoral recipients had firm plans to remain in the United States (table 1). To be counted as having \"firm plans\" to remain, the respondent had to give the name and address of his or her prospective employer. The number of foreign doctoral recipients from Asia is five times higher than the number from Europe. In addition, students from the Asian region have a higher planned stay rate than those from Europe and North America. Plans to stay in the United States, however, differ widely by country.\nThe decision to accept postdoctoral study is, not surprisingly, greatest in fields in which such further study is a common career path. More than half of all foreign students earning doctoral degrees in the biological sciences plan to remain in the United States for postdoctoral study, whereas only 5 percent report firm job offers (figure 8). In contrast, only 7 percent of computer science majors plan to remain for postdoctoral study, whereas more than 38 percent had employment offers. Those earning Ph.D.s in mathematics also seemed to be in high demand in the United States; most of their employment offers came from universities. As stated earlier, the majority of U.S. employment offers received by foreign S&E doctoral recipients were from industry; a smaller proportion receives offers from educational institutions. Industry provided the highest numbers of job offers to foreign graduate students majoring in engineering (3,256), physical sciences (713), and computer sciences (591). The highest number of job offers made by educational institutions went to students majoring in psychology and social sciences (1,213), engineering (815), and mathematics (620) (table A-9). National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Studies, Survey of Earned Doctorates, special tabulations, and table A-8. The majority of foreign students who earned S&E doctorates from U.S. institutions during 1988-96 planned to locate in the United States, and almost 40 percent reported firm plans for further study or employment. Most of those with firm plans had offers of postdoctoral appointments. The remaining students (17 percent of all foreign S&E doctoral students) had employment offers, mostly from industry. The primary work activity identified in these offers from industry is research and development. Industry was more likely to make offers to new foreign Ph.D.s who majored in engineering, the physical sciences, and computer science than to those who majored in other fields. Stay rates for foreign students are not static. They are influenced by U.S. immigration policy, the number and quality of job opportunities in the home countries of the students, and political change. The stay rate of foreign doctoral recipients should be closely monitored because it has implications for the U.S. economy and the SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS concentration of scientists and engineers in the United States as well as on the economies of the nations these students come from. For example, in the 1990s, the number of South Korean and Taiwanese S&E doctoral recipients reporting plans to remain in the United States declined because the economies of South Korea and Taiwan increased those countries' capacities to absorb the majority of the U.S.-trained doctoral scientists and engineers. Whether this trend continues following the Asian economic crisis of 1998 should be monitored. Because China is now the main country of origin of foreign S&E doctoral recipients in the United States, the trend toward increasing stay rates in the 1990s should be followed to see whether it is temporary. Should China succeed in implementing economic reforms that rely heavily on scientific and technological progress, the demand for high-level specialized personnel and the number of new Ph.D.s returning to China may increase substantially.         : 1975, 1980, 1985-96 .....................................................................................                                       1.5 3.9 10.0 0.0 0.0 1.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.9 1.7 7.7 0.0 0.0 See explanatory information, if any, and SOURCE at end of table.                                         7.7 9.9 12.5 9.0 7.              : 1975, 1980, 1985-96 Page 1 of 2 1980 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Item 1975Item 1980Item 1986Item 1987Item 1988Item 1989Item 1990Item 1991Item 1992Item 1993Item 1994Item 1995Item 1996 Number   : 1975, 1980, 1985-96 Page 1 of 1975 1980 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1993 1994 1995 1996 Item 1975Item 1980Item 1985Item 1986Item 1987Item 1988Item 1989Item 1990Item 1991Item 1992Item 1994Item 1995Item 1996 Number   : 1975, 1980, 1985-96 : 1975, 1980, 1985-96 -96 Page 1 of Item 1975 1 This table includes all citizens of Eastern European countries who indicated a visa status (permanent or temporary visa).

Between 1988-96, a large majority of doctoral recipients from China and India planned to remain in the United States for further study and employment. During this period, about 80 percent of the approximately 25,000 Indian and Chinese S&E doctoral recipients planned to remain in the United States, and about half reported accepting firm offers to do so (figure 2 and table A-2). The high stay rate of Chinese students is largely attributable to the enactment (after the student demonstrations in Tiananmen Square) of the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992, granting permanent U.S. residence status to most of the students. In contrast to the high stay rates for Indian and Chinese doctoral students, only 23 percent of doctoral recipients from South Korea and 28 percent from Taiwan reported accepting firm offers to remain in the United States (table A-2). Planned stay rates for the whole period 1988-96, however, mask differences over time for several countries. The trend in the 1990s has been for fewer doctoral recipients from South Korea and Taiwan to National Science Foundation, Division of Science Resources Studies, Survey of Earned Doctorates, special tabulations, and  Figure 2. Number and percent of foreign S&E doctoral recipients with plans to stay in the U. S., by country of origin remain in the United States because of improved employment opportunities in their home countries. This is particularly true of South Korean engineering doctoral recipients. 4 However, these trends could change because of deteriorating financial conditions in Asia in 1998. For other countries, notably China, the number of doctoral recipients with firm plans to stay has increased in the 1990s (figure 3). Before 1988, about half of the foreign students who earned S&E doctoral degrees at U.S. universities planned to locate in the United States after completing their degrees. In the 1990s, however, the proportion with plans to remain in the United States increased to more than 60 percent. 5 Although the increase in the stay rate of Chinese students is largely responsible for the jump in the overall rate of those planning to stay, students from other countries are also contributing to the growing number of those who plan to stay. Undoubtedly, the increase-particularly after 1993is a reflection of rising employment opportunities made possible by a strong U.S. economy (figure 4). Information on initial plans to stay in the United States (collected by the SED at the time of graduation) is corroborated by the findings of a recent study of foreign doctoral recipients working and earning wages in the United States. 6 According to this study, the majority of 1990-91 doctoral recipients from India (79 percent) and China (88 percent) were still working in the United States in 1995. In contrast, only 11 percent of South Koreans who earned S&E doctorates from U.S. universities in 1990-91 were working in the United States in 1995."}, {"section_title": "EUROPE", "text": "The number of European students who completed U.S. doctoral programs between 1988 and 1996 (8,700) is small compared to the number of Asian students who completed U.S. doctoral programs during the same time frame (43,171), even when all Western and Eastern European countries are combined and compared to only four Asian countries.

The United Kingdom and Greece traditionally have been the major countries of origin of European doctoral students in the United States. In recent years, Germany has joined this group. Relatively few French or Italian students come to the United States for doctoral training compared to the number from other European countries, and relatively few of those plan to remain after completing their degrees (table A-2). However, new Ph.D.s from France have come to the United States temporarily for postdoctoral appointments. In 1995, there were twice as many French postdoctorates (271) as there were French doctoral students (132) in the United States. 7 NORTH AMERICA Within North America, Canada has sent far more S&E doctoral students to U.S. universities than did Mexico. In addition, the number of Canadian students who have earned S&E doctoral degrees in the United States-although smaller than the number from individual Asian countries-is higher than the number from individual European countries. More than half of these doctoral recipients planned to locate in the United States, and 43 percent reported firm offers for further study or work in the United States. Mexico sent relatively few students to U.S. doctoral programs, and a relatively small percentage (similar to that of South Korea) planned to stay in the United States (table A-2). 7 See Damien Terouanne, \"Presence Francaise en Science et en Ingenierie Aux Etats-Unis: Cerveaux en fuite ou en voyage?\", a joint project between NSF and the French National Committee for Scientific Research (known by its French abbreviation, CNRS), published by CNRS Washington, 1997.  1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Plans to stay From 1988-96, U.S. institutions awarded 55,000 S&E doctoral degrees to persons from the countries covered in this report. Of those students, 39 percent reported firm work or study offers in the United States at the time the SED was conducted (table A-2). Two types of offers were reported: (1) temporary (usually 1-2 years) postdoctoral appointments, and (2) offers of employment positions in industry and other sectors."}, {"section_title": "POSTDOCTORAL APPOINTMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES", "text": "More than half of the students with firm offers reported they were planning to take postdoctoral appointments. This was 22 percent-or 12,000 studentsof all 1988-96 foreign doctoral recipients in S&E fields (figure 5).

Of this group, about 7,000 were from Asia, 1,700 were European, and 600 were from North America. Most of these job offers consisted of employment in research and development (figure 5). Only 3 percent of foreign S&E doctoral recipients receive a firm teaching offer directly after completing their degree. The percentage of teaching offers was somewhat higher (8 percent) for students from the United Kingdom (table A-5). The primary postgraduation activity reported by foreign doctoral students with firm plans to remain in the United States also differed by country of origin. A large majority of Chinese students received offers of postdoctoral  appointments, probably because the majority earn degrees in the natural sciences, fields in which postdoctoral experiences are common. During the period 1988-96, more than 5,000 Chinese doctoral recipients received postdoctoral appointments (table A-5). In contrast, Indian students were more likely to report permanent employment offers in the United States than postdoctoral appointments. Almost onethird of all S&E doctoral students from India reported receiving firm employment offers in the United States before completing their studies. The relatively low stay rates of S&E doctoral recipients from Taiwan and South Korea might be explained in part by those countries' dynamic economies. From 1988-96, these countries were successful in attracting their students to return home. Only a small fraction of Korean doctoral recipients (6 percent) reported firm plans for U.S. employment. Most Koreans who planned to remain in the United States received offers of temporary postdoctoral appointments. Taiwanese and European students were evenly divided between accepting postdoctoral appointments and employment in the United States."}, {"section_title": "TYPE OF EMPLOYER", "text": "Industry is the largest employer of foreign S&E doctoral recipients with firm job offers in the United States. Of the almost 10,000 foreign S&E doctoral recipients from 1988-96 who reported firm offers to work in the United States (representing 17 percent of total S&E foreign doctoral recipients), more than half (10 percent of the total) received offers from industry (figure 6). Again, there are differences by country and field. For example, 20 percent of doctoral recipients from India reported receiving firm offers of employment from U.S. industrial firms, nearly-or more than-double the percentages for the other countries covered in this report (table A-6). Although Korea and Taiwan send more students than India to the United States for graduate study in S&E, the percentages of their students receiving firm job offers from U.S. industry are much lower-2.3 percent and 9.8 percent, respectively-than India's. About 6 percent of the 1988-96 foreign S&E doctoral recipients received academic research or teaching offers from U.S. educational institutions (table A-6). Again, there are differences by country. China and India had the highest absolute numbers of students with these offers (874 and 744, respectively), but the United Kingdom had by far the highest percentage of students with these offers (15.7 percent)."}, {"section_title": "FIELD OF SCIENCE", "text": "The stay rates of foreign doctoral recipients also vary by S&E field.
