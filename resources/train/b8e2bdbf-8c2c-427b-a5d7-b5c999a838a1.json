Currently, historical data spanning 160 years are used in estimating the return period of hurricane events. But by combining this historical data with paleotempestological data which extend further back to the later part of the Holocene, a return period estimation technique is created that reveals longer trends in the Caribbean. A combination of the return period estimation with vulnerability and hazard assessment then culminates in a comprehensive risk assessment model for the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua presented in a spatial format using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. This is a multi-criteria composite model that can be applied in planning and policy formulation by decision makers in the region. Quantifying risk and vulnerability and their spatial representation is helpful to resource managers and communities in predicting and preparing for future loss. A clear spatial representation of a risk model is beneficial to communities and resource managers who seek to prepare for longer-term mitigation and hazard reduction at the local level."}, {"section_title": "The Project", "text": "This project is funded by the Inter American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI) under the CRN2050: Paleotempestology of the Caribbean region: a multi-proxy, multi-site study of the spatial and temporal variability of Caribbean hurricane activity.

They are the costliest natural catastrophe in the US as well as other countries (Elsner and Kara, 1999). In the United States, the normalized average economic damage from hurricanes was $10 billion each year between 1900 AD and 2005 AD (Pielke et al., 2008). With rising sea levels, the threat they pose to coastal areas increases exponentially (Lam et al., 2009). Hurricane variability is important for economic considerations including insurance and other policy decisions . These fluctuations in hurricane activity are also of obvious importance to society, especially as populations of afflicted coastal areas increase year to year. A majority of the Caribbean population lives within 1.5 km from the coast (Mimura et al., 2007), which makes it vulnerable to hurricanes. With increased land loss from sea level rise and increase in storm intensity as a consequence of global warming (Emanuel, 2005), Caribbean countries are further exposed to the threat of hurricanes. They are heavily dependent on tourism, and because of limited resources, they rely on external trade for most of their needs. This dependence, coupled with weak political and economic infrastructure, worsens their vulnerability to natural disasters (Briguglio, 1995).\nThe Dominican Republic lies in the zone of moderate activity for hurricanes (Pielke et al., 2003). By virtue of being on an island, it is susceptible to hurricane strikes from three sides. The coastal population of the Dominican Republic is extremely vulnerable to Hurricanes as almost 56% of the total population lives in the coastal provinces (La Oficina Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, 2010). The country has a high poverty rate of 42.2% (CIA, 2010) and a low level of access to medical facilities due to lack of roads and personal vehicles. Additionally, one of the biggest sectors in terms of GDP in the Dominican Republic is tourism (CIA, 2010); since most of the tourism is in the coastal areas, the nation's economy is also vulnerable to hurricanes which can disrupt tourism. Even though the recent devastating earthquake in Haiti did not affect the Dominican Republic directly, lying on the cusp of three tectonic plates, the Dominican Republic is also prone to earthquakes and tsunamis. While earthquakes are rarer events that cannot be predicted with accuracy, hurricanes on the other hands are of more immediate concern to the Dominican Republic."}, {"section_title": "Hurricanes and Paleotempestology", "text": "Paleotempestology is defined as the study of past storm activities. Using paleotempestological techniques, identification of extreme storm events such as hurricanes is possible by studying sedimentary or erosional evidence left by wave and wind action associated with these events (Nott, 2004;Donnelly et al., 2001aDonnelly et al., , 2001bFearn, 1993, 2000;Liu, 2004Liu, , 2007. These evidences or signatures left behind by storms are then dated to form a chronology of past events which helps in understanding past trends and variability in storm activity. It is noted that mainly events of great magnitude and intensity (Category 3-5) leave a signature in the sedimentary record (Nott, 2003), but weaker storms (Category 1 and 2) can also leave a record if a site is very sensitive (Liu, 2004). Paleo records of sand layers are generally available for the later part of the Holocene when the marine transgression slowed (Nott, 2004;Liu, 2004); prior to this the rising sea levels erased the records. The paleo time frame is thus limited to the last 5,000 years in most cases (Frappier et al., 2007b), but longer records have been found in some locations."}, {"section_title": "Risk Analysis and Prediction Using Paleotempestology", "text": "Most risk assessment studies consider available historical data that go back at most a few centuries in estimating the return period of an extreme event. While recent data are more accurate and provide a better modern analog, this may not be sufficient to demonstrate changes in trends that are apparent in data sets spanning the prehistoric time frame (Nott, 2003). Predicting future events based on a relatively short time period excludes all possible events that may occur within a longer \"hazard regime\" (Nott, 2003).\nRisk assessment quantifies the level of exposure a society faces to a given hazard (Cutter et al., 2003). Risk combines the likelihood of an event occurring with the impact this event may have on the people and their environment. Thus the three components of risk are: a. Probability of occurrence: is the likelihood of a hazard event happening; a part of risk assessment is the quantification and estimation of that likelihood (Cutter, 2003). Based on the \"probability of event\" calculations, yearly potential of occurrence determining the level of impact can be predicted for the future (Cutter et al., 2003;Nott, 2003;Nott, 2004). b. Hazard: are defined as \"a threat to people and the things they value\" (Cutter et al., 2003). In this study the hazard is identified as hurricanes (and associated storm surge and winds). c. Vulnerability: is the susceptibility of people or systems to be exposed to and harmed by a hazard."}, {"section_title": "Study Areas", "text": "The Caribbean region has an extremely low tidal range such that the surge height is almost entirely due to the physical parameters of the event itself (Donnelly, 2005). Sea level change in the Caribbean has been studied and well documented (Digerfeldt and Hendry, 1987;Milne et al. 2005;Toscano and MacIntyre, 2003) and can be used for calibration of overwash deposits from historic storm surges. The two countries -Dominican Republic and Nicaragua -were chosen to provide a contrast between the vulnerability to hurricanes based on a range of characteristics including: i. The Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua, which consist of the Regi\u00f3n Aut\u00f3noma del Atl\u00e1ntico Norte (RAAN) and Regi\u00f3n Aut\u00f3noma del Atl\u00e1ntico Sur (RAAS), has a diverse ethnicity including Creoles, Miskitos, Ladinos, Sumu, Gar\u00edfuna, Chinese, and Rama. The Dominican Republic on the other hand has a relatively more homogenous population consisting of mixed race, whites, and blacks. ii. Nicaragua's government is located in Managua, which is on the western side of the continental interior and is not affected by hurricanes. Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, is a coastal city and impacted by coastal risks. iii. Nicaragua is developed than the Dominican Republic. iv. The Caribbean coast of northern Nicaragua is a vast plain with low relief, susceptible to storm inundation. The Dominican Republic coastline in contrast has diverse topography and greater relief."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions", "text": "This study aims to answer the following questions: 1. How does forecasting of future storm probability based on historic and prehistoric proxy data differ from forecasting based solely on historic data? 2. Based on historic and prehistoric data, how is probability of strike, vulnerability, and risk distributed spatially for the Dominican Republic and RAAN in Nicaragua?\nThe primary goal of this study was to analyze signatures left in coastal lakes by past hurricanes and to utilize that information in determining the likelihood of future hurricane strikes. This was closely followed by the task to provide a comprehensive view of the risk for coastal populations in the study areas. The two research questions corresponding to the above are: 1. How does forecasting of future storm probability based on historic and prehistoric proxy data differ from forecasting based solely on historic data? Traditional forecasting of future hurricanes is based on historic data collected since 1851 AD (CSC, 2010). While this data capture decadal changes, longer-term hazard regimes are not apparent. The prehistoric hurricane strike data presented in this study can be used to refine estimates of future probabilities. In one example from the Dominican Republic, based on historical data, the likelihood of a hurricane strike for Pedernales province was 2.5 % (Table   5.1). However, after combining with prehistoric records, the distribution suggests a considerably lower strike probability of 0.2% thus reducing the long-term risk for the province. Similarly, in another example, the province of El Seibo in the Dominican Republic, which has a 1.25 % strike probability based on historical records, sees a decrease in the likelihood of hurricane strike to 0.2% when prehistoric records are factored in (Table 5.1). Conversely, in an example from RAAN, Nicaragua, the likelihood of hurricane strike for Prinzapolka is 0.0 but when prehistoric records are considered, Poisson probability of strike increases to 0.0012 or 0.12% (Table 7.2). A core obtained from Puerto Isabel, PIL 2 ( Figure 6.26), is the longest and the oldest core in this study. This core shows alternating activity regimes: 0 -925 cal yr BP (active); 925-3,350 cal yr BP (quiet); 3,350 cal yr BP -3,750 cal yr BP (active); and then from 3,750 cal yr BP -7,455 cal yr BP (quiet). In the period before 7,455 cal yr BP, no activity was recorded. These results are consistent with a similar study from the southern Mosquito Coast which reports an active period in the last millennium preceded by a quiet period from 1,000 cal yr BP to 3, 000 cal yr BP (McCloskey, 2009). The Poisson probability of strike of a hurricane is calculated within a jurisdictional boundary based on historic and prehistoric landfall data. The shortcoming of this method is that jurisdictions such as provinces and municipalities with longer coastlines will have more strikes and thus lower return periods than those that have a shorter coastline. Secondly, if a hurricane strike is close to the border between two counties, the strike location will be counted in one county even though the neighboring county might have been equally affected. Based on the chronology established by radiocarbon dating and grain size analysis, the western part of the Dominican Republic has seen at least 3 storms that have left records in the last 3,460 years and the eastern part has seen at least 5 in the last 2,330 years. The available data indicate a Poisson probability of 0.14% for the western and 0.2% for the eastern part. These probabilities are much less than the ones estimated based on historical records, i.e. at least 10% for the Dominican Republic (Pielke et al., 2003). RAAN, Nicaragua, shows a similar gap between the probability calculated from historical records and those from prehistoric records. All coring locations selected in RAAN, Nicaragua had indication of multiple hurricane events dated until 7,455 BP. In case of Dakura, when the prehistoric data are added, the Poisson probability is 0.4% which is again much less than the range estimated by using only historical records which is 1% to 5% (Pielke et al., 2003). The wide gap between historic and prehistoric probability estimates for the two case studies are due to the following: 1. The probability based on the historical records is calculated for the regions based on latitudes, whereas this study focuses narrowly on the Dominican Republic and RAAN in Nicaragua. 2. This may be a reflection of the varying sensitivity of the coring sites. Selected sites may not have recorded all the storms that have occurred in the past. 3. Limited coring of coastal sites further reduces the chance of capturing all the hurricanes to have made landfall in this area. These variations might lead one to question the utility of using paleo-hurricane records to understand future likelihood of hurricane strikes. But the intent of this study is not to substitute but rather supplement historic records in that a complete story is told."}, {"section_title": "Document Structure", "text": "This dissertation aims to better understand the risk and vulnerability of this region by studying the spatial and temporal dimensions of hurricane hazard.

Often more than one technique is used to validate findings. Two examples of the proxies are briefly described below: a. Palynology or Pollen Analysis Pollen grains are highly resistant and do not decay over thousands of years. This makes them excellent markers for climatic and vegetative reconstructions. Vegetation response to changes in climate, a major event (like a hurricane), or any other stressor can be recorded by the pollen that has been preserved in lake sediment and can be studied. Paleoclimatic studies are done by using pollen of a few indicator species that are limited by certain climatic conditions e.g., salinity, temperature, or humidity (Birks, 1993). Presence of pollen from species that can tolerate higher salt levels just above a sand layer indicates an overwash from a hurricane that brought in ocean water (Liu, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "b. Dinoflagellates", "text": "Dinoflagellates are unicellular microorganisms that are found in marine environments. During a part of their life cycle, they are in a vegetative state in the form of a \"cyst\" (Sluijs et al., 2005). These cysts have a calcareous or siliceous covering which is not easily destroyed (Sluijs et al., 2005). The presence of these dinoflagellates or their fossilized cysts in the sand layers indicates intrusion of sea water into a mostly freshwater environment of the coastal lake and thus the sand layer can be inferred to be of marine origin (Liu et al., 2008). Another recent addition to the ever expanding science of paleotempestology is to finding evidence of fires in the form of charcoal particles. A recent study by Liu et al. (2008) in the Gulf Coast of Alabama shows that there is a higher probability of fires occurring after a hurricane as trees are uprooted and limbs broken, providing ready fuel for a fire to breakout. Thus the presence of charcoal particles in the sediment indicates the occurrence of a fire following a hurricane (Liu, 2007;Liu et al., 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Hurricane Overwash", "text": "One of the most useful proxies in paleotempestology is the identification and interpretation of extreme storm events such as hurricanes by studying sedimentary or erosional evidence left by wave and wind action associated with these events (Nott, 2004;Donnelly et al., 2001aDonnelly et al., , 2001bLiu, 2004Liu, , 2007Liu and Fearn, 1993).  (Liu, 2007). During a hurricane, intense winds and storm surge transport material inland from marine sources and sandy barriers such as beaches and dunes (Figure 2.1). Coastal lakes and lagoons behind these barriers register the overwash events as a layer of clastic material deposited in a lacustrine environment. Each of these layers is considered a possible signature of a storm event. Utilizing paleotempestological dating techniques, origin and the chronology of the event record can be determined. The thickness of the sand layer combined with the spatial extent of sand towards the middle of the lake (signifying the distance of transport) could be indicative of the storm intensity (Liu and Fearn, 1993, 2000a, 2000bDonnelly et al., 2004). Estimation of storm return periods and of future strike probability can be arrived at by identifying and dating these sand layers. In addition to paleo-records, it is important to calibrate results based on modern analogs (i.e., comparing signatures left by known hurricane events) (Liu, 2004). Modern analogs help in the understanding of the conditions of the site and the strength of hurricanes that can leave a signature at that location."}, {"section_title": "Dating", "text": "Various dating techniques are used in determining the age and chronology of overwash events. The main ones are: Radiocarbon ( 14 C) dating of sediments older than 200 years (Liu, 2004); Cesium -137 ( 137 Cs) dating is useful in dating sediments deposited in last ~50 years (Ritchie and McHenry, 1990); and Lead -210( 210 Pb) dating which is useful in dating sediment deposited in the last 110-130 years (Donnelly et al., 2001a)."}, {"section_title": "Reservoir Effect", "text": "When carbonate samples of marine origins are dated, sometimes they are considerably older than expected due to a phenomenon called the \"reservoir effect\" (Dix et al., 1999). Deep waters are depleted in 14 C due to radioactive decay since they are not as effectively mixed as surface waters. The inorganic carbonate in these waters exhibits an older radiocarbon date. When these carbonates are used by organisms in their shells, the shells are effectively \"older.\" This effect is different for different seas based on the rate of depletion of 14 C (Mangerud, 1972). A database called the Marine Reservoir Effect Database provides the correction values for different areas on the Earth (http://intcal.qub.ac.uk/marine/index.html?ORDERBY=C14age%20asc)."}, {"section_title": "Why Don't All Storms Leave a Signature?", "text": "There are various factors that determine whether a storm will leave a marker. Two main factors are: (a) the relative height of the surge that transports the material for the storm marker and (b) paleotempestological sensitivity of the lake that records the storm."}, {"section_title": "Relative Height of the Storm Surge", "text": "The distance and the quantity of transported sand depend primarily on the height of storm surge in relation to the height of the beach barrier (Morton and Sallenger, 2003). The height of the surge is a consequence of the strength/intensity of the storm as well as the geomorphology of the coastline (Morton and Sallenger, 2003;Liu, 2004). Another factor that influences the surge height is the tidal influence during landfall (Liu, 2004). In this case, the Caribbean coast is micro-tidal in nature, thus astronomical tides have a negligent effect on the surge height (Donnelly, 2005). A hurricane track's direction as well as the position of the eye in reference to the coastline is one of the factors that determine the amount of water pushed against the coast and the height of the surge (Fletcher et al., 1995). Hurricanes have an anti-clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere and therefore the water pileup is the maximum on the right side of the eye wall (Liu, 2004). However this is true only if the hurricane hits the coast at a perpendicular angle. If the track is not perpendicular then the surge height will differ based on the angle of the hurricane track in relation to the coastline. Other characteristics of the hurricanes such as wind speed, central pressure, as well as the speed of the hurricane itself will also determine the surge height (Stone et al., 2005). Liu (2004) warns that the height of the surge (and the possibility of finding a sand deposit) may not always be a function of the intensity of the storm. For example, right after a barrier has been breached or eroded by a major storm, the sensitivity of the lake will be higher and even a small storm can leave a signature (Liu, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Paleotempestological Sensitivity of the Lake", "text": "Paleotempestological sensitivity of a lake is defined as \"the minimum intensity of a hurricane whose impacts will be recorded in the sediments of the lake\" (Liu, 2004). This sensitivity is determined by the height of the barrier in front of the lake and the distance of the lake from the sea. The height of the barrier determines the relative surge height. Barriers that have been washed away or eroded can take decades to centuries to re-establish (Leatherman, 1983). The return period of storms will determine how fast and high the barrier can grow (Ritchie and Penland, 1990). Relative sea level rise (RSL) can change the distance of the lake from the sea and thus affect the paleotempestological sensitivity of the lake. For example, a sand record left by a major storm while the sea stand is low (and the lake is farther from the coast), may be the same thickness as the one left by a smaller hurricane when the sea level is higher (and the lake is closer to the coast). However, since the distance from the shoreline should also change the environmental characteristic of the lake by changing its salinity and organic content, this would potentially reflect in the loss-on-ignition analysis and fossil content of the cores extracted from the lake site (Liu, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Change", "text": "The most recent low stand in the eustatic history of sea level change was ~18,000 BP, a time which coincides with the Last Glacial Maximum. Sea level was shown to be as much as 150 m below the present level (Douglas et al., 2001). A study done in Barbados found the sea level to be 121 +/-5 m below present level (Fairbanks, 1989). In the Holocene period ice began to melt and the sea level rose rapidly until about 6,000 BP; from then on, this rise was fairly constant (Douglas et. al., 2001;Toscano and Macintyre, 2003). There are two mechanisms that supply us with \"markers\" for measuring sea level change. a. Transgressive phase is relative sea level rise (Roy, et al., 1997). As transgression continues, the barrier islands begin retreating landward and start losing their sediment supply. Eventually, they become submerged shoals and then disappear. Radiocarbon dating of barrier sand sediment has provided data on sea level change. b. Regressive phase is when the sea level falls and the coast \"progrades\" towards the sea (in theory). This, in turn, creates beach ridges and peat marshes that can be used for radiocarbon dating (Douglas et al., 2001). The regressive phase is responsible for the formation of shoreline features that can date back to the last glacial age. In general, Holocene sea levels can be inferred from geologic features such as ridges and other relict geologic forms. Radiocarbon dating is used to corroborate such evidence. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are used to get accurate readings of the elevations (Tornquist, et al., 2006). But dating obtained from peat has many problems; mainly, that over time it collapses under its own weight and thus cannot be stratified according to age (Douglas et al., 2001). However, this problem can be solved by using only the basal peat that forms the contact layer with the upland surface (Douglas et al., 2001)."}, {"section_title": "Caribbean Sea Level Change", "text": "By studying mangrove peat and salinity of the sediment, Holocene sea level changes were determined. Change in salinity changed the vegetation composition and was one of the factors for distribution of mangroves species (Torrescano and Islebe, 2006). Calibrating these results with sea level studies done earlier (Fairbanks, 1989) further confirmed the changes in sea level in the Caribbean basin.  (Toscano and Macintyre, 2003). No specific study exists for the study areas presented in this dissertation, i.e., the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, but the two countries are part of the Caribbean plate and the basin is believed to have a homogeneous sea level curve without much local/isostatic influences. A comprehensive sea level curve for the south-western Atlantic and the Caribbean based on red mangrove peat (Rhizophora mangle) and coral (Acropora palmata) data (Toscano and Macintyre, 2003) is presented in Figure 2.2. This curve shows a rapid sea level rise of 5.2 mm/yr in the early part of Holocene (10,000-7,000 BP) which then slowed down to 0.93 mm/yr in the last 6,000 years. Due to this slowing down of the sea level, paleotempestology can generally provide hurricane records up till the last 5,000-6,000 years."}, {"section_title": "Global Warming and Sea Level Rise", "text": "Research done in the last few decades shows that sea level rise rates are increasing at a pace that can be correlated with the increase in levels of CO 2 (Douglas and Kearney, 2001;IPCC, 2007). Climatic models have predicted that in the next century, the best estimate rise in temperature will be between 1.8\u02da C to 4.0\u02da C (IPCC, 2007). With this range of increase in temperatures, the rate of sea level rise is projected to increase from 0.18 m to 0.59 m (IPCC, 2007). Though some of the increase in CO 2 can be absorbed by the global oceans up to a point, with the increase in temperature, the solubility of CO 2 will decrease and the ocean will stop acting as a \"sink\" (Geophysics Study Committee, 1990)."}, {"section_title": "Global Warming and Change in Intensity and Frequency of Hurricanes", "text": "Recent studies (Bender et al., 2010;Emanuel, 2005) connect an increase in hurricane strength and frequency to the rise in sea surface temperatures (SST). The effects of both storm intensification and rising sea levels are of immediate concern to low-lying areas; together the two compounds the devastation that hurricanes can bring to coastal areas. Studies by Emanuel (2005) show that warmer waters lead to more intense storms. A clear trend of increase ( Figure 2.3) in hurricane intensity is visible in the last 50 years (Emanuel, 2006). This rise is strongly correlated with the average rise in sea surface temperatures (SST). However, Landsea (2005) and Landsea et al. (2006) challenge the reliability of limited data used in detecting increase in frequency and intensity in the Atlantic basin. Studies by Knutson and Tuleya (2004) have also proven that hurricanes simulated with higher temperatures and CO 2 conditions are more intense. Records show a linear increase of 11% in CO 2 levels over a period of 80 years and from 10.88 o C to 12.48 o C in temperatures (Knutson and Tuleya, 2004). Using these values, different models project an average of 6% increase in wind speeds, 14% decrease in central pressure, and 18% increase in precipitation (Knutson and Tuleya, 2004). According to Pielke (2007), for 2050, the range of intensity increase due to global warming is projected to fall between 0-18%; and for 2100, between 0-36%. This projection indicates a considerable change in the strength of storms (Pielke, 2007). His calculations show that the damage by hurricanes in the year 2050 would be more than four-fold if a worst-case scenario of an 18% increase in intensity is adopted. A recent study done by Bender et al. (2010) suggests a two to three-fold increase in frequency of category 4 and 5 hurricanes respectively in the Atlantic basin between 20 o and 40 o latitudes. This leads to about 30% increase in damages from the strong hurricanes (Bender et al., 2010) in this region. On the contrary, the number of days of all categories of hurricanes in the Caribbean is shown to decrease in the same study (Bender et al., 2010)."}, {"section_title": "Climate Change in the Caribbean", "text": "Paleoecological study conducted by Hodell et al.

Results from this study correspond with the general climatic conditions of the broader Caribbean, Africa, and Mesoamerica (Hodell et al., 1991). Another study done by Islebe and S\u00b4anchez (2002), using mangrove pollen analysis in the Caribbean coast of Mexico, shows similar changes in the climatic conditions, shifting between wet and dry conditions during the late Holocene (Islebe and S\u00b4anchez , 2002).

On the other hand, hurricane surge carry coastal sediments (like sand) landward and deposit them on land at a comparatively closer distance to the coast (Figure 2.6.B) (Morton et al., 2007). In St. Lucia, Scheffers et al. (2005) found that the tsunami deposits contained materials of various sizes ranging from mud to boulders along with gravel and pieces of coral. Kelletat et al. (2004) reports similar findings in the Bahamas. Kortekas and  found in Martinhal, Portugal, that the main differences between tsunami and hurricane deposits were the presence of boulders and rip-up clasts along with the large extent of depositional area seen after the tsunami of 1755. In Puerto Rico, Moya (2006) discovered that tsunami deposits were laminated and contained haematite (an iron mineral produced due to volcanic activity in seismically active oceans) and Halemida sp. (a calcareous alga found in the bottom of the shallow marine platform) indicating massive tsunami induced waves of marine origins. This could be distinguished from hurricane induced storm surges that are coastal in nature. Hurricane overwash has sand which is better sorted than tsunami deposits. Tsunami deposits exhibit multiple layers due to an alternating land-ward and sea-ward flow of the water carrying marine and non-marine materials respectively. In contrast, hurricane deposits show only a land-ward flow with coastal material (Nayanama et al., 2000;Dawson and Stewart, 2007;Morton et al., 2007). Most of these studies compare tsunami and hurricane deposits in different locations but there is no research yet in the Caribbean which illustrates the difference between the deposits at the same location. Nevertheless, two distinctions seem to be common in all studies and are visually apparent: (a) varying grain size and lack of sorting (Scheffers et al., 2005;Kelletat et al., 2004) and (b) an alternating composition (Nayanama et al., 2000, Dawson andStewart, 2007;Morton et al., 2007). These two criteria have been used for preliminary identification of sediment origin in this work. Although much work has been done in the recent years to differentiate tsunamis from hurricane deposits, it is still problematic and difficult in less-than-ideal conditions. Especially distinguishing small tsunamis from large storms (which may have comparable carrying capacities) in which large materials (an indication of tsunami) may not be present (Kortekas and . Tsunami and hurricane distinction in greater depths of cores is also problematic as bioturbation and compression of deposit layers can hide sorting and layering due to bidirectional flow (McCloskey, 2009).\n\nSeptember 22 nd , 1998 as a Category 3 storm. It had peak winds of 120 mph and brought surges of 7 feet along with heavy precipitation that caused widespread destruction due to landslides and flooding. More than 438 people were killed and it cost the country about $1.2 billion in damages (Geerts et al., 2000).  (Cutter et al., 2003). The elderly and young children are less capable of caring for themselves during disasters and this makes them more vulnerable (Cutter et al., 2003).\nTwo cores were extracted from this site. The first core, PIL 1, was obtained from a spot that is 430 m from the sea and it is a 290 cm long core (Figure 6.25). This core consists of peat and clay with 8 layers of sand ( Figure 6.25). The sand layers that indicate overwash events are at: 5-13 cm, 22-32 cm, 35-45 cm, 46-50 cm, 96-105 cm, 110-119 cm, 274-273 cm, and 281-290 cm. PIL 2 was the longest and the oldest core obtained from RAAN, Nicaragua. It was cored farther inland, at 480 m from the sea (Figure 6.22), and is 470 cm long. This core has a similar sedimentary composition as core PIL 1 and comprises of peat and clay with 9 layers of sand in it ( Figure 6.26). The sand layers are at: 11-18 cm, 20-25 cm, 27-31 cm, 121-129 cm, 135-148 cm, 163-170 cm, 210-218 cm, 232-246 cm, and 384-389 cm. Five samples were sent for radiocarbon dating to NOSAMS (Table 6.5). The first sample at 35 cm was dated at the radiocarbon age of 1,030 +/-25 14 C BP and the calibrated date of 950 cal yr BP. Second at 120 cm was dated in the radiocarbon age of 3,100 +/-40 14 C BP and calibrated to 3,350 cal yr BP. Third was extracted at 238 cm and was dated at 3,460 +/-35 14 C BP This was calibrated to 3,750 cal yr BP. The fourth sample was obtained at 320 cm and dated at 2,120 +/-40 14 C BP in radiocarbon years and 2,080 cal yr BP (Table 6.5). *(This date is younger than the age of the samples above the depth of 320 and thus was not considered reliable.) The fifth organic second sample was collected at 390 cm and was dated by NOSAMS at 6,550 +/-40 14 C BP and calibrated to 7,455 cal yr BP. Using this date of 7,455 cal yr BP and an indication of 9 events from sand proxy layers in the PIL 2 core, a return period of 828 years is calculated. Plotting of age versus depth revealed an R 2 value of 0.9341 ( Figure 6.24). Four activity regimes emerge from the LOI analysis ( Figure 6.26) and dating of this core:   Table 6.5: Calibration results for PIL 2 at 38 cm, 120 cm, 238 cm, 320 cm, and 390 cm, depths using Calib 6.0 (Reimer et al., 2009 "}, {"section_title": "Hazard Regimes", "text": "Hazard regimes are defined as clearly identifiable periods of time within which the frequency of a hazard remains more or less constant (Nott, 2003). Current hurricane return period forecasting techniques are based on a homogeny in the past records but various studies indicate that shifts in hazard regimes occur on both temporal and spatial scale. Temporally, storm frequency has been studied on an inter-annual, decadal, or millennial timeframe (Nott, 2003). a. Inter-Annual Variability due to ENSO and NAO: Variability due to El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillations (ENSO) activity happens every 3-5 years. The effects last for about a year and dampen hurricane activity in the Atlantic Basin. Hurricane records from 1985 till 2003 suggest that ENSO has greatest effect on inter-annual variability (Frank and Young, 2007). The primary explanation for the decline in hurricane frequency during El Ni\u00f1o years is increased wind shear in the environment. In the Caribbean, hurricane activity is lower in the El Ni\u00f1o years (Chu, 2004). North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is another phenomenon that controls the strength and direction of hurricane tracks across the North Atlantic (Elsner, 2000;Elsner, 2006). b. Decadal Variability: Multi-decadal variations in hurricane frequency are attributed to Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). The Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic see alternating lulls and peaks spanning 20-25 years. When hurricane activity at high latitudes is above average, it is below average at low latitudes and vice versa. Plots show an inverse relationship between activity in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Atlantic (Elsner, 2000;Goldenberg et al., 2001). c. Millennial Variability: \"Bermuda High\" is defined as a \"persistent atmospheric highpressure system in the North Atlantic\" (Liu, 2004) whose change in positions may explain the change in hurricane activity in the last 5,000 years (Liu, 2004). Between 1,000 to 3,800 years ago, this high-pressure system may have been positioned more to the southwest, causing storms to strike the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean (Figure 2.7.A). In the last 1,000 years the Bermuda High has shifted towards the northeast, thus pushing the storms towards the East Coast (Figure 2.7.B). Hence, the last millennium has been a period of relatively low activity for the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean (Liu, 2004)."}, {"section_title": "Probability of Occurrence", "text": "Predictive return period modeling or probability modeling is based on empirical data. Past storm records can be divided into two broad categories: (a) \"best-track\" records (from the last 160 years collected by the Coastal Services Center at NOAA (CSC, 2010), and (b) proxy records for the last ~5000-6000 years analyzed by using paleotempestological techniques (Liu, 2007). A simple probability can be calculated by using a ratio of total occurrence over total time. This method assumes uniformity in the geologic records, i.e., it does not account for changes in climatic conditions (Elsner et al., 2008;Woodruff et al., 2008aWoodruff et al., , 2008bNott, 2003). The simple probability also does not take into consideration that some years may have more than one storm and some none. A method developed by Elsner et al. (2008) is capable of providing return periods for storms above a certain threshold of intensity and wind speed if modern analogs are available. Older records have higher uncertainty but by using Bayesian methods, this uncertainty can be addressed in the models (Elsner and Bossak, 2001;Jagger and Elsner, 2006;Solow and Moore, 2000). Poisson distribution is used to model the likelihood of hurricanes using historical data (Elsner and Bossak, 2004). While using historical data for predictive modeling has been attempted before in a hierarchical Bayesian model (Elsner and Jagger, 2004), this has not been done yet for paleo-hurricane records which have high degree of uncertainty. Using statistical methods proposed by researchers in the field, a modified probability of occurrence is estimated based on combined historic and prehistoric data (Solow and Moore, 2000;Elsner et al., 2008;Elsner and Bossak, 2001;Elsner and Kara, 1999). Poisson distribution (Equation 1) is a distribution of rare events over a long period of time; it assumes that the mean (\u03bb) is unchanging over time. Here is the number of hurricanes being forecasted and T is the time period of the past record (Elsner and Bossak, 2001)."}, {"section_title": "Equation 1", "text": "But when we consider two time periods of hurricane occurrence, \u03bb is variable due to missing data or other factors. A mixture of Gamma density with a Poisson distribution is then proposed leading to a negative binomial distribution (Epstein, 1985). In this case the \"gamma density is considered the conjugate prior\" (Elsner and Bossak, 2001;Elsner and Kara, 1999) for the Poisson process. Using this method with a prior function, predictions for varying time periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, 50 years) could then be made by using the following formula (Equation 2) where is the time period we are forecasting for and is the number of hurricanes being forecasted; is total time period (certain and uncertain) and is the total number of hurricanes in the uncertain and certain periods (Elsner and Bossak, 2001 Along with the frequency of hurricanes, using wind damage assessment of past storms to predict future impacts is also a part of hazard analysis. Reconstructing hurricane speeds for historical storms is more involved and requires extensive research in the archives and other documentary sources for reports of damage due to hurricane winds (Boose, 2004). U.S. National Hurricane Center has reconstructed data for the wind speed and intensity for hurricanes for the last ~160 years (CSC, 2010). Wind speeds for prehistoric storms are even harder to determine due to a large uncertainty in the record. Recently this has been attempted by using modern analogs in the geologic records to identify intensity and wind speeds of storms that are capable of leaving a record (Elsner et al., 2008). Modern storms of known intensities which leave a signature in the coastal lakes are used to infer the threshold intensity required to leave a proxy record at the same location, assuming geologic conditions have not changed considerably over time (Elsner et al., 2008). A Fujita scale for wind damage can be used to correlate historically reported damage with wind speeds to prehistoric storm data (Donnelly et al., 2001a;Boose 2004)."}, {"section_title": "b. Storm Surge", "text": "Numerical storm surge models are used to estimate the surge height at a hurricane landfall location for historic and prehistoric storms (Nott, 2003). These models employ variables such as bathymetry, sea-level at the time of event, the topography at the site, and the estimated intensity established from sand layer records (thickness and distance from shoreline). In case of historic records, wind speeds from written accounts (Hsu, 2004;Cheung et al., 2007;Woodruff et al., 2008aWoodruff et al., , 2008b are inferred. Apart from historical events that have been documented, oral histories obtained through ethnographic methods provide valuable information regarding storm conditions and impacts (Frappier et al., 2007b)."}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability", "text": "\"Vulnerability is the degree to which a system, subsystem, or system component is likely to experience harm due to exposure to a hazard, either a perturbation or stress/stressor\" (Turner et al., 2003). A community's vulnerability indicates its lack of resiliency to disasters or lack of ability to cope and recover after the disaster (Cutter, 2003a). The concept of vulnerability has been around for a long time, but only recently have efforts been made to quantify it by using models. Since vulnerably is based mainly on qualitative characteristics, quantifiable and conceptually robust indicators are used to measure it. There are different aspects of a community that contribute to its vulnerability. Even though everyone in a hazard prone area will be impacted by a hurricane, certain demographics are more at risk and will require additional assistance during the storm and after in the recovery phase."}, {"section_title": "Emergence of Vulnerability Science", "text": "Two classic frameworks that were proposed to study vulnerability in the early days of the vulnerability analysis were: the risk-hazard (RH) model and the pressure and release (PAR) model. The RH model is defined as a function of the hazard, exposure to the hazard, and the sensitivity of the entity that was exposed (Turner et al., 2003). This model lacked information about the interactions between the social/physical characteristics of the system as well as the differential exposure and consequent impacts to the hazard (Turner et al., 2003). The PAR model improves upon this limitation and incorporates the existing vulnerability of the system creating a disproportionate effect of the exposure within the system (Blaikie et al., 1994). However, this model lacks the \"human -environment\" interactions that may reduce or increase vulnerability (Turner et al., 2003)."}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Modeling Approaches", "text": "Based on extensive research done on various vulnerability models and approaches, Cutter (1996) categorized vulnerability approaches into three broad groupsvulnerability as a preexisting condition, vulnerability as a tempered response, and vulnerability as a hazards of place (Boruff, 2005). Boruff (2005) describes five models of note (including PAR) that employ the aforementioned three approaches for studying vulnerability: i. Pressure and release model (Blaikie et al., 1994); ii. Hazards dimensions of vulnerability model (Tobin and Montz, 1997); iii. Circle of vulnerability model (Alexander, 2000); iv. Human ecology of endangerment model (Hewitt, 1997); and v. Vulnerability of place model (Cutter, 1996). First four of the five models lack either a feedback mechanism, a geographic variability of vulnerability, a socio-economic variability, or an interaction between social and biophysical vulnerability (Boruff, 2005). In addition to varying characteristics within the system (Phillips et al., 2006) that may contribute towards uneven impacts of a hazard, there is also disparity in vulnerability due to location (Turner et al., 2003;Boruff, 2005). A place-based model for vulnerability (Cutter, 1996) comprises of a modeling framework that integrates all three approaches and characteristics of vulnerability to determine the comprehensive vulnerability of a geographic location. The vulnerability of place model (VPM) allows for comparison between geographic locations and their vulnerability. It also has a feedback mechanism that monitors change in vulnerability over time (Boruff, 2005). A place based vulnerability model was first employed by Cutter et al. (2000) "}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Indicators", "text": "Since vulnerability is a multi-dimensional concept and cannot be measured directly, quantifiable indicators are used to measure it. Indicators are useful tools in monitoring and assessing complex social and environmental issues because they combine data and observations to create quantifiable measures (Cutter et al., 2003;Birkmann, 2007). Different approaches in defining vulnerability to hazards lead to different methods in selecting indicators that best represent it. While identifying the most vulnerable populations and spatially exploring variations in vulnerability within different regions, the use of indicators based on \"human exposure\" (Adger et al., 2004) is common. This generally is known as \"social vulnerability\" (Adger et al., 2004) which is a component of the overall \"biophysical vulnerability\" (Adger et al., 2004). Cardona (2005) calls this the \"predisposition to be affected\" regardless of the nature of hazard. This is also known as the Prevalent Vulnerability Index (PVI) (Cardona, 2005). Traditional methodologies consider social indicators, e.g., gender, age, income, ethnicity, and disability (Cutter et al., 2003;Cardona, 2005) that reveal an inherent susceptibility to perils. The built environment (roads, housing, infrastructure, and critical facilities) are also vulnerable to hazards and are an intrinsic part of a vulnerability assessment study.  Boruff, 2005). Fifteen such indicators (Table 2.1) were used for social vulnerability in St. Vincent and Barbados (Boruff and Cutter, 2007). These indicators were combined to produce a composite index for each of the parishes in Barbados and the census districts in St. Vincent and were then mapped on GIS to illustrate the comparative vulnerability (Boruff and Cutter, 2007)."}, {"section_title": "Normalization of Vulnerability Indicators", "text": "Indicators used for vulnerability research have different units and cannot be combined in a justifiable manner. By using normalizing and standardizing techniques, they can be converted to quantifiable units that are comparable and can be integrated. There are many methods that are used for normalization and based on recent works done in vulnerability (Nardo et al., 2005;Briguglio, 2003), three of the commonly used (often together) methods are described below: a. Ranking method: this is the simplest way to normalize qualitative data. Number of ranks is specified and qualities are arranged as ordinal numbers. The same number of ranks is used for all the indicators and then combined. Although this method is the quickest and easiest to use, there is considerable loss of information (Briguglio, 2003). b. Standardization (Z-Score) method: indicators in different units and scale are hard to compare and combine. Statistical standardization of data puts them on a uniform scale with a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. However, there is a bias towards extreme values which have the largest effect on the index (Nardo et al., 2005). c. Rescaling method: this method uses the range of the indicator values and converts them to values between 0 and 1. It is simple and effective while retaining data information. Again, the index can be distorted by outliers or extreme values (Nardo et al., 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Representation of Risk", "text": "Risk assessment is best conducted with multi-criteria analysis using Geographic Information System (GIS) (Boruff, 2005;Carrara, 1991;Cutter, 2003b;Cutter et al., 2000). Interactive models in GIS that simulate hazard scenarios are useful in studying the impacts of hurricanes before they happen. They also help in delineating areas and identifying populations that are particularly susceptible to storm damage.

One of the initial works in this area using GIS was done by Elsner and Kara (1999) who represented return periods of all categories of hurricane strike for the east and south coastal counties of the US. With this method, there is possibility of misrepresentation of hurricane strikes depending upon the length of a county's coastline (Keim et al., 2007), as well as the location of strike. An alternative method proposed by Keim et al., (2007) uses a point of strike without using jurisdictional boundaries. This seems to be more effective in representing the probability of strike. This method too has its own limitation; it is not possible to combine it with for boundary based analysis such as vulnerability analysis which uses indicators that are measured for jurisdictions. A representation technique created by Knowles and Leitner (2007), where past historic tracks were used to create a \"Choropleth Map\" of density distribution (Knowles and Leitner, 2007;Knowles, 2008), uses the \"kernel density interpolation\" tool available in GIS, to map weighted densities of hurricane strike locations.

These are geo-statistical techniques that use the relative distance between points to assign weights while interpolating missing data points (Lam, 1983). The values being interpolated can be any attribute of the past hurricane. In this dissertation, wind speed in knots was used and classified into categories based on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. Models such as ADCIRC Coastal Circulation and Storm Surge Model; Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model; provide potential surge information based on the topography, bathymetry, central pressure, wind speed, tides, etc. But they require immense computing power and time.

First, the crucibles were weighed empty to get the tare weight. Next, sediment was sampled at an interval of 1 cm and weighed with the tare weight to get the gross weight of the sample. Crucibles with sediment in them were dried overnight at 100 o C and weighed again to determine the water percentage. After weighing the dried samples, they were burnt at 550 o C during which organic matter was oxidized (Heiri et al., 2001;Dean, 1974). Weighing this sample after ignition at 550 o C gave the amount of organics in the sediment. Finally, the samples were ignited at 1000 o C, at which temperature the carbonates in the sediments were oxidized to carbon dioxide and ash (Heiri et al., 2001;Dean, 1974).

It is part of the 238 U decay series and has a half life of 22.3 years. It falls into the lakes and oceans from the atmosphere and gets fixed with the sediment material.

Nine sieves were used ranging from numbers 18-230. They were stacked on top of each other with the largest mesh size on the top and the smallest at the bottom. After tapping the sediments for 10 minutes in the sieve shaker, each sieve was removed and material was weighed to get a grain size profile. Statistical analysis was performed to understand the grain size distribution in the sample and to determine levels of sand (Folk and Ward, 1957).

A method using a \"Gamma Density\" function (Elsner and Bossak, 2001) was vetted but could not be used for the paleo records of hurricanes as there was no distribution available to calculate the variance and hence the distribution parameters could not be established. A simple superposition (Nelson, 1995) of two Poisson processes was considered by combining the time periods and occurrences. Historic and prehistoric hurricanes were both treated as two separate Poisson events with non overlapping time frames. (For this, using a sedimentation rate from dating of the core, the top 160 years of the core was removed.) Their superposition then yielded a Poisson distribution (Nelson, 1995). (Elsner and Bossak, 2001) (Nelson, 1995) First, return periods were calculated for historic hurricanes by counting the number of hurricane strikes from the HURDAT (CSC, 2010) database. The historic return period was combined with that of paleo-hurricanes by adding the total events and dividing by the total time to arrive at an integrated mean rate of return. Historical events that were duplicated in the prehistoric records were counted only once. All categories of hurricanes were used from the historical records (CSC, 2010). Prehistoric records were also assumed to be of all categories as there is uncertainty regarding the sensitivity of study sites. Hurricane strikes divided by the total time was used in the Poisson distribution to calculate the expected probability of a hurricane making landfall in the future. Expected probability of hurricane strikes was calculated using the following formula (Klotzbach et al., 2004): Annual hurricane probability calculation along with that of longer time frames and of multiple hurricane strikes is useful for calculating future losses in the insurance and building industry (Elsner and Kara, 1999). These calculations are used to estimate damage and loss from single and multiple hurricane strikes for varying time periods (Appendix B-2 and B-4). Predictions for varying time periods (e.g., 5, 10, 20, and 50) were made by using the following formula (Klotzbach et al., 2004): T Year Prob = 1 -(1 -One-Year Prob.)

Since wave setup is almost all due to the storm in the Caribbean due to a negligible tidal range (Donnelly, 2005), a simplified flooding approach (NOAA, 2009) was used to create potential surge map. Digital Elevation Maps obtained from Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic (at 30 m X 30 m resolution) were first converted into raster format in ArcGIS 9.3. Surge height thresholds were set for each category of storm and pixel elevation values above this height was converted to \"1\" and below the height to \"0\".

IDW is an interpolation technique that uses the distance between data points to assign weights (Lam, 1983). Points farther out have less weight than those nearer. Furthermore, IDW suited the wind speed analysis as speeds decrease as the distance from landfall locations increases. \"Geostatistical Analyst Wizard\" was used in ArcGIS 9.3 to create an IDW surface using the historic hurricane strike points. Winds-speed at landfall was used as the value that was being interpolated. The resulting map shows predictive surface for wind speeds of hurricanes making landfall on the coast.

Core LIM 4 (Figure 4.37) indicates deposits from 5 events, 2 of which were dated using radiocarbon. One occurred around 925 cal yr BP and one around 2,330 cal yr BP. Since no modern analogs were found in the historical records, it is not possible to interpolate the intensity of prehistoric hurricanes for Laguna Playa Ingles and Lake Limon sites. Based on the chronology obtained from radiocarbon dating, the western part of the island has had three storms in the last 3,640 years and the eastern part has had five in the last 2,330 years. This signifies a return period of 1,213 years in the western part and 466 years in the eastern part. This means a Poisson probability of hurricane strike of 0.0824% for the eastern part (Lake Limon), and 0.21% for the western part (Laguna Playa Ingles). Paleo-hurricane records from LPE 2 and LIM 4 cores are used as a \"prior\" for Bayesian statistical analysis (Elsner and Bossak, 2001) of future probability of hurricane landfall computed in Chapter 5.\nBased solely on historical data, the likelihood of hurricane strike for La Altagracia province is the highest and second highest for Pedernales province (Table 5.1). But when prehistoric records are added, the probability of strike is reduced considerably for Pedernales (from 0.025 to 0.0020). Similarly, El Seibo has a 0.125 probability of strike based on historical records. By adding the prehistoric data, the likelihood of hurricane strike in this province goes down to 0.0021 (Table 5.1). In the above two cases, the Poisson probability has decreased by adding the prehistoric records. But depending on the site and its sensitivity, the probability could also increase if additional prehistoric hurricane records were found. Although Distrito Nacional has a 0.0 probability of a direct strike based on past records, it is the most 'at risk' province due to its high population. A hurricane landfall even in the vicinity of this province is likely to create substantial damage to life and property as was the case with Hurricane David in 1979. The hurricane storm surge and wind speed maps (Figures 5.6 and 5.8) illustrate the high level of threat to Distrito Nacional. Additionally, the capital city Santo Domingo, which is one of the biggest ports in the region, is located in this province. This area is the economic hub of the country owing to tourism and trade. Distrito Nacional is also the seat of the central government and a major hurricane landfall in this area could cripple the entire country. The province with the lowest vulnerability score is Pedernales which has a small population and thus gets low scores on each of the indicators of vulnerability. Surprisingly, this province also has the highest per capita medical facilities (Appendix B-1). While the vulnerability of this province is low, it has a high likelihood of hurricane strikes based on historical records. This makes the total risk of hurricanes in the province moderately high.\nAll coring locations selected in RAAN had indication of multiple events, one going back 7,455 years. None of these layers were found to be tsunami deposits based on the two preliminary and visual criteria discussed in Chapter 2. Additionally, sediment composition of the event layers matches the composition of sand from the beach which has a low percentage of carbonates (Appendix A-2) supporting the view that sand was transported from the beach. Cores from Lake Dakura site, DAK 2 and DAK 3 ( Because only one modern analog was found in the Dakura core, and it was the highest intensity hurricane -a Category 5, it is not possible to set a threshold for the minimum intensity needed to leave a record at the Dakura site. Consequently, it is difficult to ascertain the intensities of prehistoric hurricanes without analyzing new cores which may capture records of recent hurricanes with known intensities. Four activity regimes emerged from the analysis of PIL 2 core as discussed in section 6.5.4. A high activity period until~1,000 cal yr BP and then a low activity period from 1,000 cal yr BP till about 3,300 cal yr BP are in agreement with a study done by McCloskey (2009). The return periods estimated from these cores ranged from 140 years to 1,211 years. The probability of hurricane strike for Dakura is 0.4%, 0.24% for Lakun Tara, 0.19% for Llano de German, 0.08% for Haulover, and 0.12% for Puerto Isabel. This range indicates the varying sensitivity of the coring sites in RAAN. Using this information as a \"prior\" for Bayesian statistical analysis (Elsner and Bossak, 2001) of the historical storm records, future probability or \"posterior\" of landfall of hurricanes has been computed for RAAN in Chapter 7.\nThe municipality of Waspam has had the highest number of hurricane strikes (4) in the last two centuries. Puerto Cabezas has had one and Prinzapolka none. Based purely on historical data, the likelihood of hurricane strike for Waspam is the highest. When prehistoric records are considered for these municipalities, Waspam still has the highest probability of strike of hurricanes followed by Puerto Cabezas and lastly, Prinzapolka. Bilwi, the seat of the government of RAAN as well as the largest urban area in the region, is in the municipality of Puerto Cabezas. This makes the municipality more vulnerable than the other coastal municipalities. Also the population of this municipality is high, raising its total vulnerability to hurricanes. The hurricane strike probability based on past hurricane record (Figure 7.13) is moderate, and the potential storm surge inundation map (Figure 7.9) illustrates that a large area in this municipality can be flooded. The municipality with the lowest vulnerability is Prinzapolka which has the lowest population and thus low scores on each of the demographic characteristics of vulnerability. It also has a lower likelihood of hurricane strikes based on empirical data. This makes the total risk of hurricanes in the municipality low. Waspam has a medium vulnerability (Figure 7.7) but a high probability of strike based on empirical data (Figure 7.13) thus increasing the total risk for this municipality.

Using a rescaling methodology proposed by Brugglio (2003) (see Chapter 3), the indicators were normalized such that each ranged from 0 to 1 (Figure 5.2) and then combined and normalized again to create a composite index for each coastal province ( Figure 5.3). This technique assigned equal weights to all indicators (Cutter et al., 2003) before adding them (Appendix B-1). Distrito Nacional has the highest score for all the vulnerability indicators ( Figure 5.2). While six of them increase the total vulnerability, two decrease the vulnerability.

The elderly and young children are less capable for caring for themselves during disasters this makes them more vulnerable (Cutter et al., 2003). They also may less mobile and dependent on other people. Thus all of these indicators -population, gender, children, and the elderly-contributed towards increasing vulnerability. Census data obtained from El Instituto Nacional de Informaci\u00f3n para el Desarrollo (INIDE, 2006) provided information about the indicators of vulnerability that were used for calculations and mapping. Using this information, coastal areas were analyzed and mapped at the municipal level. Puerto Cabezas has the highest score for all the vulnerability indicators (Figure 7.3). This municipality has almost 21% of the total population of RAAN and is vulnerable due to its high population (Table 7.1). The second most vulnerable municipality is Waspam which is north of Puerto Isabel. Prinzapolka is the least vulnerable due to its low population. Other indicators such as poverty, access to roads, medical facilities etc., could not be found for either the departmental or the municipal level. Information for extremes in age cohorts and gender were available for RAAN but not for the municipalities within it. A simple ratio method was used to deduce these indicators for the 3 municipalities based on the ratio of the municipal to the departmental population. Using a rescaling methodology proposed by Brugglio (2003), the indicators were standardized such that each ranged from 0 to 1 and then combined and normalized again to create a composite index for each coastal province (Figure 7.4). This technique assigns equal weights to all indicators (Cutter et al., 2003) before adding them up (Appendix B-3). The probability of strike is the highest for the municipality of Waspam (Figure 7.5) because this municipality has had 4 hurricanes in the last 160 years. This figure may change if we add the information obtained from prehistoric records. However since no coring was done in this municipality, the likelihood of hurricanes is based on only the historic data. Calculation of longer time frames and of multiple hurricane strikes is useful for insurance and building industry (Elsner and Kara, 1999). These calculations are used to estimate damage and loss from single and multiple hurricane strikes for varying time periods. Long term calculations for hurricanes in this region were done for multiple time periods using the likelihood of varying number of storms making a landfall (Appendix B-4).  Puerto Cabezas has the most number of communities that can be affected by storm surge (Figure 7.10).

DAK 2 is a 220 cm long core and was extracted 250 m from the sea. There is a sand field in front of this location (between the sea and the coring site). This core has 9 layers of sand that indicate hurricane events (Figure 6.7). The first is at the top of the core and is about 7 cm thick (0-7 cm). Since Hurricane Felix in 2007, there hasn't been another hurricane strike in this area. For this reason this layer is assumed to be an overwash deposit from Hurricane  Three organic samples were dated from this core and calibrated to conventional ages. The first sample was taken from 75 cm depth and was dated at a radiocarbon age of 1,250+/-30 14 C BP and a calibrated age of 1,220 cal yr BP (Table 6.1). The second sample at 145 cm was dated at 1,290+/-30 14 C BP and calibrated date of 1,265 cal yr BP, and the third sample (basal) was obtained from 217 cm depth and dated at 1,300+/-30 BP radiocarbon age and the conventional age of 1,270 BP (Table 6.1). The close dates of 1,265 cal yr BP and 1,270 cal yr BP at a 75 cm difference in depth indicate an error in estimation of one of those dates. If the date of 1,265 cal yr BP is correct at 145 cm, then there are 5 events that are indicated in the core above it. This means that this area experienced a hurricane return period of 253 years. On the other hand if the 1,270 cal yr BP date is correct at 217 cm then the return period of hurricanes is 141 years. For probability analysis in this dissertation, the date of 1,265 at 145 cm was used as it seems more probable considering that the sediment at 75 cm was dated at 1,220 cal yr BP. DAK 3 location is about 6 km north of DAK 2 and is 150 m inland. This core is 295 cm long and contains mostly clay with some peat and sand layers ( Figure 6.8). Four sand layers were found in this core using visual and LOI analysis. These layers were at: 0-8 cm, 10-20 cm, 30-35 cm, and a thick layer at the bottom of the core at 243-300 cm. Both cores exhibit two sand layers on the top that are presumably from the same events as they are found at consistent depths in the two cores. Other than these layers, the stratigraphies of DAK 2 and DAK 3 cores are very different. The reason for the difference in stratigraphies of DAK 3 from that of DAK 2 is most likely because DAK 2 site has a sand field in front of it making it more sensitive to overwash deposits. DAK 3 is near the mouth of water channel and the presence of clay in most of the core indicates frequent flooding of the inlet.  The top 30 cm of the DAK 3 core was sampled at 3 cm intervals for 137 Cs and 210 Pb activity determination by using gamma spectrometry for \uf0b3 24 hours each. A 137 Cs peak was found at 7 cm depth ( Figure 6.9) indicating that the sediment at this depth was deposited in 1963. Figure 6.9: 137 Cs activity versus depth plot. The peak at 7 cm indicates 1963 as the year of deposition of the sediment at that depth. The slope derived from the log of excess 210 Pb activity versus depth line ( Figure 6.10) is used in calculating the sedimentation rate of the top 30 cm of the core. 210 Pb decay constant \uf06c\uf020(0.03114 yr -1 ) divided by the slope (-0.049) gives the sedimentation rate of 0.177 cm/year. This rate is in agreement with the 137 Cs derived rate of 0.149 at this depth. 210 Pb rate is used for calculating the year of occurrence for recent storms as it can be used for the last 110-130 years as opposed to for ~50 years for 137 Cs dating. which is a large freshwater lake ( Figure 6.11). It is a waist deep lake surrounded by red mangroves and a Typha island at the entrance (Figure 6.12).

The coastal Regi\u00f3n Aut\u00f3noma del Atl\u00e1ntico Norte (RAAN) is part of the Mosquito Coast which runs on the eastern coast of Honduras and Nicaragua. The largest ethnic group in RAAN is that of the Miskitos who have lived in the Mosquito Coast for more than 300 years (Dodds, 2001). There are 120,817 Miskitos living in the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua (INIDE, 2006). Of this 102,806 (INIDE, 2006) live in RAAN and the rest in Regi\u00f3n Aut\u00f3noma del Atl\u00e1ntico Sur (RAAS). They are part of a \"contact culture\" (Dodds, 2001) which has grown with the intermingling of the native American, African, and European people. The Miskito communities were not prepared for a hurricane like Felix as Nicaragua does not regularly get affected by hurricanes. In a trip undertaken in February of 2009, coastal Miskito communities hit hardest by Hurricane Felix were visited. One and half years after the hurricane, these communities still hadn't recovered from the damage (Figure 7.1.A and 7.1.B). They alleged that they did not get warning about the approaching storm. Since there is a lack of road infrastructure and transportation leading to and out of these communities, evacuation and rescue work was also impeded for days."}, {"section_title": "Socio-Economic Setting", "text": "The population of RAAN is 314,130 which include 158,169 men and 155,961 women (INIDE, 2006).

Not surprisingly, the most \"at risk\" areas of both the case studies are urbanized and contain the capital city of the country/department. Distrito Nacional in the Dominican Republic has the highest risk ( Figure 5.10) mainly due to its coastal location and high population. Distrito Nacional is the seat of the central government and a hurricane landfall in this area could cripple the whole country. Province with the lowest vulnerability is Pedernales which has the lowest population and thus low scores on each of the demographic characteristics of vulnerability. Bilwi, which is the seat of the government of RAAN as well as the largest urban area in the region, is in the municipality of Puerto Cabezas making this municipality more vulnerable than the other two coastal municipalities (Figure 7.7). The population of this municipality is high thus raising its total vulnerability to hurricanes. Municipality with the lowest vulnerability is Prinzapolka which has the lowest population and thus low scores on each of the demographic characteristics of vulnerability."}, {"section_title": "Origin of Overwash Layers in Cores", "text": "It is noted by researchers in the field that mainly events of great magnitude and intensity (Category 3-5) leave a signature in the sedimentary record (Nott, 2003). This theory may not be true if the lake was closer to the shore and therefore sensitive even to minor storms. Question then arises, were the records left by only major storms or storms of varying intensities? When we look at the sea level curves provided for this region (Toscano and Macintyre, 2003;Digerfeldt and Hendry, 1989) it is apparent that the sea level has been rising albeit at a slower pace in the latter part of the Holocene and therefore a coastal lake could only move closer to the shore and would be more sensitive now to minor storms than in the past. Hence, an assumption is made that all categories of hurricane are capable of leaving a record based on the orientation of landfall and the sensitivity of the lake site. Consequently, for the sake consistency, this project considers all categories of storms (i.e. Categories 1-5) from the hurricane track data available from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) historic storm database -HURDAT (CSC, 2010). While a threshold can be set based on modern analogs to determine the minimum intensity of hurricanes, it is debatable to assume that the site conditions would have remained unchanging though thousands of years. A case of establishing a modern analog is from cores from Dakura in RAAN, Nicaragua. A distinct layer of sand was visible on top of both cores from Dakura, DAK 2 and DAK 3. This layer is 7 cm thick In DAK 2 and 8 cm thick in DAK 3. It is most likely from Hurricane Felix that made landfall as a category 5 hurricane in this region in 2007 as coring was done in 2008 and there is no sedimentation above these sand layers. The second question that comes to mind regarding the origin of overwash records is that whether the records are from hurricane events or tsunamis deposits. While tsunami and hurricane deposits can be differentiated under ideal conditions as seen in the recent studies (Moya, 2006;Nayanama et al., 2000;Scheffers et al., 2005;Kelletat et al., 2004;Dawson and Stewart, 2007;Morton et al., 2007) described in Chapter 2, it is not easy to determine the origin of the overwash layer in the core. Kortekaas and Dawson (2007) found in a study done in Puerto Rico that it was only possible to identify hurricane deposits as separate from tsunami deposits by using multiple methods of differentiation. This becomes even more difficult in older cores as the sediment is considerably compacted and some of these methods become harder to apply. In this study, a preliminary analysis of the overwash deposits in the cores extracted from the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, did not exhibit the two characteristics that are visually apparent in defining tsunami deposits, such as large sized materials including coral (Scheffers et al., 2005) and deposits from alternating landward and seaward flow (Nayanama et al., 2000, Dawson andStewart, 2007;Morton et al., 2007). The third question that comes up is regarding the lateral extent of the overwash deposit. Some sand layers are visible in one core at a site and not in others at the same site. This can be explained by the particular attributes of the hurricanes and of the coring site such as the angle of strike, position of the site in relation to the eye wall, and presence of ample sand in front of the site to be carried by the surge."}, {"section_title": "Future Work", "text": "This dissertation is only the first step in creating an integrated hurricane risk framework for the Caribbean area by utilizing paleotempestological, statistical, and visualization techniques. Much work needs to be done in the future to complete the picture for the entire circum-Caribbean region. Some of the future efforts are described below: a. More dating to establish regime change Not all event layers that were identified could be dated using radiocarbon dating technique due to budget and time constraints. Long term trends and changes will be better identified in the cores with improved dating control which can help understand and address long term shifts in regimes such as the Bermuda High Hypothesis (see Chapter 2)."}, {"section_title": "b. 137 Cs and 210 Pb analysis of all cores", "text": "A comprehensive modern analog is pertinent in setting an intensity threshold for each site and will help select the storm categories that are above this threshold. 137 Cs and 210 Pb analysis of all cores would correlate known recent hurricanes with their signatures found in the cores."}, {"section_title": "c. Grain size analysis of all cores", "text": "As was evident in the LPE 2 core (see Chapter 4), not all sand layers from events are detectable in the LOI profile if there is negligible organic matter.

This type of analysis would also help in distinguishing hurricane deposits from tsunami deposits by revealing the sedimentary structure."}, {"section_title": "d. Further analysis to differentiate between hurricane and tsunami deposits", "text": "One of the important foundations of paleotempestological studies is proper identification of hurricane proxies. By using the multiple techniques covered in Chapter 2 to distinguish tsunami and hurricane deposits, a better deduction could be made as to the origin of overwash material. e. More coring sites Due to limited time and resources, only certain locations could be cored. Coring more locations at regular intervals and within smaller distance along the coast will improve the resolution of the cored data and possibly capture the prehistoric hurricanes records which may have gone undetected."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 9 CONCLUSION", "text": "Hurricanes account for a significant portion of the damages, injuries, and loss of life every year in the Caribbean. While hurricanes cannot be forecasted with absolute certainty, the ongoing target is to work towards reducing the vulnerability in areas that are most exposed to hurricanes. This project accomplishes this by providing extensive information about probability of strike, hazard, and vulnerability, such that mitigation measures can be taken to reduce impacts. This dissertation examines hurricane records from the late Holocene and their importance in understanding the hurricane risk faced by the coastal population in the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean coast of northern Nicaragua. The two study areas are diverse in many ways thus providing a range of applicability of the multi-criteria risk assessment model provided in this dissertation. The paleotempestological findings from these areas provide a broader scientific foundation for estimating future hurricanes. The outcome of this study is a synthesis of the spatial and temporal dimensions of hurricane hazard with the vulnerability distribution of the coastal population. The results identify risk-prone zones in the study areas which are then spatially represented. It is understood that there are constraints in using paleo data for future predictions, mainly due to the lack of knowledge about storm tracks for spatial reconstruction and about past conditions surrounding the recorded event. These gaps make it difficult to use only paletempetological data in predicting future events. Nonetheless, with careful use of modern analogs for calibration and knowledge of sea level changes in the Caribbean basin, paleotempestology is a powerful tool that complements historic and modern records. This work taps into one of the many potential applications of paleotempestology and much more needs to be done in understanding the comprehensive hurricane risk in the Caribbean region. Considering this is the first paleo-hurricane proxy record for the Dominican Republic and the Mosquito Coast of northern Nicaragua, the paleotempestological findings from these areas suggest a need for more information from these sites to better understand the temporal and spatial patterns of hurricane strikes in the region. Although focused on two countries, it is hoped that this methodology can be applied in disaster planning and policy formulation by decision makers in other Caribbean locations as well."}]
