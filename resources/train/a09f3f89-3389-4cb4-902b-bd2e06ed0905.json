[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Background: A previous Cochrane systematic review concluded there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of 18 F-FDG PET in clinical practice in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Objectives: To update the evidence and reassess the accuracy of 18 F-FDG-PET for detecting people with MCI at baseline who would clinically convert to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia at follow-up. Methods: A systematic review including comprehensive search of electronic databases from January 2013 to July 2017, to update original searches (1999 to 2013). All key review steps, including quality assessment using QUADAS 2, were performed independently and blindly by two review authors. Meta-analysis could not be conducted due to heterogeneity across studies. Results: When all included studies were examined across all semi-quantitative and quantitative metrics, exploratory analysis for conversion of MCI to AD dementia (n = 24) showed highly variable accuracy; half the studies failed to meet four or more of the seven sets of QUADAS 2 criteria. Variable accuracy for all metrics was also found across eleven newly included studies published in the last 5 years (range: sensitivity 56-100%, specificity 24-100%). The most consistently high sensitivity and specificity values (approximately \u226580%) were reported for the sc-SPM (single case statistical parametric mapping) metric in 6 out of 8 studies. Conclusion: Systematic and comprehensive assessment of studies of 18 FDG-PET for prediction of conversion from MCI to AD dementia reveals many studies have methodological limitations according to Cochrane diagnostic test accuracy gold standards, and shows accuracy remains highly variable, including in the most recent studies. There is some evidence, however, of higher and more consistent accuracy in studies using computer aided metrics, such as sc-SPM, in specialized clinical settings. Robust, methodologically sound prospective longitudinal cohort studies with long (\u22655 years) follow-up, larger consecutive samples, and defined baseline threshold(s) are needed to test these promising results. Further evidence of the clinical validity and utility of 18 F-FDG PET in people with MCI is needed."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) has classically been based on clinical criteria and postmortem confirmation of AD [1] . The reconceptualization of AD as a disease continuum [2] -with a long asymptomatic phase followed by a symptomatic phase of progressive cognitive decline before the onset of functional impairment and overt dementia-has led to a shift towards identifying AD at an earlier stage, before patients have crossed the threshold into dementia [3] .\nClinical subtypes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been regarded as prodromal forms of a variety of dementias [4] . There are four outcomes for patients with MCI: progression to AD dementia, progression to another dementia type, maintaining stable MCI, or recovery. Studies [5] [6] [7] [8] indicate that an annual average of 10% to 15% of people with MCI progress to AD dementia. Discriminating between patients who will and will not progress to dementia due to AD is critical in the context of care and future therapies [9] . 18 F-FDG PET provides information about neuronal activity at tissue level by measuring regional cerebral glucose metabolic rate (CGMr). Glucose hypometabolism in the temporo-parietal lobe and posterior cingulate cortex, as assessed by 18 F-FDG PET, signals a pattern of neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction typically found in AD dementia [10, 11] . 18 F-FDG PET is a valued biomarker test in the early, confirmatory diagnostic arsenal of AD dementia [12, 13] .\nFor MCI, the 18 F-FDG PET pattern is not consistent and usually presents as mild global and regional hypometabolism in patients diagnosed with MCI in research settings [14] . Nevertheless, several 18 F-FDG PET studies in MCI patients have found characteristic and progressive CGMr reductions in particular ADvulnerable regions, suggesting that certain findings on brain PET scans can potentially predict progression of MCI to AD dementia [15] [16] [17] [18] .\nA previous Cochrane review (published in 2014 based on searches to 2013) [19] concluded that the evidence from studies (n = 16) published over a 14-year period shows variability in prognostic performance of 18 F-FDG PET, and was insufficient to support the routine use of 18 F-FDG PET in clinical practice in people with MCI. This conclusion was challenged [20] in light of further published studies and some concerns were expressed regarding study design, data analysis procedures, and lack of adequate and validated image analysis approaches in included studies.\nThis paper fully updates the original review, including studies published over the last five years, and maintains the same robust methodological approach. The main objectives are to: 1) reassess the accuracy and reliability of 18 F-FDG-PET for conversion from MCI to AD dementia in light of the quality and quantity of the most recent evidence; 2) include an assessment of prognostic value among different metrics; 3) provide research recommendations to further strengthen the evidence base and move towards routine clinical utility."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Search strategy and selection criteria", "text": "This is a systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) studies that applied the same search strategy and methodology as the original Cochrane 18 F-FDG-PET review [19] , unless otherwise specified.

Assessment of methodological quality was hampered by poor reporting and lack of details. Areas of particular concern for risk of bias were around Patient Selection and Index Test domains. Poor reporting about sampling procedure led mainly to unclear risk of bias or contributed to high risk of bias in the participant selection domain. For the Index test domain, eleven studies were of poor methodological quality and at high risk of bias due to lack of pre-specified threshold. Although the reference standard was regarded as adequate to correctly classify the target condition, poor reporting on blinding of dementia assessors resulted in unclear risk of bias for that domain in most of the included studies (n = 16).\nIn summary, most studies have major threats to their validity according to QUADAS 2. Only one study [17] passed all the QUADAS 2 criteria; over half (n = 13) failed on four or more of the seven available sets of criteria. The evidence base could thus be safely categorized as generally low quality.\nA brief overview of the quality assessment is shown in the Legend section of Supplementary Table 4 .\nAn overview and characteristics of studies included in the exploratory analysis are presented in Table 3 ."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "This paper updates the previous 18 F-FDG PET Cochrane review [19] to determine this biomarker's accuracy for prediction of conversion from MCI to AD dementia in light of recently published studies. Deploying the same methodological rigor, it yielded 36 studies overall. When all included studies were examined across all metrics, exploratory analysis for conversion of MCI to AD dementia (n = 24) showed sensitivity values ranged from 25-100% while specificity values ranged from 24-100%. Highly variable accuracy for all metrics was also found across the eleven newly included studies, published in the last 5 years. Sensitivity values ranged from 56-100% and specificity values from 24-100%. The best values are reported for the sc-SPM metric in four new studies; sensitivity values ranged from 77-100% and specificity from 74-100%. Three [43, 47, 48] of these four studies used an optimized voxel-based procedure [69] . To be useful for dementia diagnosis, achieving both high sensitivity and specificity is critical [70] .\nThe main sources of heterogeneity across studies are differences in study design, participants sampling, sample size and settings, variability in selected thresholds with respect to hypometabolism in different brain regions, variable length of followup, and analytical approaches ( Table 3 ). The DTA study designs least likely to cause bias are prospective longitudinal studies with consecutive sampling and large sample size. Accuracy obtained from studies with retrospective design might be overestimated [71] , and small samples may result in misleading estimates of test accuracy due to wide confidence intervals [72] . In this review, fourteen prospective cohort studies and ten that retrospectively analysed longitudinal data were included in the exploratory analysis for conversion to AD dementia. Only 5 studies recruited a consecutive sample. Most included studies had a sample size below 50, four between 50-120 participants, and only one study with over 200 participants; participants were recruited from a range of settings. A substantial number of included studies had limitations in methodological and reporting quality. Areas of particular bias concern were Patient Selection and Index Test domains; only one study was graded low risk of bias for all criteria of QUADAS 2 [17] and reported high values for sensitivity (92%) and specificity (89%) using Neurostat/3D-SSP metric. However, this study has a small sample size (n = 30); therefore, the accuracy achieved might be overestimated.\nThe accuracy of biomarkers also heavily depends on the length of the follow-up period. MCI participants with a positive (abnormal) 18 F-FDG PET scan are classified as 'false positive' if they do not convert to AD dementia at a predefined follow-up period. It is possible the specificity values in some included studies with short follow-up are falsely low because some MCI participants might only convert to dementia at a later follow-up period and would thus be classified 'true positive'. The same logic applies to sensitivity values with the 'misclassification' of participants as true negative. But what is the ideal follow-up to assess diagnostic accuracy? Duration of follow-up was 24-36 months in most included studies and one study [46] followed-up participants for five years. Three studies with a relatively short follow-up of 18 months or less [16, 17, 63] reported specificity values of 100%, 89%, and 97%, respectively. One plausible explanation is that MCI study participants had more severe cognitive impairment at baseline, and consequently converted to AD dementia during the short observation period. Despite the fact that a majority of included studies (33/36) used Petersen's standardized clinical criteria for MCI diagnosis [4, 27] , reported information about participants' cognitive impairment severity at baseline was insufficient to explore this issue. A better understanding of the role of biomarkers in prediction of conversion from MCI stage to AD requires both short and long-term periods of observation [25] and characterization of the severity of cognitive decline at baseline.\nIncreasing age of MCI participants is considered the strongest risk factor for progression to AD dementia [73, 74] . Participants' age for studies included in the exploratory analysis ranged from 50-83 years. The influence of age groups on the predictive accuracy of 18 F-FGD PET was assessed only in a few included studies. One study reported that age as covariate in statistical analysis did not improve the performance of 18 F-FGD PET [45] ; another found Table 3 Summary of the main findings Research question: What is the diagnostic accuracy of 18 F-FDG PET biomarker for detecting AD pathology in vivo and predicting progression to AD dementia in people with MCI Studies included in an exploratory analysis for conversion from MCI to AD dementia (n = 24) Study design Prospective study design (n = 14): longitudinal cohort study (n = 8) and nested case-control study (n = 6) Retrospective study design (n = 10): retrospective analysis of longitudinal data Participant population/AGE Participants diagnosed with MCI at baseline Age ranged from 50 to 83 years MCI criteria\nPetersen criteria (n = 21) Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) (n = 1) (old study) [57] Isolated memory impairment (IMI) criteria (n = 1) (old study) [58] Neuropshychological set battery for aMCI (n = 1) (new study) [45] Notes: a stage of MCI (earlier/advanced) was not generally reported in primary studies Sampling procedure Consecutive (n = 4) Not consecutive (12) Unclear (n = 8) Sample size A number included in the analysis in primary studies ranged from 12 to 241 participants Less than 30 participants (range: 12-28) (n = 12) 30-50 participants (range: 30-48) (n = 6) More than 50 participants (range: 68-241) (n = 6) Settings\nMost of the studies (n = 15) recruited participants from Outpatient University Departments (e.g., memory clinics, cognitive disorders clinics, centers for research and treatment of cognitive dysfunctions, etc.) Multicenter (n = 2) Not reported (n = 7) Index test 18 "}, {"section_title": "F-FDG PET Threshold", "text": "Included studies used a range of thresholds regarding hypometabolism in different brain regions. Most of them were based on computer aided visual read (n = 17), while few of them were based only on fully automated measures of glucose hypometabolism (n = 3). Two studies applied both approaches. Two studies used principal component analysis on VROI, and one study combined SUVr images and t-sum. Analytical approach (metric) Neurostat/3D-SSP (n = 4) SPM (n = 8) SUVr/ROI (n = 5) Fully automated read (n = 4) Neurostat/3D-SSP and fully automated read (n = 2) Combined 'SUVr images' and 't-sum' (n = 1) VROI (n = 2) Threshold pre-specified at baseline Yes (n = 11) No/Unclear (n = 13) 18 F-FDG hypometabolism regions Metabolism was studied in a range of brain areas.

These were the most commonly investigated brain regions in the included studies. Reference standard For AD dementia: NINCDS-ADRDA (n = 20); CDR = 1 (n = 1); 'non-specified clinical dementia rating' (n = 1); 'not reported' (n = 2) McKeith criteria for Lewy body dementia; Lund criteria for frontotemporal dementia; NINDS-AIREN criteria for vascular dementia Target condition\nConversion from MCI to AD dementia Duration of follow-up Less than 24 months (n = 3) On average, mainly between 24-36 months (n = 20); some participants were followed slightly longer 5 years or longer (n = 1) (Continued) all studies, n = 1132 participants; old studies, n = 327 and new studies, n = 805). Quality concerns QUADAS 2 scoring was challenging due to insufficient details. Poor reporting about sampling procedure led mainly to unclear risk of bias or contributed to high risk of bias in the participant selection domain. Although the reference standard was regarded as adequate to correctly classify the target condition, poor reporting on blinding of dementia assessors determined unclear risk of bias in the reference domain in most of the included studies (n = 16). According to the assessment of Index test domain, eleven studies were of poor methodological quality and were considered to be at high risk of bias due to lack of pre-specified threshold. Over a half (n = 13) failed on four or more of the seven available sets of criteria. Only one study [17] passed all sets of QUADAS 2 criteria. The evidence base could thus be safely categorized as generally low quality. Heterogeneity Studies included in the exploratory analysis for conversion to AD differ regarding i) some aspects of study design (e.g., prospective/retrospective design; consecutive/non-consecutive sampling; lack of information about severity of cognitive impairment in MCI); ii) duration of follow-up; iii) absence of common thresholds; a range of different thresholds used; iv) methodological differences and heterogeneity in the conduct and interpretation of the test regarding analytical approach used, brain areas investigated, scaling procedures, etc. These differences resulted in considerable heterogeneity between included studies. A meta-analysis was not performed, and consequently, a formal investigation of heterogeneity was not feasible. Accuracy at study level Overall, when all studies were examined across all metrics, the estimates of sensitivity and specificity for conversion to AD dementia vary considerably between included studies, and are likely to be attributable to covariates mentioned above. In the thirteen studies from previous review, the sensitivity values ranged from 25% to 100% while the specificity values ranged from 15% to 100%. In the eleven new identified studies, the values ranged from 56% to 100% and from 24% to 100% for sensitivity and specificity respectively. sc-SPM metric Sensitivity = 38% to 100%; Specificity = 15% to 100% (4 old and 4 new studies) Sensitivity = 77% to 100%; Specificity = 74% to 100% (4 new studies) Neurostat/3D-SSP metric Sensitivity = 25% to 100%; Specificity = 40% to 89% (4 old and 2 new studies) Sensitivity = 56% to 100%; Specificity = 40% to 74% (2 new studies) t-sum/HCI metric Sensitivity = 79%; Specificity = 29% (1 old study) Sensitivity = 61% to 79%; Specificity = from 37% to 91% (4 new studies) Notes: The most consistently high sensitivity and specificity (approximately \u226580%)\nwere reported in the six sc-SPM studies (2 old and 4 new). that in participants under 75 years this biomarker was only a marginally significant predictor and in participants over 75 did not predict conversion [68] . Only ten out of 24 studies defined a specific threshold for 18 F-FDG PET biomarker at baseline and then prospectively assessed its predictive accuracy in identifying those participants with MCI who would convert to AD dementia at follow-up. The remaining studies used optimized thresholds, so reported sensitivity and/or specificity values might be overly optimistic. Furthermore, the accuracy of imaging biomarkers is highly influenced by the analytical approach used. It is still a matter of debate which 18 F-FDG PET metrics are most accurate [25, 44] . Our review confirms previous evidence from a published meta-analysis [75] that sc-SPM metric shows the best prognostic accuracy when compared to other computer added visual read or fully automated metrics.\nHowever, the findings should be interpreted with caution because: 1) only one study [40] had a sample size above 50 and follow-up of 2 years or longer as recommended [30] ; 2) the accuracy of sc-SPM and other metrics was not assessed simultaneously in the same study participants; 3) four out of eight studies retrospectively analysed longitudinal data of MCI-converters and MCI-stable participants. Retrospective analysis has greater potential for bias than prospective longitudinal studies. A recent study [76] , with 80 participants recruited retrospectively, concluded that an optimized voxel-based procedure sc-SPM metric has a relevant role in predicting progression to different dementias and in the exclusion of progression in prodromal MCI phase. These important, promising results for 18 F-FDG PET-SPM need to be confirmed in future prospective longitudinal studies.\nA number of studies [20, 30] concluded that a large body of data supports the accuracy of 18 F-FDG PET to detect AD at MCI stage, showing high predictive value for conversion and providing highly relevant prognostic information for routine clinical use [30] . Based on a June 2015 search, Garibotto [30] reported that sensitivity ranged from 57-85% and specificity from 67-91% across five studies [44, 51, 52, 54, 61] with over 50 participants and a minimum two-year follow-up; four of these five studies included overlapping ADNI participants. Conversely, our review found that the accuracy of 18 F-FDG PET as a single test among 12 studies from the same ADNI cohort varied immensely. Sensitivity values ranged from 10-92% and specificity from 55-97% across several metrics; values for both sensitivity and specificity were >80% in only three studies. When applying the same criteria regarding sample size and duration of follow-up, our review identified five additional studies [39, 42, 45, 46, 50] which reported sensitivity ranging from 63-93% and specificity from 24-93%; values for both sensitivity and specificity were \u226580% in only three studies. Our comprehensive, up-to-date review supports Frisoni's statement [77] that \"the informative value of biomarker cannot be used with full reliability in clinical practice\" and further evidence of the clinical validity and utility of 18 F-FDG PET in people with MCI is needed.\nThis review has systematically and comprehensively examined the up-to-date evidence for 18 F-FDG PET as a single test for prediction of conversion to AD dementia in people with MCI, using Cochrane methods designed to minimize risk of bias for assessment and review of diagnostic test accuracy.\nOverall, sensitivity, and specificity vary widely between studies, and this variability was still present in studies published in the last 5 years. However, there is some evidence that sc-SPM is the metric showing the best prognostic accuracy when compared to other computer aided visual read or fully automated metrics. The highest values for both sensitivity and specificity (approximately \u226580%) were achieved in 6 out of 8 studies (2 older and 4 new) that used the sc-SPM metrics. These findings should be interpreted with caution as only one study had a sample size above n = 50 and follow-up of 2 years or longer, and 4 out of 8 studies conducted retrospective analyses which are at greater risk of bias.\nThere are still methodological limitations in the available evidence and a lack of well-designed studies that meet best practice criteria for diagnostic test accuracy studies. Further work needs to be completed before 18 F-FDG-PET as a single test can be widely recommended as a routine diagnostic test for conversion from MCI to AD dementia in clinical practice.\nThe promising results need further testing and confirmation in robust, methodologically sound prospective longitudinal cohort studies with long (\u22655 years) follow-up, with defined baseline threshold(s) and larger consecutive samples stratified by age groups and other covariates. Various aspects of more efficient metrics, such as sc-SPM, need to be harmonized [30] , optimized, standardized, agreed amongst experts and further tested. The predictive accuracy and the incremental diagnostic values of different metrics should also be assessed simultaneously in the same MCI participants. The use of dementia-specific guidance such as those proposed by STARDdem [78] may improve reporting quality in further DTA studies."}]
