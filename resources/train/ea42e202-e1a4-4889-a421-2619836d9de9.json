[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The aim of this review is to assess the potential for neuroimaging measures to facilitate prediction of the onset of psychosis.

The review details the key findings and developments in this area to date and examines the methodological and logistical challenges associated with making predictions in an individual subject in a clinical setting."}, {"section_title": "Psychosis prediction and the ultra high-risk state", "text": "Psychosis describes a syndrome that includes symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disorganised thought, and catatonia (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; World Health Organization, 1992) . Psychotic disorders are disorders that include symptoms of psychosis. The most common psychotic disorder is schizophrenia; however, psychotic symptoms can occur in other disorders, for example, in mood disorders such as bipolar and depression (Howes and Murray, 2014) .\nBefore the onset of symptoms that are severe enough to meet the clinical thresholds of a psychotic disorder, those affected experience subclinical psychotic symptoms and a decline in social/occupational functioning (Yung and McGorry, 1996) . Recognising the value of detecting and treating psychosis early (McGorry et al., 2008) , researchers and clinicians have developed the ultra high-risk (UHR) of psychosis criteria (Yung et al., 2006) . UHR criteria are the most commonly used criteria for indicating risk of developing a psychotic disorder (Fusar-Poli et al., 2013) .\nCriteria for UHR status include attenuated psychotic symptoms and/or a brief limited intermittent psychotic episode and/or a genetically determined vulnerability, alongside deterioration in social and occupational functioning (Fusar-Poli et al., 2012a . UHR status comes with the caveat that those who meet UHR status are selectively those who have come into contact with clinical services. This review uses the term UHR throughout.\nThe UHR population is strikingly heterogeneous in terms of clinical outcomes. Follow-up studies (Nelson et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2011a) suggest that 7 years after clinical presentation, approximately a third of UHR subjects will have developed a psychotic disorder, with most transitions occurring in the first 2 years . Most of those who do not develop a psychotic disorder will have persistent attenuated symptoms and/or have developed another mental health disorder, while 14% will have recovered (see Fig. 1 ).\nClinical intervention in the UHR group may reduce the likelihood of the onset of a psychotic disorder (Stafford et al., 2013) . However, as most UHR subjects do not develop a psychotic disorder, providing preventative treatment to all of those at risk is clinically inefficient. Identifying biomarkers that could be used to stratify the UHR group according to clinical outcome would enable the selective delivery of preventative interventions to the subgroup that would benefit the most.\nIt is difficult to predict clinical outcomes in a UHR subject on the basis of their clinical features at presentation. Although the clinical assessment at presentation has good diagnostic validity for ruling out a future psychotic disorder (meta-analytical sensitivity of UHR assessment = 0.96) , it has only a modest ability to rule in a future psychotic disorder (meta-analytical specificity of UHR assessment = 0.47) . There is thus a need to find other forms of assessment that can improve the specificity of psychosis prediction."}, {"section_title": "Neuroimaging psychosis risk in the UHR population", "text": "Neuroimaging techniques have provided a wealth of new information about the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders (Lin et al., 2011a) . Neuroimaging studies of the UHR population have implicated increased functional abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), midbrain and medial temporal lobe (MTL) (Allen et al., 2012) , structural abnormalities involving the PFC (Jung et al., 2011; Mechelli et al., 2011a) and MTL (Buehlmann et al., 2010) , elevated dopaminergic activity in the striatum (Egerton et al., 2013) and midbrain (Allen et al., 2012) , and abnormalities in levels of glutamate (Stone et al., 2010a) and GABA (Kang et al., 2013) . In general, these abnormalities are qualitatively similar but less severe than those seen in patients with psychotic disorders (McGorry et al., 2008) .\nThese findings represent the difference between the UHR population as a whole and healthy controls. However, the comparison that is relevant to the prediction of psychosis onset is between the minority of UHR subjects that subsequently develop a psychotic disorder and the majority that do not. Cross-sectional neuroimaging studies comparing these two subgroups at presentation have reported differences in activation in the PFC, MTL, midbrain and caudate (Lin et al., 2011a; Sabb et al., 2010) , in the volume of the MTL, PFC, and cingulate cortex (Pantelis et al., 2003; Mechelli et al., 2011b) , in the integrity of white matter pathways (Bloemen et al., 2010a) , and in glutamate levels in the caudate nuclei (de la Fuente-Sandoval et al., 2013) . Longitudinal studies with repeated measurements before and after the onset of a psychotic disorder have described progressive changes in MTL and PFC volume (Fusar-Poli, 2015; Borgwardt et al., 2008; Cannon et al., 2015) , in white matter volume (Ziermans et al., 2012) and integrity (Peters et al., 2010) , and in striatal dopamine function (Howes et al., 2011) . These changes were not evident in UHR subjects who did not develop a psychotic disorder.\nNeuroimaging findings associated with the transition to psychosis have understandably been the focus of most studies to date, and most studies have subdivided UHR samples into groups who did or did not develop a psychotic disorder. However, this subdivision is potentially misleading, as the subgroup that does not develop a psychotic disorder is not homogeneous: in some subjects, their presenting features resolve, such that they no longer meet the UHR criteria, whereas in others their symptoms persist. A further subgroup develop mental health disorders other than psychosis, particularly depression and anxiety (Fig. 1 ) Fig. 1 . Colour intensifies as those with underlying vulnerability move closer towards disorder manifestation. Taken with permission from (Fusar-Poli, 2015) and based on data by (Lin et al., 2011a) . (Nelson et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2011a) . Identifying neuroimaging measures that predict these other outcomes is also of interest. For example, determining the factors that predict recovery may improve our understanding of what determines resilience to mental illness and could allow clinicians to avoid giving unnecessary treatments to people who would be very likely to recover without any intervention. Recent studies have begun to examine predictors of recovery in the UHR population, but at present, this literature is still relatively small (Allen et al., 2015a; Egerton et al., 2014) .\nOutcome can also be defined in terms of level of functioning, as opposed to clinical status. Long-term follow-up studies suggest that a UHR individual's level of social and vocational functioning can sometimes be more clinically meaningful than their diagnostic category (Lin et al., 2011b) . Studies have also recently begun to examine the relationship between neuroimaging measures and functional outcomes (Allen et al., 2015a; Karlsgodt et al., 2009; Kambeitz-Ilankovic et al., 2015) ."}, {"section_title": "Multi-centre studies", "text": "Although the results have been of great interest, to date most neuroimaging studies in UHR subjects have involved small sample sizes (Fusar-Poli et al.) . Traditionally, mental health services have not engaged people with psychotic symptoms until after development of a first episode of a psychotic disorder. The concept of clinical provision for UHR individuals is relatively new, and specialised services for this group are still limited to a minority of psychiatric centres. As UHR subjects are usually ascertained through specialised clinical services, this constrains recruitment to research studies. This can lead to studies being underpowered, particularly if the hypotheses relate to a specific clinical outcome (such as the onset of a psychotic disorder) that is only evident in a subset of the total UHR sample. This issue can be addressed through the recruitment of UHR subjects from multiple different sites: a number of such multi-centre studies involving neuroimaging have recently been completed (Allen et al., 2012; Egerton et al., 2013) and several others are ongoing (Psyscan, 2015; Pronia, 2013; Eu-gei, 2010) .\nAlthough multi-centre studies can provide greater statistical power, there is a potential danger of introducing bias from between-centre differences in image acquisition and processing. For example, differences in scanning protocols (Kempton et al., 2011; Schnack et al., 2010) and scanning hardware (Pfefferbaum et al., 2003) can cause significant variability in results, as can upgrades of software and hardware within centres . These effects may be reduced through the harmonisation of scanning parameters and quality control across centres, and by the development of acquisition protocols that are specifically designed to minimise between centre variance, such as those used in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Jack et al., 2008) .\nNevertheless, some between-centre variance is inevitable. Some studies quantify this by directly comparing neuroimaging data acquired from a group of volunteers (Schnack et al., 2010; Suckling et al., 2012; Gradin et al., 2010; Moorhead et al., 2009) or identical phantoms at different sites (Gunter et al., 2009) . Researchers have also used methods of post hoc statistical correction to adjust for between scanner variance (Koutsouleris et al., 2014a) . However, if a predictive tool is to be employed at a variety of sites in a clinical setting, it may not be feasible to use phantoms or travelling subjects to control for between-site effects. In this case, the use of methods for post hoc correction may be more realistic."}, {"section_title": "Machine learning for individual prediction of psychosis transition", "text": "In clinical practice, predictions about the risk of psychosis need to be made using data from a single subject. However, most studies that have identified neuroimaging features that are associated with the onset of a psychotic disorder in UHR samples have described average differences between groups, which although statistically significant describe two highly overlapping populations. In this context, individual inference has a limited utility. This has led to research on the application of statistical approaches that use multivariate patterns rather than group level differences, which are more suited to making individual level inferences. These approaches include machine-learning methods (Orr\u00f9 et al., 2012a) , such as random forests (Breiman, 2001) , support vector machines (SVMs) (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) , linear discriminant analyses (McLachlan, 2004) , and K-nearest neighbour algorithms (Dasarathy, 1991) . Machine learning methods allow for individual classification and are sensitive to subtle effects that would go unnoticed using traditional univariate analyses (Orr\u00f9 et al., 2012b) .\nThe method that has been most widely applied to neuroimaging data is the SVM (Pettersson-Yeo et al., 2013) , which may reflect its comparatively better performance with highly dimensional data (Khondoker et al., 2013) . One reason for this is that SVMs base classification decisions on the most useful data points (see Fig. 2 ), which helps to overcome some of the difficulties associated with modelling highly dimensional data (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995) .\nThe support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised classification algorithm that learns from an initial 'training' data set to classify new cases into two or more groups (Orr\u00f9 et al., 2012b) . For example, an SVM can be trained on a data set of baseline neuroimaging measurements from UHR subjects defined by whether they subsequently developed a clinically defined outcome or not, and it can then be applied to a new sample of UHR individuals (Orr\u00f9 et al., 2012b ) (see Fig. 2 ).\nAn SVM is validated by demonstrating that it can classify individuals in a sample independent of the data set it was originally trained on. Ideally, this is done using a second data set that has been acquired separately from the original (Orr\u00f9 et al., 2012b) . Validation can also be attempted without a second data set, for example, by splitting the original sample (repeatedly), with one portion being used as the training data set and other portions being used for cross validation (e.g., k-fold cross-validation; Anguita et al., 2009 ). However, any overlap between the training and test data sets will result in the model over-fitting (Varma and Simon, 2006) . This issue can be addressed by using methods that ensure separation between the training and test data, such as repeated double cross-validation (Filzmoser et al., 2009 ). Nevertheless, splitting a single sample for training and validation will include sampling error in the classification, and there is a risk that the original sample is atypically easy or difficult to classify, particularly when the sample is small.\nPreliminary results from the application of SVMs in UHR samples have been promising. An SVM trained on volumetric MRI data was able to distinguish between UHR subjects who later transitioned and a combined group of non-transitioning UHR subjects and healthy controls with an accuracy of 88%, and between UHR who did not transition and a combined group of healthy controls and UHR who did transition with an accuracy of 86% (Koutsouleris et al., 2009a) . A subsequent study used voxel-level MRI measures of grey matter volume to distinguish between UHR participants who did or did not go on to develop a psychotic disorder with an accuracy of 84.2% (Koutsouleris et al., 2012) .\nTo date, applications of SVMs to UHR samples have used crossvalidation methods within a single sample (Koutsouleris et al., 2009b (Koutsouleris et al., , 2012 rather than the ideal validation method of using a second independent data set. This partly reflects the fact that it is logistically difficult to ascertain large samples of UHR subjects with neuroimaging data and initial studies did not have access to another large data set with comparable neuroimaging measures. One study has used an SVM on two small data sets from different centres, although these employed different UHR criteria and MRI protocols. This reported an accuracy of classification of UHR transition outcomes of 80% (Koutsouleris et al., 2014b) , and also suggested that between centre effects could be minimised by using a sample pooled across both centres for training and testing (Koutsouleris et al., 2014b ).\nThe use of larger UHR samples would reduce (though not completely eliminate; Joachims, 1998) the risk of models over-fitting the data (Guyon et al., 2002) . A model that over-fits the data is one that has been influenced by random error and noise in the training data to the extent that it does not accurately reflect the underlying phenomenon being studied (Dietterich, 1995) . Over-fitting is a particular concern in models where the number of dimensions greatly outweighs the sample size and in highly complex models.\nIn addition to ensuring a sufficient sample size, over-fitting can be reduced by limiting the analysis to the most predictive features, using dimensionality reduction or subset selection techniques (Mwangi et al., 2014) . It is also possible to use the results of previous research to limit predictive models to regions of interest (Costafreda et al., 2011) , although this relies on the assumption that findings from mass univariate approaches are applicable to a multi-variate analyses.\nThe size of the sample studied also impacts on the generalisability of the findings. Small samples may result in higher fluctuations of accuracy estimates when using neuroimaging data in SVMs, suggesting poor model generalisability (Nieuwenhuis et al., 2012) . In addition, larger sample sizes are less affected by sampling effects and capture more of the population's heterogeneity, making them more likely to be representative of the population being studied . The numerous advantages of studying large samples has led to a wave of multicentre neuroimaging studies that are recruiting UHR subjects from several different centres, often using standardised image acquisition protocols (Psyscan, 2015; Pronia, 2013; Eu-gei, 2010) . A further development has been the HARMONY initiative, which is designed to standardise neuroimaging, clinical, and electrophysiological assessments across these different multi-centre UHR consortia (Cannon, 2015) . As well as the opportunity to pool data to create even larger data sets, this will allow an SVM developed using one large sample to be validated on large independent data sets collected by other consortia.\nThere is also scope for the modification and optimisation of the machine learning methods that have been used in UHR subjects. For instance, SVMs can be modified to incorporate different statistical components. This includes the application of Bayesian probability and 'fuzzy logic' to SVMs, which have been used to create Relevance vector machines (RVM) (Tipping, 2001) and Fuzzy SVMs (Lin and Wang, 2002) respectively. Both of these methods can be used to minimise the effect of outliers on the training phase of a machine (Tipping, 2001; Lin and Wang, 2002) .\nBy introducing a different loss function (Smola, 1996) support/ relevance vector algorithms can also be used in regression (Support Vector Regression: SVR (Smola and Vapnik, 1997) ; Relevance Vector Regression: RVR (Tipping, 2001) ), which allows for classification in terms of a continuous, as opposed to a categorical outcome. Tognin If it is not possible to create a linear classification boundary, a kernel function can be used to transform the data into higher dimensional space where classes become linearly separable. (C) Schematic of SVM training and testing with neuroimaging data. In training, information from the two groups, or classes, is used to make a classification algorithm based on the predictive differences of the two groups. In testing, the algorithm is applied to data from a new subject to classify them as belonging to either group. et al. (2013) used this approach to show that symptom progression in UHR subjects could be predicted using an RVR applied to cortical thickness at presentation. Regression-based machine learning has also been applied to neuroimaging data to predict 'brain age', whereby individual brains are characterised according to indices of maturity (Koutsouleris et al., 2013; Franke et al., 2010) . Such examples show high accuracy in predicting age based on MRI-derived brain descriptors in large-scale cohorts of healthy adolescents and adults (Brown et al., 2012) . In patient populations, Koutsouleris et al. (2013 Koutsouleris et al. ( , 2015 demonstrated 'accelerated aging effects' using volumetric MRI data in different patients groups, including UHR participants. In a longitudinal study, showed that aging of the brain continues to accelerate during the first 5 years after onset of a psychotic disorder. Brain age estimation has also been conducted with resting state fMRI data in a large sample of children, suggesting delayed maturation to predict the presence of mental health problems (Sato et al., 2015) .\nThese findings suggest that machine learning-based biomarkers for psychosis prediction could be improved by taking account of the potential impact of neurodevelopmental changes on neuroimaging data. For example, predictors trained on UHR samples that are limited to subjects of a narrow age range may not be generalisable to samples that include subjects outside that range, who are at different stages of development. This issue may be particularly relevant to prediction in UHR samples, as these can include subjects within a wide age window (14-40 years), but there can be marked differences in the age of those enrolled at different centres, reflecting variations in the way that UHR subjects are recruited. For example, the mean age in UHR subjects recruited through adolescent or youth mental health services is significantly lower than in subjects enrolled through adult early detection services, and age therefore varies across studies (Fusar-Poli et al., 2012b) . Large-scale collaborative efforts that include samples with different age ranges such as HARMONY (Cannon, 2015) may help to address the issue of 'neurodevelopmental heterogeneity' in the UHR state."}, {"section_title": "Multimodal prediction of psychosis onset", "text": "A feature of machine learning methods that has yet to be fully exploited in the UHR field is that their use is not restricted to neuroimaging data: they can be applied to multiple data modalities (PetterssonYeo et al., 2014) . The integration of data from different modalities may be particularly useful in predicting the onset of psychosis, as it is the result of interactions between a diversity of genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors (Modinos et al., 2015) . Moreover, multimodal neuroimaging studies in UHR subjects indicate that the normal relationships between glutamate and grey matter volume (MRS and sMRI) (Stone et al., 2009 ), glutamate and functional activity (MRS and fMRI) (Day et al., 2003; Valli et al., 2011; Fusar-Poli et al., 2011) , glutamate and dopamine (MRS and PET) (Stone et al., 2010b) , and dopamine and functional activity (PET and fMRI) (Allen et al., 2012; Fusar-Poli et al., 2010) are perturbed. These observations are consistent with animal models of psychosis, which also implicate interactions between the medial temporal cortex and the striatum and midbrain, and dopaminergic, glutaminergic, and GABAergic dysfunction (Lodge and Grace, 2011) .\nTo date, most SVM studies in UHR subjects have involved data from a single neuroimaging modality (MRI), although the impact of introducing additional data modalities has recently been explored (PetterssonYeo et al., 2014) . This partly reflects the logistical demands associated with acquiring multi-modal neuroimaging data in samples that are large enough to permit comparison of subgroups with different clinical outcomes (Allen et al., 2015b) . However, ongoing multi-centre studies in this field involve a range of different neuroimaging modalities, as well as genetic, clinical, and cognitive data, and will be able to recruit samples large enough to assess predictors of outcomes.\nThere is some evidence that combining modalities may improve the prediction accuracy of machine learning classifiers. In predicting the onset of Alzheimer's disease from mild cognitive impairment, combining neuroimaging and neurocognitive measures increased the accuracy of SVMs beyond that of a single modality SVM (Zhang et al., 2011; Cui et al., 2011) . Conversely, a study of UHR, FEP, and healthy control subjects found that prediction in some comparisons was more accurate when using a single neuroimaging modality compared to multiple modalities (Pettersson-Yeo et al., 2014) . The authors suggest that this may have been a result of an absence of complementary information in the additional modalities (Pettersson-Yeo et al., 2014) .\nA further consideration in the use of multiple data modalities is practicality and cost. Data collection with some imaging modalities, such as PET, is expensive, can involve long acquisition times, or may require specialist equipment and technical support . On the other hand, the collection of volumetric MRI, blood samples, and behavioural measures is feasible in many centres, making them the most viable options for wider clinical use. However, if predictive findings identified using relatively sophisticated neuroimaging techniques were closely correlated with measures in other domains, the latter could then serve as more accessible and less expensive proxy measures for a neuroimaging gold standard. For example, in the prediction of the onset of Alzheimer's disease, the level of past education and occupational functioning are putative proxy measures for PET data on brain glucose metabolism (Garibotto et al., 2008) .\nConsortium recruiting large samples of UHR participants will collect a range of imaging, blood-based (bio-marker and genetic), and questionnaire-based data (Psyscan, 2015; Pronia, 2013; Eu-gei, 2010) . This is a benefit both due to the range of data-types available for predictive modelling and because it allows for an understanding of the interactions between different biological systems, which may be crucial to predicting the onset of psychosis. For example, it has been suggested that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis acts as the mediating system for the influence of stress on psychotic symptoms, a system involving both hormones/inflammatory markers, brain areas, and psychological stress (Nordholm et al., 2013; Shah and Malla, 2015; Borges et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2007) .\nAnother possibility is that less expensive measures may provide predictive models without the need for imaging. Promising preliminary results have been found using machine learning methods on blood-based biomarkers (mainly hormones and inflammatory markers) for the prediction of a future psychotic disorder (Perkins et al., 2014; Chan et al., 2015) . These early studies used around 15-30 blood-based markers (Perkins et al., 2014; Chan et al., 2015) , which gives an appropriate number of degrees of freedom for a predictive model, a benefit over models based on highly dimensional neuroimaging or genetic data. Given that blood-based biomarkers would likely reflect psychosis risk due to their interface with the brain, however, predictive models using both imaging and blood-based biomarkers could perform better than each modality alone."}, {"section_title": "Graph analysis", "text": "Psychosis can be conceptualised as disorder of brain dysconnectivity (McGuire and Frith, 1996; Stephan et al., 2009; Pettersson-Yeo et al., 2011) , and neuroimaging studies suggest that both functional and structural connectivity are altered in people at UHR. Moreover, differences in connectivity have also been identified between UHR subjects who later develop a psychotic disorder and those who do not (Carletti et al., 2012; Bloemen et al., 2010b) , suggesting that measures of connectivity may be useful in predicting the onset of psychosis (Schmidt and Borgwardt, 2013) .\nThere are several methods that can be used to assess connectivity, but one of the most promising involves the application of network modelling approaches such as graph theory (GT), which forms graphs representing patterns of connectivity between brain areas (Bullmore and Bassett, 2011) . Brain graphs are conceptualised as comprising nodes (neuroanatomical regions) that are connected by edges (structural/functional connections) (Schmidt et al., 2014) . This allows for connectivity to be characterised in terms of functional segregation (e.g., modularity), functional integration (e.g., shortest path length (see Fig. 3 ), global efficiency), small world, network motifs, centrality (e.g., degree), and network resilience (e.g., degree distribution) (Rubinov and Sporns, 2010) . Graph analysis thus provides information on the integrative features of brain networks.\nBrain graphs in healthy participants suggest that the brain is normally organised in a way that maximises the integration of the whole network, while allowing for the segregation of specific brain regions. Brain graphs typically show a modular organisation, such that the network can be broken down into smaller sub networks (Bullmore and Bassett, 2011) , with modules specialised for specific computational processes (Crossley et al., 2009) . Within brain networks, certain nodes, termed hubs, are much more connected than others (Bullmore and Bassett, 2011) and form 'rich clubs' (Stam, 2014 ) (see Fig. 3 ). Hubs have more long distance connections and higher metabolic demands than regular nodes (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2012; Tomasi et al., 2013) , and because of their strategic position in the network, they are thought to have an important role in brain functioning (Crossley et al., 2013; van den Heuvel et al., 2012) .\nGraph analysis of neuroimaging data in patients with schizophrenia suggests that the disorder is associated with decreased efficiency (Zhang et al., 2014) , clustering and small worldness (Anderson and Cohen, 2013) , and MRI abnormalities in psychotic disorders appear to be preferentially concentrated in hub regions (Crossley et al., 2014; Crossley et al., in press ). Abnormal GT measures have also been associated with elevated psychotic symptomatology in a sample of UHR participants (Lord et al., 2011) .\nThe mathematical functions of machine learning cannot easily be applied to graphs however (Foggia et al., 2014) . To date, studies that have used graph analysis metrics for machine learning have used whole brain graph theory metrics rather than representing the characteristics of individual nodes and/or edges (Sacchet et al., 2015; Joules et al., 2015) . In answer to this, methods for transforming graph data in to real vector space have been proposed, allowing for the application of machine learning classification and pattern recognition methods to graph data (Foggia et al., 2014; Fu and Ma, 2012) . For instance, techniques such as graph embedding allow for vector representation of nodes or edges, which can additionally incorporate graph topological features (Richiardi et al., 2013) . Additionally, graph kernels carry the possibility of applying graphs to kernel-based machines such as SVMs (Foggia et al., 2014) . Developments in this area are ongoing (Vento, 2015) , but these methods have not yet been validated in brain graphs, and it remains to be seen whether the complex and noisy graphs that are derived from neuroimaging data can be adequately represented (Richiardi et al., 2013) ."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Because it is difficult to predict whether a UHR subject will develop a psychotic disorder on the basis of a clinical assessment, there is a need for biomarkers that can help to predict outcomes in this group. Neuroimaging measures have the potential to facilitate the prediction of outcomes in UHR subjects. Further progress in their application requires the development of methods that permit prediction using data from an individual subject, and their validation in large independent samples. The extent to which the accuracy of prediction is enhanced by using more than one type of imaging data, or incorporating non-imaging data remains to be determined. Many of these issues are currently being addressed in multi-centre neuroimaging studies in UHR subjects.\nThe ongoing effort to use neuroimaging to facilitate prediction of the onset of psychosis provides a good example of a recent shift in the focus of psychiatric neuroimaging research, from descriptive studies to investigations with an explicitly translational objective.
