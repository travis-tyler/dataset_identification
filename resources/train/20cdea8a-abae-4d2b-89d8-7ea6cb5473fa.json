While previous studies have reported that moderateto-end-stage renal disease is an important risk factor for cognitive impairment and the progression of cognitive should be of concern in people with late Stage 2-4 chronic kidney disease.\nAlthough our understanding of the process of cognitive aging remains limited, this study highlighted the possibility that routinely assessed measures for estimating renal function may help to identify a population at greater risk of cognitive decline. A number of possible explanations for these findings exist. First, this relationship may be due to the accumulation of uremic toxins, some of which are accumulated in excess and sometimes even with mild renal impairment. Second, the brain and the kidney both have low vascular resistance and may be more susceptible to age-related fluctuations in flow leading to microvascular damage prior to the onset of large vessel disease [7] . Lastly, this relationship may be due to shared risk factors such as impaired glycemic control [8] or chronic inflammation [9] . Support for the first explanation can be derived from studies of cognitive function pre-and post-kidney transplantation that have reported improvements in cognitive function in patients after transplantation [10] . Irrespective of the exact mechanism(s), the findings by Seliger and colleagues [2] once again highlight the importance of early detection of chronic kidney disease.\nHowever, like other studies in this area, this study was observational and as such could not establish whether early chronic kidney disease was causative, interacts with other factors or is merely the harbinger of early vascular brain injury. Until intervention trials have been performed, these questions will remain unanswered. In this context, a number of strengths and limitations of the study by Seliger and colleagues [2] must be considered. The strengths included the detailed assessment of known risk factors with multiple longitudinal measures of renal function and cognitive performance. Limitations of the study included the use of creatinine as the sole determinant of renal function and the lack of assessment of structural brain changes over time.\nIn conclusion, the study by Seliger and colleagues [2] in this issue should stimulate further research investigating the link between declining renal function and cognition. The study also highlights the importance of early detection of chronic kidney disease to identify people at risk of cognitive impairment and provides a strong evidence that the process may begin much earlier than first thought. As such, studies are needed to demonstrate that interventions preventing the progression of early kidney disease can also reduce the burden of cognitive aging."}]
