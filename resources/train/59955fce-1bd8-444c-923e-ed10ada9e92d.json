However, many of these markers have some limitations to be used in real clinical settings because they are complicated, expensive, invasive, or sometime unavailable.\nFor this practical reason, it is very important to find out a relatively simple and cost-effective predictor that is easily available in real clinical settings. A couple of studies suggested that Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 28 and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) 29 as such predictor for AD dementia progression.\nThe CDR 30, 31 is a representative clinical scale used to evaluate six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to AD and related dementias: Memory, Orientation, Judgment & Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home & Hobbies, and Personal Care. The necessary information to make each rating is obtained through a semi-structured interview of the patient and a reliable informant or collateral source. It is frequently used to stage dementia severity and yields both CDR global score and CDR-SOB score in the clinical and research settings. 31 The global CDR score is calculated via an algorithm with published scoring rules 30 and the CDR-SOB score is obtained by summing each of the domain box scores. 32 While the global CDR score is typically used for staging purposes with restricted ranges, CDR-SOB score not only provides more detailed information of dementia severity but also is regarded as good predictor for AD dementia progression in MCI individuals. 29 Not all cognitive domains uniformly deteriorate during early AD process and the decline of non-memory areas and related functions follows episodic memory decline. Therefore, CDR subscale scores other than memory subscale score might be useful predictors for AD dementia progression in amnestic MCI individuals. However, little is known about this issue.\nThis study aimed to examine the usefulness of CDR subscale scores for predicting AD dementia progression within 2-year follow-up period in amnestic MCI elderly subjects, and to compare their predictive ability with those of other simple clinical cognitive or functional measures."}, {"section_title": "METHODS Subjects", "text": "Fifty-nine elderly MCI individuals were recruited from a dementia and memory disorder clinic at Seoul National University Hospital.

Baseline categorical data were analyzed by the \u03c7 2 test.\nLogistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the ability of various clinical measures or their combinations to predict progression to AD dementia in MCI individuals. We used the differences of -2 log likelihood (-2LL) to statistically compare the predictive ability of various models with different numbers of independent variables. 41 The -2LL is aquantity generated by the logistic regression procedure and is directly proportional to the contribution of variables to the separation of groups. A smaller -2LL means abetter predictive ability of the model. The probability distribution of -2LL difference between simple (model 1) and more complex model (model 2) can be approximated by a chi-square distribution with (df2-df1) degrees of freedom, where df1 and df2 are the degrees of freedom of models 1 and 2 respectively. Therefore, the -2LL difference allows the direct comparison of prediction models of different complexities. 42 The level of statistical significance was set as two-tailed p<0.05."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Presence of AD dementia progression within 2 years follow-up period", "text": "All subjects (n=59) were in amnestic MCI at baseline assessments.

In this study, 22 (37.3%) of 59 amnestic MCI individuals progressed to AD dementia within the follow-up period. This progression rate is in line with the recent results from the analysis of two-year follow-up data for Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) amnestic MCI subjects, which showed that AD dementia progression rate was 35%. 3 Our results from logistic regression analyses of one-candidate model showed that both CDR-SOB and MMSE could predict AD dementia progression with statistical significance. These results were consistent with those of previous studies. 28, 29 However, CDR Orientation had higher AD dementia prediction accuracy (78.0%) than either CDR-SOB model (67.8%) or MMSE model (67.8%). AD dementia prediction of either two-or three-candidate model including CDR-Orientation was not significantly different from that of CDR Orientation alone.\nThe excellent predictive ability of CDR Orientation subscale for AD dementia progression in amnestic MCI may be explained by the fact that orientation for time and place is closely related to attention and visuospatial perception as well as memory. In early clinical process of AD, amnesia, especially episodic memory decline, was the earliest symptom and frequently accompanied or followed by in attention and visuospatial dysfunction. 41, 43 Episodic memory decline itself is not useful as a predictor for AD dementia because all amnestic MCI individuals already have poor episodic memory in common as reflected in the name of the category. 44 In contrast, the additional information about inattention and visuospatial perceptual decline may have predictive value for the progression from premorbid condition to clinical AD dementia. 45 The usefulness of CDR Orientation subscale as well as CDR-SOB seems in part related with the method of CDR assessment. 30 The CDR assessment relies on not only brief cognitive evaluation, but also information obtained from the interview with collateral informant about cognitive and functional changes compared to previous usual level. Due to this assessment process, CDR scores are less influenced by various factors, such as age, education, depression, and practice effect, which could affect cognitive test scores. 30 There is an important discussion point in our study. As well as its advantage, it was important to rate CDR score with high reliability in clinical settings. The CDR has been widely used as a criterion standard in multicenter clinical trials in AD 36, 46, 47 and its inter-rater reliability has been well established. [48] [49] [50] One study demonstrates that high inter-rater reliability on the CDR subscale ratings by trained clinical personnel with supervision from highly trained monitors, i.e., agreement with gold standard ranged from 73% to 87% or agreement among raters ranged from 73% to 87%. 50 From these points of view, our CDR ratings were highly reliable because final assignment of the rating were given by the consensus panel including 2 psychiatrists who had finished CDR training course at Washington University Alzheimer Disease Research Center and had got the certification as a CDR rater. 41 In conclusion, our findings suggest that CDR Orientation subscale score, a simple and easily available clinical measure, could provide very useful information to predict AD dementia progression in amnestic MCI individuals in real clinical settings.
