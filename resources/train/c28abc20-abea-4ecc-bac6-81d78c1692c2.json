"}, {"section_title": "EDITORIAL NOTE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "General note about the data and interpretations", "text": "Many NCES publications present data that are based on representative samples and thus are subject to sampling variability. In these cases, tests for statistical significance take both the study design and the number of comparisons into account. NCES publications only discuss differences that are significant at the 95 percent confidence level or higher. Because of variations in study design, differences of roughly the same magnitude can be statistically significant in some cases but not in others. In addition, results from surveys are subject to nonsampling errors. In the design, conduct, and data processing of NCES surveys, efforts are made to minimize the effects of nonsampling errors, such as item nonresponse, measurement error, data processing error, and other systematic error. For complete technical details about data and methodology, including sample sizes, response rates, and other indicators of survey quality, we encourage readers to examine the detailed reports referenced in each article. The nine districts were chosen to provide variation in characteristics such as student population size, demographic and socioeconomic composition, and geographic location. The size of these districts ranged from about 55,000 students in Atlanta to over one million in New York City. Data from the 2003 TUDA in mathematics at grade 4 show the largest proportion of Black students in Atlanta (87 percent), the largest proportion of Hispanic students in Los Angeles (73 percent), and the largest proportion of White students in Charlotte-Mecklenburg (41 percent). The proportion of limited-Englishproficient (LEP) fourth-graders ranged from 2 percent in Atlanta to 56 percent in Los Angeles. All of the fourth-graders in Cleveland were eligible for free or reduced-price school lunch-an indicator of poverty status-while 45 percent of those in Charlotte-Mecklenburg were eligible. The large urban districts were distributed across all four regions of the United States. While most of the districts were located entirely within large cities, two districts, Charlotte-Mecklenburg and Los Angeles Unified, also included schools located in suburban areas. Not only did the large urban districts differ from each other, but they also tended to differ from the nation as a whole and from the states. For example, all of the participating districts had lower proportions of White students than did the nation. And all of the districts except Charlotte-Mecklenburg had considerably higher proportions of students eligible for free or reduced-price school lunch than did the nation. The dramatic differences between the characteristics of a given urban school district and those of the nation, the states, and other districts create special challenges in analyzing and reporting the data."}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Analyzing and Reporting TUDA Data", "text": "Because of differences in characteristics, it can be difficult to make meaningful comparisons between TUDA districts and the nation or the states. To provide a more appropriate frame of reference, NCES also compared the 2002 results for TUDA districts with the average for all students in central cities across the nation. The term \"central city\" does not mean the central part of a city or the \"inner city,\" but rather a city that is central. A central city is defined by the Census Bureau as a city of 50,000 people or more that is the largest in its metropolitan area, or can otherwise be regarded as central, taking into account such characteristics as commuting patterns. However, many central cities-for example, Lawton, Oklahoma, or Parkersburg, West Virginia-do not resemble the TUDA districts to any great degree. In 2003, therefore, NCES refined its comparison group for the TUDA districts to include only large central cities (defined as central cities with populations of at least 250,000). About 15 percent of the nation' s students live in large central cities. In terms of student population characteristics, TUDA districts are often more similar to the large central cities than to the nation or the states. Another way in which NCES addresses the issue of widely varying characteristics is by comparing the performance of individual subgroups in a given TUDA district with the performance of the same subgroups elsewhere. For example, the performance of Black fourth-graders in Atlanta can be compared with that of Black fourth-graders in the nation, in the large central cities, in Georgia, and in other TUDA districts. Similarly, the performance of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch can be compared with the performance of other eligible students. Such comparisons frequently demonstrate that subgroup members in TUDA districts are performing at or above the national average for their peers (though of course subgroup members in some TUDA districts are performing below this average). An additional issue concerns differences in the proportions of students that TUDA districts excluded from the assessments, either because those students had disabilities that prevented their participation, or because their knowledge of English was not sufficient for them to participate meaningfully. In the 2003 TUDA assessment in reading, for example, 33 percent of Houston's fourth-grade sample was identified as LEP and 20 percent of the sample was excluded. (Houston typically assesses the reading skills of LEP students in Spanish, while NAEP assesses reading skills only in English.) In Los Angeles, 56 percent of the sample was identified as LEP, but only 5 percent of the sample was excluded. (In California, state law requires testing of nearly all students.) Variability in the proportion of students excluded should be taken into consideration when interpreting the results and making comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Available Results and Future Plans for TUDA", "text": "One of the primary values of NAEP to the public is the ability to compare performance in various jurisdictions with performance in other jurisdictions and in the nation. While NCES has always administered NAEP assessments to students in urban areas, TUDA for the first time allows comparisons of students in individual large urban districts to students in the nation, in large central cities (taken as a whole), in the states, and in other participating districts. Such comparative data appear in NCES reports on the 2002 and 2003 TUDA, and one can also make one' s own comparisons using the NAEP Data Tool available on the NCES web site (http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/naepdata). I am excited about the opportunity to provide the public with comparative information about student performance in large urban districts. Additional information will be available after TUDA is conducted again in 2005. However, the program retains its trial status. The decision whether to make urban district assessments a permanent part of NAEP will be made only after NCES and the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) further evaluate the results. Featured Topic: NAEP Trial Urban District Assessment voluntarily in the NAEP 2002 Trial Urban District Assessment in reading at grades 4 and 8. Results are also included in this report for the District of Columbia, which, in 2002 and past years, has been included in the main assessments with states and other jurisdictions. Data for public schools across the nation and for central city public schools are provided for comparison purposes.* The public schools also included charter schools, which in some cases were not managed by the urban school district. NAEP does not provide scores for individual students or schools. It reports results for groups of students (e.g., fourth-graders). For each group in each table in the report, assessment results are described in one of two ways: the group' s average reading score on a scale from 0 to 500 or the percentage of students in the group who reached each of three achievement levels: Basic, Proficient, and Advanced. The Proficient level for each grade is defined by NAGB as representing \"solid academic performance,\" which demonstrates \"competency over challenging subject matter\" for the grade assessed. Basic indicates partial mastery of skills that are fundamental for proficient work. Advanced denotes superior performance. The achievement levels are performance standards adopted by NAGB as part of its statutory responsibilities. The achievement levels are a collective judgment of what students should know and be able to do for each grade tested. As provided by law, NCES, upon review of a congressionally mandated evaluation of NAEP, determined that the achievement levels are to be used on a trial basis and should be interpreted with caution. However, both NCES and NAGB believe that the performance standards are useful for understanding trends in student achievement. They have been widely used by national and state officials and others as a common yardstick of academic performance. The results are based on representative samples of students for the nation, for schools in central cities, and for participating districts. In order to obtain reliable and representative data, a large proportion of the selected schools and students must participate. All six districts met the NCES statistical participation criteria for NAEP samples at grade 4, but New York City data are not reported for grade 8 because eighth-grade participation did not meet the criteria. Some students are identified by the school districts as students with disabilities or limited-English-proficient students. Some of these students are excluded from the assessment, and others are tested with accommodations related to their status. Because the percentages of students identified, excluded, and assessed with accommodations vary across the urban districts, that variability should be taken into consideration in interpreting the results and making comparisons. For example, in the case of fourth-grade students, the percentages of students identified as having disabilities or limited English proficiency ranged from 8 to 51 percent, the percentages of fourth-grade students excluded for these reasons ranged from 2 to 17 percent, and the percentages assessed with accommodations ranged from 1 to 8 percent. At the eighth grade, the percentages of students identified with disabilities or limited English proficiency ranged from 6 to 35 percent, the percentages of eighth-grade students excluded for these reasons ranged from 2 to 7 percent, and the percentages assessed with accommodations ranged from 0 to 8 percent.

This report examines patterns and trends in the vocational/ technical coursetaking of public high school graduates between 1982 and 1998. It updates and expands upon trends that were published in the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) report Vocational Education in the United States: Toward the Year 2000 (Levesque et al. 2000). Specifically, the current report includes trends in the participation of graduates based on their special and protected population status, including race/ethnicity, sex, disability status, English proficiency, and several measures of student academic achievement, as well as school urbanicity and school poverty level. The report analyzes these trends by examining high school transcripts for the graduating classes of 1982, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1998. 1 The analysis samples and variables used in the report are comparable across the survey years. The analysis focuses on public high school graduates who earned regular or honors diplomas. 2 Transcripts provide information on the courses that public high school graduates took in grades 9 through 12. For simplicity' s sake, the report refers to this information as \"high school coursetaking.\" With the exception of a few tables that examine coursetaking in each grade (9 through 12) separately, the report describes the cumulative coursework that graduates took in high school. The report is intended to accompany the NCES report Trends in High School Vocational/Technical Coursetaking: 1982(Levesque 2003, which provides an in-depth examination of the vocational/technical coursetaking patterns of public high school graduates in general."}, {"section_title": "Parents' highest level of education", "text": "Eighth-grade students who participated in the Trial Urban District Assessment were asked to indicate the highest level of education they thought that their parents had completed.

In addition to the main reports on the Trial Urban District Assessment in reading and in writing (summarized earlier in this issue of the Quarterly), each district receives customized overviews of its results. For each subject at each grade level, a one-page Trial Urban District Assessment Snapshot Report summarizes the performance of public school students in the district. Each snapshot report includes overall results (average scale scores and percentages of students at each NAEP achievement level), results for various subgroups and subgroup score gaps, and average scale scores at selected percentiles. By way of example, figure A shows the snapshot report on the reading performance of New York City fourth-graders (the report was reduced to 80 percent of actual size in order to fit into this article).

Daane, Arlene W. Weiner, and Ying Jin  The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the nation' s ongoing representative sample survey of student achievement in core subject areas. NAEP, known as the Nation' s Report Card, is authorized by Congress and administered by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the Institute of Education Sciences in the U.S. Department of Education. NAEP regularly reports to the public on the educational progress of students in grades 4, 8, and 12. In 2002, NAEP assessed the reading and writing performance of the nation' s fourth-, eighth-, and twelfth-grade students. NAEP also conducted assessments of fourth-and eighth-graders' reading and writing in most of the states. In 2001, after discussion among NCES, the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB), and the leadership of the Council of the Great City Schools, Congress appropriated funds for a trial district-level assessment and NAGB passed a resolution approving the selection of five large urban districts for participation in the Trial Urban District Assessment, a special project within NAEP. This report presents, for the first time, results of NAEP' s Trial Urban District Assessment in writing for public school students in the following participating urban school districts: Atlanta City, Chicago School District 299, Houston Independent School District, Los Angeles Unified, and New York City Public Schools. This represents NAEP' s first assessment of urban districts based on samples specially designed to allow reporting of subgroup data. The five districts participated voluntarily in the NAEP 2002 Trial Urban District Assessment in writing at grades 4 and 8. Results for the District of Columbia, which in this and past NAEP assessments has been sampled and assessed along with states and other jurisdictions, are also included in this report. Data for public schools across the nation and for central city public schools are provided for comparison purposes.* The public schools sampled also included charter schools, which in some cases were not managed by the urban school districts. NAEP does not provide scores for individual students or schools. It reports results for groups of students (e.g., fourth-graders). For each group in each table in the report, assessment results are described in one of two ways. First, the group' s average writing score is reported on a scale from 0 to 300. Performance for each grade is scaled separately; therefore, average scale scores cannot be compared across grades. The term \"average score\" is used throughout this report to refer to the average scale score on the NAEP writing scale. Second, student writing performance is reported in terms of the percentage of students in the group who reached each of three achievement levels: Basic, Proficient, and Advanced. The Proficient level for each grade is defined by NAGB as representing \"solid academic performance,\" which demonstrates \"competency over challenging subject matter\" for the grade assessed. Basic indicates partial mastery of skills that are fundamental for proficient work. Advanced denotes superior performance. The achievement levels are performance standards adopted by NAGB as part of its statutory responsibilities. The achievement levels are a collective judgment of what students should know and be able to do for each grade tested. As provided by law, NCES, upon review of a congressionally mandated evaluation of NAEP, determined that the achievement levels are to be used on a trial basis and should be interpreted with caution. However, both NCES and NAGB believe that the performance standards are useful for understanding trends in student achievement. They have been widely used by national and state officials and others as a common yardstick of academic performance. The results are based on representative samples of students for the nation, for participating districts, and for schools in central cities. In order to obtain reliable data, sufficient numbers of the selected schools and students must participate in the assessment. All six districts met the NCES participation criteria for NAEP samples at grade 4, but results for New York City schools at grade 8 are not reported because they did not meet the participation criteria. Some students are identified by the school districts as students with disabilities or limited-English-proficient students. Some of these students are excluded from the assessment, and others are tested with accommodations *\"Central city\" includes a nationally representative sample of public schools located in central cities within metropolitan statistical areas as defined by the federal Office of Management and Budget. A central city is a city of 50,000 or more that is the largest in its metropolitan area, or can otherwise be regarded as \"central.\" The term means \"a city that is central,\" not \"the central part of a city\" or the \"inner city.\" Note that central cities encompass wider areas than what is commonly referred to as \"the inner city.\" Featured Topic: NAEP Trial Urban District Assessment related to their status. Three of the six districts identified between 30 and 52 percent of their students as either students with disabilities or limited-English-proficient students. Because the percentages of students identified, excluded, and assessed with accommodations vary across the districts, that variability should be taken into consideration in interpreting the results and making comparisons."}, {"section_title": "Overall Writing Results for the Urban Districts", "text": "The following summary describes results first in terms of average scale scores and then in terms of achievement levels.

Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and New York City volunteered for the district-level testing after the Council of the Great City Schools approached the National Assessment Governing Board in the fall of 2000 with a proposal to allow cities to get NAEP results similar to those that participating states have been receiving for many years. Results from the District of Columbia, which participates in NAEP's statelevel assessments, were analyzed along with those from the other cities. The bid for district-level results was a surprise to many, coming as it did from the nation' s big-city school systems, but the Council made it for a number of reasons: \u25a0 First, the nation' s urban school systems wanted to make it crystal clear once again that they are fully committed to the highest academic standards for their students. \u25a0 Second, they wanted a way of gauging their progress and evaluating their reforms in ways that the nation' s current state-by-state testing system does not allow. \u25a0 Third, they wanted to be able to compare themselves against other school systems facing many of the same challenges."}, {"section_title": "Establishing a Benchmark", "text": "There were realistic expectations, of course, about what the initial results would show.

Tables 1 and 2 indicate that the majority of students in these cities, unlike the nation as a whole, were eligible for free or reduced-price school lunch (intended for children near or below the poverty line). The proportion of limited-English-proficient (LEP) students in some of the cities was also considerably higher than the national average. Finally, each of the TUDA cities had enrollments that were predominantly Black or Hispanic, a situation that is significantly different from national averages (not shown in tables 1 and 2)."}, {"section_title": "Subgroup results", "text": "The initial TUDA results also provided data on achievement by race/ethnicity, eligibility for free or reduced-price school lunch, and other student characteristics, giving analysts and practitioners a better sense of how the performance of subgroups in the cities compares with that of the same subgroups nationally. The reading results, for instance, indicated that White students, in general, scored at about the same level in TUDA cities as White students nationally. Black students  and students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, on the other hand, generally had lower average scores in TUDA cities than nationally. And Hispanic students in TUDA cities had average scores about the same as or lower than the national average for Hispanic students. In a number of cities, however, Black, Hispanic, and poor students had reading scores that equaled those of their racial/ethnic and income peers nationally. For example, Black fourth-and eighth-graders in Houston had average scores that did not differ significantly from those of their Black peers nationally. The same was true of Black fourthgraders in New York City and Black eighth-graders in Chicago. At both the fourth and the eighth grades, Hispanic students in three TUDA cities scored about the same as their Hispanic peers nationally. At the fourth grade in New York City and Houston, and at the eighth grade in Chicago, students eligible for free or reduced-price school lunch posted average scores that were statistically indistinguishable from those of eligible students nationally. A number of interesting results emerged from the writing assessment as well. White students in TUDA cities generally posted average scores that were about the same as or above the national average for White students. Black fourth-and eighth-graders in Houston and Black fourth-graders in New York City outscored their Black peers nationally, while Black students in other TUDA cities scored lower than or about the same as Black students nationally. In almost all cases, the average scores of Hispanic students in TUDA cities were about the same as the average for Hispanic students nationally. Students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch often scored lower in TUDA cities than nationally. In three cities, however, scores of eligible fourth-graders were about the same as the national average for eligible fourth-graders."}, {"section_title": "Gaps between different subgroups", "text": "The 2002 TUDA results provided fresh data on the size of the achievement gaps within and across the participating cities and how they stack up to gaps nationwide. In some cities, gaps between the achievement of certain subgroups (e.g., White students and Black students) differed from the gaps in the nation as a whole. In other cities, the gaps reflected national averages. At grade 4, for example, the results showed that gaps between the average reading and writing scores of White and Black students in Atlanta and the District of Columbia were wider than the national gaps. But in Houston, Los Angeles, and New York City, the fourth-grade reading and writing gaps between Black and White students were about the same as those nationally."}, {"section_title": "Promoting Improvement in Big-City Schools", "text": "TUDA results are important to cities and to others interested in the reform and improvement of big-city schools. They provide much-needed data on urban school performance that allows comparisons in ways that the nation' s state-by-state assessment system cannot (Council of the Great City Schools 2003). TUDA will also provide valuable insights into the performance of big-city schools over time.*  But the promise of TUDA stretches well beyond its ability to determine whether big-city schools are improving. Its real importance rests in its power to shed light eventually on which reforms are working and which ones are not. TUDA presents the cities and researchers interested in analyzing patterns in urban schools with a chance to establish a longterm, informal field experiment where each city' s reforms can be gauged against others using a common benchmark. This kind of research is not commonly done at present, however, in part because there is no common metric on which cities can be measured and in part because it is hard to do. The overwhelming majority of research on urban education is devoted to efforts to turn around individual schools or pockets of schools; efforts to assess the effects of discrete programs or program strategies; and efforts to measure student demographic and background characteristics and the effects of these characteristics on performance. Some observers have argued that the way to bring about wide-scale improvement in urban education is to take what has been learned about each individual school or program and apply it systemwide. This approach has had limited success, however, because it does not help school practitioners sort through the numerous programs or leverage systemwide change. Very few reforms or research studies, in fact, have focused on how one improves an individual system or how one accelerates improvements across many cities. Public impatience and No Child Left Behind will no longer allow the nation' s major city school districts to improve themselves using a school-by-school strategy. Time will not allow such a piecemeal approach. Instead, the public and the new law are demanding improvements in city schools writ large. And city school leaders, for their part, need better research on strategies that will help improve student performance systemwide, not just in some schools or for some students. The lack of solid research on how to turn around public school systems in big cities has been frustrating both for the urban school districts themselves and for others. There has been little way, for instance, to determine which big-city school systems were improving student achievement the most. Consequently, there has been little way to determine for sure what those faster improving school districts were doing to get their gains that others were not doing (Snipes, Doolittle, and Herlihy 2002). If we had comparable data to tell us, for example, that Black students in Atlanta were improving faster in reading than Black students in other cities, then we would know where to look for promising practices about how to accelerate the reading skills of Black students. If city school systems with varying governance structures were improving at about the same rates, we might conclude that governance structure was not the critical ingredient in the gains. If academic progress in one set of cities extended beyond 3 years, then we might be able to say something about how to sustain the effects of reform. If cities of similar composition were making progress in some states but not in others, then we might be able to ask better questions about the role of states in boosting urban performance. If faster improving cities were using a single reading curriculum and slower moving cities were relying on individual-school reform models, then urban school leaders might have a better sense about how to structure their instructional programs. If faster improving cities had spending levels that were below their respective statewide averages, then researchers and advocates might have a better understanding about the role of money in improving urban schools. Asking questions of this kind requires a more institutional, systemic, and organizational outlook about the behavior of urban school districts than many in the reform movement or the research community have hitherto shown. There are only a handful of people nationwide, in fact, who think in terms like these. Yet, answers to these and similar questions are critical if urban education is to give the public the results that it wants. Ultimately, urban school leaders will never be able to get gains \"at scale\" unless they think at scale. TUDA allows that to begin happening. TUDA will not answer questions about improving big-city school systems on its own, of course. There are too many moving gears in urban schools for us to be certain about anything. But TUDA gives urban educators and others another tool with which to ask better questions. The 2002 TUDA results are only a starting point. Over time and with a larger pool of participating cities, critical questions about how to leverage improvements in big-city school districts can be answered and acted upon. Urban school leaders are determined to raise student performance in their communities. TUDA will help let them know if they are succeeding. More importantly, TUDA can help them succeed faster. It is an experiment worth pursuing."}, {"section_title": "ELEMENTARY A N D SECONDARY EDUCATION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "NAEP Writing 2002", "text": "The Nation's Report Card: Writing 2002"}, {"section_title": "Persky, Mary C.

Occupational education consists of courses that teach skills and knowledge required in a particular occupation or set of related occupations. General labor market preparation consists of courses that teach general employment skills that are not specific to one occupational area, such as basic typewriting/ keyboarding, introductory technology education, and career preparation and general work experience courses. Family and consumer sciences education consists of courses intended to prepare students for family and consumer roles outside the paid labor market. 3 For purposes of this report, trends focus on vocational/technical coursetaking overall and on occupational coursetaking. Although vocational/technical coursetaking is prevalent in high schools, students take varying amounts and types of these courses and take them for different purposes. This report emphasizes the coursetaking patterns of occupational concentrators because this group is a common focus of federal and state accountability and research efforts for vocational/technical education (U.S. Department of Education 2002; Silverberg et al. 2002). Occupational concentrators are graduates who earned 3.0 or more credits during high school in one of the following 10 broad occupational program areas: agriculture, business, marketing, health care, protective services, trade and industry, technology, food service and hospitality, child care and education, and personal and other services. In some cases, the report also examines trends in concentrating (earning 3.0 or more credits) in 18 narrow occupational program areas. 4 Vocational/Technical Education Public High School Graduates Who Participated in Vocational/Technical Education: 1982-1998  1990, 1994, and 1998 regarding 1990, 1994, and 1998 graduates, respectively. 2 The HS&B and NELS studies excluded students with the most severe disabilities, where it was determined by school staff that these students were unable to complete the lengthy student questionnaires that were a part of these studies. In order to ensure comparability across the data sets, graduates with special education diplomas were excluded from the HSTS samples (Gifford et al. 1989;Tuma 1996). Thus, the samples used for this trend analysis were consistent with the population of public high school graduates, including students with disabilities, who earned regular or honors diplomas in each of the study years. In addition, there may be some minor coding differences between NELS and the other transcript data that may affect the data for 1992. See appendix C of the full report for more information. 3 Home economics-related courses that prepare students for the paid labor market are included under occupational education."}, {"section_title": "4", "text": "These include agriculture, business services, business management, marketing, health care, protective services, construction, mechanics and repair, print production, materials production, other precision production, transportation, computer technology, communications technology, other technology, food service and hospitality, child care and education, and personal and other services.\nRace categories exclude Hispanic origin unless specified.\nThe phrase \"4 years or less\" refers to completion of the bachelor's degree in 48 months or less from postsecondary entry; \"4-5 years\" refers to completion in 49-60 months; \"up to 6 years\" or \"6 years or less\" refers to completion in 72 months or less; and \"more than 10 years\" refers to completion in more than 120 months. A final component of the analysis was restricted to firsttime bachelor' s degree recipients who had not interrupted their postsecondary enrollment longer than 6 months. The average time between postsecondary entry and bachelor' s degree completion for these graduates was 4 years and 7 months (55 months), 5 and it was longer for graduates of public institutions (57 months) than for graduates of private not-for-profit institutions (51 months). A number of other factors were related to the average amount of time between postsecondary entry and degree completion. Parents' educational attainment was inversely related to students' time to degree: as parents' education increased, students' average time to complete a degree decreased. In addition, there was an inverse relationship between students' cumulative grade-point average and the time it took them to finish a degree. This relationship was found both overall and for graduates of public institutions, but no difference was detected for graduates of private notfor-profit institutions. Delaying enrollment in postsecond-ary education after completing high school was also associated with the time it took students to complete a bachelor's degree once they enrolled: students who delayed entry took longer to complete a degree once enrolled. Finally, those who enrolled in more institutions took longer to complete a degree, even when graduates who had extended enrollment interruptions between institutions were excluded. For example, graduates who attended only one institution completed the degree in an average of 4 years and 3 months (51 months), while those who attended two institutions took about 8 months longer, on average (59 months)."}, {"section_title": "Key population variables", "text": "The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1998 (1998 Perkins Act) defines \"special populations\" as follows: \u25a0 individuals with disabilities; \u25a0 individuals from economically disadvantaged families, including foster children; \u25a0 individuals preparing for occupations that are nontraditional for their gender; \u25a0 single parents, including single pregnant women; \u25a0 displaced homemakers; and \u25a0 individuals with other barriers to educational achievement, including individuals with limited English proficiency. The 1990 Perkins Act, which governed the second half of the period covered in this report (1990)(1991)(1992)(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998), defined \"special populations\" fairly similarly, including individuals with handicaps, educationally and economically disadvantaged individuals (including foster children), individuals of limited English proficiency, individuals who participate in programs designed to eliminate sex bias, and individuals in correctional institutions. In addition, the Office for Civil Rights (2001) in the U.S. Department of Education enforces federal statutes that prohibit discrimination in education programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance (such as Perkins Act funds) on the following bases: race, color, national origin, sex, disability, and age. To the extent possible, this report provides information on trends in the vocational/technical coursetaking of these special and protected populations, as well as their peers who were not members of these groups. To do so, the report uses the following categories. Measures were selected based on federal definitions, previous related research, and data availability. Data were provided only for those years and surveys that contained comparable variables. For the sake of readability when summarizing findings, the report uses the terms disadvantaged and advantaged to describe student groups on some of the key variables, as indicated below. 5 Race/ethnicity. Includes the five categories of American Indian/Alaska Native; Asian/Pacific Islander; Hispanic; non-Hispanic Black; and non-Hispanic White. For simplicity' s sake, the text refers to Black and White graduates, although students in both of these groups were also non-Hispanic."}, {"section_title": "Sex.", "text": "Includes the two categories of male and female. Disability status (grade 12). Includes students who were reported to have a disability and students who were reported to have no disability as of grade 12. It should be remembered, however, that graduates with the most severe disabilities were excluded from the analysis due to survey constraints. Consequently, the disability status variable identifies students with and without disabilities among the population of public high school graduates who earned regular or honors diplomas. 6 For purposes of this analysis, students with disabilities were considered to be \"disadvantaged,\" while students without disabilities were considered to be more \"advantaged.\" English proficiency (grade 12). Includes the two categories of limited English proficiency and English proficient. It is important to note that this variable describes students' English language proficiency as of grade 12. For purposes of this analysis, graduates who had limited English proficiency in grade 12 were considered to be \"disadvantaged,\" while graduates who were English proficient in grade 12 were considered to be more \"advantaged.\" The report uses the following three measures of academic achievement: 7 Grade point average (GPA). Calculated from grades recorded in the transcript files, this variable has a range of 0.0 to 4.0. It was not possible in some of the surveys to calculate GPA for academic courses only (a preferable measure of academic achievement), so overall GPA was used. GPA was collapsed into three categories: high GPA (greater than 3.5); mid-level GPA (2.0 to 3.5); and low GPA (less than 2.0). For purposes of this analysis, students with a GPA of less than 2.0 were considered to be \"disadvantaged\"; students with a GPA of 2.0 to 3.5 were considered to be \"moderately advantaged\"; and students with a GPA of greater than 3.5 were considered to be \"highly advantaged.\" 7 The final federal regulations to the 1990 Perkins Act used grade point average to define academically disadvantaged individuals. The other two measures were suggested by previous research on whether vocational education has been a \"dumping ground\" for low academically achieving students (Boesel et al. 1994). The 1998 Perkins Act offered no additional guidance for identifying students with barriers to educational achievement, other than limited English proficiency. Academic coursework completed. This variable describes whether students completed all low or all high mathematics, science, and English courses, or some other combination of mathematics, science, and English courses (midlevel or mixed academic coursetaking). Low and high mathematics, science, and English courses are defined in the glossary (appendix B) and technical appendix (appendix C) of the full report. For purposes of this analysis, students completing all low-level academic coursework were considered to be \"disadvantaged\"; students completing all high-level academic coursework were considered to be \"highly advantaged\"; and students completing mid-level or mixed academic coursework were considered to be \"moderately advantaged.\" Grade 9 mathematics. This variable identifies the mathematics course a student took in grade 9. It includes the three categories of high-level grade 9 mathematics (geometry or higher), mid-level grade 9 mathematics (pre-algebra or algebra 1), and low-level mathematics (no mathematics or mathematics courses below pre-algebra). It provides a measure of academic achievement before most of graduates' coursework in vocational/technical education was taken and is therefore less confounded with that coursetaking than either GPA or academic coursework completed. For purposes of this analysis, students who took low-level mathematics in grade 9 were considered to be \"disadvantaged\"; students who took mid-level grade 9 mathematics were considered to be \"moderately advantaged\"; and students who took high-level grade 9 mathematics were considered to be \"highly advantaged.\" Although a student-level measure of socioeconomic status would have been preferable for this analysis, such a variable was not available from the 1990, 1994, and 1998 High School Transcript Studies (HSTS). Instead, the report uses the following two school-level variables as measures of economic status: 8 School urbanicity. This variable describes the location of the school a graduate attended in the 12th grade and includes the three categories of urban, suburban, and rural. These categories are defined further in appendixes B and C of the full report. School poverty level. This variable describes the proportion of students in the school a graduate attended in the 12th grade who participated in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). It includes the categories of high poverty (greater than 50 percent in NSLP) and low poverty (5 percent or less in NSLP), with a middle group having greater than 5 percent but no greater than 50 percent of students in NSLP. This variable also includes a category for students whose schools did not report their participation in NSLP. For purposes of this analysis, students in high-poverty schools were considered to be \"disadvantaged,\" while students in low-poverty schools were considered to be \"highly advantaged.\" The middle group was considered to be of mixed advantage. The variable is defined further in appendixes B and C of the full report. It should be remembered that there may be a fairly high correlation among some of these population variables. The report does not attempt to isolate the unique contribution of each factor to participation in vocational/technical education. Instead, the report describes bivariate relationships according to NCES standards for this type of analysis. See appendix C of the full report for additional information on the technical methodology used."}, {"section_title": "Vocational/Technical Coursetaking in 1998", "text": "Overall patterns among 1998 graduates Although most 1998 public high school graduates took at least some vocational/technical and occupational coursework, graduates who were members of disadvantaged groups generally took more vocational/technical and occupational coursework and were more likely to concentrate in occupational education than their counterparts who were members of more advantaged groups. These differences were apparent with regard to disability status in grade 12, GPA, academic coursework completed, grade 9 mathematics, and school poverty. One exception was that students who had limited English proficiency in grade 12 generally took less vocational/technical and occupational coursework and were less likely to concentrate in occupational education than their English-proficient peers. In addition, male graduates took more vocational/technical and occupational coursework than female graduates, and students in rural schools took more such coursework than students in either urban or suburban schools. In contrast, Asians/Pacific Islanders generally took less vocational/ technical and occupational coursework than graduates in other racial/ethnic groups, particularly Black and White graduates. 8 Section 421 of the 1990 Perkins Act included information on students in rural and urban areas in its identification of economically disadvantaged students. The final regulations to the 1990 Perkins Act also included eligibility for the National School Lunch Program in the definition of this group. The 1998 Perkins Act provided no additional guidance on defining economically disadvantaged students. Although disadvantaged students were more likely to participate in vocational/technical education in general, and to concentrate in occupational education in particular, these students represented a minority of all occupational concentrators. In fact, when students were classified into three groups (low-, moderate-or middle-, and high-advantage), the majority of occupational concentrators (about 60 percent or more) came from the middle groups. This pattern was apparent with regard to GPA, academic coursework completed, grade 9 mathematics, and school poverty. In each case, either occupational concentrators were more likely to be from the middle groups than was the 1998 public high school class as a whole, or no significant difference was detected in the proportion of occupational concentrators and all graduates who were from these groups. Moreover, no significant difference was detected in the proportion of occupational concentrators and all graduates who were from the lowest academic achievement groups. However, occupational concentrators were less likely than the 1998 graduating class as a whole to be from the highest academic achievement groups. In the cases of disability status and English proficiency in grade 12, most occupational concentrators (more than 95 percent) came from advantaged (rather than disadvantaged) groups. While a larger proportion of occupational concentrators than of the 1998 graduating class as a whole were disabled in grade 12, the proportion of occupational concentrators who had limited English proficiency in grade 12 was lower than that for all 1998 graduates. The majority of occupational concentrators (more than 50 percent) were White and were male. In fact, occupational concentrators were more likely to be male than the 1998 graduating class as a whole. 9 With regard to school urbanicity, no school type enrolled a majority of occupational concentrators. However, occupational concentrators were more likely to attend rural schools than urban schools. 10 While academically disadvantaged graduates were more likely than their more advantaged peers to concentrate in occupational education generally, this pattern was reversed to some extent in certain occupational program areas. Notably, higher achieving students were somewhat more likely than their lower achieving peers to concentrate in communications technology."}, {"section_title": "Trends in Vocational/Technical Coursetaking: 1982 to 1998 11", "text": "The average number of credits graduates earned in vocational/technical education declined from 1982 to 1990, after which no significant changes were detected. One question of interest to policymakers is whether these declines occurred across the board or only among certain subgroups of students. Most often, vocational/technical coursetaking declines occurred among groups earning numbers of vocational/ technical credits that were not statistically different from the average for all 1982 graduates. In comparison, there were few significant changes detected in the average number of vocational/technical credits earned by several groups that earned above-average numbers of vocational/technical credits in 1982. At the same time, there were no significant changes detected between 1982 and 1998 in the average number of vocational/technical credits earned by several groups that earned below-average numbers of vocational/ technical credits in 1982 compared with all 1982 graduates. As a consequence of these changes, there were few shifts among subgroups of graduates with regard to their relative vocational/technical coursetaking patterns over the period studied. That is, most groups that earned above-average numbers of vocational/technical credits in 1982 still earned above-average numbers of such credits as of 1998 (including low academic achievers and students attending rural schools). In addition, all groups that earned below-average numbers of vocational/technical credits in 1982 still earned below-average numbers of such credits as of 1998 (including Asians/Pacific Islanders and high academic achievers). Finally, despite the coursetaking declines noted above, most groups that earned numbers of vocational/technical credits in 1982 that were not statistically different from the average for all 1982 graduates were also in this middle coursetaking group as of 1998. In contrast to declines in vocational/technical coursetaking, there was no statistically significant change between 1982 and 1998 in the average number of occupational credits that graduates earned in high school. However, trends varied somewhat among student groups.

In addition, there were few significant changes detected between 1982 and 1998 in the concentration rates for several groups that exhibited below-average occupational concentration rates in 1982 compared with all 1982 graduates.

This report examines the participation of public high school graduates in vocational/technical education between 1982 and 1998, focusing on the participation of graduates based on their special and protected population status. Trends in participation for most subgroups reflected overall trends for graduates. Generally, graduates decreased their vocational/technical coursetaking between 1982 and 1998, although their occupational coursetaking was relatively steady. The percentage of graduates concentrating in occupational education (earning 3.0 or more credits in one of the 10 broad occupational program areas cited in the report) also declined over the period. A few groups of graduates exhibited exceptions to these general trends, however. In particular, graduates with disabilities as of grade 12 took more vocational and occupational coursework by the end of the period studied. In addition, Asians/Pacific Islanders and high academic achievers earned numbers of vocational credits and exhibited occupational concentration rates at the end of the period that were not statistically different from corresponding figures for 1982. Thus, these latter groups did not exhibit the usual declines. Both Asians/Pacific Islanders and high academic achievers participated in vocational/technical education at below-average rates at the beginning of the period. As of 1998, there were differences in participation in vocational/technical education on all of the variables examined in the report: race/ethnicity, sex, disability status, English proficiency, academic achievement, and school urbanicity and poverty level. In particular, groups exhibiting relatively high levels of participation in vocational/ technical education in comparison with their peers included males, graduates with disabilities as of grade 12, low academic achievers, and graduates in rural and in high-poverty schools. In contrast, females, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and graduates who had limited English proficiency as of grade 12 exhibited relatively low levels of such participation. With regard to computer-related coursetaking, groups exhibiting relatively low levels of participation in comparison with their 1998 peers included students with disabilities as of grade 12, low academic achievers, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and students in low-poverty and in urban and suburban schools. Among these groups, 1998 graduates who had disabilities as of grade 12 and graduates who were low academic achievers also earned fewer core academic credits than their more advantaged counterparts. However, 1998 graduates who were Asian/Pacific Islander as well as female graduates earned relatively large numbers of core academic credits in comparison with their peers. All of these core academic coursetaking patterns also held for the subset of graduates who were occupational concentrators. On measures that classified students into three levels of advantage (low-, moderate-or middle-, and high-advantage), most occupational concentrators were from the middle groups. In some cases, occupational concentrators were more likely to be from the middle groups than was the 1998 public high school class as a whole. Although no significant difference was detected in the proportion of occupational concentrators and all graduates who were from the lowest academic achievement groups, occupational concentrators were less likely than the 1998 graduating class as a whole to be from the highest academic achievement groups. Findings from surveys of adults in general (Ikenberry and Hartle 1998) and of parents of college-age children (Miller 1997) suggest that Americans place a high value on obtaining a college education, but that they have difficulty estimating college costs. This study uses data from the Parent and Youth Surveys of the 1999 National Household Education Surveys Program (NHES:1999) to investigate how much \"college-bound\" 1 students in grades 6 through 12 and their parents know about the cost of attending college, and the relationships between their knowledge of college costs and how they go about preparing for college. 2 It examines whether parents had started to save for their children' s education, gathered information on financial aid, and knew about various tax credits to help offset costs. Students were asked about discussions they had with parents or teachers/counselors to learn about college costs, academic requirements, and financial aid availability. The base sample of this report consists of 7,910 6th-through 12th-grade students who participated in the Youth Survey of NHES:1999. Parent data used in this report were collected through the Parent Survey of NHES:1999 from the parents of these students. Because of this sample design, the data can be used to analyze both students' own plans and their parents' plans for students' postsecondary education. Findings can be generalized to all 6th-through 12th-graders, but not to all parents of 6th-through 12th-graders. Student and parent cost estimates are compared against price data collected directly from postsecondary institutions."}, {"section_title": "Almost All Plan to Attend College", "text": "In 1999, the vast majority of 6th-through 12th-graders (94 percent) and their parents (96 percent) responded \"yes\" to the question \"Do you think (you/your child) will attend school after high school?\" Ninety-one percent of both students and their parents agreed that the students would attend college or some other type of postsecondary institution. Among students and parents who reported such plans, 45 percent of students and roughly one-half of parents  thought the students would attend a 4-year college, while 17 percent of students and one-quarter of parents reported plans for students to attend a 2-year institution.

While students in 11th and 12th grades were more likely to have acquired cost information than their 9th-and 10th-grade counterparts, just 52 percent of 11th-and 12th-graders had acquired such information (figure A).

An additional 11 percent of students in grades 11 and 12 thought they could accurately estimate tuition and fees, and an additional 17 percent of 11th-and 12th-graders had parents who thought they could accurately estimate tuition and fees. Considering both students and their parents jointly, about 38 percent of 11th-and 12th-grade students had either acquired information about college prices or thought they could estimate costs, and had parents who reported the same. The likelihood of having knowledge of college prices increased with household income and parents' education for both students and parents. In addition, parents of White students were more likely than parents of either Black or Hispanic students, and White students more likely than Hispanic students, to report knowledge of college costs.

While 20 percent of undergraduates were charged $20,000 or more in annual tuition, 38 percent of 11th-and 12th-graders and 27 percent of their parents thought it would cost at least $20,000 annually to attend. However, when looking only at the overall average, no difference could be detected between parents' estimates ($14,506) and the actual average tuition for private 4-year colleges ($14,709). Thus, parents of children who planned to attend private 4-year institutions appeared to be more aware of the costs at these institutions than their counterparts whose children planned to attend comparable public colleges. Because college tuition varies substantially from state to state , further analyses were conducted to determine how accurately students and their  parents could estimate tuition for the type of institution students planned to attend within their state of residence. Accurate estimates were defined as those within 25 percent of the actual state average. 7 As shown in figure D, one-quarter of 11th-and 12th-graders and about one-third (31 percent) of their parents were able to provide accurate estimates. Moreover, both students and their parents were much more likely to overestimate than to underestimate tuition. Finally, 37 percent of 11th-and 12th-graders and 29 percent of their parents could not estimate yearly tuition for the type of college the students hoped to attend. In looking at all students included in the survey (i.e., 6th-through 12th-graders) who were planning to attend postsecondary education, the likelihood of being able to estimate tuition accurately increased with household income. For their parents, both household income and parents' education level (i.e., the higher the level, the more likely they were to estimate accurately) were associated with the ability to estimate tuition."}, {"section_title": "Getting Ready for College", "text": "Students and parents were asked separate questions in NHES:1999 about their preparations for college.

The likelihood of parents reporting that they had begun saving or making other financial preparations to pay for their child' s college education increased with household income. Parental planning was also related to students' academic standing in school: as grade point average increased, so did the likelihood that parents reported saving money, gathering information about financial aid, and knowing about college tax credits. No relationship was detected between the proximity of students starting postsecondary education and their parents' plans to pay for it. Focusing on students who intended to go to college, 63 percent of 11th-and 12th-graders and 59 per-cent of 9th-and 10th-graders had parents who had made some financial preparations. The apparent difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, there was not a detectable difference between the percentage of collegebound 9th-and 10th-graders (59 percent) and the percentage of college-bound 6th-through 8th-graders (57 percent) with parents who had made financial preparations. A similar percentage (58 percent) of college-bound 11thand 12th-graders' parents had sought information about financial aid availability, and about one-third (34 percent) were aware of the Lifetime Learning and/or HOPE Scholarship tax credits.

And just over two-thirds (69 percent) reported having conversations about the type of college they expected to attend. However, half or fewer reported discussing college costs or financial aid with parents or teachers/counselors. As might be expected, the likelihood of reporting such discussions increased as students approached college age. By 11th and 12th grades, over 90 percent of students reported having discussions about academic requirements or the type of college to attend, and about three-quarters (71 to 75 percent) reported discussions about college costs and financial aid. Students' discussions about aspects of college had little relationship to either household income or parents' education levels. However, there was a positive relationship between students knowing what type of institution they wanted to attend and the likelihood of students discussing college cost requirements with their parents or their teachers/counselors.

The multivariate analysis of students' and parents' cost awareness controlled for interrelated variables that reflected student characteristics, family background, students' high school experiences (including GPA), and parents' involvement in their children' s school. After applying such controls, a number of variables remained significantly related to cost awareness (figure E). For instance, there were positive relationships between students' and parents' cost awareness and students' grade level (11th-and 12th-graders and their parents were more aware than 9th-and 10th-graders and their parents); parents' education levels (college graduates were more aware than others); and reporting plans to attend private 4-year colleges or universities (compared with public 4-year institutions). In some cases, results differed for students and parents. For example, Black students were more likely than White students to report cost awareness, while for parents the opposite was true: parents of Black students were less likely to be knowledgeable about costs than parents of White students. Although cost awareness among students was not associated with household income, there was a positive relationship between cost awareness and household income among their parents: those with household incomes over $75,000 were more likely to be knowledgeable about the costs than those with household incomes of $50,000 or less. In addition, male students were more cost aware than female students, but students' sex was not associated with parents' cost awareness. Parents' level of involvement in the schools was associated with their cost awareness, but not with students' awareness. Finally, some variables pertained only to students or parents. If students had talked with their parents or with teachers/counselors about college cost requirements or about financial aid, they were more likely to be aware of college costs. Similarly, if parents had talked to someone or read financial aid materials, or if they knew about the availability of either the Lifetime Learning or HOPE Scholarships, they were more likely to be aware of college costs. If cost awareness were high, one would expect a corresponding ability to accurately estimate tuition for the type of institution the student planned to attend. In fact, nearly identical results were found for students' and parents' cost awareness and ability to estimate the costs. That is, most variables related to cost awareness also were related to the ability to estimate 1 year' s tuition accurately. In the end, even after applying statistical controls, the results indicate that the level of awareness students and parents possess about the costs of attending college is positively related to either household income or parents' education levels (or both). However, it is important to note that, regardless of family background, if parents had sought information about financial aid availability or if they knew about other means of offsetting costs (through tax credits), they were much more likely to know what it would cost to send their child to the college the child planned to attend. Similarly, if students had talked to parents or teachers/ counselors about college costs, they too were better able to estimate the tuition of the college they planned to attend."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The public places a high premium on getting a college education (Ikenberry and Hartle 1998;Miller 1997). However, recent media attention on rising college costs (Neusner 2002), combined with a general lack of knowledge about the affordability of many colleges (e.g., the average tuition at public 4-year colleges was $3,000 a year in 1998), may unnecessarily discourage some students and their parents from preparing for college. The results of this analysis reveal that many middle and high school students and, to a lesser extent, their parents do not have an accurate idea of what it costs to attend college. Even among 11th-and 12th-graders who intended to enroll in college, roughly half of both students and their parents  Figure E.

The opposite was found for parents. reported having knowledge of college costs. When asked to estimate 1 year' s tuition, more students and their parents overestimated than underestimated the average amount. Furthermore, nearly 40 percent of 11th-and 12th-graders and nearly 30 percent of their parents could not estimate the cost of 1 year' s tuition. Not surprisingly, the younger the students were, the less aware they or their parents were of college costs. At a time when students still have the opportunity to plan for college and take requisite college preparatory courses (i.e., 9th and 10th grades), 69 percent of 9th-and 10th-graders and 47 percent of their parents could not estimate what it would cost to attend. It is possible that many students, with the encouragement of their parents, plan to attend no matter what the cost. However, the findings of this study also demonstrated a significant knowledge gap between lower and higher income families and between parents who ended their education at high school graduation and those who were college graduates. 9 Thus, the students and parents who can least afford college and who would be most affected by the financial burden were also the least aware of how much it costs to attend. On the other hand, regardless of parents' education and household income, students who were involved in family decisionmaking were more likely to seek out information about college academic requirements and financial aid through discussions with parents and teachers/counselors. Similarly, regardless of income and education levels, parents who were involved in their children' s school were more likely to have begun saving for their college education. In addition, compared with parents who reported low involvement in their children' s school, highly involved parents were more aware of college costs. 9 Parents' education levels and household income are often highly correlated, and families where neither parent attended college are disproportionately represented among lower income groups. For example, in NHES:1999, 89 percent of students whose parents did not attend college were from families where the household income was $25,000 or less, whereas 69 percent of students with college-educated parents were from families where the household income was above $75,000.\nTo retain comparability with the 1984 survey, this study used a working definition of high schools as schools with a highest grade of 11 or 12.

Did this trend in the time between high school and bachelor' s degree completion continue throughout the 1990s? The 2000/01 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:2000/01), which surveys a nationally representative sample of undergraduates who completed a bachelor' s degree between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000, affords the opportunity to address this question. This report provides a basic demographic profile of 1999-2000 bachelor' s degree recipients and examines the institutional paths they took to complete the baccalaureate. It also describes the amount of time it took them to do so, assessed from both the time they completed high school and the time they entered postsecondary education.

In total, these working adults made up roughly one-third of the undergraduate population. This study examines the characteristics and educational experiences of working adult undergraduates, focusing on those who considered employment their primary activity. The analysis compares two groups of working adults according to the emphasis or importance they placed on work and postsecondary enrollment when they were asked: \"While you were enrolled and working would you say you were primarily: 1) a student working to meet expenses or 2) an employee who decided to enroll in school?\" Throughout this report, students who identified themselves as employees who decided to enroll in school are referred to as \"employees who study,\" while those who identified themselves as students working to meet expenses are referred to as \"students who work.\"  \nThis report uses postsecondary transcript data collected as part of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988(NELS:88/2000 to examine aspects of the (1) postsecondary attainment, (2) postsecondary attendance patterns, (3) postsecondary curriculum, and (4) postsecondary performance of a cohort of approximately 9,500 1 individuals (ages 26-27) who were in the 12th grade in 1992 and attended institutions of postsecondary education 2 during the period 1992-2000.

Thus, it is possible to examine the relationship between postsecondary histories and outcomes and earlier high school experiences, attainment, and coursetaking. The evidence of student records as set forth in postsecondary transcript information offers cogent documentation of precisely what college students study, when and where they study it, and how well they perform in each course. It is important to note that transcript records do not do anything more than that. They do not tell us how much students have learned, whether the learning is retained, or what classroom experiences, teaching methods, or delivery systems produced the best results.

Among the guidance activities examined in the survey, the following were the most commonly available at public high schools in 2002: use of college catalogs, individual counseling sessions, use of computerized career information sources, testing and having tests interpreted for career planning purposes, and use of noncomputerized career information sources. These activities were offered by 92 to 100 percent of the schools (table B). In addition, between 73 percent and 87 percent offered occupational information units in subject-matter courses, exploratory work experience programs, career days/nights, vocationally oriented assemblies and speakers in class, job-site tours, tours of postsecondary institutions, job shadowing, group guidance/ counseling sessions, and training in job seeking skills. School courses in career decisionmaking were the least available activity, although this activity was available in 57 percent of all public high schools. Between 1984 and 2002, the proportion of schools offering a guidance activity declined for 3 of the 15 activities-career days/nights, tours of postsecondary institutions, and training in job seeking skills. During this time period, no differences were detected in the proportion of schools indicating that the remaining guidance activities were available. Student participation (regardless of whether an activity is offered) provides a second indicator of the prevalence of guidance activities. 6 The guidance activity in which public high school students participated most often in 2002 was individual counseling sessions (78 percent of students; table C). Fewer students (44 to 61 percent) participated in 8 of the remaining 14 activities-career days/nights, vocationally oriented assemblies and speakers in class, testing and having tests interpreted for career planning purposes, group guidance/counseling sessions, occupational information units in subject-matter courses, the use of noncomputerized career information sources, the use of computerized career information sources, and the use of college catalogs.

No significant differences were detected between these years in the proportion of students who participated in the remaining guidance activities. NOTE: Percentages are based on information provided by public high schools about their students' participation in each activity. Student participation in a guidance activity is reported for all public high schools, regardless of whether the activity was offered by the school. Thus, for these analyses, schools that did not offer an activity were coded as having zero students participating in that activity. In the 1984 supplement to HS&B and the 2002 FRSS survey, schools reported the percentage of 11th-and 12th-grade students who participated in each of the 15 guidance activities. This information was used with enrollment data for grades 11 and 12 to calculate the number of students who participated in an activity at each public high school, and the percentage across all public high schools. Enrollment data for the 2002 FRSS survey items were obtained from the 1999-2000 Common Core of Data (CCD) School Universe file, and enrollment data for the 1984 supplement to HS&B items were taken from the 1980 HS&B data. Thus, national estimates for the percentage of 11th-and 12th-grade students who participated in an activity were calculated by dividing the sum of 11th-and 12th-grade students who participated in the activity by the sum of students enrolled in those grades. In the FRSS survey, public high schools were asked about four school activities that had not been included in the 1984 supplement to HS&B: regularly scheduled group guidance sessions led by teachers or other school staff, a written career plan, a senior project based on the student' s career of interest, and the selection of a career major or path to guide the student' s selection of courses. Schools indicated whether each activity was available and whether it was required of all, some, or no students. In 2002, 77 percent of public high schools indicated that selection of a career major or path was available, and 50 percent of all public high schools required all students to participate in the activity. Sixty-four percent of public high schools indicated that written career plans were available, and 47 percent required all students to participate in the activity. Sixty-three percent of public high schools reported that regularly scheduled group guidance sessions led by teachers or other school staff were available, and 35 percent required all students to participate in the activity. Finally, 31 percent of public high schools reported that senior projects based on the student' s career of interest were available, and 14 percent required all students to participate in that activity.\nThe wording in the questionnaire was \"Internet courses using asynchronous (i.e., not simultaneous) computer-based instruction.\" 4 Data for private 2-year institutions are not reported in a separate category because too few private 2-year institutions in the sample offered distance education courses in 2000-01 to make reliable estimates.

Schools also indicated whether their state or school district provided in-service training or professional development in selected topics for high school guidance counselors during the 12 months preceding the survey. In addition, the survey respondent (typically a lead guidance counselor) was asked to report the number of hours he or she spent on professional development in each topic. In 2002, about 49,500 guidance staff (counselors and paraprofessionals) were assigned to public high school students; this represents an average of 249 students for every guidance staff member and 284 students for every guidance counselor, including full-and part-time counselors. 7 The ratio of high school students to full-time guidance counselors was 315:1.

The two listed services at which guidance counselors spent the most time in 2002 were the choice and scheduling of high school courses, and postsecondary education admissions and selections; 49 percent of public high schools reported that more than 20 percent of their guidance staff' s time was spent on the choice and scheduling of courses, and 43 percent indicated that more than 20 percent of their guidance staff' s time was spent on postsecondary education admissions and selections. The third activity at which guidance counselors spent the most time was students' attendance, discipline, and other school and personal problems; one-third of public high schools reported that more than 20 percent of their guidance staff' s time was spent on this activity. Fewer public high schools (13 to 19 percent) indicated that more than 20 percent of their guidance staff' s time was spent on academic testing, occupational choice and career planning, and other guidance activities. Schools were least likely to report that more than 20 percent of their guidance staff' s time was spent on job placement and employability skill development (2 percent) and on nonguidance activities such as hall or lunch duty, substitute teaching, and bus duty (5 percent). Professional development for guidance counselors. About two-thirds (64 percent) of all public high schools indicated that their state or school district provided professional development on academic curriculum standards/frameworks or assessments for guidance counselors during the 12 months preceding the survey. Fewer schools (51 to 53 percent) reported the availability of professional development on career guidance standards/frameworks/models, how to interpret test scores and assess student achievement, 7 It is important to note that the number of counselors and the student-counselor ratios from the FRSS survey are not strictly comparable to estimates from the Common Core of Data (CCD). The CCD estimates are based on a definition of secondary schools as schools comprising any span of grades beginning with the next grade following an elementary or middle school (usually 7, 8, or 9) and ending with or below grade 12 (Snyder 2001). In contrast, the 2002 FRSS study defined secondary schools as schools with a highest grade of 11 or 12. Thus, the CCD definition encompasses a broader range of schools than does the FRSS definition. Because the CCD data are reported at the district level rather than the school level (i.e., the counts reflect all guidance counselors in the district assigned to secondary grades regardless of whether the school is a middle school, a senior high school, or a combined school), the CCD data cannot be disaggregated to reflect a definition of secondary schools that is comparable to the definition used by the FRSS study. and how to work with students with special needs. Of the five listed topics, the least available was training on occupational/vocational curriculum standards/frameworks or assessments (43 percent). Thirty-eight to 51 percent of respondents spent 4 or fewer hours, or the equivalent of one-half of a day or less, on professional development for a listed topic over the 12 months preceding the survey. The proportion of respondents who spent more than 8 hours on professional development for a listed topic during the preceding 12 months ranged from 18 percent for training on how to interpret test scores and assess student achievement to 30 percent for training on state or local career guidance standards/ frameworks/models and for training on state or local academic curriculum standards/frameworks or assessments. State governments play a critical role in providing public elementary and secondary education. State constitutional, statutory, and regulatory frameworks provide the legal authority for state governments, local governments, and school districts to raise revenues for education; they also set conditions for spending these funds. State policies are associated with nearly every facet of education, typically defining, for instance, when children must be in school, who may teach them, and what they are expected to learn. The purpose of this report is to describe developments in state-level education policies that occurred during the 1990s and to use a wide range of sources to characterize these reform efforts at the state level. In doing so, this report extends an earlier National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) report, Overview and Inventory of State Requirements for School Coursework and Attendance (Medrich et al. 1992), which examined state-level reform efforts during the 1980s. Similar to the first report' s mandate to discuss reform in the 1980s, this report examines education policy developments of the 1990s."}, {"section_title": "State Education Reforms in the 1990s", "text": "Although public education has long been the subject of debate and reform efforts, the past decade is notable for the type and volume of state-level education policy activity. In particular, the 1990s continued a trend from the 1980s in which states shifted their focus from educational inputs, such as per-student expenditures on instructional materials, to educational outcomes, such as the percentage of students attaining a score of \"proficient\" on a statewide assessment. State governments passed legislation, adopted new procedures and standards, and pursued policies in a number of areas that reflected a new emphasis on outcomes over inputs. To facilitate discussion of the diverse set of education policies states adopted during the past decade, this report groups these reform efforts into four broad categories: \u25a0 standards, assessment, and accountability; \u25a0 school finance reforms; \u25a0 teacher training and school resources; and \u25a0 school choice options."}, {"section_title": "State Education Reforms", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview and Inventory of State Education Reforms: 1990 to 2000", "text": "- ---------------------------------David Hurst, Alexandra Tan, Anne Meek, and Jason Sellers This article was originally published as the Executive Summary of the Compendium of the same name. The data are primarily from reports published by a number of organizations, listed at the end of this article. These categories reflect the primary ways in which states have sought to change the provision of education. The first category-standards, assessments, and accountabilityincludes those policies that attempt to directly affect the achievement levels of students by specifying what students should learn and be able to do. The second categoryschool finance reforms-reflects a long-standing capacity of states to affect education by modifying the way in which revenues for public education are raised, distributed, and spent. The third category-teacher training and school resources-includes policies that may have an indirect effect on student achievement by changing, for example, the way in which teachers are trained. Finally, the fourth category-school choice options-includes efforts to give parents more choices in where they send their children to school. The following section provides a more detailed description of these reform areas."}, {"section_title": "Standards, Assessment, and Accountability", "text": "Much of the legislative activity related to education in the 1990s focused on raising academic standards and holding schools accountable for student performance. This report describes four components of these efforts: content standards, performance standards, assessments, and accountability systems. Content standards define what students should know and be able to do, while performance standards indicate how well students must perform to be considered proficient in a given subject area. Statewide assessments measure student progress toward attaining the goals defined by content and performance standards, and accountability systems are intended to collect the information necessary to hold schools and school districts responsible for the performance of students. Surveys conducted by organizations such as the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) revealed that by the late 1990s most states had one or more of these components in place. Between 1995 and 2000, for example, the number of states that had developed English/language arts standards increased from 20 to 49 (CCSSO 2000a). Increases were found in other subjects as well. The number of states that had developed mathematics standards grew from 25 to 49, science standards from 23 to 46, and social studies/history standards from 20 to 46. States also typically specify a set of performance standards that correspond to content standards. These performance standards often indicate the scores a student must make on a statewide assessment to be considered proficient in a given area. Measuring student progress toward attaining the goals defined by content and performance standards is central to standards-based reform efforts, and statewide testing programs were the focus of much attention during the 1990s. One area of concern has been the degree to which the subject matter and skill level of statewide assessments are consistent with state content standards. In an effort to align assessments with standards, some states have diversified their testing programs by adding items or assessments designed to mirror the material covered in the state' s content standards and by adding performance-based assessment items, such as short answers and open-ended tasks. As reported in Education Week' s Quality Counts 2001, most states assessed students a number of times between 1st and 12th grade-48 states administered at least one exam in 8th grade and 43 states did so in 4th grade. While English/ language arts and mathematics were the most frequently tested subjects, many states also regularly assessed student performance in history/social studies and science as well. Nearly all states included multiple-choice tests in their assessment programs, 38 states included short answer items, 46 used extended-response items in English exams, and 7 states used extended-response questions in assessments of other subjects. States have also conveyed the results of assessments and other indicators of student performance to parents and the public through institutional \"report cards.\" Institutional report cards generally are issued annually and may be issued at the state, district, and/or school levels. Publishing these report cards is one way in which states have sought to hold schools and districts accountable for student performance. In 2000, the CCSSO collected information on the type of reporting conducted by each state. All state education agencies reported having at least one annual accountability or indicator report as of September 2000: 46 states issued at least one report providing statistics at the district level, and 40 states and the District of Columbia did so at the school level (CCSSO 2000b)."}, {"section_title": "School Finance Reforms", "text": "In order to provide the instruction necessary for students to obtain the high levels of achievement envisioned by the standards-based reform efforts of the 1990s, schools must have adequate financial resources. This report examines a number of reforms implemented by states that affect the way they raise revenues, allocate funds among districts, and allow funds to be used. Three key areas of state education finance reforms are examined: moving from equity to adequacy, general revenue reforms, and special education financing reforms. One of the aims of state education finance systems has been to foster equity among the resources available to school districts within the state (Ladd and Hansen 1999). Recent legal challenges to state financing systems have shifted to focus on adequacy, seeking to compel states to define and provide a high-quality education for all children, rather than focusing primarily on reducing resource inequalities across school districts (Ladd and Hansen 1999). States have faced a number of challenges as they have sought to define and provide an adequate education. Included among these challenges are defining adequacy; determining the cost of obtaining adequacy; inflation; and adjusting for school, student, and geographic cost differences. The various ways that states have responded to these challenges are discussed in this report. A second type of finance reform discussed in this report concerns efforts to make state revenue systems more fair, efficient, or balanced. Shifts away from local property taxes have had impacts on the mix of revenues used for financing schools in particular states (Ladd and Hansen 1999). Michigan, for example, passed legislation in 1993 that abolished local school property taxes, despite the state' s traditional heavy reliance on local property taxes as revenue for education (Courant, Gramlich, and Loeb 1995). These revenues were replaced by an increase in the state sales tax and the adoption of a statewide property tax, along with other revenue sources. Finally, reforms in special education finance include changes in the way states distribute funds to districts and new policies to finance special education services using revenues from multiple sources. Since 1988, Medicaid funds must be used to reimburse Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)-related medically necessary services before IDEA funds are used (U.S. General Accounting Office 1999)."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Training and School Resources", "text": "The standards-based reform efforts described in this report are intended to ensure that all students attain high levels of competence in all subject areas. Attaining these goals, however, depends in part on the resources in schools, including the effectiveness of teachers. During the 1990s, a number of states reexamined the process by which teachers are trained and certified. Concerns over the academic rigor of teacher training programs, the strength of the certification process, the match between training programs and teaching assignments, and the type and availability of professional development opportunities have led many states to consider applying a similar model of reform to teacher training as they have to student achievement. This model is centered on standards, testing, and accountability. This report outlines the general process by which teachers are traditionally certified, which typically includes taking a prescribed course of study in college, passing one or more competency tests, completing student teaching requirements, and, once certified, maintaining certification by participating in professional development activities or taking additional coursework. A nontraditional, alternative certification model, which is intended to move highly qualified subject matter experts not currently in the teaching profession through preparation and certification more quickly than traditional routes, is outlined as well. A number of states either established or revised standards for obtaining a teaching license during the 1990s (CCSSO 2000a). According to the CCSSO, \"standards for teachers define the knowledge and skills teachers should have to provide quality instruction to students at given age or grade levels and specific content areas\" (CCSSO 1998, p. 26). A CCSSO survey conducted in 2000 found that a majority of states licensed or certified teachers based on state standards and that most of these states had either developed or revised their statewide teaching standards since 1990 (CCSSO 2000a). Most state teaching standards specify the type of coursework that a prospective teacher should complete while in college. While most prospective teachers are expected to complete a core set of education classes, including classes such as teaching methods, child development, and supervised teaching experience, those wishing to earn a certificate to teach secondary school students may also be required to take a certain number of hours in the subject they plan on teaching, such as mathematics or English. In 1999, according to Education Week (2000, nearly all states set minimum subject-area coursework requirements for high school teachers and about half had established such requirements for middle school teachers. Of the few states without standards, most indicated that they were soon to be in effect or were being developed. In addition to developing new standards for teacher education and certification, states implemented other measures in the 1990s to modify school resources, such as funding prekindergarten programs and increasing the number of required high school credits in core academic subjects. A number of states have adopted policies that are intended to ensure that key instructional resources such as textbooks are aligned with the state' s content standards. Class size reduction-including its potentially negative financial implications and effects on teacher supply and qualityalso received attention during the 1990s. The Education Commission of the States (ECS) reported that as of June 1999, 20 states had some sort of initiative to limit the student/teacher ratio to 20 or fewer students per teacher (ECS 1999)."}, {"section_title": "School Choice Options", "text": "While states focused attention during the 1990s on reforming education finance systems and increasing the learning resources and academic standards of traditional public schools, they also adopted legislation intended to provide more parents with choice in where their children attend school. The report discusses four approaches states have taken toward meeting this goal. Public school choice allows students to attend the public school that they and their families select, while charter schools give parents the option of sending their children to a public school that operates largely independently of the local school district. In addition, some states have adopted policies that provide public support for private education in the form of tax credits, vouchers, or other resources for parents who send their children to private schools. Homeschooling is now an option in all states (Lines 2001), although states do not necessarily provide financial or other support for parents who homeschool. The ECS reports that as of February 2001, 32 states had passed legislation permitting or requiring some form of public school choice. Throughout the 1990s, the number of states that adopted charter school legislation also increased, from 1 state (Minnesota) in 1991 to 36 states and the District of Columbia in September 1999. Similarly, the number of charter schools in operation increased during the 1990s. Almost 1,500 charter schools were in operation as of September 1999, about twice the number of charter schools operating in September 1997 (Nelson et al. 2000;Berman et al. 1998). Enrollment in charter schools represented about 0.8 percent of all public school students in the 26 states and the District of Columbia that had charter schools in operation in 1998-99 (Nelson et al. 2000). Allowing open enrollment in public schools and enabling the creation of charter schools are both ways in which states have sought to provide greater choice in public education. Proposals have also been made to increase private school choice by using public funds to subsidize the cost of private school attendance (Moffit, Garrett, and Smith 2001). Several states, for example, permitted the limited use of public funds to support private education in the form of transportation, textbooks, and various auxiliary services. Less common were programs that used public funds to cover part or all of private school tuition. In Vermont and Maine, public funds have been used for many years to help cover tuition costs at nonsectarian schools for students living in areas in which a public school is not readily accessible. Since 1989, three states-Wisconsin, Ohio, and Florida-have passed legislation enabling the creation of voucher programs. Another education option available to parents in all 50 states and the District of Columbia is to homeschool their children. The 1999 National Household Education Surveys Program (NHES) found that 850,000 students nationwide, or 1.7 percent of U.S. students ages 5 to 17, were homeschooled in spring 1999 (Bielick, Chandler, and Broughman 2001)."}, {"section_title": "A Profile of Working Adult Undergraduates", "text": "In 1999-2000, about two-thirds of working adult undergraduates (those age 24 or older) considered employment their main activity-employees who study-while the remaining one-third characterized themselves primarily as students who worked to pay their education expensesstudents who work. Employees who study were older on average than students who work (36 vs. 30 years old). As shown in figure A, roughly two-thirds of employees who study were age 30 or older, compared with just over onethird of students who work. Employees who study were also more likely to be married (52 percent vs. 31 percent), and to have children and other dependents (57 percent vs. 43 percent) (figure B). A fundamental difference between employees who study and students who work is how they combined work and attendance. As might be expected, employees who study devoted more time to work and less to attending classes, while students who work did the opposite (figure C). At least three-quarters of employees who study worked full time (87 percent) or attended part time (76 percent), and roughly two-thirds (68 percent) did both. In contrast, at least 6 in 10 students who work attended school full time (68 percent) or worked part time (60 percent), while roughly half (46 percent) did both. Thus, employees who"}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The profile of working adults is based on the 1999-2000 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:2000), a representative sample of all students enrolled in postsecondary education in the 1999-2000 academic year. The analysis of postsecondary completion is based on the 1996/ 01 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:96/01), a longitudinal cohort of all students who began postsecondary education in 1995-96 and who were last surveyed in 2001, about 6 years after their initial enrollment. The NPSAS sample is limited to undergraduates age 24 or older. The age of 24 was used to identify adult undergraduates because this is the age that students are recognized as financially independent of their parents for financial aid purposes. The NPSAS analysis focuses entirely on working undergraduates, but the totals presented in the tables include the 18 percent of nonworking adult undergraduates. The BPS sample is limited to students age 24 or older who worked while enrolled in 1995-96 (i.e., they were working while enrolled in their first term), regardless of their working status in subsequent years. The BPS survey sample has proportionally fewer older students than the NPSAS survey sample because to be eligible for BPS, students must be enrolling in postsecondary education for the first time. Therefore, returning students are not included. study most often worked full time and attended part time, while students who work most often attended full time and worked part time. In summary, among undergraduates age 24 or older, those who characterized their primary activity as employment were older, worked more, attended school less, and were more likely to have family responsibilities than their peers whose primary activity was being a student."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment, Degree Program, and Field of Study", "text": "Even though work and attendance patterns clearly distinguished employees who study from students who work, there were some exceptions. For example, roughly one-fifth of each group combined full-time work and full-time attendance (19 percent of employees who study and 22 percent of students who work). In previous studies, attendance status was strongly linked with postsecondary completion: part-time students were much less likely to complete a postsecondary credential than full-time students (see, for example, Berkner, Cuccaro-Alamin, and McCormick 1996). Therefore, when examining the educational characteristics of each group of students in the current analysis, full-time and part-time students were examined separately in order to compare the two groups while controlling for attendance status.  Consistent with differences in the time they spent in the classroom, employees who study and students who work differed in where they enrolled and what they studied. Employees who study attended community colleges more often than students who work (61 percent vs. 39 percent) and public 4-year colleges and universities less often (17 percent vs. 34 percent) (table A). Even among students who attended exclusively part time, these differences prevailed. Among full-time students, employees who study were more likely than students who work to be enrolled in private forprofit institutions (14 percent vs. 10 percent). Corresponding to their predominance in community colleges, employees who study were more likely than students who work to be in programs leading to an associate' s degree (45 percent vs. 37 percent) and were less likely to be in bachelor' s degree programs (23 percent vs. 45 percent). In addition, among full-time students, employees who study were more likely than students who work to be enrolled in certificate programs. The same was not observed for part-time students. Employees who study were also more likely than students who work to be taking courses not leading to any degree (10 percent vs. 2 percent). Along with differences in their rates of participation in degree programs, the two groups of working adults also differed in their fields of study. Employees who study majored in computer science, business, vocational, and technical fields more often, and majored in social/behavioral sciences, life sciences, and health fields less often than students who work. In summary, among working adult undergraduates, employees who study were more likely than students who work to attend community colleges and to be working toward associate' s degrees (among both full-time and part-time students) and vocational certificates (among full-time students only). They were also more likely than students who work to major in occupational fields of study such as computer science and were less likely to major in behavioral sciences."}, {"section_title": "Reasons Employees Who Study Enrolled", "text": "Given their focus on work, employees who study were asked several questions about their reasons for enrolling in postsecondary education. It is likely that students who emphasize the importance of their employment over enrollment would be interested in enhancing their position in the labor market. This was found to be the case for 85 percent of adult employees who study, who reported that gaining skills to advance in their current job or future career was an important consideration in their postsecondary education. However, 89 percent also reported that personal enrichment was an important factor.

In addition, roughly one-third (36 percent) of employees who study had enrolled to obtain additional education required by their job."}, {"section_title": "Financial Aid", "text": "Because employees who study are more likely than students who work to attend postsecondary education on a part-time basis, their tuition expenses are lower. 1 In addition, employees who study are more likely than students who work to be employed full time. Lower tuition combined with full-time employment means that employees who study have less need for financial aid than students who work. Employees who study, therefore, were less likely than students who work to apply for and receive financial aid in 1999-2000. Nevertheless, roughly half (48 percent) of employees who study received some type of financial aid, averaging about $3,000 per recipient. About 40 percent of employees who study received grants, averaging about $1,500, and 12 percent received loans, averaging about $5,600. In addition, about one-quarter (23 percent) of employees who study received aid from their employers, averaging about $1,200. Employer aid was the only type of financial aid that employees who study received more often than students who work (23 percent vs. 5 percent). The difference between the percentages of employees who study and students who work who received different types of aid held among both full-time and part-time students with one exception: among part-time students, no difference in the percentages receiving grant aid could be detected. Among employees who study, those who were enrolled in bachelor' s degree programs were the most likely to receive employer aid (33 percent received an average of $2,200 in employer aid). In addition, 24 percent of employees who study who were not enrolled in any degree program also received employer aid (averaging about $400). Presumably employers encouraged such students to take certain courses rather than earn a formal credential."}, {"section_title": "Persistence and Degree Completion", "text": "In previous studies examining factors related to students' risk of not completing their postsecondary education, working full time and attending classes part time were both independently associated with lower rates of persistence and degree attainment (Berkner, Cuccaro-Alamin, and McCormick 1996;Horn 1996). Given these findings, 68 percent of working adults who identified themselves as employees who study in 1999-2000 carried a substantial risk of not completing their postsecondary program: they were both employed full time and attended part time (figure C). In contrast, 18 percent of students who work combined full-time work with part-time attendance. Based on these differences, it might be expected that the two groups of working adult undergraduates would have different outcomes when examining their completion rates. Indeed, among those who first began their postsecondary education in 1995-96, differences in outcomes were evident. Six years after students had begun their postsecondary education, 62 percent of employees who study had not completed a degree or certificate and were no longer enrolled, compared with 39 percent of students who work. Even among those who intended to obtain a degree or certificate, 55 percent of employees who study had not completed a degree or certificate and were no longer enrolled, compared with 38 percent of students who work (figure D). Among employees who study with reported degree or certificate intentions, the total percentage who had attained any credential was 37 percent, most often a vocational certificate (28 percent). Among students who work, 44 percent had attained a postsecondary credential, and they, too, were most likely to have obtained a certificate (22 percent). However, 10 percent of students who work had completed a bachelor' s degree, compared with 2 percent of employees who study. 2 Employees who study were at particular risk of leaving postsecondary education in their first year. Among students with a degree goal, 32 percent of employees who study left in their first year with no credential, compared with 7 percent of students who work. These students had not returned after 6 years. After the first year, however, no difference could be detected between employees who study and students who work in their rates of attrition."}, {"section_title": "Highlights", "text": "The collection of tables in the full report is designed to illustrate some of the range and analytical promise of the NELS:88/2000 Postsecondary Transcript Files.

In addition, younger students were more likely than older students to have first enrolled at public or private not-forprofit doctorate-granting 4-year institutions and were less likely to have begun at public 2-year institutions.

A fourth group, the text analysis group, created and implemented specially designed software to study the nature of the classroom talk (or discourse) in the lessons."}, {"section_title": "Weighting and Variance Estimation", "text": "Analyses of the TIMSS 1999 Video Study data were conducted using data weighted with survey weights. These weights were calculated specifically for the classrooms in this study. The full report presents details about calculation of classroom base weights to reflect the probability of selection, rates of nonresponse among selected schools, and adjustments made to the weights in order to account for nonresponse. In addition, an explanation of the jackknife technique is provided, along with a description of how to use the weights when conducting analyses using these data."}, {"section_title": "Sample Design", "text": "The respondent universe for the B&B:2000/01 follow-up survey consisted of all students who attended postsecondary education institutions between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000, in the United States and Puerto Rico, and who received or expected to receive bachelor' s degrees during this time frame. Approximately 11,700 confirmed and potentially eligible bachelor' s degree recipients were selected for participation in B&B:2000/01. Of these, about 70 were determined during the follow-up survey to be ineligible. From the remaining nearly 11,630 eligible sample members, about 10,030 were located and interviewed in the follow-up survey."}, {"section_title": "Instrumentation", "text": "The B&B:2000/01 follow-up interview focused primarily on the activities of respondents since receiving their bachelor' s degree. The first section of the survey collected information on nonrespondents to the base-year survey (NPSAS:2000) and included items to verify eligibility. The second section dealt with undergraduate enrollment history and loan burden. The third section gathered background and demographic information about respondents and their families. The fourth section focused on postbaccalaureate enrollment, including graduate and doctoral/first-professional programs, as well as technical and vocational programs.

The sample survey data are from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B). on professional licensure, certification, and job-related training. The final section specifically pertained to teaching experiences for newly qualified teachers."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Design and Outcomes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Training", "text": "Training programs on successfully locating and interviewing sample members were developed for telephone staff. Topics covered included administrative procedures required for case management; quality control of interactions with sample members, parents, and other contacts; the purpose of B&B:2000/01 and the uses of the data to be collected; and the organization and operation of the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) program to be used in data collection. Tracing staff received additional training specific to the locating needs of the study (see discussion below)."}, {"section_title": "Interviewing", "text": "Using CATI, with telephone locating, interviewing began in July 2001. The overall unweighted response rate was 86 percent, after eliminating ineligibles from the original sample of about 11,700. The weighted overall response rate was 75 percent. Of those eligible sample members who were successfully located, the unweighted response rate was 94 percent. On average, it took about 19 minutes to complete the interview. Sample members for whom no locating information was available were sent directly to the tracing unit for specialized tracing. The tracing unit was also used for intensive tracing, once all contact information was exhausted during attempts to conduct the telephone interview. About 630 cases in total were sent to the unit for intensive tracing; of these, nearly 400 sample members completed the interview, resulting in a 64 percent unweighted response rate for intensive tracing cases."}, {"section_title": "Refusal conversion", "text": "The ability of interviewers to gain the cooperation of sample members, and thus avoid refusals, is important to successful interviewing. Refusal conversion specialists have received specialized training and are experienced in attempting to convert (interview) sample members who refuse to complete interviews. In B&B:2000/01, approximately 1,520 sample members refused at least once to participate in the interview. Of those, 70 percent were successfully converted and interviewed."}, {"section_title": "Indeterminate responses", "text": "Efforts were made to encourage responses to all interview questions and to limit indeterminates, defined as a \"don't know\" response or a refusal to answer a question. As a result of these efforts, item nonresponse throughout the interview was low, with only 6 of 556 items having indeterminate response rates above 10 percent."}, {"section_title": "Online coding", "text": "The B&B instrument allowed computer-assisted online coding of literal responses for postsecondary institution, major field of study, occupation, and industry. These online coding systems were designed to improve data quality by capitalizing on the ability of respondents to clarify information at the time the coding was performed. Of those responses requiring online coding, the highest rates of uncodable responses were for elementary/secondary school and for postsecondary institutional coding (about 14 and 5 percent, respectively), most likely because the coding system included only U.S. institutions and some respondents attended foreign institutions. Major field of study, occupation, and industry codes all had less than 2 percent uncodable responses."}, {"section_title": "Analysis Weights", "text": "Analysis weights were developed for the approximately 10,030 final respondents to the B&B:2000/01 interview. This was done by first testing for potential nonresponse bias; then adjusting for the effects of bias; and finally, poststratifying to known population totals. The quality of final weights was evaluated by a variety of methods. Overall institutional response rates were computed, as were illustrative design effects. An item nonresponse analysis was performed for selected variables. Variance estimations were calculated by either the Taylor series or balanced repeated replications (BRR) method."}]
