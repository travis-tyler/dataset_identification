[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This paper studies career choices and mobility patterns of white male doctorates in natural sciences and engineering (S&E). While it may be believed that a doctorate's career is typically associated with research and development, there exists anecdotal evidence that a large fraction of S&E doctorates find employment opportunities in such non-traditional for scientists areas as financial-, accounting-and other business services, non-technical consulting, and law. The consequences of these career changes depend on their nature and factors that affect it. This raises the following questions: What do we know about career choices of S&E doctorates? Who chooses to make a career change, when, and why? How does outward mobility from S&E compares with that between S&E-related jobs? The first objective of the paper is to assess relevance of the doctoral careers to S&E in general, and to R&D in particular. The second goal is to compare participation rates and mobility patterns of doctorates in careers of different types. The third objective is to evaluate how various personal-and job characteristics, research productivity, and labor market conditions affect mobility within-and out of S&E. An econometric model of transitions with competing risks is specified and estimated using the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) collected by the NSF during 1973NSF during -2001. This longitudinal data set is unique because of its large representative sample of professionals whose share in the labor force is small. As a data source on careers, the SDR is rich in employment characteristics specific to S&E. The first main finding of the paper is that only 57% of doctorates in the sample worked in R&D. Another 35% worked in occupations that involve application rather than creation of new knowledge and products. Finally, 8% of doctorates worked outside S&E in such sectors as financial-and other business services. This finding contradicts the common perception that S&E doctorates have very narrowly specialized skills unsuitable outside academic research. The second finding is that career choices vary within a career. Doctorates tend 1 to begin their careers in R&D (72%) but only half of them are still in R&D thirty years later. Some of those who leave go to applied jobs (80%) and others leave S&E for good (20%). The transitions within-and out of S&E differ in their timing and patterns. The only common feature is their high frequency within the first 16 years of job-specific tenure. Switchers from R&D to application are more likely to be tenured academics, while returns to R&D from application are conditional on active publishing and patenting activity. Finally, those who leave S&E are more likely to do so from the private sector. They are more likely to be graduates from highly ranked institutions, have a pre-PhD degree in non-S&E fields. Finally those who leave R&D for non-S&E tend to have higher number of postdoctoral appointments prior to the exit. Finally, analysis of the macroeconomic conditions at the time of the transition shows that high R&D expenditures relative to the GDP decreases mobility of all types. Growth of the R&D expenditures can be thought of as an increase in demand for R&D labor. Therefore, it is not surprising that increase in demand for labor decreases the turnover of labor. High enrollment rates in S&E programs used to indicate increase in demand for faculty are found to increase mobility into both R&Drelated and applied jobs. These results suggest that the S&E labor supply is sensitive to the changes in the labor market conditions. This paper is closely related, first of all, to the studies of the S&E labor force, considered in more detail in the next section. Secondly, it belongs to the literature on applications of the duration analysis to problems with multiple states and competing risks. The first contribution of the paper is its assessment of retention rates in R&D and factors affecting it. The second is its analysis of \"career changes\" of S&E doctorates. The paper is organized is follows. Section 2 describes the relevant literature. Section 3 describes the data and describes empirical patterns on career choices and mobility of doctorates. Section 4 outlines a competing risks transition model used to evaluate four transitions among three job-types: between R&D and applied jobs, and between S&E-and non-S&E type jobs. Finally, Section 5 contains discussion of the estimation results and discussion of further research."}, {"section_title": "Literature", "text": "Existing literature on doctoral employment focuses on career paths traditional for this group of professionals such as R&D or teaching jobs in academia, government or private sector. Mobility out of R&D and complete career changes of doctorates considered in this paper have not been assessed in the S&E literature before. The studies of the traditional career paths can be grouped into two major strands. The first strand is concerned with employment and mobility within a specific sector, such as managerial vs. technical jobs in R&D firms (Ferrall (8), Biddle and Roberts (3)), promotions within academia (Robin (14), Grimes and Register (9)), or mobility between firms (e.g Moen (12), Fallick et al. 7, Almeida and Kogut (1)). The second strand studies mobility between R&D sectors, e.g. Zucker and Darby (17), Audretsch and Stephan (2). Mobility within R&D sectors serves as a vehicle of transferring new ideas through their inventors who most often hold patents on these inventions rather than publish their findings freely in scientific journals. In these cases employing the inventors becomes the only way to access the new developments. On one hand, this type of mobility is a concern since it reduces firms' incentives to invest into human capital. On the other hand, it is beneficial for the firms-recipients. Almeida and Kogut (1) analyze mobility of engineers -patent-holders and patterns of their patent citations in semiconductors industry. They find notable regional differences in knowledge localization, especially in such regions as the Silicone Valley, and the New York Triangle. innovations benefit from such mobility because it causes reallocation of human resources towards these firms. The authors show that under certain conditions there is a net benefit of this kind of mobility but for technological reasons it is specific to the computer industry only. Moen (12) considers this issue using the human capital framework. He shows that in the R&D-intensive firms workers are paid much lower wages early in their career. He considers this a payment for acquiring training, for which they are compensated later in their careers. He suggests that all possible externalities of labor mobility are internalized by the market. The second strand of literature considers mobility between different sectors, e.g.  (17) extend the scope of analysis to all areas of sciences. Both studies estimate a duration model to show that it is the \"star\" scientists that make the move. The quality of a scientist is determined by the number of primary accession numbers (similar to citations) obtained from the GenBank. Audretsch and Stephan (2) analyzed a similar type of mobility of doctorate biologists -founders of bioscience firms. They also found that the \"switchers\" are the \"star\" scientists, who start their own company rather than join a bigger one. This interesting observation proves the prediction of the human capital theory that early in their careers, academic scientists would heavily invest in their knowledge in order to build reputation, and cash it out later, by selling their services to a private firm or by starting their own business. A slightly different aspect of mobility was considered in an earlier paper, by Biddle and Roberts (3), where the authors model and empirically test one of the career paths of industrial engineers that begins in a technical-and then can be continued in a managerial occupation. A self-selection and job matching framework was used to determine who and why decides to switch to the managerial track and whether to stay on it or not. The key assumption in the paper is that the skills to perform technical and managerial tasks are positively but imperfectly correlated. Therefore, the model predicts that the most productive technical workers would also be more productive as managers, and therefore, they choose to switch to management later in the career. Another prediction of the model was that those who switched the tracks and turned out to be unproductive as managers would backtrack. The authors found empirical support for the first prediction of the model but not the second."}, {"section_title": "Empirical evidence on career choices and transitions", "text": "This section describes the data and outlines main facts on occupational choices of the PhDs, relevance of these choices to S&E and R&D, and transition patterns between jobs of different types."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The stylized fact in this section are derived from the rarely used Survey of Doctorate showed that individuals are concentrated mostly in occupations defined as \"scientist\" (\"engineer\") or \"teacher\" in the same discipline as the major of their degree (Table   1), with some minor exceptions, e.g. some mathematicians-or physicists-by-training worked as teachers in engineering or life sciences programs. This finding suggests that for the purposes of my analysis I can consider aggregate occupational groups (say, \"postsecondary teacher in S&E\" or \"scientist\") rather than detailed occupations, which gives me 4 occupational groups: scientists and engineers, postsecondary teachers, managers, other non-S&E occupations. Next, the respondents were asked to report an activity that occupies majority of The last category, non-S&E type occupations, include jobs unrelated to S&E. In order to distinguish relevance of the job to S&E I use a different taxonomy than that adopted by the NSF 2 . For example, NSF taxonomy considers all managerial occupations as unrelated to S&E. This way, the head of a university department or a director of a research laboratory would be considered as someone who changed his career. For the purposes of my analysis such a classification would give misleading results because mobility from S&E to non-S&E would include both career advancements (exits due to promotions) and career changes. Distinguishing between the two is possible only when managerial occupations are separated by their relevance to S&E. One example of non-S&E jobs would be teaching non-S&E subjects (e.g. in humanities, business 3 , law, or arts). The second example would be employment in areas of legislation, business services, such as finance, accounting, non-technical consulting, or marketing and sales of products and services in non-S&E industries (e.g. tourism and hospitality, entertainment, media). Some might argue that business consulting or legislation in high-tech industries or manufacturing requires technical knowledge. I agree with this note but suggest however that technical education for these professions does not require to be at the doctoral level."}, {"section_title": "Career choices and empirical transitions", "text": "Overall, 56.7% of all doctorates in the sample were employed in R&D-related jobs. Application-type jobs accounted for 35.4% of all employment. The remaining 7.8% worked in non-S&E jobs. These facts contradict a common perception that S&E skills of doctorates are narrowly specialized and find no utilization outside their profession. The first three columns in Table 3 reports the summary statistics by job-type. The main difference in observed characteristics between the employed in non-S&E fields compared to the rest is their age: they are on average older (48.5 years vs. 45 years-old as sample average) mostly because they join non-S&E later in their career (age at the start of the spell is 7 years later than the average). Differences in other features are not substantial. For example, there is a slightly higher fraction of engineers in these occupations compared to the average. Finally, they are also the least likely to have degrees in non-S&E fields. Career choices vary throughout a career. As shown on Figure 1, participation in R&D jobs is high early in the career (75%), while employment outside S&E is very low (3%). However, only 45% of doctorates are still in R&D thirty years after graduation. Employment in applied jobs grows from 25% right after graduation to 42% at the end of the career. Non-S&E jobs account for 10% of all employment by twenty years after graduation and remain stable thereafter. The next section analyzes the transition patterns in more detail to understand their nature."}, {"section_title": "Mobility patterns", "text": "Transitions between different types of jobs can be divided into transitions within S&E vs transitions out of S&E. For 15,000 individuals there were on average 1.73 task-specific spells. Unfortunately, this means that I do not observe any repeated spells of the same type, which makes it impossible to estimate a duration model with dependent risks using the joint distribution of unobserved heterogeneity 4 . The longest observed spells were 28 years-long. However, the number of individuals in long spells was small: less than 100 people in total. Due to this problem, only spells with more than 20 observations were considered, which shortened the longest spell to 18 years. The remaining 18% have other career patterns, including non-S&E employment. Table 4 contains average transitions rates. One can notice that R&D-related jobs have slightly higher retention rates compared to those in applied jobs: 0.61 vs 0.58 respectively. In addition, average transition rates to non-S&E are also similar: 0.07 out of R&D compared to 0.08 out of application. The next subsection considers the transition dynamics in more detail.  "}, {"section_title": "Reallocations within S&E", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": "In other to understand the reasons and the timing of the transitions, I develop an econometric duration model of transitions, and estimate it for four types of transitions: two between the S&E type jobs, and two out-of-S&E jobs."}, {"section_title": "Specification of the transition model", "text": "In every time period, an individual can be in one of three states denoted as s(t), corresponding to the job-types: \"R&D\", \"applied\", or \"non-S&E\", denoted respectively as 1, 2, and 3. Let the rate of each transition be denoted by: where X is a set of observed variables. Once state i is chosen, the duration of the stay in i is determined by \u03b8 i = i \u03b8 ij , i =j. Regardless of the initial state, an individual can exit into one of two other possible states. Suppose, there exist 3 latent duration variables, {T j } 3 j=1 , with T j corresponding to the length of stay in the initial state i before exiting to the state j. In terms of duration analysis, they correspond to two competing risks that affect stay in the initial state. In empirical duration analysis literature it is often assumed that competing risks are independent, which is much easier to deal with computationally. In most economic problem this assumption is often very difficult to justify because individual characteristics (e.g. skills or preferences for each sector) are more likely to be correlated. This dependency can be captured through the joint distribution of some unobservable characteristic \u03b5 over the three states, i.e. transition rates are independent only conditional on \u03b5. For computational reasons, \u03b5 are often assumed to be discrete with a finite support and a joint probability mass function G(\u03b5). Identification of this kind of models requires data sets with multiple spells of the same type. However, the data set I am using in this study is not suitable for estimation of the model with dependent risks. Therefore, I follow the traditional approach and assume that the risks are independent conditional on the choice of the observable characteristics. The third set of characteristics include some research success parameters:"}, {"section_title": "ART, P AP ERS, P AT EN T S, N P DOC}", "text": "where ART GRAD and ART contain number of publications (at graduation and in total respectively), P AP ERS contains the number of working papers in two years preceding the survey, P AT EN T S includes the total number of granted patents, and finally N P DOC contains total number of postdoctoral appointments. This set of variables is expected to capture the effect of research productivity on transitions. The descriptive statistics for the variables can be found in Table 3."}, {"section_title": "Functional forms", "text": "Each transition probability \u03b8 ij is assumed to have the following functional form: where \u03b8 ij (t i ) is a baseline hazard, \u03b8 0ij (X) is a systematic hazard. To derive the likelihood function we need to consider contribution of spells of different types. For a single spell k which does not end in an exit to either of the states (i.e. a right-censored spell), the likelihood contribution is simply the survival function, S . Contribution of the spells ending in either of the states would be equal to: where \u03b4 kj (t) is a Kroenecker delta equal to one if an exit from k to j occurs at time t and zero otherwise. Since each individual can have more than one spell, denote R a number of spells that an individual has in R&D, A in applied occupations, and N in non-S&E. Then for this individual, the likelihood contribution is: where X is a matrix of observable characteristics, and \u03b3 is a vector of parameter values."}, {"section_title": "Initial conditions", "text": "I consider only spells that I observe from the start (no left-censored spells are used). Therefore, the only spells that require treatment for initial conditions are those corresponding to first jobs. The problem with such a spell is that the initial selection into each type of spells is non-random, and is correlated with observable and unobservable characteristics. There exist several methods to deal with the initial conditions. D'Addio and Rosholm (5) model the probability of taking a certain job as a function of observable characteristics, which comes at the cost of estimating more parameters. I adopt a method which assumes that: where p r , p a , and p n are empirical probabilities of observing an individual in R&D (r), application (a), or non-S&E (n) right after graduation. The choice of this approach is supported by the results of a multinomial probit model with correlated unobservable characteristics that was estimated separately on choices of the first jobs. The results show that none of the personal characteristics have significant effect on job choices. These results are not shown and are available upon request. Finally, a likelihood contribution of an individual is: Mobility within S&E Tables 5 and 7 present estimation results for the transitions between R&D and applied jobs. The first result is that scientists are more likely to move from R&D to applied jobs than engineers. This suggests that either competition in scientific R&D is more intense, or that scientists' R&D skills are more applicable in teaching or consulting than those of engineers. This is not true for mobility from applied jobs back to R&D: no difference by discipline in mobility rates is found. Those with degrees in non-S&E are more likely to switch to applied jobs and less likely to return to R&D. Individuals employed in Carnegie Research universities have lower probability of leaving for applied jobs, and higher probability to return to R&D. Those leaving R&D are more likely to be employed in academia and be involved in design and development than in basic or applied R&D. At the same time transitions to R&D from applied jobs are done mostly out of non-academic sectors. Having a tenuretrack positions or being tenured increases probability of transferring to applied jobs compared to non-tenure track and postdoctoral appointments. This finding suggests that academic scientists invest in R&D early in their careers which enhances their total scientific knowledge, which they later \"sell\" to their students or clients as was suggested by Cater and Lew (4). The opposite however does not seem to be true: tenured academics are not more likely to switch from applied jobs to R&D than non-tenured ones, suggesting that predominantly teaching academics will not become involved in more intensive R&D after being tenured. The transitions are also less likely to happen from professional services as well. These results are more or less consistent for all seven specifications. The next result is that neither of the productivity parameters affects the probabil- years on the job. The coefficient on the 2-4 interval of the baseline hazard remains positive and highly significant for all specifications except two: when one includes early productivity, and number of recent unpublished papers. In these two cases, the relative probability of exiting after four years actually falls but this effect is insignificant. Tables 6 and 8 contain estimation results for the transitions out of S&E by origin."}, {"section_title": "Mobility out of S&E", "text": "The first finding is that just as in the case of the within-S&E mobility, scientists are more likely to leave R&D for non-S&E than engineers. At the same time, there is no significant difference between scientists and engineers when it comes to mobility from applied jobs to non-S&E, with the computer scientists being the least likely to make the switch. One reason for that may be a higher competition in R&D positions for scientists. Alternatively, R&D skills of scientists are more valued outside S&E than those of engineers. More specifically these might be the design and development activities, noting the negative significance of the coefficients at basic or applied R&D. Those with non-S&E degree are more likely to be switchers to non-S&E regardless of the origin of transition suggesting that these individuals possess some skills required in non-S&E jobs or have preferences towards non-S&E. All else equal, non-academics have higher odds to leave S&E. This might suggest that employment in the industry or government makes them more exposed to non-S&E employers, or that these sectors provide skills valued outside S&E. The overall ability of the PhDs proxied by the quality of the degree granting school and publishing activity has the following effects. Graduates from the top schools and Carnegie Research I and II institutions have higher chances to leave R&D. When controlling for the research productivity directly, the positive effect of the Carnegie research institutions disappears, while the productivity parameters are all insignificant. Notably, the more postdoctoral positions the person had, the more likely (s)he is to leave R&D for non-S&E, which might suggest that inability to land a tenure-track job for any reason has a \"discouraged worker\" effect making an individual give up S&E altogether. Including the number of postdocs also eliminates any effect at the baseline hazards at the time intervals before 8-10 years of the R&D-specific tenure. This is consistent with the length of two to three postdoctoral appointment in length. The number of postdocs does not have the same effect on mobility out of applied occupations, where it has a negative sign and is insignificant. Most occupational transitions occur during the time believed to be critical for researchers to build scientific reputation. Analysis shows that it is mostly academic researchers on tenure-track or with tenure who switch to the applied jobs, which supports the predictions of the human capital theory. I also find that individuals who leave S&E are more likely to be employed in non-academic sectors and have non-S&E degrees prior to their PhD. The probability of leaving R&D increases with the number of postdoctoral appointments. Finally, these individuals do not exhibit high research productivity. Analysis of the labor market conditions at the time of the transition show that mobility both within and out of S&E is very low when relative R&D expenditures are high, and grows when unemployment rates increase. Enrollment rates in science and engineering programs have similar effect on mobility but only within S&E.            "}]
