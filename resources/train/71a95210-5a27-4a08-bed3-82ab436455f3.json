For the intervention study, saline (0.9% NaCl) or synthetic human GIP (20 ng \u2150 kg \u03ea1 \u2150 min \u03ea1 ) was administered to type 2 diabetes subjects for 180 minutes together with a meal, and plasma samples were obtained at predetermined intervals for 360 minutes. A bolus of GIP or placebo was given to C57BL/6 mice.\nPlasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and GIP were measured.\nAfter an oral glucose tolerance test, glucose, glucagon, PP, GLP-1, and GIP levels were significantly elevated in type 2 diabetes groups, compared with normal and prediabetes groups. GIP infusion in type 2 diabetes subjects was associated with significantly elevated PP levels compared with placebo. The GIP bolus given to C57BL/6 mice was followed by increased PP levels.

In 1975, Unger and Orci (1) proposed that diabetes was the result of a bihormonal abnormality involving both deficiency of insulin and excess of glucagon levels. Similar to glucagon, plasma PP levels had been shown to be elevated in type 2 diabetes by Floyd et al (2) as early as 1976. Although a plethora of studies have examined the causes and consequences of \u2424-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes, the causes and consequences of \u2423-cell and PP cell dysregulation remains substantially unknown.\nThe regulation of glucagon secretion from \u2423-cells is complex and only partially understood. Glucagon secretion is stimulated by hypoglycemia and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and inhibited by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) (3) (4) (5) . On the contrary, the regulatory mechanisms underlying PP secretion are still unclear. Patients with truncal vagotomy do not exhibit the initial rapid rise in PP levels seen in normal subjects after a meal, suggesting that vagal tone directly or indirectly modulates PP secretion (6) . Moreover, the enteroendocrine axis also modulates the typical food-induced PP secretion that occurs after a meal. In fact, iv infusions of glucose, amino acids, or lipids fail to induce changes in plasma PP levels (6) .\nSeveral lines of evidence point to incretin hormones such as GLP-1 and GIP as possible candidates for regulating PP secretion: both GLP-1 and GIP are secreted after eating and are secretagogues of at least two islet hormones: insulin via activation of GLP-1 receptors and GIP receptors (GIPRs), and glucagon via GIPRs (4, 7, 8) . GLP-1 is not a secretagogue of PP because infusion of GLP-1 or a potent GLP-1 receptor agonist in healthy subjects during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions does not increase PP secretion but rather results in a slight lowering of fasting and postprandial plasma PP levels (6, 9 -13) . GIP, on the other hand, has been shown to induce PP secretion. Administration of porcine GIP infusion to subjects with or without diabetes increases PP levels 2-to 3-fold (14, 15) . In perfused human pancreata, GIP augments PP secretion, which is even further augmented by splanchnic nerve stimulation (16) . Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that GIP serves as a secretagogue of PP.\nIn separate studies, different researchers have independently investigated the effects of diabetes on \u2423-, \u2424-, or PP cells or how diabetes affects the actions of GIP on insulin, glucagon, or PP secretion. To date, no study has integrated the association of diabetes with the simultaneous abnormalities of all three islet hormones, and there is no unifying theory underlining GIP as a culprit in these islet hormone abnormalities in diabetes.\nWe propose that GIP may be one of the major contributors to the hyperglycemia caused by islet trihormonal dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. To test our hypothesis, we present data on plasma levels of glucose, insulin, glucagon, PP, GIP, and GLP-1 during a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in four groups of participants characterized as having the following: 1) normal glucose homeostasis; 2) impaired glucose tolerance; 3) newly diagnosed diabetes (drug na\u00efve); and 4) diabetes on glucose-lowering medications. We complement our findings with data from a separate GIP infusion study illustrating the effects of exogenous GIP on PP secretion in participants with type 2 diabetes and in C57BL/6 mice.

Using immunofluorescence, GIPRs were shown to be present in both mouse and human PP cells just as they are present on \u2423-and \u2424-cells (Figure 3, A and B) . As previously reported, PP cells are on the rim (or mantle) of mouse islets but are dispersed among the other four cell types in human islets (18) .

Both plasma glucagon and PP levels but not insulin levels increased significantly at 15 minutes after infusion (P \u03fd .01, Figure 3 , C-E)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "We have demonstrated that the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes involves trihormonal abnormalities in islets of Langerhans, specifically involving \u2423-, \u2424-, and PP cells. In this study, we provide evidence from human, animal, and in vitro studies suggesting that the overproduction of GIP in diabetes contributes to the hyperglucagonemia and hyperPPemia. Data from the BLSA cohort showed that after an oral glucose challenge, GIP secretion is significantly higher in patients with type 2 diabetes than in those with prediabetes or normal glucose metabolism (Figure 1 ). Administration of GIP during a meal was associated with higher glucagon and PP levels compared with meal alone in participants with type 2 diabetes (Figure 2 ). GIP-induced glucagon and PP secretion were also demonstrated in rodents (Figure 3 ). Consistent with a direct regulation of glucagon and PP secretion by GIP, we found GIP-specific receptors on both human and mouse \u2423-cells (4) and PP cells (Figure 3 ). In type 2 diabetes, inadequate insulin secretion is accompanied by elevated plasma glucagon levels. In the BLSA cohort, the most noticeable differences between the NGT and the groups with diabetes (diabetes-new and diabetes-med) were the marked elevation in glucagon, PP, and GIP after an OGTT in both diabetes groups (Table 1 and Figure 1 ). The observed hyperglucagonemia and hypoinsulinemia associated with diabetes are in agreement with the bihormonal abnormality hypothesis of diabetes proposed by Unger and Orci in 1975 (1) . A large body of evidence shows that hyperglucagonemia causes increased hepatic glucose output because of increased rates of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from gluconeogenic precursors (19 -21) . Additionally, glucagon levels, instead of being suppressed, actually increase in type 2 diabetes after oral nutrient intake, which would paradoxically cause even greater glucose output.\nThe hyper-PPemia observed in diabetes is supported by the findings from Floyd et al (2) in 1976. To our knowledge, however, our study is the first to illustrate the concurrent presence of abnormal function in \u2423-, \u2424-, and PP cells, or trihormonal abnormality, with worsening glycemic control in diabetes. Furthermore, we showed that GIP may be the culprit in the observed hyperglucagonemia and hyper-PPemia in diabetes in the GIP infusion study. Previously we reported that GIP is a secretagogue of glucagon in humans (4) and that GIPRs are present on \u2423-cells in rodent, human islets, and \u2423-cell lines (4, 22) . \u2423TC1 cells and purified rat \u2423-cells have increased intracellular cAMP levels and glucagon secretion in response to stimulation with GIP (4, 23) . Our data now show that GIP is a secretagogue of PP in humans and mice. This finding is supported by data from perfused human pancreata (16) and human subjects (14, 15) . The presence of GIPRs on PPcontaining cells in islets in both man and mouse strongly supports the conclusion that the effect of GIP on PP secretion is due to direct signaling. It also appears that PP cells can still respond to GIP in type 2 diabetes because iv GIP infusion during a meal caused a doubling of plasma PP levels above that achieved by meal ingestion alone.\nAlthough the consequences of hyperglucagonemia in type 2 diabetes are well known, the same cannot be said for hyper-PPemia. The role of PP in glucose metabolism remains elusive. There are data pointing to PP being an insulin sensitizer in the liver. Abnormal hepatic glucose metabolism and glucose intolerance are features of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is also associated with deficient circulating islet hormones such as hypoglucagonemia and hypo-PPemia. Intravenous infusion of PP for 8 hours to five patients with chronic pancreatitis improved hepatic insulin resistance (24) . Recently Nannipieri et al (25) reported that PP levels were not significant contributors to diabetes remission after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. Unfortunately, GIP levels were not measured in the study. It is possible that the elevated circulating PP levels after a meal are not a contributor to diabetes but a compensatory, although inadequate, response to hepatic insulin resistance and hyperglucagonemia in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, in type 2 diabetes, elevated GIP levels may lead to worsening postprandial hyperglycemia as a result of exacerbated GIP-induced hyperglucagonemia. However, the GIP-induced hyper-PPemia is insufficient to counteract the hyperglycemia, as demonstrated by the GIP infusion study. We here proposed an integrated physiological model involving a GIP-induced islet trihormonal abnormality hypothesis of type 2 diabetes, an increase in GIP secretion after nutrient ingestion leads to unopposed secretion of glucagon and increased secretion of PP in the setting of diminished insulin secretion (Figure 4 ). There is evidence that the numbers of L and L/K cells are significantly higher in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with healthy controls (26) . Although it has been clearly shown that GIP increases insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, hence its name, the same is not true for glucagon and PP because these hormones responded to a bolus of GIP in the fasting state in mice and humans whereas insulin did not (14, 15) . Most likely, within this glucose dependency lies the pathogenesis of GIPR unresponsiveness in type 2 diabetes. Because as glucose levels rise, GIPRs on \u2424-cells become insensitive to activation by GIP (27, 28) . However, because GIPRs on PP and \u2423-cells are not glucose dependent for activation, they still respond to circulating GIP levels. The trihormonal abnormalities in type 2 diabetes may also manifest, although not in a similar fashion, in type 1 diabetes. Kennedy et al (29) found that the responses of PP and glucagon to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were impaired or reduced in patients with type 1 diabetes. How the trihormonal hypothesis applies to prediabetes requires further research. Most likely, in- jcem.endojournals.orgsufficient insulin secretion secondary to GIPR downregulation on \u2424-cells contributes to elevated glucose levels in prediabetes. Strengths of our studies include the availability and ability to weave together results from a human observation study, a human intervention study, animal models, and in vitro study. However, there are certain limitations. First, the BLSA cohort is older; however, other studies have shown that basal or fasting PP levels were elevated in maturity-onset diabetes compared with a healthy group after adjusting for age (2) . Second, the GIP infusion cohort has higher averaged BMI (38 kg/m 2 ) compared with the BLSA diabetes-med cohort (29 kg/m 2 ). These differences may explain why the plasma glucagon levels are higher in the GIP infusion group compared with the BLSA diabetesmed cohort, 22 pmol/L vs 14 pmol/L, because higher fasting glucagon levels were observed in obese individuals by other investigators (30) .\nIn summary, type 2 diabetes involves islet trihormonal abnormalities. GIP may play a role in the hyperglucagonemia and the hyper-PPemia seen during the postprandial state in type 2 diabetes when GIPR resistance is present only in \u2424-cells but not in \u2423-cells or PP cells. In type 2 diabetes, hyperglucagonemia exacerbated by elevated GIP levels, may lead to worsening hyperglycemia, which suggests that we should look at GIPR antagonists, not GIPR agonists, as possible treatment options. What role, good or bad, elevated circulating PP levels plays in glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes is unclear and warrants further investigation."}]
