The earliest nautical map available does not give a depth for the bay, indicating that it was not navigable by ships. (Pritchett, 1898). The bay is enclosed by cliffs to the west and east, with a Broad fluvial valley entering from the north. Chuckanut Creek drains through this valley into Mud Bay (Fig. 3). with 20% gradients to near-vertical walls on the side slopes. These gradients shallow in Chuckanut Village, allowing for some meander (COB, 2011). The lower reach of Chuckanut Creek is categorized as a pocket estuary (Eissinger, 1995;Northwest Ecological Service, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Geology", "text": "The Mud Bay area is dominated by two geologic units, the Chuckanut Formation and Pleistocene glacial drift (Easterbrook, 1976). The cliffs adjacent to the bay are part of the Padden Member of the Chuckanut Formation (Johnson, 1982). The Padden Member is an alluvial deposit, up to 3000 meters thick, that dates from middle to late Eocene (Johnson, 1982). It contains sandstones, mudstones and conglomerates. The area was last glaciated during the Vashon Stade, with glaciation reaching a maximum extent ~15,000 years ago, and then retreating rapidly (Mullineaux, 1965). The glacial deposit seen in the valley along the banks of Chuckanut Creek is a clay-rich gravelly till, identified as undifferentiated glacial drift on geologic maps (Easterbrook, 1976). The Bellingham area is still undergoing isostatic rebound at an average of 0.03 \u00b10.12 cm yr -1 (Washington Coastal Hazards Resilience Project, 2018). Sea-level rise since 1934 has been 0.12 \u00b10.027 cm yr -1 (NOAA, 2018). Future relative sea-level rise is estimated to range from ~0.38 cm yr -1 to 0.71 cm yr -1 by 2100 (Mazzotti et al., 2008;Washington Coastal Hazards Resilience Project, 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Anthropogenic influences", "text": "The area surrounding Mud Bay has been dominated by industrial and residential use for over a century, some of which might have generated additional sediment that could have been transported into the bay. Logging on Chuckanut Ridge was done from the 1890s to around 1915 (Davis, 1993). The bay was used for log boom storage from the early 1900s into the 1920s (figs. 4 and 5). Above Teddy Bear Cove, ~0.5 km south of Mud Bay, a brick and tile factory operated intermittently during 1915-1925. The section of Chuckanut Drive above Mud Bay was constructed from 1920-1921 (Thomas, 1971). Additional nearby extractive industries included the Chuckanut Stone Quarry which was operational from 1880-1908 and was located ~13 km south of Mud Bay. Two one-man coal mining operations were in existence during the early 1900s. One was located ~3 km south of Mud Bay on Governors Point and was operational during 1921-1922. The other was of unknown location or operational date. Both mines contained low-grade coal and were not considered highly productive (Thomas, 1971). There was also a salmon cannery south of the quarry during 1900-1934(Thomas, 1971. While these exemplify industrial activities in the near vicinity, none of these specific examples is likely to have influenced the sediments in Mud Bay. Local uses also required workers, who needed housing. Chuckanut Village, located at the north end of the bay, was already platted by 1891 (Lewis and Alberton, 1891). The intertidal zone was also platted but was never developed. Chuckanut Village was originally built as housing for the workers of the above industries, but people continued to live there after the industries disappeared (Farrow et al., 1989). Additional housing developments have been built on the west side of the bay, beginning with the Chuckanut Bay Subdivision, approved for construction in 1984 (Ted S. Gacek & Associates, 1984). Land-clearing and paving associated with urbanization could increase the sediment transported into the bay. The engineered structure that has been most cited as the cause of increased sediment accumulation is the railroad causeway across the mouth of the bay (Farrow et al., 1989;COB, 1995;Eissinger, 1995;Wahl, T. 2008; MacLennan et al., 2013 a and b; Josephine Miller and Wayne Gerner, Chuckanut Village residents, personal communications, 2017). The Great Northern Railway conducted a preliminary survey of their route in 1896 and opened a wooden railroad trestle across the mouth of the bay in 1904 ( fig. 4) (Thomas, 1971, Farrow et al., 1989, Wahl, 2008. In the 1920s, this open-framework trestle was replaced by a rip-rap causeway with a 69-m-wide tidal inlet opening ( fig. 6). The hypothesis is that reducing the bay mouth to this opening limited tidal and wave energy in the bay, and sediment began to accumulate in the intertidal zone. On the west side of Mud Bay there are wave-erosion features recorded in boulders of Chuckanut Formation sandstone ( fig. 7). These features were first described by Gilbert as having an \"infinite variety of fantastic shapes\" caused by wind and wave action (1878). The bay has an ~14-km fetch, but large storm waves now break on the causeway, and do not enter the bay at full force (Wahl, 2008; Josephine and Dennis Miller, Chuckanut Village residents, personal communications, 2019). The construction of Interstate 5 has also potentially affected sedimentation in Mud Bay, if only for a limited time (Northwest Ecological Services, 2006;Wahl, 2008). Construction took place from 1955 to 1966, with the last completed portion located directly upslope of Chuckanut Creek, ~1.6 km north of Mud Bay (Hillegas, 2004). Anecdotal evidence from people who lived in Chuckanut Village during construction states that the creek was the color of 'chocolate milk' due to the suspended sediment being transported (Josephine Miller and Wayne Gerner., Chuckanut Village residents, personal communications, 2017). This claim is plausible based on photographs of the grading during Interstate 5 construction, where large amounts of loose sediment were generated ( fig. 8)."}, {"section_title": "Environmental importance", "text": "Mud Bay is an important natural habitat. Eel grass meadows that serve as nursery environments for salmonids and other fish, as well as shellfish beds, are in the bay (Eissinger, 1995;Eissinger, 2003;Northwest Ecological Services, 2006;MacLennan et al., 2013 a and b). The estuary also contains a salt marsh (Eissinger, 1995;Eissinger, 2003;Northwest Ecological Services, 2006; MacLennan et al., 2013 a and b). Chuckanut Creek and Mud Bay are spawning and rearing grounds for chum and coho salmon, steelhead trout, and sea-run cutthroat trout (Eissinger, 2003;Northwest Ecological Services, 2006;MacLennan et al., 2013 a and b). Migratory, wintering and resident species of birds use the bay, including bald eagles, osprey, and herons (Eissinger, 2003;Northwest Ecological Services, 2006). In 2009, the North Cascades Audubon Society published a list of 124 species of birds found in or around the bay over the previous year. Eissinger described the bay as \"One of the most biologically significant marine habitat areas in Whatcom County (1995).\" The bay and estuary have been identified in the COB Water Resource To collect sediment cores, I used the following equipment: a \u00bd-diameter gouge corer, a Russian peat corer, X-radiography trays, and a 15-cm-diameter push corer. Based on the assumption that Mud Bay accumulation rates would be similar to sediment accumulation rates of 0.2 cm yr -1 from the intertidal zone at Willapa Bay near Long Beach, Washington (Boldt et al., 2013), I collected initial cores to 50 cm depth below the bed surface with the expectation of capturing the historical changes in the bay. The Willapa Bay accumulation-rate estimate was a useful starting point, but fluvial and tidal conditions differ in the two bays, so the comparison was not robust. Even allowing for accumulation rates 1.5 times greater than the initial estimates, 50 cm was not sufficient to capture a full century. Collection depths were increased to 1 m when I determined that the accumulation rates were greater than 0.50 cm yr -1 in some areas of the bay. Sediment from the \u00bd-diameter corer was sectioned in the field, and put into sample bags as 2cm increments to 20 cm depth, 5-cm intervals from 20 to 70 cm depth, and 10-cm increments to 100 cm depth. This allows for higher resolution at shallow depths, where identification of the surface mixed layer is important for analysis. Samples from this coring device were intended for 210 Pb analyses. Relatively complete ~100-cm cores were collected at sites 1 and 4. At site 2, a 50cm core was collected during the first field visit. At site 3, an 80-cm core was collected. Sites 2 and 3 were sandier, which made coring more difficult and could account for the incomplete collection at site 3. Russian peat cores were collected at sites 1, 2, and 4 down to 50-cm depth. Site 3 was too sandy, and the corer could not penetrate the sediment. Sediment was sectioned as 4-cm increments and put into sample bags in the field. These were intended for grain-size and 137 Cs analyses. The 137 Cs analysis requires more sediment than the 210 Pb analysis, which the larger-diameter Russian peat corer provided. Plexiglass X-radiograph trays were used to collect samples for X-radiography imaging. These trays were 60-cm long. Samples were collected at sites 1, 2, and 4. No core was collected from site 3. These samples were transported back the University of Washington Marine Sciences Building (MSB) intact, and in a vertical orientation, for analysis. The 15-cm-diameter push core was collected at site 1. This sample was collected for 137 Cs analysis after I determined that none of the Russian peat core samples were collected at a sufficient depth for the laboratory analysis. Additional cores were not collected due to safety concerns regarding the +21-cm low-tide level on the field day, expected difficulties with core collection from coarser-grained sites, and the potential for coring to the needed depth of analysis, based on 210 Pb accumulation rates. The collection depth below the seabed surface was 55 cm, and the core was transported in a vertical orientation. It was cut in the laboratory into 1cm-thick sample increments for use in higher-resolution testing than the 4-cm-thick Russian peat core samples would allow."}, {"section_title": "Laboratory", "text": "Accumulation rates were calculated using 210 Pb radiochemistry protocol (Nittrouer et al., 1979). The half-life of 210 Pb is 22.3 y, and accumulation rates can be determined for 4-5 half-lives, or ~100 y. Sample increments were chosen to maximize resolution in the upper portions of the cores, but sampling extended over the full lengths of the cores. A maximum of 24 samples can be analyzed at a time, so 12 samples each from sites 1 and 2 were analyzed simultaneously. After analysis, I determined that the core from site 1 did not extend deep enough into the seabed. A second core was collected at the same location and extended to 100 cm. I analyzed 12 samples each from sites 1 and 3. Site 4, the location where I anticipated the greatest accumulation rates, was analyzed to a higher resolution with 24 samples. Alpha-decay counting was conducted using Ortec Ametek and Octete Plus alpha spectrometers. Data analysis was done in Matlab, based on the following equation (a): where \u03bb is the decay constant for 210 Pb, D0 and Dz are two depths on the excess 210 Pb decay profile, and Z is the vertical distance between those two depths. When using this equation, I assumed that there is no active mixing occurring in the zone of net sediment accumulation. The surface mixed layer depth, where active mixing is occurring, is not included in the calculation. I determined the surface mixed layer depth visually based on the break in vertical slope of the uppermost data points in the 210 Pb decay profiles. Supported levels of 210 Pb, which also cannot be used to calculate accumulation rates, were determined by a break in slope of data points near the base of the core. Accumulation rates using the penetration depth of 137 Cs decay were measured to corroborate the accumulation rates obtained using 210 Pb (Ritchie, 1970). As a byproduct of global nuclear programs, 137 Cs has a distinct time horizon in marine sediments. Significant deposition began in 1954, and peaked in 1963 (Delaune et al., 1978). If a depth of penetration to the 1963 137 Cs peak agrees with the predicted 1963 depth from the 210 Pb accumulation rate, then the 210 Pb accumulation rate is robust. Samples were weighed, dried and crushed in preparation for gamma-decay counting. Gamma-decay counting was conducted using a Canberra DSA LX signal analyzer with Canberra Genie 2000 spectroscopy software. Data were plotted in Excel to determine the 1963 penetration depth. The penetration depth for 1963 using 210 Pb was calculated by multiplying the years since 1963 with the previously calculated accumulation rate, then adding the surface mixed depth. X-radiography negative images were collected at the MSB, using a Faxitron Torrex cabinet x-ray system. I developed the negatives manually in the dark room of the same building. Digital scanning of the negatives was done using an Umax Powerlook 2100XL digital scanner. Images were intended to help interpret anomalies in the 210 Pb profiles and grain-size distributions. Grain-size analysis was completed using a Beckman Coulter LS 13 320 laser-diffraction particlesize analyzer at the MSB. I first mixed each sample to homogenize it, and then weighed ~1 g of sediment from each sample collection interval, mixed it with a 0.05% sodium metaphosphate dispersant, and sonicated it for at least 15 minutes. Samples were put through a 0.2-cm sieve prior to analysis to remove any gravel, which the Beckman Coulter cannot analyze. Sieving removed fibrous organics from cores 1, 3 and 4, and gravel and shell material from 4 depth intervals in core 3. The reported data were an average of three consecutively run one-minute grain-size analyses. Distributions were used to determine the general sedimentation trends in the bay over time and to identify anomalies that do not reflect the prevailing trends."}, {"section_title": "Results:", "text": "3.1 Accumulation rates 210 Pb activity in excess of the supported (background) 210 Pb value of 0.19 dpm/g was determined for twelve samples in each of cores 1, 2 and 3, and 24 samples at core 4 (Appendix B). I fit a regression line to activity vs. depth plots, omitting a surface mixed layer of 5-20 cm, dependent on site (Fig. 11). Using equation (a), the calculated accumulation rate ranged from 0.20 to 1.07 cm yr -1 . Sites 2 and 3, near the center of the bay, show substantially lower accumulation rates (0.23 and 0.20 cm yr -1 , respectively) than at sites 1 and 4, on the east side of the bay (0.83 and 1.07 cm yr -1 , respectively). Line fits with R 2 ranging from 0.57 to 0.84 suggest that the accumulation process at all sites were relatively steady. The 137 Cs depth of penetration to 1963 was 51.5 cm in core 1, which is similar to the 210 Pb predicted penetration depth of 50.6 cm and validates the 210 Pb accumulation rates ( fig. 12) (Appendix B).

This timeframe makes it difficult to evaluate changes in sedimentation processes prior to 1920. Due to this limitation I cannot say whether the small-scale industrial and residential activities that occurred on or near the bay prior to 1920 had any effect on sediment accumulation. If sediment accumulation rates are accurately represented by the 210 Pb analyses and are constant through time, the grain-size distributions curves from sites 1, 2 and 3 extend to accumulation depths before 1920. At site 1, the depth to 1920 should be approximately within the depth interval 80 to 90 cm; at site 2, the 1920 depth should be at 20 to 24 cm; at Site 3, the 1920 depth should be at 18 to 20 cm. At site 3 there is an ~10% increase in relative abundance of fines at this depth. All three sites show a >5% increase in relative abundance of fines at depths 70 to 80 cm, 16 to 20 cm, and 16 to 18 cm respectively, which still fit within the 1920s construction timeframe. In other locations, causeway construction has been linked to rapid changes in sedimentation both during, and in the immediate years proceeding, completion (Proosdij et al., 2009).

Except in the case of site 4, these decay profiles were based on limited data points, excluding the surface mixed layer and supported 210 Pb points. Higherresolution 210 Pb analysis could be done on these sites to better constrain any changes of slope in the decay profiles."}, {"section_title": "Interstate 5 effects on accumulation rates", "text": "Any increased accumulation rates related to Interstate 5 are likely constrained to short-term events, limited to the time-period of construction. There are anomalies in the grain-size distributions at three sites that could contain an Interstate 5 signature. Assuming peak impact around 1963 during construction grading, elapsed time between then and sampling is about 55 years This estimate is variable as construction was completed over a period of about 11 years, ending in 1966 (Hillegas, 2004). Using these dates and 210 Pb-determined accumulation rates, I estimated the depth at which construction-related sediments might occur in each core. At site 1, this corresponds to ~45 cm dept within an interval of coarsening located from 40 to 60 cm. As this site was located closest to the creek mouth, this is where coarser bedload particles would be expected to deposit as the creek gradient shallows and transport capacity lessens. At sites 3 and 4, there are fining anomalies at 12 to 14 cm and at 60 to 65 cm, respectively. These depths also correspond roughly with Interstate 5 construction, and I interpret these anomalies as the finer of the coarse-grained bedload sediments and suspended silts that were deposited distal from the In Mud Bay, the opposite is happening, evidenced by the finer-grained sites located closer to the shore on the east side of the bay. I interpret this to be due to a change in the energy dynamic due to the causeway, which is essentially acting as an artificial barrier coastline, evidenced by the development of a flood-tide delta in the bay ( fig. 9). Fines now depositing at sites 1 and 4 would have been subject to greater tidal and wave energy, as well as energy from the tidal channels, prior to the causeway construction. Because the causeway shelters the shore, these energies no longer resuspend and transport fines out of the east side of the bay, and the center of the bay, located near the causeway opening, is now the higher-energy environment. The erosional features on the west side of the bay give evidence that the shoreline previously had a higher energy environment than seen today."}, {"section_title": "Spatial patterns in accumulation rates", "text": "Spatial patterns in the accumulation rates also correspond to the anticipated energy at each site. Sites 2 and 3, with lower accumulation rates, are both located closer to the causeway opening and they are at about the same elevation as the tidal channel. More sediment can be resuspended and transported by both tidal and fluvial means at these locations. There is little or no fining-up trend observed at site 2, implying that this site could be most indicative of precauseway bay conditions. This site is closest to the causeway opening, ~300 m behind the causeway, and it is likely that it would receive more tidal energy than the other sites. The two sites 1 and 4, located more distally from the opening, and elevated above the creek and tidal channels, have the greatest accumulation rates. My interpretation of these spatial variations in accumulation rates is that sites 1 and 4 are in a more quiescent area of the bay, which corroborates the changed energy distribution discussed in section 4.4. An additional opening in the causeway to the east could increase tidal flushing and remove some of this sediment."}, {"section_title": "Sea-level rise to date", "text": "Sea level has been rising over the time period covered in this study.

This is based on data collected from NOAA tide gauge 9449880, located in Friday Harbor, Washington. Friday Harbor was chosen as a proxy for Mud Bay due to both locations still undergoing isostatic rebound at a rate of ~0.03 mm yr -1 (Washington Coastal Hazards Resilience Network, 2018), and having similar semi-diurnal mesotidal cycles.

Near Mount Vernon, the Skagit River discharges a mean of 2.5 million metric tons of suspended sediment annually, accounting for 40% of sediment transported into Puget Sound (Curran, 2016) and dwarfing sediment supply by Chuckanut Creek.

The high degree of bioturbation validates my use of 137 CS to ensure that mixing was contained to the surface mixed layer.

I had no prior data regarding the best places to core, or how long those cores should be. Additional work in the bay, using results from this study as a guide, could address unanswered questions about anthropogenic effects on the bay. Our understanding of how the environment has reacted to anthropogenic changes helps determine which modifications to the causeway would bring about the most beneficial changes to sedimentation patterns in Mud Bay. It is possible to better constrain whether grain-size anomalies correlate with Interstate 5 construction. The freeway was built through Chuckanut Formation sandstone, which has a different lithology to the glacial drift found in the creek valley. It is reasonable to infer that if Chuckanut Creek carried sediment derived from construction, then point counts of sediment accumulated during construction would differ from sediment derived from more typical erosional processes (Wratten, 2019). These point counts could be used to evaluate an Interstate 5 signature. In addition, calculating transport capacity and sediment flux for Chuckanut Creek would help determine how much sediment is entering the bay from the primary fluvial source. A greater distribution of grain-size analyses could help constrain the energy distribution within Mud Bay, and where a new causeway opening might be the most beneficial. Using my accumulation rates as a guide, it would be possible to conduct multiple grain-size distributions on cores representative of >100 years to better determine changes in sedimentation prior to and after the causeway was built, particularly on the east side of the bay. Better constraining how much bedload and suspended sediment Chuckanut Creek transports into the bay would help answer questions about how rapidly the bay will continue filling. A sediment budget could be built for Chuckanut Creek using both field data and modeling. I would recommend that future coring in the bay be done using vibracoring methods. This would allow for conducting higher-resolution 210 Pb analysis to constrain any changes of slope in the regression that could indicate a change in accumulation rate. X-radiography could also be conducted at deeper depths, and at coarser-grained locations, with a vibracore."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Mud Bay is an important natural habitat that has been identified as a top-priority restoration site due to high levels of sediment accumulation leading to habitat degradation. Multiple anthropogenic modifications and activities could have caused increased sediment accumulation rates, the most notable are the building of the railroad causeway in the 1920s and the construction of Interstate 5 in the 1960s. There is evidence of a flipped energy distribution in the bay that could be related to changes in tidal-energy distribution after the causeway was constructed. Short-term increase in relative proportions of silt at the depth consistent with the age of Interstate 5 construction suggest that this event is also recorded in the bay sediment. The bay has been filling with sediment at a rate greater than sea-level rise since 1934. A comparison of accumulation rates to projected relative sea-level rise in the bay indicates that the east side of Mud Bay will continue infilling with sediment. The proposal put forth by the City of Bellingham to modify the causeway and allow for more tidal and wave flushing in the bay might alleviate the present sediment conditions, but more work should be done in the area to define unknown variables, get a better understanding of the effects of opening the causeway, and help determine where a new opening would have the greatest positive effects.

Note the bivalve and burrow located ~6 cm below the bed surface. Figure 15: X-radiograph negative image of site 2. There is no primary structure preserved in this image. The dark structure located ~4 cm from the bed surface is an artifact of collection, and does not represent bedding. Below ~24 cm there are coarser sand and shell fragments. Figure 16: X-radiograph negative images of site 4 is distinctly mottled, with almost no primary structure preserved. There is a finer-grained bedding structure located from ~16 to 20 cm depth that could be indicative of a flood event in ~1998.
