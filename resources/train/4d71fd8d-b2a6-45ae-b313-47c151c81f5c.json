[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered a critical time window for predicting early conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain functional connectome data (i.e., functional connections, global and nodal graph metrics) based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides numerous information about brain networks and has been used to discriminate normal controls (NCs) from subjects with MCI. In this paper, Student's t-tests and group-least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (group-LASSO) were used to extract functional connections with significant differences and the most discriminative network nodes, respectively. Based on group-LASSO, the middle temporal, inferior temporal, lingual, posterior cingulate, and middle frontal gyri were the most predominant brain regions for nodal observation in MCI patients. Nodal graph metrics (within-module degree, participation coefficient, and degree centrality) showed the maximum discriminative ability. To effectively combine the multipattern information, we employed the multiple kernel learning support vector machine (MKL-SVM). Combined with functional connectome information, the MKL-SVM achieved a good classification performance (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve = 0.9728). Additionally, the altered brain connectome pattern revealed that functional connectivity was generally decreased in the whole-brain network, whereas graph theory topological attributes of some special nodes in the brain network were increased in MCI patients. Our findings demonstrate that optimal feature selection and combination of all connectome features (i.e., functional connections, global and nodal graph metrics) can achieve good performance in discriminating NCs from MCI subjects. Thus, the combination of functional connections and global and nodal graph metrics of brain networks can predict the occurrence of MCI and contribute to the early clinical diagnosis of AD."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of memory and cognitive decline (Blennow et al., 2006) . With the aging of the global population, there will be an estimated 115 million AD patients in the world by 2050, with an average of 1 new AD patient every 33 s (Ijaopo, 2017) . Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage that precedes early AD. Evidence indicates that about 15% of MCI patients progress to AD per year (Petersen et al., 1999; Grundman et al., 2004) . Therefore, MCI is regarded as the critical time window for early prediction of conversion to AD (Manly et al., 2008) .\nComponents of the brain functional connectome, including functional connections and graph theory topological metrics, have become important imaging markers for exploring brain networks and predicting the classification of neurodegenerative diseases (Biswal et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2013; Filippi et al., 2018) . The functional connectome systematically depicts global graph metrics (i.e., small world, modularity, global efficiency), nodal graph metrics (i.e., degree, participant coefficient, shortest path length), and functional connections of the network. It provides a novel approach for revealing altered brain network patterns (delEtoile and Adeli, 2017; Khazaee et al., 2017; Filippi et al., 2018) . Given the large numbers of network features in the brain connectome, the Student's t-test (Qiao et al., 2016; Li W. et al., 2019) and sparse methods such as least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) have been applied to select the critical features of brain networks (Wee et al., 2014; Li Y. et al., 2019) . Nodal graph metrics naturally have a group topology (i.e., a node corresponds to a group of node-graph theoretical attributes). Group-LASSO is a regression-analysis method for group-feature selection and regularization that can be adopted to select nodal graph metrics and maintain significant discrimination of nodal features.\nIn recent years, machine learning approaches with datadriven algorithms have been used to combine and classify brain features. Some classifiers such as support vector machines (SVMs) (Prasad et al., 2015; Khazaee et al., 2016) , Na\u00efve Bayes (Zhuo et al., 2018) and deep neural networks (Themistocleous et al., 2018) are applied to discriminate normal controls from subjects with MCI. However, most of these methods focus on a single modality of imaging, the functional connectome, or graph theory attributes separately, resulting in relatively poor classification performance (Suk et al., 2014) . Therefore, the multimodal brain network (i.e., functional connections and graph theory topological metrics) should be used to provide a comprehensive and insightful understanding of the brain network in patients with MCI. Combined with information from different attributes, multiple kernel learning SVM (MKL-SVM) (Niu et al., 2017) can partially alleviate the high-dimensional curve of multiple features and measure the contributions of different features to the classification. These proposed methods could help select critical features and discriminate normal controls from subjects with diseases.\nThe main purposes of the present study were to select discriminative features of the brain connectome (i.e., functional connections, global graph metrics, and nodal graph metrics) and develop a classification of MCI based on different attributes of the brain network. Altered patterns of discriminative features were further analyzed using the proposed methods. By combining the group-LASSO model and MKL-SVM, we (i) identified the most discriminative nodal features of the brain connectome and predominant brain regions in MCI patients, (ii) achieved accurate and automatic classification of MCI patients and normal controls (NCs), and (iii) analyzed the changed patterns in the brain network."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants with MCI and NCs were recruited to establish a registry at Huashan Hospital. Each participant underwent a comprehensive evaluation, including clinical interview, neuropsychological assessment, laboratory tests, and multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations of the brain. MCI was defined according to the following criteria (Petersen, 2004) : (i) cognitive concern/complaint by the subject, nurse, or physician, with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) = 0.5; (ii) objective impairment in \u22651 cognitive domain based on 1.5 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean using the norms obtained in the pilot study; (iii) basic normal functional activities (determined by CDR and daily living activity assessment); (iv) absence of dementia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (Rabe-Jablonska and Bienkiewicz, 1994) . The inclusion criteria of NCs were: (i) no neurology-related or cerebral vascular diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease, intracranial aneurysms, or cerebral tumors); (ii) no severe mental retardation or schizophrenia; (iii) no severe problems in speaking, vision, or hearing; (iv) able to actively participate in the neuropsychological assessment. In the present study, 105 participants (41 MCI patients and 64 NCs) were selected. Two patients with MCI and four NCs were excluded due to incomplete data in resting state-functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and severe head motion at some time points. Finally, data from 99 individuals (39 MCI patients and 60 NCs) were included in the subsequent statistical analyses. The clinical and demographic data of these 99 participants were summarized. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Huashan Hospital of Fudan University (Shanghai, China). Written informed consent was obtained from each participant (or his/her legal representative).

The first 10 time points were not used to ensure stabilization of the initial signal and adaptation of participants to the environment. Timing correction to the last slice was conducted. Realignment for compensation of head-movement effects was achieved using a six-parameter rigid-body spatial transformation. All spatial movement was <3 mm of displacement and <3 \u2022 of rotation in any direction, and no participant was excluded. Next, rs-fMRI images were co-registered to the high-resolution 3D-T1 structural images. Normalization of 3D-T1 structural MRI images to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space was undertaken by non-linear warping based on Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL). Then, rs-fMRI images were spatially normalized to the MNI space using the parameters derived from the normalization of structural images and simultaneously resampled into 3-mm isotropic voxels. All normalized fMRI images were smoothed with a 6-mm, full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel. Linear detrending and band-pass filtering at 0.01-0.1 Hz were carried out to control low-frequency drift and high-frequency physiological noise.

Thus, the functional connectivity matrix (adjacency matrix) was constructed (Li et al., 2017) . The final functional connection networks produced N * (N-1)/2 edges, where N corresponded to the number of nodes in the networks. Considering the ambiguous interpretation of negative correlations, we restricted the analysis to positive correlations and set the negative correlation coefficients as zero. A thresholding method based on network sparsity was adopted to remove the less significant connections and to retain the topological properties of graph theory by setting an appropriate threshold for network sparsity (Dai et al., 2019) . Sparsity thresholds (ranging from 0.02 to 0.5, with steps of 0.01) were set to acquire a binary undirected network (Chang et al., 2016) .

The modularity (Q) of a brain network quantified the efficiency of segmenting a network into modules (Newman, 2006) . A modified greedy optimization algorithm was used as follows:\nwhere N m represents the number of modules, L is the total number of edges in the brain network, and l i is the number of within-module edges in module i; d i represents the sum of the linked edges at each node within module i. Modified greedy optimization was applied to detect the modular structure (Newman, 2004 At the module level, the intra-module connectivity density (D s ) and intermodule connectivity density (D s,t ) were calculated as follows:\nwhere N S is the number of nodes within module s, and \u03b5 i,j are the edges within module s.\nwhere N s is the number of nodes within module s, N t represent the number of nodes within module t, and \u03b5 ij is the number of edges between module s and module t.\nMoreover, at the nodal level, within-module degree (WD) and the participation coefficient (PC) were measured as follows:\nwhere e i is the nodal degree of node i within module s,\u0113 s is the average nodal degree of all nodes in module s, and \u03c3 s is the standard deviation of the nodal degree within the module of all nodes in module s.\nwhere N m is the number of modules and k i,s is the number of connections between node i and module s. k i represents the number of connections of node i to all other nodes within the N m modules.

Then, differences pertaining to graph theory metrics between MCI patients and NCs were compared based on two-sample Student's t-tests. A procedure to ascertain the false discovery rate was performed to further correct for multiple comparisons. To localize the specific pairs of regions in which functional connections were altered in MCI patients, we used a network-based statistic (NBS) approach (Zalesky et al., 2010) . A corrected P-value was calculated for each component using the null distribution of the maximal connected component size, which was empirically derived using a nonparametric permutation approach (10,000 permutations) (Zuo et al., 2012) .

Thus, the nodal graph metrics naturally have a group topology, that is, a node corresponds to a group of node-graph theoretical attributes. Given the natural group attributes, we used group-LASSO as the feature-selection scheme for nodal graph metrics.\nwhere y i is the label of the i-th participant, and w (j,k) and x (j,k) are the weight and value of the j-th ROI and k-th Nodal Graphic Metric, respectively.

The simplest way is to overlay the data directly, but this approach can be inappropriate due to the highdimensional curve and small number of samples. Moreover, a modality with more dimensions can submerge a modality with fewer dimensions. To overcome this challenge, we used MKL-SVM for information combination because the kernel trick can partially alleviate the high-dimensional curve. MKL-SVM was conducted as shown below.\nSuppose that there are n training samples with connection values and graph metrics. For x m i , m = 1,2,3, which correspond to the connection value, the nodal graph metrics and global graph metrics respectively. y represent the correcponding class label of the i-th sample. MKL-SVM solves the following primal problem:\nwhere \u03c6 m represents a mapping from the original space to the Represent Hilbert Kernel Space (RHKS), w m represents the normal vector of the hyperplane in RHKS, and \u03b2 m denotes the corresponding combining weight on the m-th modality. Then, the dual form of MKL-SVM can be represented as:\nand is the kernel matrix on the m-th modality. After we trained the model, we tested the new samples x = {x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x M }. The kernel between the new test sample and the i-th training sample on the m-th modality is defined as\nIn the end, the predictive level based on MKL-SVM can be formulated as follows:\nThe proposed formulation of MKL-SVM is similar to but different from existing multi-kernel learning methods because \u03b2 m is selected based on the cross-validation scheme on the gridsearching space with constraints m \u03b2 m = 1. The range of c was 2 \u2227 \u22125 to 2 \u2227 5. All data-processing and classification procedures used in our study are shown in Figure 1 . Due to the small sample size, we used the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) strategy to verify the performance of the methods, in which only one subject is left out for testing while the others are used to train the models and obtain the optimal parameters. For the choice of optimal parameters, an inner LOOCV was conducted on the training data using a grid-search strategy. Moreover, in order to verify the performance of the proposed model, we also tested the model on the independent ADNI dataset.\nAfter feature selection of functional connections with Student's t-tests and nodal graph metrics by group-LASSO, MKL-SVM was carried out to combine the brain connectome information. We evaluated the classification performance of different methods with a set of quantitative measures -accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity -which were defined as follows:\nwhere TP, TN, FP, and FN denote the number of truepositive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative values, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated as a performance measure for binary classification of the MCI and NC groups. In particular, LOOCV was employed in this study due to the small sample size, which provided an optimistic estimate of the classification accuracy since all except one of the subjects are used to train the classifier. For other approaches such as k-fold crossvalidation, only N-k (N is the total number of participants in the dataset) participants are included during the training process, resulting in poorer performance due to the small dataset (Wee et al., 2012) . For the functional connections (C), global metrics (G), and nodal metrics (N) of the brain network, we obtained AUCs of 0.9605, 0.7290, and 0.9576, respectively ( Table 7) . We also performed classification experiments by combining functional connections (C), global metrics (G), nodal metrics (N), global metrics (G), and nodal metrics (N). The results showed that despite the low classification performance of single global graph metrics, they still effectively increased the classification performance of nodal graph metrics and functional connections.

Finally, the combination of all connectome features based on MKL-SVM achieved the best classification performance, with 92.93% accuracy, 95.00% specificity, and an AUC of 0.9728. Moreover, the weight values (\u03b2) of functional connections, global metrics, and nodal metrics were 0.3, 0.01, and 0.6, respectively, indicating that the node attributes contributed most to the classification (Figure 7) . It should be noted that MKL-SVM both combines the information of functional connectivity and graph theory attributes and provides a method to merge more useful information for MCI identification. Therefore, we also combined the traditional unimodal marker of hippocampal volume with the brain connectome; the results are listed in Table 7 . Our results suggest that the AUC of the hippocampal volume was 0.7005, and the AUCs of the combination of hippocampal volume with functional connectivity, global graph theory attributes, or node graph theory attributes were 0.9509, 0.8117, and 0.9647, respectively.

The locations of nodes in the 264 atlas were labeled according to the AAL_90 atlas (Figure 4 and Table 4 ).

According to the definition of \"hubs, \" we identified hub nodes in MCI patients and NCs. Figure 5 shows the hub nodes in each group. In MCI patients and NCs, the common hub regions were mainly located in the left middle temporal gyrus, right precuneus, left median cingulate gyrus, left cuneus, and paracingulate gyri. More importantly, some hub nodes were present only in MCI patients and absent in NCs: the left paracentral lobule, right paracentral lobule, left postcentral gyrus, and right cuneus. Simultaneously, there were also some hub nodes in NCs but not in MCI patients. These regions were located on the left Heschl, right superior temporal, left inferior occipital, and left middle occipital gyri. Hub nodes play critical roles in maintaining high-level cognitive functions by coordinating overall information flow and supporting the integrity of the brain connectome (Wang et al., 2013) . The similar distributions suggested preservation of hubs in MCI.\nFurther comparisons of the predominant brain regions mentioned above revealed that MCI patients had significantly lower values of betweenness centrality and degree centrality and significantly higher values for the nodal shortest path in the frontal lobe (e.g., bilateral superior frontal gyrus), temporal lobe (e.g., bilateral inferior temporal gyrus), limbic lobe (e.g., left median cingulate and paracingulate gyri), and parietal lobe (e.g., left inferior parietal gyrus) compared with the NC group FIGURE 4 | The most predominant nodes for discriminating MCI patients from NCs.

Thus, we used group-LASSO as the feature-selection scheme for nodal graph metrics. It effectively extracted the groupstructure information of nodal attributes. The most predominant brain regions (with seven significantly different nodal topological metrics) were mainly distributed in the left lingual, left fusiform, left inferior temporal, and right middle temporal gyri. These brain regions showed significant changes in nodal graph metrics and so could be regarded as the most sensitive observation areas for nodal topological attributes in MCI patients. Also, withinmodule degree, degree centrality, and participation coefficient showed the most significant discriminative ability among the selected nodal graph metrics. The corresponding brain regions with the three most discriminative nodal metrics considerably overlapped with the hub nodes found in MCI patients. Overall, our results emphasize the importance of analyzing the attributes of intra-modules and hub nodes for early discrimination of NCs from subjects with MCI.\nBy projecting brain regions with significant differences of functional connections and graph metrics in the brain network to subnetworks, we found that the differences between MCI patients and NCs were distributed mainly in the DMN, dorsal attention network, cingulo-opercular task network, and frontoparietal task network. Of these, the DMN had the most significant discriminative ability. Studies have verified the correlations between these subnetworks and cognitive functions in the human brain, corresponding to spatial attention (Rolle et al., 2017) , visual attention (Wirth et al., 2017) , and executive function (Talpos and Shoaib, 2015) .\nIn this study, the DMN carried the most distinguishing information, which was verified by the proposed feature selection methods. Previous studies showed that the DMN is involved in episodic memory and is considered the major cognitive domain impaired in the early stage of AD (Meskaldji et al., 2016; Dillen et al., 2017) . Besides validating the discriminative ability of the DMN for discriminating NCs from MCI, we accurately located the predominant brain regions (middle temporal, inferior temporal, lingual, posterior cingulate, and middle frontal gyri) in the DMN and the corresponding nodal graph metrics. These results may facilitate the early and accurate diagnosis of MCI. They also demonstrate the repeatability and verifiability of the proposed methods, which is an important contribution of our work."}, {"section_title": "Fusion Classification of MKL-SVM and Identification of Maximum Contribution", "text": "Group-LASSO is valid for nodal feature selection because it can retain significant features with the most discriminative ability while avoiding data redundancy. We carried out reduction of nodal features according to group-LASSO and selected optimal features to achieve the best performance for discriminating NCs from MCI. This is an effective way to integrate multiple views of biomarkers for AD classification. The simplest way is to directly splice the data. Studies using multivariate pattern analysis [e.g., linear discriminate analysis (Alam et al., 2017) , artificial neural networks (Quintana et al., 2012) , and random forest (Sarica et al., 2017) ] have been undertaken to identify MCI using complex network characteristics. However, those approaches could be inappropriate due to the high-dimensional curves and small samples. Information with higher dimensions can submerge the low-dimension information. To overcome these challenges, we employed MKL-SVM for information combination. MKL (Niu et al., 2017) is a sparse machinelearning method that allows identification of the most relevant classification sources. The results suggested that the performance of classification by combining multiple brain connectome features was better than that of individual connectome features. The weight value (\u03b2) of functional connections, global metrics, and nodal metrics emphasized that nodal graph attributes had the greatest contribution to classification. It also indicated that MCI patients had significant changes in nodal properties. More surprisingly, although global metrics showed the worst classification performance, they can still provide important information about functional connections and nodal metrics.\nAfter combining functional connections and global metrics (C + G), functional connections and nodal metrics (C + N), and global metrics and nodal metrics (G + N), the results indicated that classification performance was effectively improved by combining the information of global metrics.\nTo verify this significant improvement, the Delong test was applied (DeLong et al., 1988) . We found that the proposed method significantly outperformed the global graph attributes, functional connection, and nodal graph attributes under the 95% confidence interval with P-values of 0.0002, 0.0227, and 0.0419, respectively. Although MKL-SVM did not yield significant improvements compared to the feature concatenation method (P = 0.1627), it still had two advantages. First, MKL-SVM could address the imbalanced dimension issue across modalities to some extent and better embody the contribution of different information sources to distinguish MCI patients from NCs. Second, experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed the single modality of the functional connectome in the brain network. It should also be noted that both methods are simple attempts to verify information effectiveness.\nThe classification results based on the traditional marker of hippocampal volume suggested that the combination of hippocampal volume and connectome features could also improve classification accuracy. The MKL-SVM can be used to combine multiple features of the brain connectome and effectively integrate multimodal information to discriminate NCs from patients with MCI.\nDuring validation of the proposed model, the classification performance of the independent ADNI dataset was not as good as the pre-trained sample. This may be due to heterogeneity in scanning machines, parameters, and physiological structures between western and eastern samples, which obviously violates the independently identically distribution assumption of SVM."}, {"section_title": "Altered Pattern of the Brain Network Connectome in MCI", "text": "At the global brain level, we found that MCI patients had weaker functional connections in the brain network, which was consistent with previous functional network studies of AD (Li et al., 2016) and MCI (Wang et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2016) . Some results demonstrated that these abnormal functional connections were directly related to the global topological attributes of brain networks (Wang et al., 2013) . In our study, we first found that patients with MCI and NCs fit the features of a smallworld network in a global network topology. That is, the brain network supported rapid, real-time integration of information across separate sensory brain regions to confer resilience against pathology and maximize efficiency with minimal cost for effective information processing between brain regions (Sporns and Zwi, 2004; Achard and Bullmore, 2007; Sporns, 2011) . Further comparison suggested that the value of small-world \u03c3 in MCI patients was lower than that in NCs, indicating \"economic small-world\" disruption (Liao et al., 2017) (i.e., reduction of the segregation and integration functions of effective information in the brain network). Moreover, we found changes in the functional segregation of brain networks in MCI patients (increased C p ). C p is a measure of local network connectivity (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009 ) that reflects the efficiency of local information transfer and the ability to defend against random attacks against a network. A higher value of C p represents a more concentrated clustering of local connections and a stronger capacity for processing local information. It is notable that previous studies reported decreased C p in AD patients (Zhao et al., 2012) . The reason for this difference might be related to the compensatory change of segregation function in the transition stage of MCI. Therefore, our results suggested that functional connections in the whole-brain network were generally decreased, whereas the network segregation of local information processing was increased.\nAt the local brain level, further analyses of the hub nodes and nodes with the most discriminative ability for MCI showed that MCI patients had significantly lower values of betweenness centrality and degree centrality and higher values of nodal shortest path in some brain regions (the frontal, temporal, limbic, and parietal lobes) compared with NCs. These data suggested that the network integration and local transmission capability of these lobes were decreased in MCI patients. However, in critical nodes in the occipital lobe, the increased betweenness/degree centrality and decreased shortest path indicated enhanced integration function and greater local transmission efficiency. We speculated that enhanced variation of these nodal graph metrics in some occipital nodes suggests compensation to maintain highlevel cognitive performance despite the pathological process of amyloid accumulation during the earliest phases of AD. This functional variation in the occipital lobe was also mentioned in previous studies. For example, Dai et al. found that the left fusiform gyrus exhibited higher functional connections in the AD group (Dai et al., 2015) . Bokde et al. (2010) found significantly greater activation in the right middle occipital gyrus during the location-matching task.\nTherefore, the altered brain connectome patterns in our study revealed that functional connections generally decreased in the whole brain network but increased for nodal graph topological attributes of local brain regions. This might suggest functional compensation in some brain regions to maintain normal cognitive function in the early stage of AD."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "There are still several limitations that need to be considered further. First, the class imbalance issue. Although there are several approaches (e.g., resampling or reweighting) to overcome imbalance, taking them makes it difficult to estimate whether the improvement of performance is based on these adjustments or on the proposed methods. In the future, we plan to investigate highquality data with more balanced samples for feature selection and classification or develop a more robust algorithm that improves classification accuracy and generalization.\nSecond, we assessed a small sample size. The optimization of parameters and hyperparameters inevitably leads to overfitting for small samples. To avoid this issue, we empirically chose parameters with a default setting of lambda = 1 and C = 1 instead of optimized parameters and hyperparameters. In the future, we will conduct parameter optimization based on a larger sample size.\nThird, we must consider the generalization of the model. For the independent ADNI dataset, classification performance was not as good as observed for the pre-trained sample, which suggests a limitation in modal generalization for different centers. We intend to improve the classification performance of multicenter data sources by combining domain adaptation.\nFinally, our cross-validation approach may have been insufficient. Evaluation of classification by k-fold cross-validation might be more precise when sufficient data are available. Therefore, in the future, it is necessary to compare the results obtained by different cross-validation methods (i.e., LOOCV and k-fold cross-validation)."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In the present study, the discriminative features of functional connections and nodal graph metrics were selected by Student's t-tests and group-LASSO, respectively. The combination of all connectome information using MKL-SVM achieved the best classification performance (AUC = 0.9728). In addition, the altered brain connectome pattern revealed that functional connectivity was generally decreased in the whole-brain network, whereas graph theory topological attributes of some special nodes were increased in MCI patients. Our findings demonstrate that optimal feature selection and the combination of all connectome features could achieve good performance for discriminating NCs from MCI. The combination of functional connections and global and nodal graph metrics of brain networks can predict the occurrence of MCI and contribute to the early clinical diagnosis of AD."}]
