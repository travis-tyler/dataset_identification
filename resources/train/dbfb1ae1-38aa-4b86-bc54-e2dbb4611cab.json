Small-farm households rely on off-farm income. Given small farms' poor financial performance, why do so many continue to exist? Small-farm households typically receive substantial off-farm income and do not rely primarily on their farms for their livelihood. They often invest in their farm operations with off-farm income. Except for households operating retirement farms, most of their off-farm income is from wage-and-salary jobs or self-employment. Households operating retirement farms typically receive most of their off-farm income from such sources as Social Security, pensions, dividends, interest, and rent. Farm operator households, generally speaking, cannot be considered low-income . Median household income for only two types of farm households-those operating retirement or low-sales farms-was below the median for all U.S. households in 2011.

Use of these more homogeneous groups helps draw a clearer picture of the status of farms in the United States. ERS updated the typology recently, nearly 15 years after the release of the original version of the classification (Hoppe and MacDonald, 2013). This is the first edition of the Family Farm Report to use the updated typology. The update addressed two recent trends: commodity price increases and a shift in production to larger farms. The previous version of the typology defined small farms as those with sales less than $250,000. The small-farm cutoff was increased to $350,000, reflecting a 41-percent increase in commodity prices between 1995 and 2010. To address the shift in production, two new groups were added: family farms with sales from $1 million to $4,999,999 and family farms with sales of $5 million or more. The original typology had less detail at the upper end of the size spectrum, with all family farms with sales of $500,000 or more placed in a single group. The agency also introduced a technical change in the measurement of farm sales, shifting from gross farm sales to gross cash farm income (GCFI). Compared with gross farm sales, GCFI is a better measure of the size of the farm business because it focuses more on the revenue actually received by the farm. One consequence of the switch to GCFI is an increase in the share of farms with production contracts classified as small from 33 percent to 75 percent (see box, \"From Gross Farm Sales to Gross Cash Farm Income\"). The updated typology is shown in the box \"The Revised Farm Typology.\" Just as the small-farm cutoff was increased from $250,000 to $350,000 to reflect commodity price increases, the cutoff for low-sales farms increased from $100,000 to $150,000. There now are four groups of small family farms, a midsize group of family farms, and two groups of large-scale family farms (large and very large). Under the new typology, 90 percent of U.S. farms are classified as small family farms in 2011, similar to the 87-percent share under the previous version of the typology. The shift in the value of production was more substantial, increasing from 15 percent under the previous typology to 26 percent under the updated version. Virtually all of this increase is associated with production contracts. Farms with production contracts typically have small GCFI relative to their gross farm sales, as explained in the box discussing the two measures of farm size. Many of these farms were classified as larger operations in the previous typology (based on gross farm sales) but are reclassified as small in the revised typology (based on GCFI). These reclassified farms have a substantial value of production, mostly under contract. "}, {"section_title": "From Gross Farm Sales to Gross Cash Farm Income", "text": "During the update of the farm typology, the measure of farm size was changed from gross farm sales to gross cash farm income (GCFI). GCFI focuses on the revenue received by the farm business and includes the farm's sales of crops and livestock, receipts of Government payments, and other farm-related income. Gross farm sales differs from GCFI by excluding other farm-related income and by including items that are not revenue to the farm-the value of production accruing to share landlords and production contractors, as well as Government payments accruing to landlords. Gross farm sales focuses on the value of products sold or removed from the farm, regardless of who receives payment for the products. For use in the farm typology, GCFI is a better indicator of the size of the farm business than gross farm sales because it focuses on the revenue actually received by the farm business that it can use. For most farms, GCFI and gross sales are equal. These farms do not share production or Government payments with landlords or contractors and do not receive other farm-related income. Gross farm sales, however, can be much larger than GCFI for farms with livestock production contracts. The value of the livestock removed is included in gross farm sales (as the value of production accruing to contractors). Contract growers receive a production contract fee for their services, but the fee is a fraction of the value of livestock removed. For example, a four-house broiler operation typically would generate $1.1 million in gross farm sales, but its GCFI-including production contract fees and other revenue-would only be $175,000.

Productivity growth exceeded the growth in demand for agricultural products, which led to excess capacity in agriculture, farm consolidation, and farm operators and laborers leaving farming to work in the growing nonfarm economy. The number of farms dropped sharply after a peak of 6.8 million in 1935 to about 3 million in the late 1960s. The decline in farm numbers slowed in the 1970s and nearly stopped in the 1990s. By 2013, about 2.1 million farms remained. Changes in land operated by farms were less dramatic than changes in the number of farms. Land operated by farms peaked at 1.2 billion acres in the early 1950s and then gradually declined to 914 million acres in 2013.

ARMS data can be used to examine sources of farm labor in detail (see box \"Estimating the Sources of Farm Labor). The person who acts as the employer determines the difference between hired and contract labor (O'Donoghue et al., 2011, p. 5). Farm operations pay hired workers directly, and the worker is a farm employee. In contrast, farm operations pay labor contractors for the performance of specific tasks, such as fruit or vegetable picking. The contract laborers are employees of the contractor, not the farm business."}, {"section_title": "Estimating the Sources of Farm Labor", "text": "Different versions of the Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) are conducted each year to collect information useful for specific purposes. All five versions of the 2011 ARMS collected the number of hours worked on farms by the principal operator, the spouse of the principal operator, other operators, and unpaid workers. (ARMS does not differentiate between operators' management and labor hours.) Version 1 of the survey also collected the number of the hours worked by hired laborers. Hours of hired labor on the other versions were estimated by dividing cash wages for hired labor by the region-or State-specific wage rate for farm labor. No versions of the survey collected hours of contract labor, so an estimate was made by dividing contract labor expense by the wage rate. Estimates of wage rates came from Farm Labor, published by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA/NASS, 2013b). The report provides wage rates for California, Florida, and 15 regions containing 2 or more States. One measure of annual labor use is the \"person equivalent,\" defined here as 2,000 hours, or 40 hours of work per week for 50 weeks per year. Off-farm occupation and retirement farms use the least labor, about two-thirds of a person equivalent. Labor use increases to 1-person equivalent for lowsales farms and grows with GCFI to 39-person equivalents for very large farms. Nonfamily farms use 5-person equivalents, on average. That estimate, however, reflects heavy labor use by relatively few farms. Only 12 percent of nonfamily farms use more than 5-person equivalents of labor, while 51 percent use less than 1. The operator and spouse provide between 70 and 80 percent of the labor on small family farms. Among the remaining family farms, the operator/spouse share declines from 50 percent for midsize farms to 5 percent for very large farms. This reflects the fact that as farms increase in size, they more often require more labor than the family can provide. In contrast, hired labor increases from 34 percent of the labor needs for midsize farms to 74 percent for very large farms. Contract labor also accounts for roughly a fifth of the work hours on very large and nonfamily farms. Farms specializing in high-value crops use about two-thirds of the contract labor used by the sector; very large family farms and nonfamily farms produce more than half of those crops (not shown in table)."}, {"section_title": "Land Tenure", "text": "Land tenure is the ownership status of farmland. Farm operations can be sorted into three categories of tenure: \u2022 Full owner-the operation owns all the land farmed. \u2022 Part owner-the operation owns some of the land operated and rents the rest. \u2022 Tenant-the operation rents all the land operated. Operations that own only a small portion of the land they operate (less than 1 percent) are also considered to be tenants in the ARMS data. Land leasing is a way of gaining access to additional land as well as a way for beginning farmers to enter agriculture. Farm operations often expand by renting land to avoid debt and the risks associated with ownership and to be able to respond more quickly to changing market conditions. As a result, the share of farms classified as part owners or tenants tends to increase with farm size (table  1). As a group, part owners rent about half the land they operate. Large majorities of retirement, off-farm occupation, low-sales, and nonfamily farms are full owners. Leasing is most common among family farms with GCFI of at least $150,000 (moderate-sales, midsize, large, and very large farms). Between 55 and 73 percent of the farms in each of these groups are part owners, and an additional 12 to 20 percent are tenants."}, {"section_title": "Specialization and Diversification", "text": "Over the past century, crop and livestock production largely separated from each other as farmers specialized in the production of a few commodities (MacDonald et al., 2013, pp. 31-33). For example, 75 to 90 percent of farms had chickens, milk cows, or hogs in 1900, but by 2010 less than 10 percent of farms produced those livestock, generally specializing in one species and relying heavily on purchased feeds. More than 80 percent of farms produced corn in 1900, largely to feed their own livestock. By 2010, only one-sixth of farms produced corn, generally specialized crop farms. Specialization allows farmers to capture some efficiencies of scale, but also subjects them to greater market risks as well as production risks from pests and diseases. Diversification-producing several commodities-can help mitigate these risks, but can also lower resource-use efficiency. In this report, a farm is said to specialize in a particular crop or livestock commodity if that commodity accounts for at least 50 percent of its production. Diversification is measured by the number of commodities a farm produces. Note that a farm can receive the bulk of its production from one commodity, such as corn, but still produce additional commodities. An example would be a farm specializing in corn but also producing soybeans and hay."}, {"section_title": "Specialization", "text": "Beef cattle is a common specialization among small family farms, accounting for roughly onefourth to one-third of retirement, off-farm occupation, and low-sales farms (table 2). Small farms as a whole also account for a substantial share of the total value of beef production-32 percent (see fig. 5)-as mentioned earlier. There actually are three phases in the commercial production of beef cattle (McBride and Mathews, 2011, pp. 5-7;Cash, 2002, p. 21): \u2022 Cow-calf-this stage involves maintenance of cows and the production of weaned calves at 6 to 9 months old, when they weigh between 400 and 700 pounds. \u2022 Stocker-the calves gain another 200 to 400 pounds on forages-pasture, hay, and crop residues-and grains over a 3-to 8-month period. \u2022 Feedlot-the calves are finished on a combination of forages and grain to be sent to slaughter at 1,000 to 1,500 pounds. Roughly half of beef enterprises focus on the cow-calf phase and the rest participate in two or all three phases. Enterprises specializing in the cow-calf phase are typically found on small farms. Farms with cow-calf enterprises average 57 weaned calves per year and most of them (77 percent) produce hay. Much smaller shares report producing corn (6 percent), soybeans (5 percent) or small grains (10 percent). Small feedlots exist, but larger operations account for most of the beef shipped directly from feedlots to the slaughter market. The 2012 Census of Agriculture, released by USDA/NASS in May 2014, reported that feedlots selling fewer than 50 head of finished cattle accounted for 50 percent of the 33,880 feedlots in the United States but only 2 percent of the total head of finished cattle (USDA/ NASS, 2014, p. 19). In contrast, 77 percent of finished cattle came from 607 specialized farms that sold 5,000 head or more. Cattle enterprises offer advantages to operators of small farms. Cattle are less labor-intensive than many other enterprises (except during calving), which may be attractive to an operator who is retired or who holds a full-time job off the farm (Cash, 2002, p. 21).

In addition, small, midsize, and large farms each account for about one-fourth of production not under contract, or sold in the cash or spot market.

However, some farms-particularly the larger ones-have more than one operator who makes decisions. In such cases, one operator is designated as the principal operator, the one most responsible for running the farm. The others are considered secondary operators. In the case of singleoperator farms, the sole operator is the principal operator. 6 Commercial-sized farms often require more management and labor than one individual can provide. Additional operators can provide the necessary labor and management and possibly other resources, such as capital or farmland. Having a secondary operator may also provide a successor when an older principal operator phases out of farming."}, {"section_title": "Secondary Operators and Their Farms", "text": "There are secondary operators on 913,800 farms (table 4). Because farms are generally family businesses, family members usually serve as secondary operators. In fact, 73 percent of the secondary operators-723,700 out of nearly 1 million-are spouses. (The number of secondary operators is 9 percent greater than the number of multiple-operator farms because some multiple-operator farms have more than one secondary operator.) As expected, the number of operators per farm is highest for large-scale farms. The number of operators reaches 2.4 per farm-on average-for very large family farms. The share of family farms with more than one operator also peaks at 73 percent on very large farms, 30 percentage points higher than the share for all U.S. farms. About 12 percent of all multiple-operator farms (and 5 percent of all farms) are multiple-generation farms, with at least 20 years' difference between the ages of the oldest and youngest operators. Multiple-generation farms are most common among large-scale and nonfamily farms ( fig. 6). Principal and secondary operators on multiple-generation nonfamily farms are unlikely to be related to each other. They are more likely to be unrelated managers from different generations. (ARMS does not inquire about the relationships between primary and secondary operators who are not married to each other.)"}, {"section_title": "Principal Operators", "text": "One striking characteristic of principal farm operators is their advanced age. About 32 percent of farm operators are at least 65 years old (table 5). In contrast, only 11 percent of self-employed business owners in nonagricultural industries are that old (USDL/BLS, 2012). Retired operators are the oldest group-as would be expected-with an average age of 70 years, followed by low-sales operators, with an average age of 60 years. The advanced age of farm operators is understandable, given that the farm is the home for most farmers and that farmers can phase out of farming gradually over a decade or more. Improved health care and advances in farm equipment also have allowed farmers to farm later in life than in previous generations (Mishra et al., 2005, p. 14). The ability to farm later in life also helps explain why the number of older principal operators (691,200) is nearly double the number of retirement farms (353,900)."}, {"section_title": "Trends in Aging", "text": "Principal operators' average age has been high for years, and it increased from 55 in the late 1990s to 58 beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2011 ( fig. 7). 7 Principal operators of more commercially oriented farms-those with GCFI of $150,000 or more (measured in constant 2011 dollars)were 3 to 5 years younger than average for all principal operators in any given year, but their average 7 The analysis in this section is limited to ARMS data, which began in 1996. Data from the census of agriculture, however, indicates that the aging of U.S. farmers has been underway for generations. In the 1940 Census of Agriculture-when the average age of principal operators was first published-operators averaged 48 years of age. The average reached 50 years by 1959, 55 years by 2002, and 58 years by 2012. Most farms are very small and produce little, but this is particularly true among farms operated by respondents who report that they are retired (table 1). ERS developed a measure of midpoint age to track changes in the age of operators responsible for most farm production. Midpoint age in figure 7 is a median, the midpoint of the distribution of production sorted by the age of the principal operator. The midpoint age reached 55 years by 2008, which means that half of the value of production is on farms with principal operators older than 55 and half is on farms with principal operators younger than 55. The midpoint age has trended upwards over most of the period examined, from a low of 48 years in 1998, increasing by 7 years. Notes: Multiple-operator farms have more than one operator. Multiple-generation farms are multiple-operator farms with a difference of at least 20 years between the ages of the youngest and oldest operators.  Multiple-operator and multiple-generation farms by farm type, 2011 Fewer farms are involved in the \"younger half\" of production in 2011-below the 55-year midpoint-than in the \"older half\" ( fig. 8). 8 About one-third of all farms have operators younger than 55, while two-thirds have operators age 55 or more, but each group of farms produces similar shares of production. In part, this reflects the large number of farms with operators at least 65 years old and their low production levels. 8 Actually, the midpoint age falls among principal operators who are 55 years old. Some 55-year-old operators are below the midpoint while others are above it. The first 5 groups' shares of production in figure 8 total 47.3 percent rather than 50 percent, because all the 55-year-olds are in the 55-to 59-year-old category. Similarly, the share of farms operated by principal operators who are younger than the midpoint age is actually 37.0 percent rather than the 35.6-percent sum calculated from figure 8. Comparing the 2011 and 1996 distributions of farms and production can provide clues to the future. Between 1996 and 2011, the share of farms and production generally declined for farm operators in age groups below 55 years, while the shares increased for farms with operators 55 to 59 years old and (to a lesser extent) 60 to 64 years old. Little change occurred for older operators at least 65 years old, since operators in this age class are often phasing down their farming operations. If these patterns continue into the future, the share of farms will continue to decline for operators in age groups below 55 years old. Whether their share of production will also decline is less certain, since younger farmers tend to be more productive. Shares of farms and production for the 55 to 59 age group may decrease, since the group is currently substantially larger than the next youngest group following it. Shares for the 60 to 64 group are likely to increase due to the aging of the large group of farm operators currently aged 55 to 59 years. The share of farmers 65 years old or more also may increase as younger operators grow older, but their share of production is less likely to increase. It will take years for these potential changes to occur; 15 years passed between the two panels in figure 8. Notes: Both family and nonfamily farms are included in this graph.

More current data show similar shares of high school graduates for farm operators and all U.S. heads of household, 91 and 88 percent, respectively ( fig. 9).

These programs affect farm revenue indirectly by affecting the prices farmers receive, the expenses they pay, or the services they use. Growing ethanol production has also led to increased demand for corn, putting upward pressure on corn prices, but USDA does not administrate ethanol policy. 10 Finally, USDA provides more direct financial support through Government payments from farm programs. This section focuses on two of the principal ways USDA supports farming: Government payments and Federal crop insurance. Both farm programs and Federal crop insurance have existed since the 1930s, helping to support farm income. Crop insurance, however, has grown rapidly in importance in recent years."}, {"section_title": "Government Payments", "text": "Government payments are defined narrowly to include only payments from farm programs to farmers. They exclude payments from Social Security and other public programs, as well as purchases of farm products by State and local governments, such as school districts buying locally produced vegetables for school lunches.

Moderate-sales, midsize, and large-scale family farms were more likely to receive Government payments than smaller farms.

Payments are tied to the amount of cropland enrolled in programs and yield histories. Specialty (or high-value) crops and livestock production are not generally supported by traditional commodity programs. Producers of nonprogram commodities-as well as producers of program commodities-may also receive disaster assistance and occasional ad hoc payments. Farms specializing in nonprogram commodities may receive substantial payments if they also produce program commodities or did so in the past. Economic Research Service/USDA Between two-thirds and three-fourths of moderate-sales, midsize, and large family farms receive commodity-related payments, summing the share receiving only commodity-related payments and the share receiving both commodity-related and conservation payments. These farms collectively received 73 percent of total commodity program benefits paid to farmers in 2011, roughly proportional to their 76-percent share of harvested acres of program crops. Commodity-related payments in total are much larger than conservation payments, accounting for about two-thirds of all Government payments made to farmers in 2011. Commodity-related payments also make up a majority of Government payments in each farm type, with the exceptions of retirement and off-farm occupation farms."}, {"section_title": "Types of Farm Program Payments", "text": "The 2011 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) collected information about the following farm program payments: Commodity-related payments . Payments from the Direct Counter-cyclical Payment (DCP) and Average Crop Revenue Election (ACRE) programs, loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, net value of commodity certificates, milk income loss contract payments, agricultural disaster payments, and any other miscellaneous State, Federal, and local payments. Participation in these programs generally requires present or past production of specific commodities. Goals: Establish price and farm income support, stabilize production, and provide a safety net for farmers. Conservation payments . There are two types of conservation payments: \u2022 Payments from land-retirement programs . Includes the Conservation Reserve Program, the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP). Goal: Remove environmentally sensitive farmland from production for long periods of time-at least 10 years or permanently, in some cases. \u2022 Payments from working-land programs . Includes the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the Conservation Stewardship Program. These programs provide technical and financial assistance to farmers who install or maintain conservation practices on land in production. Goal: Address environmental problems-such as pesticide and nutrient runoffon land in production. Federal farm programs listed above were authorized by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, which was in effect when the 2011 ARMS was conducted. Since then, Congress passed the Agricultural Act of 2014, which eliminates several programs and introduces new ones.  (Claassen, 2012, pp. 42-43). Beginning in 2003, spending on working-land programs increased nearly tenfold, increasing their share of total conservation spending. The 2014 Farm Act continues the emphasis on working-land programs. Midsize farms receive the largest share of working-land payments, 33 percent, while low-sales, moderate-sales, and large farms each received roughly half as much. Working-land programs target environmental problems on land in production, encompassing both crop and livestock practices. Small farms with little production-retirement and off-farm occupation farms-receive small shares of these payments. Only 5 percent of working-land programs go to very large farms, reflecting the small share of farmland they operate (2 percent). Land-retirement programs target environmentally sensitive land which is removed from production, so the distribution of land-retirement payments differs from those of commodity-related payments or working-land payments. Retirement, off-farm occupation, and low-sales farms received 77 percent of land-retirement payments in 2011, reflecting their large numbers (84 percent of all farms), their large share of farmland (48 percent of the land owned by farms), and their tendency to enroll large shares of their land in land-retirement programs when they do participate. Enrollments in land-retirement programs account for 47 percent of the land operated on participating retirement farms, 38 percent on participating off-farm occupation farms, and 28 percent on participating low-sales farms. In contrast, enrollment ranges from 2 percent to 9 percent for the remaining types of farms. The main occupation of off-farm occupation operators is nonfarm work, which limits the amount of time they can spend farming. Since acreage enrolled in land-retirement programs requires little labor or capital investment and provides a guaranteed income stream, these farmers may find the programs financially attractive, particularly if their farms are not profitable. Given their age, many retired farmers and older farmers on low-sales operations who have eligible land available to put into conservation uses are willing to do so as they scale back their operations and reduce the size of their crop enterprises."}, {"section_title": "Federal Crop Insurance", "text": "USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA) helps farmers manage risk through insurance provided by the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), which it administers. Federal crop insurance historically has focused on crops, but policies are now available for pasture, rangeland, and livestock. Twenty approved private-sector insurance carriers sell and service the policies. RMA develops insurance products, develops (or approves) premium rates, reinsures the carriers, reimburses the carriers for their administration and operating costs, and subsidizes premiums that farmers pay (Shields, 2013; USDA/RMA, 2010).

The Crop Insurance Reform Act of 1994 and the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 increased premium subsidies for farmers, and over time new insurance products have been introduced, which increased participation and the amount of coverage purchased (Glauber, 2012, pp. 438 and 487). 11 Premium subsidies account for a large share of the cost of Federal crop insurance (see box \"The Cost of Federal Crop Insurance\"). About 62 percent of Federal crop insurance premiums are paid by the Federal Government (Shields, 2013, p. 3). Note: Government payments are reported by calendar year, but crop insurance indemnities, premium subsidies, and acres insured are reported by crop year. A crop year is the 12-month period starting with the month when the harvest of a specific crop typically begins. Indemnities from Federal crop insurance first exceeded Government payments in 2011 and remained higher than Government payments in 2012 and 2013. Commodity prices have been at historically high levels in recent years, and high commodity prices lower Government payments from programs that are designed to compensate for low prices. But, high prices can increase payments from crop insurance. Indemnities compensate for losses, and the value of losses increase as commodity prices rise. In addition, adverse weather reduced yields and raised indemnities from 2011 to 2013 (Shields, 2013, p. 11). In 2011, the Great Plains experienced drought in southern and central portions of the region and extensive moisture in the north that hindered planting and production.

In particular, retirement, off-farm occupation, and low-sales farms-which together account for 84 percent of all U.S. farms-have very low participation rates. The highest participation rates were for large and midsize farms, followed by very large and moderate-sales farms. Farms specializing in cash grains accounted for about 65 percent of all the participants in Federal crop insurance. Cash grain also was the most common specialization for moderate-sales, midsize, and large farms-accounting for 41, 55, and 48 percent of farms, respectively (see table 5)-and 77 to 92 percent of cash grain farms in these groups participated in Federal crop insurance. Only 24 percent of very large farms specialized in cash grains, but substantial shares of high-value crops and dairy producers in the group participated in Federal crop insurance. Seventy percent of U.S. cropland was insured, but coverage was much less for retirement, off-farm occupation, and low-sales farms ( fig. 11). 12 In contrast, the more commercially oriented family farms with GCFI of $150,000 or more-as well as nonfamily farms-insured between 62 and 92 12 According to RMA administrative data, 83 percent of cropland is insured by Federal crop insurance (Shields, 2013, p. 3), compared with 70 percent in ARMS survey data. The RMA administrative data provide a more complete estimate of insured acres, but ARMS provides detail about individual farms participating in Federal crop insurance. For more information, see White and Hoppe (2012, p. 3). In addition, RMA estimates the share of acres insured using planted acres from NASS as the denominator. ARMS does not collect information on planted acres, so cropland-minus land enrolled in land-retirement programs-is used instead in figure 11.    The distribution of indemnities is roughly proportional to the distribution of insured acres, as expected ( fig. 12). The correspondence is not exact, because indemnities occur only if there is a loss, and the size of indemnities vary with the value of the commodities produced and the level of coverage chosen. Most indemnities (70 percent) accrue to midsize and large farms, reflecting their share of insured cropland acres (66 percent). Large farms and nonfamily farms each received a small share of indemnities, 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively, reflecting their small share of U.S. farms and insured cropland. Relatively small shares of these farms specialize in grains, a cropland-extensive enterprise. Other specializations common in one or both of the groups-high-value crops, beef (largely feedlots), and dairy-are less cropland extensive. Notes: Indemnities also include those for livestock. The ARMS data used here are for calendar year 2011.    Table 7 presents income statement and balance sheet items as well as selected additional financial measures (see box, \"Defining the Financial Measures\"). These measures help evaluate farm profitability, financial efficiency, solvency, and financial position, all useful indicators of financial health. Taken together, the measures in table 7 give a perspective of the financial status of the typical farm and help explain ongoing changes in farms structure. Not all farms perform equally well and performance is generally better for larger farms rather than small farms, although many small farms also perform well. Earlier editions of the Family Farm Report used the mean (or average) as the indicator of the typical level for financial ratios calculated from ARMS, but this edition uses medians. The median of a ratio falls at the midpoint of the distribution of the ratio for farms in a group. Half of the farms have a ratio above the median and half have a ratio below that of the group. The median of the ratio is the ratio for the median farm, the farm at the midpoint of the distribution. Medians are used because they are affected less by individual cases with extreme values than means. Individual farms may have extremely large ratios, for example, as the denominators approach zero. Means are retained for income statement and balance sheet items, however, because means are additive, which helps show how net farm income and net worth are derived. 13 For more information see \"Appendix II: Means and Medians in the ARMS.\""}, {"section_title": "Profitability Measures", "text": "Three ratios measuring profitability are presented in table 7: \u2022 Rate of return on assets-compares profits to resources used to produce them. \u2022 Rate of return on equity-compares profits to the farm owner's investment in the farm. \u2022 Operating profit margin-compares profits to the farm's revenue (Northwest Farm Credit Services, 2008, pp. 7-9). All three profitability measures are strongly associated with farm size. The median rates of return on assets and equity and the median operating profit margin are negative for retirement, off-farm occupation, and low-sales small farms. These measures turn positive, however, for moderate-sales farms, and increase further for midsize and large-scale farms. The ratios return to near zero again for nonfamily farms, reflecting the 78-percent share of those farms with GCFI less than $350,000.

The different results are attributable to how the two measures treat unpaid labor and management provided by the principal operator and other persons (secondary operators, spouses, and other household members) on unincorporated farms. Operating profit for unincorporated farms is calculated with deductions for unpaid labor and management, to reflect their opportunity cost (Hoppe et al., 2010, p. 17). 14 (See box, \"Defining Net Farm Income and Operating Profit.\") Net farm income, in contrast, makes no such deductions, placing no value on these resources. Farms with negative operating profits but positive net farm income can stay in business if the operators undervalue their unpaid labor and management. Both median and mean net farm income increase with farm size and are lower for small farms than for midsize, large, and very large family farms (table 7). The differences in net income reflect the 14 Unincorporated farms are organized as proprietorships or partnerships. Incorporated farms include both S-and C-corporations. Farms organized as corporations pay salaries to their principal operators. Operators of unincorporated farms receive a nondeductible draw from their farms' equity instead of salaries.

Households operating off-farm occupation farms generally receive substantial off-farm income to cover living and farm expenses. Cash expenses also exceeded gross cash income for retirement and low-sales farms, but the ratios were lower-at 101 and 103 percent, respectively-and near the 100-percent break-even point. The remaining farm types generated enough income to cover expenses, with their median operating expense ratios falling in a fairly narrow range, from 65 to 74 percent. Half of U.S. farms are in the critical zone for the operating expense ratio (table 8). This percentage, however, reflects the relatively large shares-47 percent to 59 percent-of retirement, off-farm occupation, and low-sales farms in the critical zone. For the remaining farm types, the share in the critical zone ranges between one-fourth and one-third. The low median debt/asset ratio for retirement, off-farm occupation, low-sales, and nonfamily farms-all just above 0 percent-reflects their low debt levels (table 7). At least 70 percent of the farms in each of these groups have less than $10,000 in debt. 15 For the remaining typology groups, the median debt/asset ratio increases with GCFI, from 5 percent for moderate-sales farms to 22 percent for very large farms. Large and very large farms have a relatively large share of farms in the critical zone, two or three times the 3-percent share for all U.S. farms (table 8). Both large and very large farms carry substantial debt, an average of $0.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively. ERS developed its financial-position measure in the aftermath of the 1982-1986 farm crisis to sort farms by two measures-net farm income and the debt/asset ratio (Johnson et al., 1987). Most U.S. farms have a favorable financial position, which means they generate positive returns and have a debt/asset ratio of no more than 40 percent. Sixty percent of U.S. farms and at least 50 percent of each farm type were classified as such in 2011 (table 7). Vulnerable farms-with negative net income and a debt/asset ratio above 40 percent-are rare in all farm types and amount to 3 percent of all farms. Off-farm occupation farms account for 64 percent of the vulnerable farms, but their operators are unlikely to depend on the farm for their livelihood."}, {"section_title": "Operator Household Income and Net Worth", "text": "Given their negative operating profit margins and low net farm income-on average-how do so many small farms stay in business? Households operating small farms typically receive substantial off-farm income. In 2011, average off-farm income for small-farm households ranged from $40,600 for moderate-sales households to $97,600 for households operating off-farm occupation farms (table  9). Most off-farm income (71 percent for all U.S. farm households) is from earned sources, either a wage-or-salary job or self-employment. However, households operating retirement farms receive three-fifths of their off-farm income from unearned sources (such as Social Security, pensions, dividends, interest, and rent), reflecting the advanced age of operators on those farms. (See box, \"Measuring Operator Household Income and Net Worth.\") Participation in off-farm work varies by farm type. At one extreme, neither the operator nor spouse worked off-farm on 65 percent of retirement farms. At the other extreme, both the operator and spouse worked off-farm on 56 percent of off-farm occupation farms.

Unlike operator household income, most of which comes from off-farm sources, net worth from the farm makes up most of the wealth of farm households, regardless of farm type. The farm, on average, accounts for 78 percent of operator household net worth, reflecting the value of the land used in farming. However, much of the net worth of farm households is illiquid and not easily available to spend for consumption because it is largely based on assets necessary to continue farming."}, {"section_title": "Level of Operator Household Income and Net Worth", "text": "Mean income and net worth may not be the best measures of the economic well-being of most farm households, because a few households with high income or net worth can raise the means well above those experienced by the typical farm household. Median household income for all farm households in 2011 was $57,100 (table 10) or 14 percent higher than the $50,100 median for all U.S. households. Only two types of farm households-those operating retirement or low-sales farms-received household income below the U.S. median. Farm households' net worth compares favorably with that of other U.S. households. For each group of family farms, median net worth was more than the median for all U.S. households ($79,700) or U.S. households reporting a self-employed householder ($294,600) (Bricker et al., 2012). Farm households have substantial farm assets, reflecting the value of their farmland, and most have relatively little farm debt. ERS developed a measure of economic well-being that jointly considers both household income and net worth or wealth (Mishra et al., 2002, pp. 39-42). This measure divides farm households into four groups, based on low and high levels of income and wealth relative to the median household Economic Research Service/USDA Income and wealth of principal operator households by farm type, 2011 and is calculated for the farm business. Farm earnings-in contrast-are based on cash items only, with the exception of a deduction for depreciation. Farm earnings also exclude the share of net income generated by the farm paid to other households, such as those of partners. 2 Earned income comes from off-farm self-employment or wage or salary jobs. Unearned income includes interest and dividends, benefits from Social Security and other public programs, alimony, annuities, net income of estates or trusts, private pensions, regular contributions of persons not living in the household, net rental income from nonfarm properties, and royalties for mineral leases. 3 Income from off-farm sources is more than 100 percent of total household income if farm earnings are negative. 4 Includes households where the operator works off-farm and there is no spouse. 5 Includes households where the operator does not work off-farm and there is no spouse. 6 The off-farm occupation group includes any small farm where the principal operators reports they are not currently in the paid workforce, as well as farms where the operator reports an off-farm occupation. On 13 percent of off-farm occupation farms, the principal operator is not currently in the paid workforce and the spouse also does not work off-farm.

In the case of unincorporated businesses and S-corporations, the household's farm business income is calculated as its share of net cash income generated by the farm. Net cash income is gross cash farm income (GCFI)-the sum of the sales of commodities, other miscellaneous farm-related income, and Government payments-less cash expenses and depreciation.* The household of the principal operator does not necessarily receive all the business income generated by its farm. For example, business income may be shared with partners or relatives who hold an interest in the farm. In the case of C-corporations, farm business income is the dividends paid to household members. Wages paid to the operator by farms organized as S-or C-corporations are also included in farm business income. \u2022 Income from other farming activities. This component consists of net income from a farm other than the one being surveyed plus wages paid to household members other than the operator and net income from renting out farmland not associated with the farm being surveyed. \u2022 Off-farm income . Off-farm income can come from earned sources (such as wages, salaries, and self-employment income) or from unearned sources (such as interest, dividends, and Social Security and other transfer payments). Farm earnings-the income received from farming-are the sum of the first two components. Farm earnings are not directly comparable with net farm income presented in table 7. Net farm income includes both cash and noncash items and is calculated for the farm business. In contrast, farm earnings apply to the operator household and are based on cash items only, with the exception of a deduction for depreciation. Farm earnings also exclude the share of net income generated by the farm paid to other households. Unlike net farm income, operator household income excludes two sources of nonmoney income provided by the farm to the farm household: (1) the imputed rental value of the farm dwelling; and (2) the value of farm production consumed on the farm (food and firewood). Average imputed rent, $7,400 per farm, is substantial, which helps explain why average net farm income is positive but average farm earnings are negative for retirement farms, off-farm occupation farms, and low-sales farms (tables 7 and 9). Home consumption is much less, $170 per farm. ARMS is also the source of data for estimates of operator households' net worth or wealth. The net worth of farm operator households is defined as the difference between the value of their assets and liabilities. It is calculated as the sum of the operator household's farm net worth and nonfarm net worth. If the net worth of the farm is shared with other households (such as the households of shareholders in a family corporation), only the operator household's share is included. * Depreciation is not a cash expense, but it is deducted to be consistent with accounting conventions used in the Current Population Survey to estimate U.S. household income. income and wealth for all U.S. households (see table 10 for the four groups). Roughly 60 percent of households operating retirement or low-sales farm have low income-summing both low-income groups-a larger share than for any other farm types. Nevertheless, most low-income retirement and low-sales households had wealth above the median for all U.S. households. Fifty-six percent of all farm households had both income and wealth above the corresponding medians for all U.S. households. For most typology groups, the share in the high income-high wealth group was even greater, ranging from 66 to 86 percent. The exceptions were households operating retirement or low-sales farms, where only two-fifths were high income-high wealth."}, {"section_title": "Limited-Resource Farmers and Their Farms", "text": "Despite the large share of farm households with high income and wealth, some farmers have limited means. USDA currently defines limited-resource farms as those with low sales that are operated by households with low income (see box, \"Defining Limited-Resource Farms\"). Limited-resource farms could be more accurately labeled \"low income\" rather than \"limited resource\" since the definition limits household income but has no constraint on farm assets or household wealth. Eleven percent of all farm households operate limited-resource farms, but the percentage is much higher for retirement farms (21 percent) and low-sales farms (17 percent) ( fig. 15). The largest share of U.S. limited-resource farms (44 percent of all limited-resource farms) occurs in the low-sales category. Compared with other farmers, limited-resource farmers have lower median household income, household net worth, and farm assets (table 11). Nevertheless, 92 percent of limited-resource households are in the low income-high wealth category and have net worth greater than the median for all U.S. households. Limited-resource households also operate smaller farms, on average, than other farm households, in terms of GCFI and acres. About 57 percent of limited-resource farmers are at least 65 years old. Many of these older operators may have scaled back their operation and begun drawing down their assets.

Their median operating profit margin and rates of return on assets and equity were all positive, and a large majority of these farms had a positive operating profit margin. In addition, large majorities of farms in these groups were outside the \"critical zone\" indicating uncomfortably low rates of return on assets and operating profit margins. In contrast, small farms were less profitable. In the case of retirement, off-farm occupation, and lowsales farms, the median operating profit margin and rates of return on assets and equity were negative. A large majority of the farms in the three groups fell in the critical zone for the rate of return on assets and the operating profit margin. The situation was better for moderate-sales farms. Their medians for the three ratios were positive-but substantially less than those of larger family farmsand roughly half of the farms were outside the critical zone for the rate of return on assets and operating profit margin. Nevertheless, some farms in each small-farm category had a high operatingprofit margin, at least 20 percent. Small-farm households typically receive substantial off-farm income-largely from wage and salary jobs or from self-employment-that they can use to subsidize the farm business and cover living expenses. Because many small-farm households receive a large share of their income from off-farm work, macroeconomic and monetary policies affecting the nonfarm economy are important to them. The provisions in the tax codes allowing farmers to write farm losses off against other income are also important to operators of off-farm occupation farms with substantial off-farm earned income (Durst, 2009, pp.4-5). Finally, the status of retirement programs is important to operators of retirement farms and to older operators in other farm types as they approach retirement."}, {"section_title": "Financial Status of Farm Households", "text": "Most farm households have neither low income nor low wealth. Considering the two measures together, 56 percent of farm households had both income and wealth above the corresponding medians for all U.S. households. For each typology group-except retirement and low-sales farms-a large majority of farm households (66 to 86 percent) were in the high income-high wealth group. In addition, most retirement and low-sales households with low income had wealth above the median for all U.S. households. Much of the wealth of farm households, however, is illiquid and not immediately available for consumption, because it reflects assets necessary for farming. Even households operating limited-resource farms had high wealth, with 92 percent reporting household net worth greater than the median for all U.S. households. Households operating limitedresource farms are more accurately viewed as having limited income rather than limited resources, since there is no constraint on farm assets or household wealth in the current definition. Assets held by farmers are difficult to verify on applications to USDA programs, so the requirement for a second Economic Research Service/USDA year of low income-more easily verified than low assets-is used instead. Alternate definitions of limited-resource farms with farm asset or household wealth constraints significantly reduce the number of limited-resource farms (Hoppe and Banker, 2010, p. 48). Operator household income excludes nonmoney income: the imputed rental value of farm dwellings and the value of products produced on the farm and consumed by the operator household (firewood and food). Exclusion of these items understates the contribution of the farm to the farm operator household's well-being. All farm households receive nonmoney income from the farm, but it may be most important to low-income farm households operating retirement, low-sales, or limited-resource farms. Older Operators and the Future The advanced age of U.S. farmers raises concerns about finding replacement farmers as older farmers grow even older and exit farming. The eventual exit of older farmers, however, is not as ominous as it may seem. Substantial numbers of people enter farming, but they are not necessarily young. In 2011, 22 percent of family farms were \"beginning farms,\" operated by farmers with no more than 10 years of farming experience. 16 Only 14 percent of the principal operators of these farms were younger than 35 years. The largest share, 49 percent, was 35 to 54 years old. Beginning farms are more likely than established farms to be small, but both beginning and established farms come in different sizes (Ahearn, 2011 and. Beginning farms are more likely than established farms to be small, but both beginning and established farms come in different sizes (Ahearn, 2011 and. Secondary operators on multiple-generation farms are another potential source of replacement farmers. While there are relatively few multiple-generation farms-they ranged between 5 percent and 8 percent of all U.S. farms over the years-they are generally much larger than average, and account for a disproportionately large share of agricultural production. Given increasing productivity, fewer-but larger-farms would be necessary in the future to maintain current production levels. Some of the secondary operators on multiple-generation farms would have the experience necessary to operate these larger farms. Finally, some older operators have already retired and effectively left farming. Operators classified as older are made up of two components: those who are retired (12 percent of all farmers) and those who are not (20 percent). Retired older operators account for only 3 percent of production, and about one-third of their land is either rented to others or enrolled in land-retirement programs. the numerator of the ratio-experienced by relatively few farms that mask the extent of negative margins among smaller individual farms. Switching from the aggregate mean to the sample median also substantially lowers the operating profit margins among off-farm occupation, nonfamily, and low-sales farms-by 27, 24, and 10 percentage points, respectively. Together, off-farm occupation and low-sales farms account for 77 percent of farms with an operating profit margin less than 0, so we would expect margins in these groups to fall after changing from the aggregate mean to the sample median. Likewise, low operating profit margins for the smaller nonfamily farms were masked by high operating profits of larger nonfamily farms when calculating the aggregate mean."}, {"section_title": "Operating Expense Ratio", "text": "Differences in the operating expense ratio by farm type follow the same pattern, whether it is calculated as an aggregate mean or as a sample median. Retirement and low-sales farms are near the break-even level: just above 100 percent (using the sample median) or just below 100 percent (using the aggregate mean). The ratio is substantially higher for off-farm occupation farms, 119 percent if calculated as an aggregate means and 146 if calculated as a sample median.

The exception is the off-farm occupation group, where the ratio calculated as a sample median is 27 percentage points higher when it is calculated as a sample median.

Other farms hold substantial amounts of debt, which results in the 8-percent debt/asset ratio for all farms, when the ratio is calculated as an aggregate mean. The share of farms with less than $10,000 of debt is high for retirement farms (91 percent), off-farm occupation farms (72 percent), low-sales farms (74 percent), and nonfamily farms (74 percent) (see table 7).
