All subtypes of MCI are associated with an increased risk for AD and other dementias. 2 Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is diagnosed when the patient has an objective memory impairment but no significant change in daily functioning.\nThe prevalence of MCI has been estimated to be about 16% in nondemented elderly individuals, 3 with an annual conversion rate to dementia ranging from 5% 4 to 15%. 1 Although MCI indicates a higher risk for dementia, individuals with this diagnosis may remain stable or even revert to normal, which suggests that the course of what we are now defining as MCI is quite heterogeneous. 5 Although patients diagnosed with MCI have an increased risk of development of dementia, they may convert back to normal or remain stable."}, {"section_title": "CASE ILLUSTRATION: PART 1", "text": "A 79-year-old female comes in alone for an initial medical evaluation. She takes hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension, simvastatin for hypercholesterolemia, and ibuprofen intermittently for osteoarthritis.

On review of systems, she reports mild changes in memory that started last year, about which she is somewhat concerned.\nShe now has to write a daily \"to-do list\" and will forget why she walks into a room. She denies any difficulty with shopping, cooking, or bill-paying. She completed college, worked successfully as an administrative assistant until she retired at age 65, volunteers at the library, and spends time with friends and family.

A detailed medical, psychiatric, and substance use history should be done to assess for other etiologies such as medication side effects, depression, alcohol or substance dependence, and delirium. A physical examination, including a full neurological examination, should also be performed, looking for acute and chronic illness and focality.\nAlthough the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most commonly used office screening, it is not particularly sensitive in those with mild disease and a high educational level, or, conversely, with a low educational level. There is no established cutoff for a diagnosis of MCI. A newer cognitive screen, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), is available online in a wide number of languages (http://www.mocatest.org). This test was designed to be more sensitive and specific for MCI and early AD as compared with the MMSE, which is more useful for moderate and severe dementia. Both tests use a scale of 30 points, with a score of \u226426 usually indicating cognitive impairment. Reasons for referral to a memory specialist or an Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) are described below.\nGeriatric depression can also present with memory complaints; therefore, history-taking should also include an evaluation for anhedonia, sleep and/or appetite disturbance, feelings of worthlessness and/or hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. Normalization of these symptoms as \"part of getting older,\" masking them as \"being anxious about seeing the doctor,\" or even denying them despite directly querying patients, may result in clinicians not detecting the presence of depression. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), an office screening tool, should also be administered and may be helpful to elicit depressive symptoms. A score >10 on the 30-item version suggests a mild depression and should trigger further history taking. The diagnosis of depression should not exclude the possibility of MCI, as depression may be the presenting symptom of a primary memory disorder. Translations of the GDS are available at http://www.stanford.edu/~yesavage/GDS.html.\nThere are no laboratory tests that definitely diagnose MCI; the purpose is to exclude other etiologies for memory loss, particularly reversible or treatable causes. Standard laboratory tests include vitamin B12, folic acid, rapid plasma reagin (syphilis), and thyroid stimulating hormone. Screening for risk factors and with as needed testing should also be done for substance use, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Lyme disease, and heavy metal exposure. Lumbar puncture is not generally necessary unless there is a suspicion of other treatable conditions, such as HIV, syphilis, or normal pressure hydrocephalus.\nNeuroimaging such as head computed tomography or, preferably, magnetic resonance imaging, can also be obtained. The main purpose is to exclude conditions such as hydrocephalus, stroke, severe white-matter disease, and tumor. Unless a patient presents with atypical features such as pronounced language or behavioral disturbances, focal neurologic symptoms or signs, or a history of cancer with a known predilection for the central nervous system, these scans are usually unremarkable, showing at most age-related atrophy or nonspecific white-matter changes. Electroencephalography should be considered in atypical cases, such as fluctuating cognitive status or automatisms that may be consistent with partial complex seizures; or rapid onset and progression of memory loss over the course of weeks to months, which may suggest a rapidly neurodegenerative disorder such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\nNeuropsychological testing can be helpful in distinguishing depression from a primary memory disorder, providing a baseline, or obtaining objective evidence for cognitive decline. Of note, neuropsychological tests can help contextualize and normalize a patient's cognitive functioning as it relates to his or her age and education. Detailed testing may also be useful in patients who have extremes of education or comorbidities in which the overall pattern of cognitive performance can be examined to confirm a diagnosis of MCI or various subtypes of dementia, or confounding psychiatric symptoms such as depression. This comprehensive cognitive testing is performed by a trained neuropsychologist, and usually covers a number of areas including verbal memory (e.g., list learning tasks such as California Verbal Learning Test or Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease battery), contextual memory (e.g., logical memory [a story recall task]), psychomotor speed (e.g., Trails A or grooved pegboard), executive functioning (e.g., Trails B or the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test), visuospatial abilities and memory (e.g., Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure) , attention (Digit Span Test, Trails A), and language (Boston Naming Test), category fluency (e.g., animal naming), and phonemic fluency. Good communication between the referring clinician and the neuropsychologist is vital to ensure diagnostic accuracy; two patients may have similar neuropsychological profiles but, depending upon the clinical history, may be given different diagnoses.\nThe gold standard for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is clinical history with corroboration from an informant. There are no definitive diagnostic tests for MCI, and neuropsychological tests and laboratory or brain imaging findings should be interpreted in the light of the clinician's history and assessment."}, {"section_title": "Caveats About Workup of Primary Memory Complaint", "text": "Due to the increasing public awareness about research in MCI and AD, clinicians should be aware of common misperceptions about research tests, most notably apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE4) status and the detection of beta amyloid in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or on imaging. Although APOE4 is a well-identified risk factor for AD, the presence of APOE4 does not guarantee the development of MCI or AD. Likewise, as there are other risk factors for MCI and AD, the mere absence of APOE4 does not preclude the possibility of the development of MCI and AD in the future. 6 There are no widely accepted CSF biomarkers for the diagnosis of MCI or AD, although their value for diagnosis and prediction for conversion from MCI to AD is being investigated. Recent research has also focused on the development of ligands for positron emission tomography imaging, such as Pittsburgh Compound B, to detect beta amyloid in the brain. Although the clinical significance of Pittsburgh Compound B positive findings and the standardization of this and similar tests are still being studied, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already recommended the amyloid imaging agent florbetapir for approval pending development and implementation by the company to train users to read scans consistently. 7 Biomarker profiling with peripheral, cerebrospinal fluid or neuroimaging markers thought to be associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not diagnostic for mild cognitive impairment, and are not currently recommended.\nIn the summer of 2010, three working groups proposed diagnostic criteria for Preclinical AD, MCI due to AD, and dementia from AD, which included a variety of biomarkers and imaging techniques. 8 These criteria are under revision and should be published in 2011. It should be noted, though, that most CNS amyloid measures (both imaging and CSF markers) should not be used in asymptomatic individuals who are simply anxious about developing symptoms due to aging or in the context of a family history of late onset dementia, as the false positive rate is high. 9, 10 Patients interested in participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a nationwide multicenter initiative to correlate imaging and biomarkers with longitudinal clinical evaluation, can be referred to an appropriate research center as described in Table 2 . Potential subjects should be aware, however, that they may not receive their individual results of these experimental markers.\nIn summary, clinicians should remember that a detailed history with a corroborated memory complaint and objective memory findings remains the gold standard for an accurate diagnosis of MCI; a \"positive\" AD biomarker profile may provide supporting evidence for the diagnosis. To date, molecular profiling and imaging for markers associated with AD have not been shown to be correlated with a clinical diagnosis of normal cognition, MCI, or AD. 11 Therefore, individuals with a positive biomarker profile but without objective memory impairment should not be diagnosed with either MCI or dementia."}, {"section_title": "Treatment and Research Opportunities", "text": "Given the instability of the diagnosis of MCI, clinicians should closely follow identified patients with cognitive screens every 6-12 months and be alert for signs of functional decline that indicate conversion to AD or other dementias. There are no FDA-approved therapies for MCI; therefore, the decision is to watch and wait or to consider off-label treatment with an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. Treatment of MCI with an AChE inhibitor has modest impact but is associated with the risk of side effects, mostly gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. In the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, a placebocontrolled trial of vitamin E versus donepezil, donepezil delayed progression of AD for 1 year, but by 3 years the treatment group had the same rate of conversion to AD. 12 The possibility of delaying the time to conversion to dementia and the subsequent loss of functionality is not insignificant, but the lack of a more long-lasting effect is probably due to AChE inhibitors not significantly altering the underlying disease process. Although it has been hypothesized that oxidative stress is one process involved in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, vitamin E has not been shown to be efficacious in delaying the progression of MCI to AD. 12 Mediterranean diet, physical exercise, and the maintenance of cardiovascular health have been associated in various epidemiologic studies with better cognitive outcomes. Randomized trials, however, have not been completed, and there are no data demonstrating the prevention of MCI or AD. Nevertheless, given the low risk of these interventions and the possible general health benefits, patients should be counseled on these measures. Finally, as part of standard clinical care, advance directives and financial matters should also be discussed while patients are able to articulate their decisions, independent of their likelihood of conversion to dementia. Advance directives are discussed in more detail below.\nResearch is now focused on improving the accuracy of identification of the subgroup of patients who have MCI and will progress to AD. Those patients who are interested in research or clinical-trial participation should be referred to a nearby ADRC or Web sites for clinical trial recruitment. Resources to identify current research opportunities for MCI or AD are shown in Table 2 ."}, {"section_title": "ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE Definition and Epidemiology", "text": "Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia and accounts for about 60%-80% of diagnosed dementias. Currently, there are 5.3 million people in the United States diagnosed with AD, and this number is expected to increase markedly as the Baby Boomers age, and the percentage of the population aged >85 years continues to increase. As per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, Text Revision, AD requires the following: (1) new onset memory impairment; (2) another cognitive disturbance, such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or executive functioning; and (3) a gradual, progressive course that results in significant functional impairment. The National Institute of Neurological and Communication Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association classifies the diagnosis of Alzheimer's into probable, possible, and definite. The criteria for probable AD require confirmation on clinical exam and cognitive testing, deficits in \u22652 domains of cognition, and progressive decline in memory and functioning. The criteria for possible AD apply if there is an atypical course or presentation, or there is another illness present but it is not the primary cause of the dementia. A definite diagnosis can only be made if there is a clinical presentation consistent with AD and there is neuropathological confirmation by autopsy or biopsy. 13 The diagnosis of AD is made by clinical history, documentation of functional decline, and ruling out other potential etiologies of cognitive decline."}, {"section_title": "Differential Diagnosis and Workup", "text": "The workup for AD is similar to the workup for MCI described above ( Table 1 ). The differential diagnosis of AD includes other types of dementia (mixed, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus, HIV, and other rare forms of dementia), delirium, and, less frequently, seizure disorders. Features that may indicate another type of dementia other than AD are shown in Table 3 . If the clinician suspects a dementia other than or in addition to an AD or a vascular etiology, a specialist referral should be considered for accurate diagnosis, as this significantly affects prognosis and treatment efficacy. Other reasons for referral to a specialist, a memory clinic, or an Alzheimer's Disease Center or ADRC include the following: the patient's memory changes began before age 60; a focal neurologic examination; a significant family history of earlyonset AD or other dementia or neurologic disease; a significant psychiatric history; or a neurological disorder associated with cognitive deficits, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, or traumatic brain injury.

The daughter is upset because on visiting her mother, she found multiple notices about unpaid utility bills, and the electric company has threatened to turn off the lights.

The putative mechanism is inhibition of the enzyme AChE, which transiently increases levels of acetylcholine at the synapse. The most commonly prescribed oral AChEI is donepezil. Bradycardia is the most concerning side effect, and an electrocardiogram should be done to rule out bradycardia or a bundle branch block. The most common side effects are GI upset and sleep disturbances such as vivid dreams, wakefulness, or sedation; these can be avoided or addressed by starting at a low dose and then slowly titrating up, taking medication with food, and switching the timing of the medication. Patients who continue to experience GI side effects or who are not able to take oral medication can consider the rivastigmine transdermal patch (Exelon). Patients and families should be informed that AChEIs may improve cognition and/or function, and patients usually remain better on the drug than off. It is not curative, and patients continue to decline at the same rate as previously. Therefore, at some point, usually 6-18 months after starting medication, they will be \"back where they started.\" Table 4 reviews medications for all stages of AD.\nThe only FDA-approved treatment for early Alzheimer's disease is the class of medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.\nDue to the progressive nature of AD and the profound effect on both the patients and families, it is important to provide education and either provide or refer for counseling. Families should be encouraged to contact the Alzheimer's Association (http://www.alz.org) to obtain psychoeducation and emotional support. The Alzheimer's Association also offers a number of other resources, including caregiver and patient groups, a 24-hour hotline (1-800-272-3900), Safe Return bracelets for patients who wander or are confused, downloadable information on a variety of topics, and small respite grants.\nBecause most patients with early AD are able to participate in decision-making, this is a critical period to appoint a healthcare proxy and express their long-term healthcare goals. Patients should be encouraged to discuss wishes for their current situations but also to communicate at what point in their illness they would not want aggressive measures pursued any further. Patients should also be encouraged to make research advance directives regarding what types of procedures or novel medications they would be willing to participate in. Goals of care and directives should be reviewed at least once annually with the family and, whenever possible, with the patient, or when there is a significant medical event (particularly hospitalization complicated with delirium or loss of functioning).\nPatients should also be counseled that they should decide whom to appoint as their power of attorney, and clinicians should remind families that power of attorney is a separate role from healthcare proxy. Referral to a lawyer familiar with elder law and financial planning and/or to a geriatric case manager or social worker may help families with long-term planning.\nFuture planning should include healthcare proxy, advance directives, and recommendation to obtain help with financial planning and power of attorney.\nAll patients who drive and are newly diagnosed with dementia should be assessed for their driving safety. Clinical history and clinician judgment should be used to make a determination; MMSE scores have limited predictive value. Patients whose informants express any concern about the patients' ability to drive should be asked to give up driving until they can pass an on-road driving evaluation. Depending upon the clinical situation and state guidelines, physicians can submit a request requiring patients submit to an on-road driver's test or have their license suspended. Some states have mandatory reporting of unsafe driving concerns. If the patient continues to drive, it is important to follow up with further questioning periodically.

The most commonly used medication classes are the antidepressants, mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines.\nThe most commonly used antidepressants are the SSRIs and trazodone, which is usually used on an as needed basis or for sleep. The published evidence is variable, with some small trials showing benefit and others not. 25, 26 In one clinical trial, the efficacy of antipsychotics versus citalopram was not significantly different, and for the 40% of patients who remained in the trial, citalopram was as effective as risperidone. 27 Therefore, clinically, an SSRI may be a good first-line option particularly for patients who appear irritable, anxious, sad, or depressed. 28 Anticonvulsants have been used for agitation and behavioral control in a number of settings. Valproate and carbamazepine have the most data, but they are hard to tolerate and have many potential side effects and drug interactions. Gabapentin and lamotrigine are used clinically, and are better tolerated by patients. There are numerous case reports, case series, and open-label studies demonstrating that gabapentin and lamotrigine are well-tolerated and can improve agitation, [29] [30] [31] [32] but large-scale randomized, placebo-controlled trials are lacking.\nBenzodiazepines are not usually recommended because of their potential to increase falls risk, confusion, and disinhibition, but occasionally they may be helpful in treating patients with marked anxiety. 26 Only short-to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines with no active metabolites (e.g., lorazepam or oxazepam) should be used. Medications such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide are never recommended because of their long half-life and numerous active metabolites. 26 Atypical antipsychotic medications seem to have moderate efficacy in treating the neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD. In a 2008 meta-analysis of 15 trials, only risperidone and aripiprazole showed efficacy, 25 although the variations in the individual trials made the dataset difficult to interpret. The large National Institute of Mental Health-funded Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness-AD (CATIE-AD) 33 attempted to assess the effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of psychosis or agitation in dementia. It was a large and complex trial, but it did not lead to definitive answers, as was hoped. Anecdotally, these medications can be quite helpful, but the risks must be carefully weighed. The side effects of the atypicals include metabolic abnormalities (dyslipidemia, weight gain, and diabetes), QTc prolongation, increased falls risk, sedation, and increase in cerebrovascular adverse events. 25 In a meta-analysis, pooled rates of cerebrovascular events were 1.9% in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics compared with 0.9% in patients on placebo, and the risk of all-cause mortality was 1.6-1.7 \u00d7 greater. 34 Commonly used medications are summarized in Table 7 .\nAdverse effects of medications include abnormal gait and risk of falls, as well as medication-specific risks such as QTc or metabolic syndrome, which need to be followed and documented closely.\nTypical antipsychotics are known to be associated with increased risk for QTc prolongation and extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) such as rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. In clinical trials for agitation, they were equivalently efficacious as the atypical antipsychotics. 25 Overall, the risk of cerebrovascular events appears to be at least as significant for conventional antipsychotics as for atypicals. The risk of other side effects (e.g., EPS and tardive dyskinesia) is greater in typicals than atypicals. 25 Clinically, physicians often use conventional antipsychotics when atypical antipsychotics fail to control target neuropsychiatric symptoms. 25 The decision to use antipsychotics is usually made only when other approaches and medications have failed and the patient remains combative, agitated, or psychotic. When clinicians are discussing the use of these medications with patients and families, a palliative care approach may be used: These are not curative treatments, they carry some risk, but they may help you achieve your goals for palliation, to help the patient remain at home, not be upset/frightened/angry/combative, and so forth. Within this framework, there must be close monitoring of efficacy (frequency, amplitude, and duration of episodes) and of safety (e.g., following QTc, looking for emerging insulin resistance, evaluating gait, and examining for EPS).\nTreatment/family discussions should follow a palliative care model with clinicians discussing benefits and risks and making decisions in the context of patient/ caregiver goals. Efficacy should be monitored by considering the frequency and amplitude of agitated episodes.\nIn discussing goals of care, families often want to avoid hospitalization or institutionalization, and therefore managing the symptoms in the home, despite the attendant risks, is preferable. It is often easier to broach the subject of risks of various treatments when agitation is first an issue, leaving room to discuss the spectrum of possible interventions, beginning with those with fewer known risks and discussing the rationale of the steps taken along the way. This usually leads to a healthy dialogue and understanding of the risks and benefits of treatment. It is important to remember that after 3-6 months of successful treatment, attempts should be made to very gradually lower the dose of medication to minimize exposure and risk. 35 An emergent psychiatric evaluation or an evaluation in an emergency room should be considered for physical aggression, agitation that is not responsive to interventions, or behavior that endangers the patient or others. 36"}, {"section_title": "CASE ILLUSTRATION: PART 5", "text": "Five years later, the patient has 24 hour care and is primarily bedbound and unable to feed herself.

This stage can be particularly difficult for caregivers, as the patient may not show signs of recognition and cannot verbally express his or her needs, and thus is completely dependent. Some signs that patients are entering the \"terminal\" phase of their illness, with a prognosis of <6 months, include being unable to ambulate, dress, and bathe without the assistance of another person; inability to communicate meaningfully; urinary and fecal incontinence; an episode of aspiration pneumonia, pyelonephritis, sepsis, or recurrent fevers despite treatment; stage 3 or 4 decubiti; malnutrition (e.g., albumin <2.5); or difficulty swallowing. This constellation is similar to what hospice uses as admission criteria for nononcologic patients.\nAt this stage of illness, clinicians should also consider simplifying medication regimens in light of patients' swallowing difficulties and end-stage disease. Some medications are available as liquids or may be given crushed in food. Some medications, such as cholesterollowering agents or antidementia medications, can be stopped. Another crucial point is a careful assessment for and adequate treatment of pain, especially as patients are not able to advocate for themselves. Although families are also often concerned about adequate nutrition, there are no data that prove that feeding tubes significantly prolong life or improve quality of life. Patients with feeding tubes can still aspirate, and patients may be at risk of infection or confusion and restraint (i.e., if they try to remove the tubes). Monitored assisted feeding is generally recommended over the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube. Feeding can be a time of closeness and connection and, whenever possible, be encouraged.\nFinally, it is crucial to think about the comfort of the patient and support for the caregiver. This can range from home care, home-based medical care programs (visiting doctors), hospice programs to nursing homes. If the patient meets the criteria for Medicare home hospice (<6 months expected lifespan), this can provide an enormous amount of support and care. Decisions about types of care and possible residential placement should reflect the patient's needs, financial concerns, and the caregiver's health and emotional needs. Ideally, families will have these discussions long before a crisis emerges to minimize conflict at a crucial juncture. Having the patient and family discuss and document end-of-life wishes and sign a living will and healthcare proxy when the patient has capacity to make decisions can significantly improve quality of life and quality of death for the patient and the family. Social work and/or legal referrals can also be very helpful at this time. One helpful resource for families is a downloadable brochure from the Alzheimer's Association titled \"End of Life Decisions\" (http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_publications.asp)."}, {"section_title": "Interventions for Family Members", "text": "Caregivers report significantly more distress due to both cognitive and behavioral changes and providing increased care for ADLs. 37 Therefore, physicians should also carefully monitor caregivers for signs of distress, including caregiver depression, medical self-neglect, and financial or legal stresses. Risk factors for caregiver depression include patient depression, severity of behavioral disturbance, and perceived burden. 38 Caregivers who have signs of depression should be referred to a mental health specialist and caregiver support groups. Placement of the patients in an assisted living or nursing home may alleviate the burden of care, but many caregivers continue to experience guilt about not being able keep their loved ones at home or watching the prolonged course of dementia takes its toll. The degree of support and connection with physicians is an important part of the caregiver's experience, and feeling supported, even in the face of decline and loss, can make a significant difference to a caregiver."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The diagnosis, management, and treatment of MCI, AD and other dementias, and their neuropsychiatric sequelae, present significant challenges for the patients, families, and clinicians.
