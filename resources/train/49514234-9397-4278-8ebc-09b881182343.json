The availability of biomarkers and improved understanding of factors that contribute to heterogeneity in cognitive decline are required to improve diagnosis and prognosis. Small chronic brain haemorrhages occurring with impaired small vessel wall integrity, known as brain microbleeds (BMBs), 1 are commonly found in elderly individuals and have been linked to key hypotheses in the neuro-pathogenesis of the most common form of dementia (i.e. Alzheimer's Disease [AD]), namely the 'amyloid cascade' 2 and the 'vascular hypothesis'. 3 However, the clinical effect of BMBs on cognition is an evolving research field. 4 The prevalence of BMBs at different stages within the continuum of cognitive decline, reported by a recent review of multiple studies using different magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences and different magnet strengths, 1 are shown in Figure 1 .\nA further exploratory analysis on the progression pattern of brain mineral deposition, including BMBs, as a differential indicator of cognitive decline in a crosssectional sample of 200 individuals aged 55-90 years old (58 cognitively normal [CN] , 127 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI] and 15 with AD) observed a similar trend, of a higher count in the number of BMBs in individuals with MCI compared with those with AD. 5 Indeed, a number of studies have identified a lack of association between BMBs and cognitive function in AD patients, 6, 7 indicating that BMBs may not be present in patients with severe AD at all 6 and that cognitive decline in AD may be independent of BMB number.\n8 MCI could be manifested on different neurocognitive disorders. However, as MCI is a stage in the continuum of cognitive decline that leads to AD, exploring the manifestations at each stage of this continuum would certainly lead to a better understanding of the AD pathogenesis. Few longitudinal studies have considered the predictive value of BMB detection on the progression of cognitive decline. 9, 10 A study found MCI participants with BMBs were twice as likely to progress to dementia than those without BMBs. 10 Another study investigated AD patients and found that patients with BMBs were more cognitively impaired than patients without BMBs, despite having similar disease duration. 9 Although these studies suggest that BMBs may have a potential predictive value for progression of cognitive decline, the evidence is limited. The variability in the outcome of the assessment of BMBs when magnetic field strengths and sequence parameters differ is known; 11 and it has been considered the main limitation in the analyses of BMB progression. To the best of our knowledge, and in agreement with a recent review on the reproducibility and variability of MRI markers in cerebral small vessel disease, 11 no study has assessed the reproducibility of any longitudinal measurement for BMBs.\nThis study investigated BMB progression over three consecutive years in groups of individuals with different cognitive status: CN, early MCI (EMCI), late MCI (LMCI), and AD, with the hypothesis that BMB prevalence and count progress in CN and MCI individuals, but not in AD patients. The study also evaluated putative risk factors for BMB progression at each time-point and analysed the influence of inter-observer differences on the assessment of BMB progression. Of note, the use of the term 'progression' not only refers to whether BMB prevalence (i.e. the proportion of patients with BMBs) and count (i.e. the individual number of BMBs per patient) increased (i.e. progressed), but also if it decreased (i.e. regressed), or remained stable from one year to the next."}, {"section_title": "Patients and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Clinical data extraction from the ADNI database", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 12 The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W Weiner, MD.

Since BMB counts were obtained at three time-points (year 1 [Y1], year 2 [Y2] and year 3 [Y3]), the evaluation was performed for potential change from Y1 to Y2, Y2 to Y3 and Y1 to Y3. Candidate variables were selected a priori based on clinical plausibility and/or previous research (Table 1 ).\n14-39 Data exploration suggested three ANCOVA analyses for bio-specimens (ANCOVA 1), brain measurements (ANCOVA 2) and cognition (ANCOVA 3) should be performed at each time-point. Prior to conducting ANCOVAs, collinearity was assessed through Belsley collinearity diagnostics 41 and any covariates found to have statistically significant associations with other covariates included in each ANCOVA were excluded. Independence between each covariate and the independent variable and homogeneity of regression slope assumptions were also tested and any statistically significant associations excluded from the analysis. Finally, principal component analysis was performed prior to conducting the cognition ANCOVA to restrict cognitive test scores to four principal components that explained 78.38% of the variance. Finally, statistically significant predictors for potential change in BMB count at each time-point from the ANCOVAs were then used to calculate odds ratios to determine whether each predictor was a factor for BMB progression, i.e. an increase in BMB count from Y1 to Y2, Y2 to Y3 or Y1 to Y3. For this, significant predictors from ANCOVAs were dichotomized appropriately; presence or absence for binary factors and clinical criterion used for continuous factors.\nBrain microbleed counts reported by each observer for a subsample of 150 patients (cross-sectional subsample) were used to assess inter-observer variability on BMB prevalence per cognitive group. A Bland-Altman plot was constructed to evaluate inter-observer differences. 42 The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to determine whether differences in BMB prevalence between cognitive groups were significant. Cohen's kappa for BMB presence/absence and for BMB count were also calculated, using an online tool ( V R Richard Lowry 2001-2015) 43 and the MATLAB V R function kappa, version 1.3 by Giuseppe Cardillo. 44 Brain microbleed counts reported by each observer for a subsample of 20 patients (longitudinal subsample) were used to assess inter-observer variability on BMB progression per cognitive group. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to determine significance in the differences in average (i.e. mean or median depending on whether the data were normally distributed or not) BMB prevalence between cognitive groups. The median number of BMBs reported by each observer, in each cognitive group each year, was also calculated.\nDifferences in BMB counts reported by each observer were further investigated.

Observer 2 had a tendency to report a higher BMB count in the basal ganglia in the subsample of 20 patients, and in the cortex in the subsample of 150 patients. Inter-observer differences were mainly found in these two locations (i.e. the basal ganglia and cortex). However, in the subsample of 150 patients, median differences of 1 BMB were found in the grey/ white matter junction (three cases), brain stem (six cases), thalami (two cases), cerebellum (eight cases) and subcortical white matter (three cases). Vessel calcifications (Figure 4a ), basal ganglia mineralization ( Figure 4b ) and reduced cortical thickness (Figure 4c ) hampered identification of 'true' BMBs and hence affected inter-observer reliability."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The findings of the current study suggest that the number of BMBs may increase in cognitively normal and mild cognitively impaired individuals but not in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, a progression pattern was not present, and none of the factors reported to date to be associated with BMB prevalence appeared to predict these results, although total serum cholesterol was identified as the main potential predictor of the change in BMB count at each time-point. Despite equal assessment conditions, inter-observer variations can be considered problematic in the assessment of BMB progression; their variation seems to have little influence in the analysis of BMB progression in the sample, not so in individual cases. Contrary to our hypothesis, progression of BMBs in CN and MCI groups of individuals could not be ascertained, as it was observed only in a small proportion of individuals from each group. BMB prevalence remained stable in all AD patients as hypothesized. However, the AD group of patients had higher median number of BMBs than the other three groups. The lack of progression maybe due to the low prevalence of vascular risk factors in AD patients compared with the other groups of individuals. Despite considerable heterogeneity within the existing literature, these current findings contrast with the general trend reported. 1 For example, the Rotterdam study investigated elderly individuals without dementia and reported progression in BMB prevalence from 24.4% at baseline to 28.0% after three years. 21 Although a percentage of CN individuals with BMBs in this current study showed similar progression, increasing from 25.51% to 28.57% three years later, in our case this increase was not significant in the overall sample. Possible explanations for this discrepancy include differences in sample sizes, study population characteristics, MRI sequences and imaging parameter choices, inter-observer variation and/or observer experience. Many studies described in a review 1 used small sample sizes, 10,45-47 particularly for CN controls, which may not be representative of BMB prevalence per cognitive group. MRI sequence and imaging parameter choice can also affect BMB identification with susceptibility-weighted images enhancing the susceptibility-related contrasts, and higher magnetic fields increasing the contrast-to-noise ratio and the BMB size. 48 Different study sample characteristics may also have influenced BMB prevalence. The current sample was not representative of the general population, as individuals that have baseline MRI scans with evidence of infarction or other focal lesions, presence of multiple lacunes or lacunes in a critical memory structure, and/or other brain structural abnormalities are excluded from ADNI, hence only individuals with absence or mild presence of vascular pathology are included. Moreover, in the current sample, the mean age in the CN group (74 years) was slightly higher than the EMCI and LMCI groups (70 and 71 years, respectively); and the proportion of CN individuals with two cardiovascular risk factors (29.59%) was also greater than for the EMCI and LMCI groups (26.00% and 21.05%, respectively) and AD (5.88%) patients. BMB prevalence is known to increase with age and cardiovascular risks. 20, 22, 23 Finally, accurate BMB identification is crucial to reporting BMB prevalence, and to our knowledge, this has not been analysed in any of the previous longitudinal studies of BMB progression.\nNo specific clinical risk factors predicted BMB progression. The association of specific clinical risk factors with BMBs is somewhat conflicting in the existing literature. For example, a study found low total cholesterol to be associated with BMB prevalence, 22 whereas this study found elevated total cholesterol to predict potential change in BMB count from Y1 to Y2 and Y1 to Y3. This latter finding is more consistent with that reported in a study of dementia patients, with BMB prevalence increasing with hyperlipidaemia and with MCI patients with hyperlipidaemia having increased BMB counts. 23 Similarly, conflicting findings have been reported for endocrine-metabolic risk factors, specifically diabetes. 21, 23 There is a dearth of information on factors and neuropathological markers of cognitive decline and dementia progression, which include years in education, family history of AD and BMBs. 14, 35, 36 The present study is specific to factors that contribute to potential change in BMB count and therefore not directly comparable with research on cognitive decline per se.\nOdds ratios were small with confidence intervals overlapping one in the current study. Predictors derived from ANCOVA models may not have translated into significant odds ratios due to sample size and/or small effect size of putative risk factors, and/or dichotomization. Change of the number of BMBs counted in the period analysed was only observed in less than 30 patients. Such sample sizes may have been too small to produce significant findings. Furthermore, the predictors determined by ANCOVA had to be dichotomized to calculate odds ratios. Such dichotomization may have resulted in loss of statistical power. Indeed, two studies investigating risk factors associated with BMBs used much larger samples sizes and logistic regression models to avoid limitations associated with dichotomization. 20, 22 They still reported odds ratios and confidence intervals quite close to (and often overlapping) one. The progression of other markers of cerebral small vessel disease like white matter hyperintensities could predict the progression of BMBs. However, only visual ratings of white matter hyperintensities and perivascular spaces at Y1 were available for the analyses. Future longitudinal studies require larger sample sizes, quantitative measures of small vessel disease indicators at each time-point and/or alternative statistical approaches to fully investigate risk factors for BMB progression.\nVariation in inter-observer differences was observed in the current study. BlandAltman analysis found a bias towards Observer 2 reporting a higher BMB count, with an increased difference as BMB count increased. However, the analysis of the overall BMB progression in the sample yielded similar results for both observers. Despite recognition of large ranges of inter-observer reliability within the existing literature, 40 there are no guidelines on what constitutes clinically acceptable bias/limits of agreement. Most studies have reported kappa statistics; however, this parameter is limited in interpreting the extent of agreement, with the quantitative value being qualitatively described as slight, fair, moderate etc. For consistency in the way results are reported and to allow comparability with other studies, this current study also reported kappa statistics. Bland-Altman methodology, though, is more appropriate to parametric data, permitting the meaningfulness of change to be determined within the context of the measurement scale (i.e. the 95% limits of agreement are placed in 'test score' units in contrast to kappa).\nFactors found to affect inter-observer reliability have previously been reported as those confounding BMB detection. 11, 49, 50 Basal ganglia mineralization is likely to explain Observer 2's tendency to report a higher BMB count in the basal ganglia, and vessel calcifications and reduced cortical thickness, hampering differentiation between BMBs and vessel calcification, explaining the higher BMB count reported for the cortex. A previous study on 100 CN community-dwelling individuals aged 73 years showed a positive and strong correlation and considerable overlap between calcified regions and other regions with iron accumulation in its different forms. 52, 51 Others have suggested a shared pathway for the age-related deposition of both minerals in the brain, occasionally attributed to the primary accumulation of one followed by the other; 53 or to a shared transport mechanism that manifests in the deposition of both minerals in the vicinities of the blood vessels. 54 These may partly explain why inter-observer differences increased with the increase of the BMB count and the consistency in the overall progression pattern of BMBs found by both observers despite the influence that the inter-observer differences had on the assessment of the BMB progression in individual cases. Future studies should seek to reduce interobserver variation and there should be a clinical consensus on acceptable bias/limits of agreement.\nThis study had a number of strengths and limitations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that assesses the reproducibility of longitudinal measurements of BMBs, as such contributing to the emerging field of research on BMBs as potential pathological markers within the spectrum of cognitive decline. Strengths of this study also include the large number of individuals assessed under the same MRI protocol using well-validated BMB guidelines and the wide variety of relevant participant data available. The observers were blinded to clinical data, including cognitive status, throughout image analysis.\nA limitation of this study was the relatively small AD group. Longitudinal study designs and the nature of AD may impede obtaining comparatively sized AD groups; 55 however, future studies should try to secure larger AD populations to facilitate valid comparisons. This study was also limited by the inclusion/ exclusion criteria of the ADNI database, a cohort not entirely representative of the general population. 56 Individuals with substantial small vessel disease are excluded from ADNI and therefore AD patients are likely to be more genetically prone to the disease. Clinical study data included were also restricted to available ADNI database parameters collected across multiple sites. Although a general protocol is in place, variations in techniques and data collection methodologies are likely. The location of BMBs was not statistically analysed in this study. Lobar BMBs have been previously found to be associated with longitudinal cognitive decline, whereas BMBs located in the deep grey matter and infratentorial brain revealed no significant associations. 57 BMBs in all regions were included in this study, potentially diluting findings. A further limitation is the failure to apply a Bonferroni correction to the ANCOVA models that would have resulted in a more stringent criterion for statistical significance. Finally, intra-observer variation was not considered here due to time constraints; such measurements are also important to determine, although might reasonably be expected to be less than inter-observer variations.\nBrain microbleed prevalence and count appeared to progress in CN and MCI individuals but not in AD patients; however, differences between cognitive groups were not significant and the median number of BMBs tended to remain stable in each group over time. No significant progression pattern was found in the sample analysed, although as noted above this sample may not be representative of the general ageing population. Although total cholesterol, years in education, family history of dementia and AD, and endocrine-metabolic risk factors were weakly predictive of potential change in BMB count at certain timepoints, they were not significant risk factors for BMB progression. Finally, despite equal conditions, inter-observer differences were found and inter-observer variation is likely to have influenced BMB progression pattern assessment. Therefore, this report cannot exclude BMB progression in AD patients.\nWhile this study highlights the importance of reporting inter-observer variation, future studies should seek to reduce interobserver differences. Similar inter-observer variation analyses could be performed for computational rather than visual assessments of BMBs, to determine whether computational assessment methods are more reliable. Repeating this study in a few years may yield different results as the cognitive status of individuals enrolled in ADNI is likely to advance along the continuum of cognitive decline and more patients are likely to have had three consecutive study visits, minimizing AD group limitations. A similar study could also be performed in a larger sample of patients, adjusting for baseline characteristics, and across a wider spectrum of cognitive decline. Also, analysing a wider interval between assessments and/or increasing the number of yearly assessments (i.e. analysing progression in 4 or more years) would be clinically important. Analysis of BMB location may also be informative. Such a study is likely to provide useful information on BMB progression and associated risk factors, confirming or otherwise the potentially valuable role of BMBs as a differential indicator of cognitive decline."}]
