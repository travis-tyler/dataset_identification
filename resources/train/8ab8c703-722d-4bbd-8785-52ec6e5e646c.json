The longitudinal relationships between UAE and the various indices of blood pressure (BP) are not well studied. We compared the associations of UAE with the longitudinal exposure to PP and systolic, diastolic, and mean BPs. UAE was measured from 24-hour urine collections in 450 community-dwelling subjects (age: 57\u03ee15 years, 53% women, all with UAE \u03fd200 g/min). For each subject, longitudinal indices of BP were estimated by dividing the area under the curve of serial measurements of BP (median: 5) during 1 to 22 years preceding UAE measurement by the number of follow-up years. Median (interquartile range) UAE was 4.7 g/min (3.3 to 7.8 g/min) in women and 5.2 g/min (3.7 to 9.8 g/min) in men.

[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] However, to date, only 1 study has compared the associations of UAE with the various indices of BP. 9 In a cross-sectional study that only included men, Pedrinelli et al 9 found that, among the 4 indices of BP, PP was the best predictor of microalbuminuria (defined as UAE \u054615 g/min). In another study, Tsakiris et al 14 found that, after adjusting for age, spot urinary albumin concentration measured in a morning urine sample was significantly associated with concurrent SBP and PP but not with concurrent DBP or MBP. Although urinary albumin concentration had a stronger association with concurrent PP (\u2424\u03ed0.199; P\u03ed0.00001) than with concurrent SBP (\u2424\u03ed0.164; P\u03ed0.005), these associations were not directly compared in that study. 14 In addition, there was considerable variability in the associations of urinary albumin concentration with the 4 BP indices measured 3 and 12 years before urinary albumin measurement. 14 Two other studies have compared the associations of worsening renal function with the various indices of BP. 29, 30 In a post hoc analysis of data from the Reduction of Endpoints in Noninsulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus With the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan Study, Bakris et al 29 found that, in subjects with hypertension and established diabetic nephropathy, baseline PP was a better predictor of the primary composite outcome of doubling of serum creat- inine, end-stage renal disease, or death than baseline SBP or DBP and that SBP and PP were equivalent as predictors of incident end-stage renal disease. 29 In contrast, in a subgroup of subjects from the placebo arm of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program, Young et al 30 found that baseline SBP was better than baseline PP in predicting a decline in kidney function, defined as a 0.4-mg/dL increase in serum creatinine, during 5 years of follow-up. It is noteworthy that both of these studies 29, 30 only used the baseline BP variables to predict the study outcomes. This is important because all of the subjects in the Reduction of Endpoints in NoninsulinDependent Diabetes Mellitus With the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan Study 29 and 44% of the subjects in the placebo arm of Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program 31 received antihypertensive medications, which would affect their BP during the course of the study.\nThe present study is the first to compare the relationships of UAE, a measure of renal microvascular injury, and the 4 longitudinal indices of BP. Our findings underscore the importance of the pulsatile component of BP as a risk factor for increased UAE and support the hypothesis that implicates pressure pulsatility in renal microvascular injury. 17, 18 It should be noted that the present study examined the relationships of the longitudinal indices of BP with UAE, and not with glomerular filtration rate, which is a measure of overall renal function.\nIt is also noteworthy that, compared with longitudinal models, cross-sectional models accounted for a larger proportion of the overall variance in UAE, suggesting a stronger association of UAE with concurrent indices of BP than with longitudinal indices of BP. This observation may suggest that the renal microvasculature is more susceptible to short-term, rather than to long-term, exposure to BP, or that concurrent BP may be influenced by the same pathophysiological processes that mediate higher UAE levels and, thus, may demonstrate a stronger association with UAE. Future studies of the longitudinal changes in both BP and UAE are required to further elucidate the interrelationship between BP and UAE."}, {"section_title": "Mechanistic Hypotheses That Link UAE With the Pulsatile Component of BP", "text": "Contemporary views suggest that the high-flow, lowresistance arterial system of the kidneys and the unique arterial structure of the glomeruli may play a major role in the pathogenesis of renal microvascular injury in hypertension. 17, 18 Specifically, to maintain glomerular filtration pressure, vascular resistance in the afferent arteriole is constantly maintained below that in the efferent arteriole. Thus, unlike most systemic arterial territories, where the precapillary resistance arterioles shield the microcirculation from excessive pressure pulsatility, the glomeruli are exposed to high levels of pulsatile pressure. 17, 18 In addition, PP decay across the glomerulus is drastic, indicating that the bulk of the pulsatile energy that is transmitted through the afferent arteriole is absorbed in the glomerulus. 19 Additional evidence for the vulnerability of glomeruli to pulsatile pressure comes from experimental studies of the myogenic response of the afferent arteriole, which is thought to be the primary mechanism that protects the glomeruli from BP-induced injury. 20 Loutzenhiser et al 20 found that this mechanism primarily responded to changes in SBP, whereas, when SBP was held constant, this renoprotective mechanism was insensitive to changes in the other indices of BP, including PP. Thus, it may be concluded that, although the myogenic response can protect the glomeruli from SBP-induced barotrauma within the autoregulatory range of BP, it is not equipped to protect the glomeruli from the detrimental effects of PP.\nAdditional support for the role of PP in the pathogenesis of increased UAE comes from studies of the effects of PP on small artery structure and function. There is good evidence that, among the various indices of BP, PP is most strongly correlated with small artery remodeling (eg, increased media:lumen ratio). 32, 33 Interestingly, among the currently available classes of medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which are the standard treatment for the reduction of UAE, also appear to be the most effective in reversing these small-artery structural abnormalities. 34 Importantly, such structural changes are often accompanied by significant abnormalities in small-artery function, including endothelial dysfunction, 17, 34 which is strongly linked to UAE. 2, 35 The strong association between UAE and generalized endothelial dysfunction suggests that glomerular endothelial dysfunction may play a causative role in the pathogenesis of increased UAE. 2, 35 Indeed, in an experimental study, endothelial dysfunction antedated the rise in UAE in hypertensive rats. 36 Importantly, clinical studies indicate that endothelial dysfunction is more strongly associated with PP than with SBP, 37 suggesting that endothelial cells may be more susceptible to oscillatory than to peak shear stress. Collectively, these findings support our results and suggest that the stronger association of UAE with longitudinal PP rather than with longitudinal SBP in the present study may be a manifestation of the stronger deleterious effects of chronic exposure to PP on endothelial function."}, {"section_title": "Sex-Related Differences: Potential Explanations", "text": "Although the reasons for the lack of association between UAE and BP among the women in our cohort are not entirely clear, several observations may help to explain the sex-related discordance in our results. Compared with men, women in our cohort had a shorter duration of follow-up (P\u03fd0.001), significantly lower UAE (P\u03ed0.003), less microalbuminuria (P\u03ed0.009), and a lower global vascular risk burden (Table 1) . Notably, sex-related differences in the incidence and severity of renal disease are not uncommon. 38 Multiple studies have found higher levels of UAE in men than in women, 13, 39, 40 which may be because of sex-related differences in endothelial function 41 or glomerular hemodynamics. 42 "}, {"section_title": "Clinical Implications", "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the association between UAE and the risk of adverse outcomes is linear, without any specific thresholds. 43 Thus, identification of modifiable risk factors for low-grade UAE is important, especially vis-\u00e0-vis the rising prevalence of albuminuria. 44 Our results suggest that, at least in men, chronic exposure to high PP can lead to higher UAE. This finding suggests that therapies that reduce central arterial stiffness may have superior renoprotective effects compared with therapies that reduce BP but have a lesser impact on central arterial stiffness. Interestingly, the vasopeptidase inhibitor, omapatrilat, which was more effective than enalapril in reducing proximal aortic stiffness in humans, 45 also produced a larger reduction in glomerular pressure and proteinuria and conferred superior renoprotection compared with enalapril in an animal model of glomerulosclerosis. 46 "}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "The strengths of our study include using the gold standard measure of UAE and using longitudinal data derived from repeated measurements of BP performed over long time periods. In addition, we confined the analyses to clinically healthy, community-dwelling individuals who were not using antihypertensive medications to minimize the confounding effects of comorbidities and antihypertensive medications. Moreover, we used statistical methods 26 -28 that allowed us to avoid multicollinearity while comparing the interrelated BP indices and did not rely solely on stepwise regression analysis, in which minor differences between predictor variables can potentially determine which variable(s) would enter the final model. 47 One factor that potentially limits the generalizability of our results is that the participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging are predominantly white, well-educated, and health-conscious individuals. Another important limitation is that UAE was measured at a single time point. Therefore, the effect of BP on longitudinal changes in UAE cannot be determined from the present study. In addition, because of PP amplification across the arterial tree, the operational PP at the level of the kidneys likely differs from brachial PP and may be closer to central aortic PP. However, as in previous studies that compared the relationships of renal outcomes with the 4 indices of BP, longitudinal measurements of central aortic BP were not available in our cohort. Whether the use of central aortic BP would yield uniform associations with UAE in men and women remains to be examined in future studies. Finally, the longitudinal index for each variable was computed by dividing the cumulative exposure to that variable by the number of follow-up years for each subject. This approach, which was necessary to ensure the comparability of longitudinal indices among subjects with differing durations of follow-up, may dilute the effect of the duration of exposure to each variable. However, this would not be expected to affect our findings, because the duration of exposure to each of the 4 indices of BP was similar within each subject (ie, equal to the duration of follow-up)."}, {"section_title": "Perspectives", "text": "This longitudinal study provides robust evidence that the pulsatile component of BP confers the highest risk for BP-induced renal microvascular injury, as evidenced by UAE.
