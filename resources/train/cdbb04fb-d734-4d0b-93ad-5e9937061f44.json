[{"section_title": "", "text": "LIST OF TABLES "}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The federal crop insurance (henceforth, FCI) program has become the mainstay of U.S. agricultural support and is the single largest agricultural insurance program globally (Woodard and Yi, 2018). In 2015, the FCI program serviced 1.2 million policies, collected 3.7 billion in farmer paid premiums (down from 4.5 billion in 2011 due to crop price declines), and in 2017 covered a total of 100.4 billion (see Figure 1.1) in crop liability. 1 While FCI as a percentage of the total USDA budget remains a relatively small portion (less than 16% in 2017) of the total USDA budget, the Risk Management Agency (RMA) still accounts for a significant total budget of $7.8 billion. 2 With over 311 million acres insured in the U.S. and participation rates in major crop states estimated to be well over 90% based on National Agriculture Statistic Service (NASS) data, crop insurance is an important economic topic in rural America as well as to taxpayers. 3 The greater crop insurance literature has studied insurance premium rate design, FCI demand elasticities, moral hazard, participation decisions, and the effects of crop insurance on other producer decisions Just et al. 1999;Goodwin et al. 2004;Woodard and Yi, 2018). Existing research however, appears to lack a clear explanation for why producers choose to insure at widely differing coverage levels, which can be at their own expense given a generous range of utility functions. This outcome is counter to any reasonable utility model predictions given the significantly positive expected return on farmer paid premiums ((Farmer Paid Premium = Total Premium -Subsidy), see column in Table 1.1), where farmers have received $2.05 in indemnity payments for every $1.00 paid in premium. Note the standard model of deductible demand under actuarially fair premiums (loss ratio of 1.00) for a risk averse individual results in full coverage even before accounting for the subsidy (Schlesinger H., 2000;Woodard and Yi, 1999). This is the first study to utilize a national farm level data to examine the associations between farm specific factors including input costs, revenues, assets, and liabilities and coverage level choice differences. This study hypothesizes that producers choose to insure under different coverage levels based on expected or perceived cash flow constraints, while controlling for a number of other factors such as net worth, primary crop grown, and farm size. Based on a precursory review of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA) Summary of Business (SOB), higher expected revenue per acre areas in the corn belt (Indiana) appear to insure at higher coverage levels, while lower expected revenue areas such as states in the high plains (North Dakota) insure at lower average coverage levels (Figure 1.2). We postulate that previous approaches employing utility theory to predict farmer choices have failed to accurately explain farmer choices in the past, due to failure to recognize the short term liquidity constraints both real and self-imposed, resulting from widely differing cost and revenue expectations in different growing regions. This study attempts to evaluate whether annual expected costs and revenues (i.e. cash flow) might be influencing these differences in coverage level selection choices, while controlling for premium rates and other farm level traits potentially correlated with various coverage level selections. Variables such as higher revenue and higher costs are expected to be positively associated with coverage level selections. Producers are assumed to make expected profit maximizing decisions with risk neutral preferences regarding crop coverage selections. If we assume that a risk-averse producer would choose the highest coverage level available when faced with an actuarially fair premium (Mossin J.,1968) and noting that crop insurance is legally required to be actuarially fair (Refer to Section 3), in addition to the FCI subsidies that result in rates even lower than actuarial fair rates to the point of significant positive returns (see Table 1.1), we can reasonably assert a profit maximizing producer using a generous range of functions would insure under the highest coverage level available. However, despite this assertion, farmers regularly choose lower coverage levels (see Figure 1.2). It thus does seem unreasonable to assume that risk aversion may not be a well-founded assumption. Producers located in areas with higher production and revenue expectations might be expected to insure at higher coverage levels to cover the higher input costs such as fertilizer, associated with higher yields. Producers may also simply prefer to maximize total subsidy or subsidy received per acre in order to maximize their long run return on premium paid (see Tables 4.2 and 4.3). In either case, realized and expected annual cash flow are hypothesized to influence these decisions. Explicitly, I hypothesize that in the presence of a liquidity constraint, farmers will view variable input quantities and insurance premium as substitutes. Meaning that if variable costs such as fertilizer are higher, controlling for other variables, farmers will decrease their coverage levels to lower their premium expense. Higher revenue was predicted to reduce the liquidity constraint and thus have a positive effect on coverage level. The hypothesized effect of fixed costs was ambiguous, with the only choice variable annually being insurance premium, assuming fixed costs are fixed for a period of years. For further predictions based on theory, see the Theoretical Methodology and Empirical Methodology Sections. Results show higher variable costs are associated with a decrease in coverage level. This indicates that producers may substitute away from insurance premium, despite the positive long run return, to focus on inputs with a more immediate annual payoff such as fertilizer or chemical. Results for gross revenue per acre and fixed costs per acre show that both variables are associated with higher coverage level selection, even when controlling for premium rates, area, and yield risk. For fixed costs, this indicates that farmers increase their coverage levels to reduce the probability and risk of being unable to meet their financial obligations. For further discussion, see the Conclusion subsection of the Results Section. Understanding the associations between coverage level selection and farm and producer specific variables has value in regard to agriculture sector policy, as well as determining total FCI program liability levels. In addition, understanding these associations has industry relevance, as it is in the interest of the companies and agents approved to sell FCI to maximize coverage levels and participation rates, thereby maximizing premium and commission collection. Further, the literature suggests FCI decisions have a wide range of effects, including influencing land values, farmer crop type choices, farm debt levels, environmental health, and input level choices (Goodwin et al. 2004;Young et al. 2001;Atwood et al. 1996;Walters et al. 2012;Mishra et al. 2005). Thus defining the parameters affecting the total amount of liability farmers choose to insure and specifically the effect of cost and revenue variables, has a variety of implications at the farm and policy level. Specifically, this thesis sets out to determine if a relationship exists between variable and fixed costs per acre and the coverage levels they choose to insure, while controlling for other farm level financial and production traits. Based on the Risk Management Agency (RMA) 4 summary of business 5 database, geographic differences in $3,010 $5, 984 $6,102 $4,392 $6,631 $7,164 $6,233 $6,100 $6,968 $13,366 $12,712 $11,102 $11,230 $11,242 $13,467 $23,639 $26,684 $25,178 $27,656 $28,772 $31,071 $32,947 $32,745 $35,792 $41,595 $38,766 $44,476 $61,638 $84,205 $74,392 $73,349 $110,030 $113,122 $119,618 $105,951 $98,006 $95,117 $100,435 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 coverage level selection and preference are shown in Figure 1.2. Farmers in higher average yield states such as Iowa and Indiana, appear to select higher coverage levels, while farmers in lower yielding states such North Dakota and Kansas, more often select lower coverage levels. Differences in coverage level selections may be due to decision making motivated by expected revenue or input costs or as has been suggested anecdotally by industry participants, influenced by the geographic density of agents and the resulting competition among insurance agents for client business. This study utilizes farm level data from the USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey Data (ARMS) data to isolate the effects of farm level parameters and their association with changes in coverage level selection. Defining which parameters are associated with different coverage selections should provide some insight on how different types of farmers' coverage choices might change in correlation changes in the agriculture economy and agriculture policy changes. Du, Feng, and Hennesy (2014) employ a mixed logit approach and find that farmers' choices do not appear to coincide with the predictions of standard expected utility maximization framework. Expected utility maximization uses probabilities and utility functions to make a distinction between risk exposure and risk preferences, creating testable models based on known probabilities and assumptions of farmer risk preferences. The standard methodology assumes farmers maximize end of period wealth by choosing input levels, including crop insurance coverage level, subject to a constraint Smith & Baquet, 1996). A higher return on investment is assumed to increase a farmer's utility depending on the risk level and the farmer's preferences. Many studies have pointed out the rationale behind selecting the maximum coverage level or subsidy rate in order to maximize subsidy dollar extraction, thereby maximizing utility (Babcock, 2011;Barnett & Coble, 2011). Given an actuarially fair premium 6 , which is mandated by the Federal Crop Insurance Act, a risk neutral profit maximizer subject to no constraints would choose to either maximize their total dollars of subsidy received or the percentage of premium subsidized. A review of the RMA summary of business dataset shows this not to be the case in most areas. Several studies using a variety of methodologies have attempted to explain the anomaly of apparent underinsurance through the selection of low coverage levels (Du, Hennesy, & Feng 2013;Du et al. 2014;Babcock, 2015). This is the first study to utilize a national farm level data to examine the associations between farm specific factors including input costs, revenues, assets, and liabilities and coverage level choice differences. These decisions vary significantly geographically as shown in Figure 1.2 and later in Figures 4.2 and 4.3."}, {"section_title": "Source: USDA RMA Summary of Business", "text": "It is argued that while crop insurance began as a response to farmer losses during the great depression, it is now regularly seen as a vehicle for income transfer subsidies above and beyond risk management (Goodwin and Smith, 2013). This is largely due to the fact that with a producer loss ratio since 1980 of 2.05 (Table 1.1), which implies that farmers received $2.05 in indemnity payments for every $1 paid in premium by farmers. Just, Calvin, and Quiggin (1999) in an attempt to decompose the incentives to participate in federal crop insurance found risk aversion to be a minor incentive, with the farmers who chose not to participate having negative expected returns from insurance. 7 Regardless of whether this is the case, it seems reasonable to assume that producers being profit maximizers are at least partially motivated by subsidies. Why farmers do not 7 (albeit participation rates have climbed considerably since the publication date of this study) wholly take advantage of the presence of this income transfer if this is truly the case thus remains a subject of deliberation (Du et al. 2014). This research is further deemed policy relevant given the dramatic increases in insured acres and liability since the 1980 Federal Crop Insurance Act, with the total dollar amount of subsidized premiums rising accordingly (RMA summary of business 2017; Johansson et al. 2014). It also provides an opportunity to evaluate the variables affecting farmers' insurance decisions. Understanding this has value in regard to policy and determining the potential program costs, as well as industry value, as it is in the interest of the companies approved to sell FCI (AIPs) to maximize their insurance sales and premium collected. Further, the literature regarding the effect of FCI on various land values and input decisions indicates that FCI has a wide-ranging impact in rural America. Thus, defining the parameters affecting the level at which farmers choose to insure has a variety of applications important for policy. Finally, little research has been done on whether and to what extent farm level factors affect coverage level selections."}, {"section_title": "SECTION TWO", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "HISTORY OF THE FEDERAL CROP INSURACE PROGRAM", "text": "The following is a brief overview of the changes to and development of FCI. Congress first authorized Federal Crop Insurance with Title V of the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938 following farmer losses and bankruptcy resulting from the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl (Smith and Glauber, 2012). From this legislation, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) was created in 1938 to administer the program (RMA 2017). The programs offered were initially designed for only the major crops (mainly corn, barley, oats, sorghum, wheat, cotton, and rice) with participation hovering around 26.6 million acres (12% of all eligible acres were enrolled prior to 1980 8 ) for the next several decades (Knight and Coble, 1997). No private companies were involved until 1980 9 (RMA, 2017). The Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 transformed the organization of federal crop insurance in the U.S and is the permanent statutory authority for FCI as it exists today. By removing the previously existing insurance format, the 1980 Act replaced the old format with Multiple-Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI). This new form of insurance covered potential losses at the unit level. In addition to adding many regions and crop varieties, the 1980 Act created a public-private reinsurance agreement that allowed private approved insurance providers (AIPs) to sell insurance products while using the FCIC as a reinsurer. In order to encourage participation, the bill offered premiums subsidized at a rate of 30%, for the 50% and 65% coverage levels. The 75% coverage level subsidy was capped to equal the same total subsidy as the 65% level (Glauber and Collins, 2002;Knight and Coble, 1997;CRS, 2018). The 1980 bill also mandated that a pilot program be implemented in which individual yield history would be used to calculate a farmer's yield guarantee. This was referred to as actual production history (APH) insurance. In addition, disaster assistance was eliminated in counties if crop insurance was available as an alternative in a county (Glauber, 2013). Allowing private companies with market incentives to sell policies, subsidized premiums, and removing the availability of disaster assistance programs were all steps designed to replace ad hoc disaster bills with crop insurance. Previously congress was obliged to pass ad-hoc disaster relief in order to help rural areas during extreme drought or other causes of extremely low farm income. While crop insurance participation did increase following this bill, it was at a rate much more slowly than expected. As such, beginning again in 1987, congress began passing ad-hoc crop loss disaster assistance bills tending to use low insurance participation rates as justification (Glauber, 2004).  In 1994, congress passed the Crop Insurance Reform Act. This act introduced completely subsidized 50% coverage yield insurance (CAT) for a small administrative fee. The 1994 Act also added additional subsidy assistance for buy-up yield coverage levels greater than 50%. Combined with making crop insurance compulsory, by 1995 participation rates on eligible acres had reached 80%, with 50% of these acres being covered under CAT (Glauber, 2013;RMA 2017). Largely due to the mandate, FCI liability rose from $13.5 billion in 1994 to $25.2 billion in 1995 (Knight and Coble, 1997). This act also introduced a new pilot authorities program under Section 508(h) which allowed private firms to develop new crop insurance policies. Once submitted, these policies can be approved by the FCIC Board of Directors. This makes them eligible for expense reimbursements, premium subsidies, and government reinsurance. Once approved, these policies are added to the general FCI portfolio and can be sold by any of the AIPs agents (Glauber and Collins, 2002). Along with repealing the unpopular mandatory coverage requirement from the 1994 farm bill, the most notable change of the 1996 Farm Act was to add a revenue coverage insurance option as an alternative the standard yield insurance (Note Table 2.1). This insurance functioned by using the futures market to set a projected price, which could be multiplied by a farmer's APH or average per acre yield to establish a per acre expected revenue, which would be the basis for guarantees (RMA, 2017). Over the next several years' congress continued to add to crop insurance incentives by increasing subsidy rates and passing the Agricultural Risk Protection Act in the year 2000, which further increased buy-up (coverage levels above the 50% catastrophic coverage level) coverage level subsidies. This resulted in further increases in farmer participation rates among buy-up coverage levels (Glauber, 2013). This increasing trend in participation rates has continued up into recent years with the 311 (Table 2.1) million acres of the National Agricultural Statistics Service's estimated 319 million total 2017 U.S. crop acres insured (NASS Quickstats 10 ). In addition, farmers have steadily adopted revenue coverage insurance in place of yield coverage over time since its introduction in the 1996 farm bill (Adhikari, 2010). The 2000 Agriculture Risk Protection Act (ARPA) also allowed RMA to enter into contracts with producer groups for the development and research of new crop insurance products, while prohibiting the FCIC from conducting research and development on its own. Private firms were also enabled to submit unsolicited proposals to develop policies to the FCIC board for approval (RMA 2018) 11 . To add additional incentive for new policy development, ARPA also contained provisions allowing for the reimbursement of research and development costs associated with creating the policies approved by the FCIC and developed by private firms (Glauber and Collins, 2002). This change led to many new crop-specific insurance products being developed for commodities with smaller market share as well as specialty crops (RMA, 2017). The third unit type, enterprise units (EU), consists of all insurable acreage of the same insured crop in the county in which the insured has a share on the date coverage begins for the crop year. An enterprise unit may not be further divided except as specified in the insurance provisions (for example: irrigated and non-irrigated corn). In general, the acreage for an enterprise unit must be located in any combination of two or more sections, section equivalents, or FSA FNs, if more than one of these is the basis for optional units. 14 The main difference between basic and enterprise units is whether a producer owns or has shares in particular fields. Enterprise units combine all the acres of a given crop within a county in which a producer has a financial interest regardless of whether they are owned, rented, or have multiple landlords. Due to enterprise units typically being larger than the basic or optional units, yields tend to be less variable, decreasing the likelihood of an indemnity trigger. Thus enterprise units are subsidized at higher rates, which tends to encourage higher coverage level selection.   Premiums for FCI are required to be set at actuarially fair rates (i.e. a loss ratio of 1.00 15 ), but opportunities to choose coverage level, as well as between yield and revenue insurance contracts, and area or individual plans create regional differences in subsidies paid per expected bushel covered for a given crop. 16,17,18,19 The 2018 breakdown of policy types selected in three selected states is displayed in Figure 3.3. These states were selected as being relatively representative of their respective regions. As shown, RP is by far the most popular policy type in all states, as producers have increasingly switched from yield protection to gain the additional price decline coverage. 15 For a discussion of loss ratios, refer to the Data Analysis and Discussion Section under the Federal Crop Insurance Experience Data subsection. 16 The Act requires that the FCIC set premium rates at a level which it determines to be \"actuarially sufficient\" to attain a given ratio of anticipated loss claims to the premiums expected to be collected for the entire crop insurance program each year. 7 U.S.C.  (Goodwin & Smith, 2013). The increases in participation rates since 1980 closely followed the increase in subsidy rates mandated in the subsequent farm bills (Glauber, 2004). Goodwin and Smith (2013)  The main justification given for these subsidies in FCI lies in the assumed inability of the private market to provide equivalent risk protection due to systemic  weather patterns (Miranda and Glauber, 1997;Glauber and Collins, 2002). Legislators from state economies that rely on crop and agriculture production tend to support these subsidies. Previous to the advent of subsidized crop insurance, ad-hoc disaster assistance was common in times of extreme crop or revenue loss for these economies. As the premium subsidies partially disguise the income transfer, they are generally considered more politically viable by crop industry groups due to the less obvious income transfer. Goodwin (2001) concluded that due to the considerable degree of systemic risk inherent in crop insurance, private offerings would likely be of considerable cost. The amount of subsidy required to bring crop insurance participation rates to their current levels likely supports this assessment (Goodwin and Smith, 2013). Glauber and Collins (2002) results suggested the costs of increasing participation rates from 50 to 75 percent would be considerably higher than the cost of increasing participation from 25 to 50 percent, implying an increasing marginal cost of enrolling additional acreage. Woodard & Yi (2018) examined FCI demand elasticities finding they are elastic when accounting for the endogeneity of premium rate calculations using an IV model. This is contrary to the findings of previous research (Knight & Coble 1997), which found crop insurance is generally inelastic with respect to premium rates, though per Woodard, other studies have not accounted for potential endogeneity issues. The model predicts a reduction in subsidy expenditures exceeding 40%, noting the impact being the most severe on the highest revenue crops. This proposition would likely significantly change incentives with low revenue crops receiving the advantage as the percentage of subsidy received would be less affected."}, {"section_title": "Effects of Rating in FCI", "text": "Perhaps the greatest area of focus in the broader crop insurance literature has been an ongoing evaluation of the actuarial fairness and the potential for moral hazard based on the accuracy of crop insurance rating. This literature has resulted in changes to the actual rating structure of federal crop insurance.  found a producer's yield history average (APH) is not reflective of the best predicted yield due to the consistent increase in per acre yields over time. The influence of this finding had been analyzed previously; as a result, trend adjusted APH calculations were made available as an option to producers (Just et al. 1999). Other contributions have been made in the area of moral hazard. Atwood, Robison-Cox, and Shaik (2004) developed a methodology useful for flagging farms potentially engaging in yield switching; when farmers relocate or \"switch\" yield from one unit to another to create the appearance of an indemnifiable loss for one of their insured units. Bekkerman, Smith, and Watts (2012) showed that some FSA programs are likely to impact producer participation when it results in increased likelihood to receive indemnities and thus exploit moral hazard opportunities. The RMA uses what is known as a loss cost ratio ratemaking methodology (Josephen et al. 2000). This approach is based directly on historical experiences, where aggregate rates are created by averaging individual loss rates for individual experiences. The historical loss cost ratio methodology used by RMA derives rates by averaging loss cost ratios at each point in time at the county level for individual producers (Woodard et al. 2011). Coble et al. (2010) reviewed the RMA's loss experience based rating system, concluding that a loss driven methodology is the only way to assure actuarially fair rating.  found that RMA rates tend to be higher than those implied from estimated farm-level distributions in Illinois. Woodard et al. (2011) concurred using farm level data for Illinois corn found loss cost ratio methodology exaggerates actuarially fair rates, which results in rate estimation bias. Claassen and Just (2011) discuss the complications spatial and temporal heterogeneity in their analysis of yield distributions. Additional literature regards the ability to predict likely yields, using linearity and accounting for technological innovations."}, {"section_title": "Explaining Coverage Level Selection", "text": "The question of what factors affect coverage level selection decisions beyond subsidy remains indefinite. Most of the considerable body of research on U.S. crop insurance has focused on issues related to product design, rate-setting, farmers' participation decisions, and their choice of which product to buy. However, limited research has been done to investigate the significant disparities in coverage level selection geographically, nor the potential farm level variables and constraints affecting coverage level choices. While some macro associations have been established (Du et al. 2013), whether coverage selections are influenced by decreasing or increasing debt, input prices, education, or symptoms of an adoption curve remains understudied. Expected utility maximization is an important part of the more general insurance literature and has historically been applied to crop insurance. In this setting the utility maximization framework can be constructed to model a number of choices related to FCI. Whether or not to insure, which policy type to purchase, and finally the level of insurance. The framework for the third choice would be constructed to analyze the tradeoff faced by a producer of higher percentage subsidy payments or higher risk coverage. With subsidies offered as a percentage of premiums dependent on coverage level as shown in Table 4.1, it might be expected that farmers would try to maximize their subsidy per acre or the percentage of premium subsidized (Du et al. 2014). Given a significant positive return on every dollar of premium invested into crop insurance ($2.05, Table 1.1), the return over the long run is invariably positive. One might then assume that producers would take advantage of this available return or income transfer by maximizing the coverage level at which they insure (i.e., minimize their deductible). 100% 67% 64% 64% 59% 59% 55% 48% 38% Subsidy Rate % for enterprise units n/a 80% 80% 80% 80% 80% 77% 68% 53% Subsidy Rate % for area plans (yield) n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a 59% 59% 55% 55% Subsidy Rate % for area plans (revenue) n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a 59% 55% 55% 49% Subsidy Rate % for whole farm units n/a n/a 80% 80% 80% 80% 80% 80% 71% 56% Source: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40532.pdf A review of the RMA summary of business shows this not to be the case. Figure   4.2 below, displays corn revenue protection policies earning premium (PEP) (PEP as opposed to policies sold but not earning premium, meaning they are inactive, which the RMA also reports) in North Dakota and aggregates them over the coverage level at which they were taken out. As is distinguishable from Figure 4.2, the most popular coverage level selections in North Dakota during the past six years have held relatively steady at the 0.70 and 0.75 levels. In light of previous discussion, this seems surprising. In contrast, producers in Indiana select the 0.80 and 0.85 coverage levels more frequently and increasingly did so temporally before pulling back slightly following 2016, as shown in   Du et al. (2013) noted the geographical inconsistencies in crop insurance policy and coverage selection. They note associations between areas with high yields and less volatile yields and revenue policy selection along with higher coverage. Whether these are more specifically associated with other producer traits, farm-level financial variables, or cost and revenue expectation differences remains unexplained. In the broader insurance literature, a preference for what can be considered overinsurance rather than underinsurance has been well documented (Pashigan et al. 1966;Snydor, 2010). This is found most generally among consumers choosing a low or zero deductible insurance policy, despite the expected value being lower for lower deductible policies (Shapira and Venezia, 2008), making the seeming underinsurance in FCI all the more peculiar.   \"Economic theory suggests that individuals exposed to risk should take up actuarially fair insurance if risk averse. When contracts are heavily subsidized and subsidy transfers increase with extent of coverage then uptake should tilt toward the contracts providing the greatest dollar subsidy. We find that farmers turn down contracts that transfer comparatively more subsidy and retain comparatively less risk in favor of contracts transferring less subsidy and retaining more risk\" (Du et al. 2014). Due to the variety of insurance types and coverage level choices available to farmers, Johansson et al. (2014) advocate for the use of a multinomial model in lieu of a multivariate probit approach to examine the effect of premium rate changes on coverage level selection. Their results confirmed that a higher subsidy rate does, in some cases, increase the likelihood producers will insure at higher coverage levels, while higher premiums reduce the level of coverage selection. Other studies have examined farmers' preference for insurance type. Adhirki et al. "}, {"section_title": "Prospect Theory", "text": "In response to the lack of empirical evidence supporting their expected utility hypotheses, Du et al. (2014) suggested prospect theory as a potential superior explanatory framework for coverage level decisions made by producers. In prospect theory, as opposed to expected utility, values are allocated to (whereas utility is derived from) potential gains and losses rather than to final assets. Meanwhile, the objective probabilities that are used in utility theory are replaced/transformed with decision weights (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979;Kahneman and Tversky, 1992). Prospect Theory as a model for decision making is supported by substantial laboratory evidence (Barberis, 2013). It is considered relevant by Du et al. (2014), as they believe growers may anchor their reference outcome near potential yields. This is easier noted than applied however, as stated by Barberis (2013), \"while prospect theory contains many remarkable insights, it is not ready-made for economic applications.\". Babcock (2015) followed up on their work by calibrating the prospect theory models using Tversky and Kahnemen's weighting functions to the same 2009 FCI conditions used by Du et al. (2014). Babcock (2015) found that prospect theory predicts optimal coverage choices consistent with observed coverage selections, but only when a stand-alone investment is used as the reference point, otherwise the predictions relatively match those of expected utility. This could be due to a producer tendency to overweight low probability extreme events (Bocqu\u00e9ho et al. 2014;Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Thus, resulting in a coverage level selection that is lower than expected utility would predict is optimal. The results of Bougherara and Piet (2014) from a sample of French farmers also indicate that this may explain producer's tendency to underinsure or opt out of insurance altogether. The consensus from the prospect theory literature appears to agree there is a need for additional study regarding how producer's frame or view their decision making. While prospect theory may indeed offer a better framework for modeling producer choices, the literature is limited by small samples, difficult application, and limited study breadth."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion of Literature Review", "text": "While the crop insurance literature is relatively extensive, research regarding coverage level selections appear to be understudied. With the latest changes brought by the 2014 farm bill, which includes the merging of farm programs to crop insurance in the form of ARC, PLC, and SCO, the variables affecting farmer decision making regarding coverage levels are increasingly complex. The question as to why farmers in some situations and areas choose not to maximize coverage level selection in order to maximize subsidy dollar extraction and thus expected profits remains. Understanding the farm level associations between producer and farm traits and coverage level choices has value in regard to policy and determining the potential program costs, as well as industry value, since it is in the interest of the companies approved to sell FCI (AIPs) to maximize their insurance sales and premium collected. The incentives resulting from subsidy and rating effects are well documented within the literature, though with continued changes to FCI, they will likely continue to be reviewed in future studies. Further, the literature regarding the effect of FCI on various land values and input decisions indicates that FCI has a wide ranging impact on rural America. Thus, defining the parameters affecting the level at which farmers choose to insure has a variety of applications important for measuring policy effects."}, {"section_title": "SECTION FIVE THEORETICAL METHODOLOGY", "text": "The framework most commonly employed in evaluating crop insurance decisions is expected utility (EU) maximization, where production factors, including coverage level, are chosen subject to physical and technical constraints (Smith and Baquet, 1996). This framework has been called into question increasingly in its application to farmer decision making however, with inconsistent levels of risk aversion depending on the amount being risked (Bocqu\u00e9ho et al. 2014;Rabin, 2000). Further, based on the models that have been constructed to evaluate farmer insurance decisions under EU framework; the highest coverage levels would be chosen in order to either maximize subsidy dollars as a percentage of liability or maximize total subsidy by maximizing coverage levels (Du et al. 2016). These choices do not appear consistently in practice, which gives the appearance of underinsurance on the part of the producers While the EU framework is in many cases justified, we also point out that farms are profit maximizing firms, separate from utility maximizing individuals, thus in addition to the added simplicity, we believe it is not inappropriate to evaluate producer decision making under a profit maximization framework. Risk preferences are not known at the farm level; thus these preferences are not assumed or incorporated into the model. In addition, crop insurance is associated with both lower risk and higher expected returns, which would be unambiguously preferred regardless. Producers are assumed to make asset and input allocation decisions in order to maximize expected profit subject to a cash budget constraint. Equation 1is intended to represent the expected profit maximization problem of a typical producer. Under a profit maximization framework, the utilization of a higher coverage level involves exchanging a costlier fixed premium expense for a higher yet indeterminate conditional indemnity. The balance of real or self-imposed liquidity constraints and debt obligations are accounted for in this model, as it may constrain the farm from increasing its coverage level even if the expected return from doing so would be positive. The payment of a higher premium due to a higher coverage level selection is a definite shift of the revenue distribution downward by the amount of the premium minus subsidy; the upward shift due to an indemnity receipt is based on a producer's given yield probability distribution for a given crop. While a profit maximization model is utilized for this thesis, characteristics from ARMS such as education and operator age are also considered, as well as other household and demographic characteristics. In addition, alternative income sources are considered as these are likely to affect the cash constraint and perceived revenue risk of the producer, thus off-farm income earned by both the producer and other household members is considered. The degree and type of farm indebtedness in addition to other potential determinants would also likely affect the producers' perceived risk. Part of the purpose of this thesis is thus to evaluate the effect these characteristics have on coverage level decisions. The signs of many of these variables are theoretically ambiguous. For example, older producers might have a higher likelihood of being risk averse and therefore, may be more likely to purchase high coverage levels. However, older producers are also likely to have higher equity and thus more likely to self-insure or insure under the lowest coverage levels. It is well-known many agricultural lenders will only offer credit if farmers are enrolled in FCI, which likely influences participation decisions; however, it is unknown how lenders might influence coverage level selection. 22 The producers who are required to insure, may enroll in lower coverage levels unless forced to select higher ones by their lender. Farm size might also affect crop insurance decisions due to more professional management among larger farms, more motivated agents pitching to larger farms due to Historically, increases in subsidy levels have increased participation and it follows that an increase in subsidy across all coverage levels would increase the expected return and encourages higher insurance coverage levels. Rating changes meanwhile are still ambiguous due to the distortion caused by the subsidy. Since subsidy is offered as a percentage of premium rates, a higher premium rate results in increased subsidy transfer to the farmer, while also increasing farmer premium costs. Since crop insurance is rated to be actuarially fair however, this should mean that farmers can expect a higher indemnity in correlation with the higher premium. Now consider a profit maximization framework subject to a liquidity constraint. Producers are assumed to maximize the expected profit at year end by choosing the number of acres of each crop type and input levels including the coverage level of their crop insurance policy. Once the decision to enroll under a particular policy is made, producers make farm level, policy, coverage level, and type decisions simultaneously. Crop yields and prices are stochastically determined in this model and if the producer is not risk neutral, then the optimal input choices will be sensitive to price and yield distributions in their area. Expected profit is equal to the discounted value of the difference between revenue and costs from period t to the terminal time T, where E is the expectation operator. Mathematically, where the subscript t denotes year and the subscript i denotes the crop. The harvest price of the i-th crop at time t (P b it) is intended to be reflective of the market price for crop i during harvest. The projected (expected) price is denoted by . Since the projected price is denoted from the futures price, the farmer's expectation and the RMA projected price are assumed to be the same. Yields are denoted by (i.e. the harvest yield) , planted acres by ait, the expected indemnity to be received from crop insurance by I, and crop insurance premium by . Crop insurance indemnity is a function of a producer's actual production history (APH) yield (expected yield) for individual crop insurance Y, the projected price , the harvest price (which is assumed to be the same for both the insurance price and the price actually received by the producer), and the coverage level the producer selects, which is our choice variable of interest. The liquidity constraint is included in the \u03bb term. In the constraint, the profit maximization equation is subject to an available cash constraint where premium costs, other variable input costs, and fixed costs must be covered by the available liquid capital the farm has at its disposal; ( \u22121 , ( )), where is liquid assets as a function of the previous year's profit and the amount the farmer is willing or able to borrow against their equity ( ). is assumed to be a potentially binding constraint based on the financial position of some producers, such as those that have insufficient collateral to borrow sufficient funds to purchase optimal input quantities. It should be noted that it may be the case that the credit constraint faced by a farmer might be better considered a maximum willingness-to-borrow or an unwillingness to increase their debt-to-asset ratio due to risk aversion (see Atwood et al., 1996). After all it is reasonable to assume some producers insuring at lower coverage levels may nonetheless have sufficient equity in their operation to borrow additional working capital to maintain the optimal quantity of inputs. For further discussion, see the conclusion of the Results section. In this model, our choice variables are; coverage level , planted acres ait, and the quantity of inputs , of which coverage level is our variable of interest. All other variables are considered exogenous parameters for the purpose of this study. Solving equation 1 As shown in the model, coverage level decisions enter the model as functions of expected indemnity payments and known premium cost. It should be noted is technically a discrete choice variable, which for individual level plans (RP and YP) has eight options, = (.50, .55, .60, .65, .70, .75, .80, .85). However, the ARMS data requests that producers take the average of their coverage levels, in the case they are insuring under more than one policy, this means that many observations are averages between these discrete choices. The producer is likely presented with the options of It should be noted that while most producers are likely to have a positive return on investment from FCI (see Table 1.1), some farms with especially low risk or that only experience very shallow losses, such as rice growers, may not see a positive return, though their premium rates should be extremely low. In fact, farms with negative expected returns may make their crop insurance decisions in systematically different ways from those with positive expected returns. In the model it should be assumed different producers calculate their willingness to pay premium on their deductible risk under their own unique operating, financial, and business setting, thus recognizing that the effects of crop insurance on a firm's profit maximization expectations is specific to each firm. The producer then compares each coverage level and its associated premium and selects the level that results in the highest return on investment. While overtime we believe that to be the maximum coverage level available due to subsidy incentives, from year to year that level may vary due to the farm level factors previously discussed. Although the first order conditions from the model yield mostly ambiguous predictions about the direction of the effects of these variables on coverage level selection, the profit maximization model provides a realistic framework in which to view how a business would make such decisions. In addition, the model as constructed suggests that coverage level choice is likely influenced by farm level variables. In particular, the variables affecting the cash constraints faced by the farmer and their willingness to increase their debt-to-asset ratios in the event of increased costs. The FOCs for both the input quantity and coverage level choices indicate that farmers will increase both s.t. the liquidity constraint, with coverage level being maximized s.t. the liquidity constraint and inputs being optimized. However, the results are ambiguous in regard to how producers will choose between the two options in the presence of a constraint. If the price of variable cost inputs rise, will a producer choose to decrease their coverage level and retain their current fertilizer and chemical application levels or vice versa. The return on both assumed to be positive, with the difference being long term (multiple years) versus short term (1 growing season) payoff. Our empirical model and variables of interest provide some insight into these decisions and farmers' choices between substitutes. "}, {"section_title": "Federal Crop Insurance Rating Data", "text": "Crop insurance premium calculations involve numerous input variables with the rating of individual plans based upon a producer's unique Actual Production History (APH) (the ten year history of production for a particular crop and unit on a producers farm), the county of the farm, the loss history and amount of data available in that county, the coverage level selected, RMA's detrended yield estimate, the projected price, price volatility factor for revenue insurance, and heteroskedasticity adjustments. 27 Area-based insurance policies are also affected by these factors with the exception of the use of APH, which utilize county yields in the place of a producer's individual yield history. This research utilizes Area Yield Protection (AYP) base rates for individual coverage levels as a proxy for the cost of insurance in a particular county as well as a measure of risk with higher base rates being associated with higher likelihood of crop loss. Individual farmlevel yields are more variable than county yields, thus rates are higher for individual plans. However, the county level base rates provide a useful approximation of the relative variance in premium rates across counties. 28 The RMA ADM data includes base rates for insurance plans by coverage level, county, and year for the variety of crop insurance plans available from the RMA. ARP base rates were pulled from the RMA online database for 2014 and 2016 for the four main crops. Base rates differ for the respective crops depending on type and practice. The 27 Note: volatility factors and heteroskedasticity adjustments are only utilized in pricing revenue plans 28 An online premium estimator is available on the RMA's website, which allows users to examine premium differences across policies most common and representative type and practice for each crop was used. These are displayed in Table 6.1. 29 While base rates differ across coverage levels, the shape and slope of base rates differ by county and crop. Some counties exhibit more of an exponential shape in their coverage levels, as opposed to a linear shape in others as shown in Figures 6.1 and 6.2 below. In order to account for this difference, which has the effect of making the higher coverage levels relatively more expensive compared with midrange lower coverage levels in counties with an exponential function curve shape, a binary indicator variable was constructed representing whether a producer's farm is located in an exponential or linear shaped base rate county. This shape was determined by defining whether the average of the .90 and .70 coverage level base rates (plus .0075 to account for slight nonlinearities 30 ) is greater than or less than the .80 coverage level base rate. Indicating whether a county's base rates increase in a linear or exponential fashion as coverage level rises.  soybeans. Note that the rates steadily increase the further from the heart of the corn belt a county is located. These counties are rated based on their yield risk potential, thus the counties in the heart of the corn belt having experienced very limited yield loss historically, have significantly lower base rates. These figures also show the limited offer area of the AYP policy, thus limiting our models that include base rates to the counties shown. Base rate observations are not included in the wheat models due to the limited number of observations within the AYP offer area.  indicating a county where rates increase in an exponential shape as coverage level increase and 1 indicating counties where rates increase linearly. As can be seen, the rates for counties outside of the heart of the corn belt are more likely to increase in a linear shape, particularly for soybean. We hypothesize this is due to low risk counties having a higher probability of shallow losses, thus making the higher coverage levels more expensive relative to lower coverage levels. As opposed to counties outside of the most productive and low risk areas, where a more signifcant loss is more likely relative to the liklihood of a shallow one, thus the base rates for the lower coverage levels are higher relative to counties with base rates exhibiting an exponential shape. There are three ratios typically used in the evaluation of a policies insurance experience. First the loss ratio is the relationship between benefits and premiums under a policy. The term ''loss ratio'' means the ratio of all sums paid by the FCIC as indemnities under any eligible crop insurance policy to that portion of the premium designated for anticipated losses and a reasonable reserve, other than that portion of the premium designated for operating and administrative expenses. Second, loss cost ratios (LCR) are a reflection of the actual realized risk in an insurance program, i.e., the percentage of the potential total loss which was actually realized in a given year. Third, earned premium rates (EPR) were derived by taking total premium paid over total liability. This ratio provides a return on total risk from the perspective of the insurance company, while providing the average premium rate paid per dollar of liability from the perspective of the producer. Loss ratios were calculated by dividing indemnities paid by earned premiums in each individual year for each county. Areas with higher relative production risks tend to correlate with higher relative loss ratios. Premiums and indemnities were aggregated to the county level for a given year and crop and then the ratio of indemnity to premium payments in a given year gives us the loss ratio. As EPR and LCR both have total liability as their denominator, when the LR is 1.00, which means total indemnity and total premium are the same, LCR and the EPR must equal one another. Because of this, given that RMA's all crop long term target loss ratio is 1.00, as mandated by the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, 31 over time LCR and EPR should equal one another. EPR is typically a low volatility measurement temporally, as it is a function of the relatively stable measures of total liability and total premium. For this research, five-year county level loss ratios were utilized to represent the expected return on premium to producers in that county. Figure 6.7 displays the 5-year loss ratios for 2014 by county, relative to other counties in the U.S. As can be seen, insurance experience data exists for a much greater number of counties compared with base rates. It should also be noted that the 2014 5-year loss ratios contain loss data for 2012, which was a record loss year. However, given that the yield losses of 2014 were likely still fresh in operator's memories when making their insurance decisions in 2014 and would be somewhat \"watered down\" when they made their 2016 coverage decisions, we do not believe this to be problematic.     Figure 6.8 displays the 5-year earned premium rates for corn for 2014 by county, relative to other counties in the U.S. As can be seen, the amount of premium paid is far higher outside of the corn belt, particularly in areas such as the high plains and Texas. It should be noted that even if farmers in a particular county were to opt for 55% coverage levels, their liability would be considerably lower along with their premium rate paid, thus changing their earned premium rate only slightly.       Table 6.3 contains descriptive statistics permitted by the ARMS for the data utilized by this study. Each observation of the ARMS variables discussed above was individually evaluated for outliers and declined responses (shown as -1s in the ARMS data). Observations with declinations to respond for explanatory variables were removed. in equation (6.2), where c is the number of counties included in the model. Both state and county level fixed effects were considered. Since many counties might have only two or three observations, there was some concern that the majority of the variance would be removed, however when the model is run using either specification, the results stay remarkably consistent. Thus in order to account for differences in growing conditions, premium rates, and agent density, with the greatest precision, county level fixed effects were used. The inclusion of county fixed effects eliminates variation between counties so that the variation in the dependent variables used to identify the parameter estimates is the variation between producers within an individual county.  Off-farm income earned by household (OFI) captures the effect of income diversification and its potential effect on farmer risk aversion. Farm with higher off-farm income have a more dependable cash flow source, better enabling them to afford premium expenses for the higher coverage leverage levels. Farms with higher off-farm income may also have higher risk tolerances, due to being less dependent on the farm's income to cover costs and thus allowing them to insure at a higher coverage level and cover the expense without the risk. Gross farm income per acre (GFIicpt) accounts for the additional financial flexibility provided by additional revenue per acre, allowing for great cash flow flexibility. If farmers purchase lower coverage levels due to income or cash flow constraints, we would expect farms with additional revenue and higher constraints to purchase higher coverage levels when other variables are controlled for. The other side of the profit and cash flow expectation equation is costs. If farms are reducing their coverage levels in the presence of more significant cash flow constraints driven by lower revenue or higher costs, we might expect higher costs to reduce the average coverage level selected. One idea that has been proposed to explain the differences geographically in coverage level is varying levels of input costs, in addition to revenue expectations. As discussed in previous sections, farms in the high production states tend to insure at higher coverage levels. Higher production per acre is associated with higher expected revenue acre, as well as higher fixed and variable costs per acre. Fixed and variable costs are included separately to account for the different effects they may have on the coverage level choice at the time of the decision. Consider that fixed costs are a cost and therefore additional downward constraint on cash flow at the time when farmers make their coverage level decision. Since these costs are already fixed, a producer making variable costs choice including premium expense must take into account that fixed costs must be covered regardless of profit. Thus we predict an ambiguous effect. Higher fixed costs may decrease coverage level choices due to cash flow, however farmers may respond to higher fixed costs by increasing their coverage level in order to insure their expected revenue to the point where they are certain of covering their fixed payments such as real estate or equipment payments. Many variable cost choices are made around the time of the crop insurance coverage choice selection in early spring. Farmers with higher variable costs may insure at a higher coverage level in order to cover these costs, if they have the flexibility in their cash flow budgets to allow it. However, there is also the potential for farmers to substitute cash flow away from their premium expense and toward other variable costs such as fertilizer, which might result in increased revenue. In this case, we would expect higher variable costs to be associated with a lower coverage level selection."}, {"section_title": "Rating and Insurance Experience Variables", "text": "Crop specific Area Yield Protection policy base rates (BR) are included as a proxy of historical yield risk in a county. This variable is the area yield protection base rate before loading at the 70 percent coverage level and is thus uninfluenced by a farm's actual production history, coverage level selection, price risk, or any other loading factors. Loss ratio (LR) is calculated as the total five-year (total indemnity/total premium) loss ratio preceding the year a farmer insures their crop in the county in which a farm is located. This variable is intended to serve as a proxy for a farmer's expectation of losses in the upcoming year and the influence it may have on coverage level selection. Due to the income effect, higher expected loss ratios may provide operations with an incentive to insure at higher coverage levels in order to harvest additional subsidy. The loss ratios can be interpreted as the average return farmers in a county received per dollar paid in premium (including subsidy) over the five-year period preceding the insurance purchase years in the data (2014 and 2016). Corn, soybean, and cotton loss ratios are all positive. Meaning that farmers could expect over a dollar in return for each dollar of premium paid in insurance, in contrast to most other forms of insurance. Wheat farmers received $0.88 for every dollar of premium paid. However, the actual loss ratios are considerably higher if subsidy is considered, since the subsidy covers on average roughly half of the total premium (refer to previous sections). Earned premium rate is the 5-year county level earned premium rate preceding the year in which a farmer makes their insurance decision. This variable is included to represent the average cost of insurance (premium/liability) in the county in which a farm is located. A higher earned premium rate indicates a higher average cost of insurance for farmers within a county. Examining Table 7.1, corn revenue protection has a mean earned premium rate of 0.094. Indicating that the average premium paid per dollar of liability insured is $0.09. Whereas the average premium paid for wheat per dollar of liability insured is $0.146. The effect of a higher premium rate without subsidy would be negative due to the income effect, however due to the current subsidy structure a higher premium rate results in additional absolute subsidy, distorting this effect. Summary statistics for these variables are included in the table below for each crop and policy type. Higher rates for the higher base rate coverage levels represent the increased likelihood of indemnity payout due to shallow losses. Due to the Area Yield Coverage insurance plan only being offered in counties RMA considers to be significant production areas, observations in which base rates were available are limited relative to the SOB loss ratios and earned premium rates. Base Rates are not included for cotton and wheat as there were too few observations in the ARMS data set in the counties for which base rates are available."}, {"section_title": "Control Variables:", "text": "The debt-to-asset ratio variable (DAR) captures the effect a farm's leverage ratio has on coverage level selection. It is defined as the ratio of total farm debt to total farm assets. Higher asset levels relative to debt would indicate a farm is less likely to become overleveraged or one that has a higher relative net worth relative to debt obligations, meaning greater equity available to borrow against. Net Worth/Acre is intended to control for production potential under the assumption that more valuable farmland is associated with a higher value, as well as control for higher valued farms ability to either self-insure or insure at higher levels due to greater access to lines of credit which are typically tied to collateral. Cropland Acres controls for the size of farms, under the assumption that larger farms may be able to better utilize economies of scale, in addition to the higher potential of having professional or and/or educated management. Age of primary operator (Age) is a personal characteristic that has been shown to affect risk aversion and is correlated with higher equity. Number of owners (NofOwns) is a farm characteristic controlling for the number of owners, which may impact the insurance coverage decision. Operator education (Oeduc) is an operator characteristic that may be correlated with knowledge of the mechanics of crop insurance and farm programs, management style, as well as risk aversion."}, {"section_title": "The Dependent Variable", "text": "The dependent available utilized in this study is coverage level selected, as noted on each survey respondents returned ARMS. As expected only a limited number of individuals responded to this question on the ARMS for each crop and policy type. Thus the data is subsetted for each respective crop and policy type to include only observations where the coverage level selected response is 50 or greater, as that is the minimum coverage level available under each insurance policy type. Responses to coverage level selection over 85 were assumed to be data entry error, or intended to mean maximum coverage, and are thus reduced to 85."}, {"section_title": "Correlation Matrices", "text": "It is not unreasonable to assume there may be significant correlation among the farm-level variables. For example, larger farm operations may be likely to have more higher revenue per acre or at least lower expenses per acre due to economy of scale advantages. In addition, higher input costs are likley associated with higher revenue, after all, more nitrogen results in higher yields up to a certain point on the yield curve. Further, as just discussed, many of the variables included could possibly be correlated with coverage level selection. Thus multicollinearity and engodeneity are persistant issues when using farm level variables. Wooldridge (2015) states that the problem of multicollinearity cannot be clearly defined, however all else equal, for estimating coefficients it is better to have less correlation between our variables. The presence of multicollinearity inflates the variance and standard errors of the estimated parameters and can therefore reduce the signicance of the coefficients. For a given dataset, multicollinearity can be reduced by dropping indpendent variables from the model. However, this can introduce bias if the dropped variables belong in our model. In order to counter this, the scope of this thesis was reduced in term of variables of interest, with the acres leased and several financial variables which exhibited significant correlation with other controls removed. The consistency of the statistical significance of the each of the variables of interest proved particularly robust however, for the most part staying consistent regardless of the model specification that was run and the variables that were included. Correlation matrices between each of the variables included in the models are provided Figures 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 in order to assist in determining potential multicollinearity concerns. The variation inflation factors (VIF) for the models were also computed, which serve as an indicator of multicollinearity. A VIF of 8 for a particular variable would imply that the standard errors are 8 factors higher than if there were no multicollinearity between that variable and the remaining independent variables. Commonly a value of 10 is recommended as a maximum (Kennedy, 1992). However lower recommended values can be found in the literature. When the VIF were calculated for each of the final models, the majority of the VIF for both the variables of interest and controls were between 1 and 2. The largest VIF tended to be for Gross Income per Acre and Variable Costs per Acre, which ranged between 3 and 5. This was unsurprising after reviewing the correlation matrices shown below. We found these to be relatively reasonable given the correlation typically found between farm level variables and the consideration that both of the variables belong in the model and thus left the final models unchanged.

From left to right, the results in column (1), the OLS BR&SOB the (Ordinary Least Squares with Base Rate and Summary of Business data) model, and column (2), the FE BR&SOB (Fixed Effects with Base Rate and Summary of Business data) model, include the two base rate (BR) variables, BaseRate70 and BR slope, as well as the two Summary of Business (SOB) variables, the 5-year loss ratio (LR) and the 5-year earned premium rate (EPR).

To clarify, models (2), (4), and (6) are identical to models (1) and (3), and 5respectively, but include state fixed effects.

Though the AYP counties do account for the majority of the production and thus most of the corn belt, the observations outside of the AYP offer area are not included except in columns (5) and (6) due to the unavailability of the base rate data. Results are attained across all farms in the annual ARMS sample across the United States for all corn growing states."}, {"section_title": "Standardized Coefficients", "text": "To allow for ease of interpretation, models with standardized regression coefficients are included. This removes the potential confusion caused by unit size in the interpretation of the magnitude and importance of a variable's effect on coverage level. The standardization method utilized allows for comparison of the size of the association of the dependent variable to coverage level selection and thus for comparison of the relative strength of each variable. Put differently, the greater the absolute value of the coefficient, the more significant is the association with coverage level. The dependent variables in these models were standardized and thus utilize standard deviations as units. This standardization is achieved by subtracting the mean from the variable outcome and dividing by two times it's standard deviation. The resulting variables have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1 and thus measure the change in coverage level selection given a two standard deviation increase in an independent variable. The coefficients below are standardized using the methodology discussed in Gelman (2007), in which he recommends standardizing each input variable by dividing by two times it's standard deviation. Note that linear rescaling of independent variables does not change the t-statistics or p-values, but can aid the coefficient interpretations. Dividing by two standard deviations allows for coefficients to be interpreted in the same way as binary inputs. The procedure scales inputs to be comparable with binary variables and be somewhat symmetric with probabilities that fall between 0.3 and 0.7. For further discussion, see Gelman (2007). The following models are fit to transformed inputs: the binary independent variables have been centered by subtracting their specific mean in the data, while the continuous variables have been rescaled by subtracting the mean and dividing by two standard deviations. Thus the standard z-score formula is applied with the standard deviation multiplied by two as shown in 8.1. The independent variable is not standardized in the following table, which allows for easy interpretation of the coefficients as coverage level percentages. The independent variables of interest are the first seven (cash flow related) variables included in the model, followed by the controls. Note that the dependent variable, coverage level, is technically a discrete choice set. Though producers were asked to average their coverage level across policies resulting in observations that were not in the discrete set. This means that the interpretations of the coefficients should be considered more as average associative effects on coverage level rather than changes in producers' discrete coverage choices."}, {"section_title": "Explanatory Variable Results Discussion", "text": "Comparing the results across the six columns in Table 8.1, the majority of explanatory variables of interest that are significant for any model are also significant in the other models. Off-Farm income is significant at the 1 percent level in all six columns, with a two standard deviation increase being associated with a .44 to .81 increase in coverage level. This may indicate off-farm income reduces the cash flow constraint as perceived by farmers, allowing them to increase their coverage selection. The reader might note the standard deviation for off-farm income is particularly large. This is due to the highly skewed distribution of off-farm incomes in the dataset. Interestingly, if offfarm income observations of over $400,000 are removed, the magnitude of the positive association between off-farm income and coverage level actually increases. Indicating that off-farm income increases coverage level up to a certain level of off-farm income, at which point the incentives facing a producer might change. One postulate that might partially explain this is that outliers in terms of off-farm income ($400k+), might have an entirely different set of incentives regarding risk and personal attention than an average representative producer with the median off-farm income level for the entire dataset being $27,500. For example, the sign of coefficient indicates that producers who likely less liquidity constrained due off-farm income are associated with an increase their coverage level regardless of whether outliers or higher levels of outside income are included, as the theoretical model predicts. However, producers with extremely high offfarm incomes near the outlier zone, while not cash constrained, also are likely not at significant financial risk in the event of a crop loss, in addition to likely having significant personal and financial interests outside of farming, thus potentially warping their insurance incentives. Though I acknowledge this is beyond the sophistication of the model to recognize as it simply predicts that farmers would maximize their coverage in the absence of a constraint. Gross Farm Income/Acre is significant at the 10 percent level in column (3) and the 1 percent level in columns (5) and (6). When county fixed effects are added into the model in Column 3, the coefficient loses significance as shown in Column (4). Columns (5) and (6) do not include the yield risk (BR) controls and include observations from a much larger area. Unsurprisingly, the coefficients on this explanatory variable are positive in all models for which they are significant, meaning higher gross income per acre is associated with higher coverage level selection, which is consistent with our prediction of a less binding liquidity constraint being associated with higher coverage level selection. The magnitude of this association is significantly larger in columns 5and (6), with a 2 standard deviation increase in Gross Farm Income per Acre being associated with a 5.39 increase in coverage level in column (5) and a (3.51) increase in column (6) when fixed effects are added in, compared with an increase of 1.92 and 1.81 in columns (3) and (4) respectively. The estimated association between variable costs per acre and coverage level selection is consistently negative and significant at either the .05 or .01 level across the six columns when state fixed effects are used (see appendix). Columns 2 and 4 lose significance as shown in the Table below when county fixed effects are added, however Column 6 is still significant at the .01 level, when county fixed effects are added. Reviewing column (1), the coefficient suggests that at the mean a two standard deviation increase in variable costs per acre is associated with a decrease in coverage level selection from 1.73 to 2.02 in columns 1and 3, 5.93 in column (5), and 4.3 in column (6). Once again this appears consistent with our cash flow constraint predictions as it may indicate that farmers adjust their coverage levels downward to make up for a more constrained cash flow budget that would be associated with higher variable costs per acre. This association if continually found in future studies may be the most significant contribution to the literature. Referring back to the theoretical model predictions in the Theory Section, the FOCs' were ambiguous regarding producer choices between coverage level and input quantities. When analyzed individually, the model predicts that coverage level will be maximized s.t. the liquidity constraint. Input quantities will be optimized to maximize profit s.t. the liquidity constraint as well. Left ambiguous without knowing the functional forms of premium, indemnity, or input quantity mixes however, is whether in the presence of a liquidity constraint, producers will on the margin choose to increase their coverage level and thereby their premium expense or if they will increase their inputs to be closer to the optimum quantities. The results shown in Table   8.1 present some evidence that producers appear to choose inputs (variable costs) over higher coverage levels (premium costs). This is in spite of the long run positive return to crop insurance premium, indicating that farmers may be focusing on remaining viable in the short term where crop insurance may or may not pay out, particularly if they're liquidity constrained. An increase of two standard deviations in fixed costs per acre is associated with an increase in coverage level that is significant in all six columns at the .01 level. The magnitude is also relatively consistent ranging from 2.32 in column 1 to 3.30 in column 3. The difference in sign for associated effects between fixed costs and variable costs is likely driven by a combination of cash flow constraints and risk aversion. Since fixed costs are payments that must be made regardless of revenue, profit, or cash flow, it appears that farmers may adjust their coverage level upward in order to ensure their ability to make those fixed expense payments. This is in contrast to variable costs, over which farmers have greater control. If variable costs are increased, it appears that farmers may respond by reducing their premium expense in order to stay within their cash flow constraint. These results support the hypothesis that differences in expected revenue and costs are likely driving some of the differences we see geographically in coverage level selection. Holding other variables constant, a higher revenue per acre farm with lower variable costs per acre will select a higher coverage level. When the fixed cost variables are removed from the models and loan payments are added in, the sign and magnitude of the two variables are similar. (Note they are not included in the same models due to a high degree of collinearity, resulting in a lack of significance in the total loan payments per acre variable. Note there is also a high degree of collinearity between variable costs per acre and gross revenue per acre, however the signs of these variables stay consistent when either of the correlated variables are removed from the models. Reviewing the insurance cost and incentive proxy variables, the 5-year loss ratio and earned premium variable signs are consistent with predictions, with each coefficient being significant at the .01 level for both variables. A two standard deviation increase in the average five-year loss ratio is associated an increase from .92 to 1.60 across the 6 models. When premium rate and cash expenses are controlled for, farmers appear to increase their coverage levels in the presence of higher loss ratios, consistent with theoretical predictions in standard economic models. Coverage level selection appears to be the most responsive to changes in premium rate, regardless of the model specification used. In the presence of controls, farmers reduce their coverage levels by significant magnitudes when premiums are higher per dollar of liability with a 2 standard deviation increase associated with a 3.76 decrease in coverage level in Column 6 and a 4.35 decrease in Column 2. Higher earned premium rates are associated with lower coverage levels despite the theoretically greater probability of payout and therefore higher expected total absolute return under actuarially fair rates. As a higher premium rate results in a greater burden on cash flow at higher coverage levels, this association also appears to fit into that theory. Farms located in counties with higher base rates are also associated with a lower coverage level. County base rates were included as a proxy representative of yield risk in a county and are theoretically disassociated with any other rating or loading factors, thus the result is to some extent unanticipated. However, higher yield risk does imply higher yield variability which would allow farms to insure at a lower coverage level and still have a similar probability of an indemnity payout to a low yield risk area as discussed in the Theory Section. The base rate associations appear to be consistent regardless of whether county fixed effects are included in either model, although when fixed effects are included there appears to be a slight decrease in the coefficients due to the decrease in variance. A two standard deviation increase in the RP corn base rate is estimated to decrease coverage level by 1.99 based on the Column (2) coefficient and 3.12 in Column 4. These results do not support suggested hypotheses that farmers insure at higher coverage levels in order to harvest subsidy through the positive return on each dollar paid in premium."}, {"section_title": "Control Variable Discussion", "text": "The debt-to-asset ratio is statistically significant with a negative sign for the first four columns for which base rates are included. An increase in a farmer's debt-to-asset ratio is typically indicative of decreased solvency. However, it should be noted that such an increase may or may not be indicative of worsened financial condition. The magnitude of the estimated coefficients in both cases means that a two standard deviation increase in the debt-to-asset ratio is associated with a 1.66 to 2.34 decrease in coverage level selection in the columns for which the control variable is significant. It is worth noting that the negative sign on the coefficients indicates that despite the requirement of crop insurance by many agricultural lenders in order to provide operating and real estate loans, it does not appear that higher debt levels are associated with higher coverage level selections. Higher net worth per acre is consistently associated with lower coverage levels and is significant at the .01 level in all six columns. This may be mean that higher net worth farms prefer to self-insure. Note that higher net worth per acre farms are typically associated with higher coverage levels due to the noted tendency of farms located in the high value per acre corn belt to insure at higher levels, which indicates that farms in the corn belt are insuring at higher coverage levels in order to cover their revenue and costs despite their higher net worth per acre. This is consistent with the result of , who found that producers whom owned more acres were associated with greater nonuse of insurance and when they did insure, chose to insure specific risks, such as purchasing hail insurance, more commonly than lower net worth farmers whom more insured under multi-peril options. The magnitude of these coefficients also appears significant in the non-standardized models (see appendix), with a $1000 increase in net worth per acre being associated with a decrease in coverage level of 2.7 for corn RP models (1) and (2) and 1.3 in model (6). Operator's education is statistically significant at the .01 level in Columns (1) through (4), indicating education is positively associated with coverage level selection. In the non-standardized model, the association is more relatable where an additional 20 years of age is associated with an estimated increase in coverage level of 0.60. This result is consistent with other studies that have found individuals tend to become more risk averse as they age. It could also suggest that older producers have a greater ability to pay the higher insurance premiums accompanying higher coverage levels, having had more time to accumulate net worth."}, {"section_title": "Soybean Results Discussion", "text": "The results for soybeans insured under an RP policy in Table 8.2 are displayed in an identical manner to those of corn in Table 8.1. Comparing the results across the six columns in Table 8.2, it is apparent that the results are relatively similar to those of corn, as might be expected given that the majority of U.S. farmers rotate between the two crops. Given this however, it might be further expected that the results should be nearly identical to corn, but as can be noted reviewing the two tables, there is some difference. Mainly several variables such as Total VC/Acre are not significant in several of the models for soybean, whereas they are in the corn results. There are several potential explanations for this, one being that different types of farms with different crop mixes may have responded to the ARM survey. For example, the corn surveys may have had responses from farms who grow \"corn on corn\" repeatedly, which was not uncommon during high crop prices, or from farmers in slightly less temperate climates which might limit them to corn or wheat, such as areas of North Dakota. An alternative explanation to these however, relates to the model predictions and the differing input mixes and costs for the two crops. Consider that a large portion of the variable costs for most corn farms are made up by their fertilizer expense. Soybeans in contrast, being legumes, fix nitrogen. This means that farmers apply nitrogen to soybeans at significantly lower rates 33 , resulting in a lower variable costs per acre. This means that variable costs for soybean are less binding relative to corn in the event of constrained liquidity and is perhaps why the soybean results are not identical to those of corn. Reviewing the results for Off-Farm Income, an increase in Off-Farm income is associated with a slightly higher coverage level. This is the association predicted by our theoretical model, however the magnitude is small given the large standard deviation. Refer to the discussion of the corn results for a discussion of the size of the standard deviations. The association is significant in four of the six models. The two models in which the coefficient is not significant are the FE models that include base rate data (columns (2) and (4)), meaning the variation measured is within county variation between farms located in the soybean AYP offer area, which is nearly exclusively inside the corn belt. Gross Farm Income/Acre is significant at the 1 percent level in columns (5) and (6). Columns (5) and (6) do not include the yield risk (BR) controls and thus include observations from a much larger area. Unsurprisingly, like the corn results, the coefficients on this explanatory variable are positive in all models for which they are significant, meaning higher gross income per acre is associated with higher coverage level selection, which is consistent with our prediction of a less binding liquidity constraint being associated with higher coverage level selection. The magnitude of this association is larger in column (5) than column (6), where, when county fixed effects are included, the magnitude decreases by roughly half. The estimated association between variable costs per acre and coverage level selection is significant and negative in columns (5) and (6). Which is consistent with the negative association between coverage level and variable costs we see in corn and wheat. This consistency serves as a pseudo robustness check to the postulate put forth in the corn results discussion, providing evidence of the choice producers tend toward when choosing between premium expense and other variable input costs. The positive association between fixed costs and coverage level is significant at the .01 in all six columns. This association is nearly identical to that found in the corn results and given the level of significance in both, indicates considerable robustness. We interpret this as farmers who have higher fixed costs or financial obligations, such as long term lease agreements or land debt, likely increase their coverage levels in order to ensure their ability to make those payments. In the short term, in the case of a cash constraint, farmers will decrease their coverage level and therefore premium payment in order to divert resources to other variable cost inputs in order to maintain their debt-toasset ratios as collateral to fall back on (see conclusion). However, the same farmer, if presented with a required payment in the short term, will opt to increase their coverage level to the point where they can cover their payment obligation and decrease risk of default in the short term. This may even be required by a farmer's agricultural loan officer, considering they require crop insurance participation, it might follow that they would require sufficient coverage level to ensure the farmer meets their annual loan obligations. Reviewing the insurance cost and incentive proxy variables for RP soybean, the 5-year loss ratio is associated with a slight decrease in coverage level in columns (3) -(6). This surprising outcome is in contrast to the results in RP corn, though the magnitudes in soybean are much smaller. This could be a symptom of multicollinearity between the 5-year loss ratio and the other insurance variables, which each have the expected negative signs associated with higher premium rates. The sign on the earned premium rate variable is consistent with predictions, with each coefficient being significant at the .01 level for both variables. The coefficients are of relatively large magnitudes, with a two standard deviation increase in premium rate associated with a decrease in coverage level ranging from 3.77 to 4.68. Higher earned premium rates are associated with lower coverage levels despite the theoretically greater probability of payout and therefore higher expected absolute return under actuarially fair rates. However as discussed, this result appears to be driven by the fact that a higher premium rate results in a greater burden on cash flow and farm liquidity. Thus this association appears to be consistent with the theoretical model. The BaseRate variable is associated with a decline in coverage levels in each of the four models for which it is included. It is significant at the .01 level in three of the columns and the .10 level in column (3). County base rates were included as a proxy representative of yield risk in a county and are theoretically disassociated with any other rating or loading factors, thus the result is to some extent unanticipated. This could be due to the correlation with premium rate, which has a negative effect on coverage level or as mentioned in the discussion of the corn results; higher yield risk does imply higher yield variability which would allow farms to insure at a lower coverage level and still have a similar probability of an indemnity payout to a low yield risk area."}, {"section_title": "Soybean Control Variable Discussion", "text": "Higher net worth per acre is significant at the .01 level in columns (5) and (6). This may be mean that higher net worth farms prefer to self-insure. Refer back to the Corn RP results for further discussion. The year 2016 variable is also significant in columns (1) -(4), indicating that soybean farmers in the Midwest increased their coverage levels slightly on average between 2014 and 2016. Since this variable is not significant in columns (5) and (6), this might indicate that this trend was not strong enough across the broader U.S. where soybeans are grown to be picked up by the model. Operator's education is statistically significant at the .01 level in column (1) and columns (4) through (6) and at the .10 level in column (2), indicating education is positively associated with coverage level selection. The magnitude of the association is relatively insignificant however, with a two standard deviation increase in education being associated with a .63 to .76 increase. Operator age is only significant in model (5), where it has a positive effect. This result is consistent with other studies that have found individuals tend to become more risk averse as they age. As it is not significant in column (6), the limited number of observations in each county surveyed in the ARMS may mean that this variation was removed."}, {"section_title": "Wheat Results Discussion", "text": "The final results discussed in this section are for RP Wheat displayed in Table 8.3. Insufficient observations existed in the AYP offer area for wheat, thus the base rate variables are not included, leaving only the model results that would compare with the results in columns (5) and (6) in the corn and soybean results tables. In Table 8.3 column (1) displays the OLS results for RP wheat for the entire ARMS sample, while column (2) includes county level fixed effects. Reviewing the results for wheat insured under RP, first note the size coefficient on Off-Farm Income in column (2) is significant at the .10 level and of consistent sign with the results for corn and soybean. The most notable result for wheat are the VC/Acre coefficients, which are also consistent in sign with the results from corn and soybeans. The magnitude of the wheat coefficients however, is signifcantly larger. This effect while at first surprising, likely stems from the differences in liquidity, expected revenues, and costs faced by wheat producers, compared with those of most corn and soybean farmers. Refer to Atwood et al. (1996) for a discussion of Montana wheat farmers financials, where based on their findings, due to the high yield risk faced by wheat farms of Montana, farmers there maintain lower debt-to-asset ratios relative to their peers in other growing regions. Anecdotally, it also seems likely that liquidity constraints might be somewhat more binding for wheat farmers, especially considering their lower annual cash flow receipts, making them particularly sensitive to increases in variable costs. In the presence of such an increase, it does not seem unexpected that farmers would lower their premium cost by reducing their coverage level in an attempt to maintain their low debt-to-asset ratios as a risk management strategy. This line of thought also leads into the possibly initially surprising result that FC/Acre coefficient is not statistically significant in either column (1) or (2). However, using reasoning just discussed, it seems likely that if the low debt-to-asset ratios carried by wheat farms found by Atwood et al. (1996) continue to be the case, fixed costs are likely a small percentage of the total cost per acre faced by wheat farmers and thus relatively insignificant in their decision process. Comparing the size of the standard deviations for the two variables this seems likely. The 5-Year Loss Ratio variable is significant with a positive effect in column (1), though it loses significance in column (2) when fixed effects are added. Weakly indicating that when premium is controlled for, farmers insure under slightly higher coverage levels (1.8 points) when the average loss ratio over the past 5 years in their county is .82 higher (2 standard deviations). The Earned Premium Rate coefficient is significant in both columns at the .01 level. The magnitude also appears to be economically significant with a .12 increase in the earned premium rate associated with a 4.8 decrease in coverage level. In dollar terms, a $12 increase in premium paid per $100 of insured liability is associated with a 4.8 decrease in coverage level selected. This result is consistent with the results found in corn and soybean. It is also consistent with farmers minimizing their cash expenditure on premium in spite of the positive return on crop insurance premium paid."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "The interpretations in the previous results discussions are mostly based on the assumption that farmers are either liquidity constrained or unwilling to increase their debt-to-asset ratio by borrowing more in order to pay their premium expense in the fall. We maintain the assumption made for the theoretical model that farmers are profit maximizers, despite not consistently buying up on their coverage in the presence of what appears to be a significant expected return on each dollar of premium paid. These results do not negate the postulate put forward in recent literature (Du. et al., 2016) that farmers are minimizing expenditures. They do however provide some insight into which types of expenditures farmers are minimizing, in particular crop insurance premium. We acknowledge that these findings are correlational only, however there appear to be very few reasonable alternative explanations for why higher variable costs might be associated with decreased coverage level selection. Future work should focus on regional differences as well as identifying a source of variation from which causal inference could be made. This will likely be more achievable as additional years of data become available, particularly in the presence of policy changes."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion and Implications", "text": "This study provides evidence toward a potential explanation of the behavioral anomaly exhibited in farmer coverage choices across differing geographic locations. Of particular interest, the results provide insight in an area where our theoretical model predictions were ambiguous; do farmers substitute away from premium expense and toward direct variable input expenses in the presence of a liquidity constrain, thereby decreasing their coverage level? In addition, it allowed us to study and evaluate the existence of other significant associations between coverage level and farm level characteristics, while controlling for fixed county and year factors. Across crop and insurance policy types this research suggests a few notable findings. First, higher short term/variable costs are associated with lower coverage levels. Second, long term/fixed costs are associated with higher coverage levels. Third, higher revenue per acre and larger farms in terms of acreage tend to insure at higher coverage levels. Finally, that farmers insuring under RP policy plans, regardless of which of the three crops evaluated are grown, are price sensitive to increases in premium rates, despite strong subsidy incentives and positive long term return expectations that accompany higher coverage levels. As to the question posed in the literature of why farmer's do not insure at the maximum coverage level given the positive long run expected return; we believe the results of our analysis indicate that liquidity concerns may be creating what is effectively a constraint on their spending, either affecting farmers' ability to afford the premium cost of the higher coverage levels or reducing their willingness make the expenditure at least in the short term. This appears to be particularly true in areas outside of the corn belt, where revenues are lower. Thus, while a utility maximizing farmer would choose to either maximize their total dollars of subsidy received or the percentage of premium subsidized, they may not choose do so in the presence of an expected or perceived cash flow or liquidity constraint. Adding to the evidence of a constraint, is that nearly every variable included in each successive generation of the empirical model, regardless of crop, that related to liquidity or cash flow, indicated that higher expenses or lower revenue was associated with a decrease in coverage level. These included variables that did not make it into the final model due to multicollinearity concerns, such as acres cash leased, which had a negative effect on coverage level, even though the farmers leasing more acres under a cash lease contract have more risk. Indicating that like wheat farmers, even in the presence of higher financial risk, farmers prefer to lower their coverage level and manage risk by minimizing expenditures than by increasing their coverage level and increasing their short term costs. It might well be the case that the suggested credit constraint faced by farmers may be better considered a perceived constraint or a \"maximum willingness-to-borrow\". After all it is not unreasonable to assume some producers choosing to insure at lower coverage levels may nonetheless have sufficient equity in their operation to borrow additional working capital to maintain the optimal quantity of inputs including a higher coverage level on their crop insurance coverage. Evidence of this occurring is limited however. If anything, producers whom borrow additionally to increase their coverage levels are those with higher fixed costs they wish to ensure their continued pay, which is what our results indicate. Thus we postulate that in the presence of increasing input costs, producers will decrease their input quantities (including insurance premium) to a certain point, rather than borrow the additional working capital required to maintain an optimal yield and or profit maximizing input mix. This theory is supported by the results found in Atwood et al. (1996), in which they found the high yield risk wheat farms of Montana maintained low debt-to-asset ratios, even in the presence of subsidized insurance. Hence we suggest here that farmers likely have a minimum debt-to-asset they like to maintain at all times, thus reducing their willingness to pay high premium costs in the short term that will likely increase their debt-to-asset ratios in the event the do receive an indemnity; i.e. an unwillingness to trade a definite annual fixed premium cost for a higher conditional but indeterminate/uncertain indemnity, particularly over a short term horizon. Thus, in such a case as supported by our results, we believe farmers choosing to insure at lower coverage levels are attempting to ensure they remain viable over the short term (one to five years) via either a real or self-imposed budget constraint. Thus the suggestion that there are two types of producers that make the same choice of low coverage levels, the first type is low equity producers that have legitimate cash constraints and the second being producers who are attempting to control their short run financial risk using cash reserves and thus minimize expenditures in the short term, even when presented with the choice of a long term positive investment because it is likely to reduce their cash reserve in the short term. Therefore, we emphasize that this is likely not an absolute constraint for all producers, but one indicative of how farmers choose to manage risk. The theoretical model, which predicts both that producers will on the margin, maximize their coverage level s.t. the liquidity constraint and secondly that producers would optimize their input quantities s.t. the liquidity constraint, left ambiguous how farmers would choose between the two choice variables when the constraint was binding. The results provide sufficient evidence to hypothesize that farmers may indeed view direct farm inputs and crop insurance premium as substitutes, where in the short term with the payout of crop insurance uncertain, farmers shift from purchasing additional coverage levels to purchasing direct inputs (such as nitrogen) with direct revenue increasing payoffs in the short term (one growing season). This is despite the long run positive return to crop insurance premium paid. The findings from this empirical analysis also allow for some insight regarding policy implications, in addition to being intended to improve our understanding of the drivers or at least variables associated with different levels of coverage level selection in the event of financial changes at the farm level. The potential implications of this thesis have several applications and repercussions relevant to farm and FCI policy, particularly as coverage level selection is a major determinant of the total liability outstanding during any given crop year. More specifically the results indicate that farmers might adjust coverage level selections based on changes to costs depending on the types of cost. Based on these results, long term increases in variable costs, such as fuel and energy prices might lead to a decrease in coverage levels. While farms with higher fixed costs, such as machinery payments, will insure at higher coverage levels. A major change in the farm economy affecting input costs could thus affect coverage levels depending on whether the effect resulted in changes to fixed or variable costs. Changes in revenue could also affect coverage level selection, along with changes in the relative net worth of farms. These associations should be of interest to agricultural lenders, crop insurance industry participants, as well as the RMA due to the implications that changes in the agricultural economy may have on coverage level and thus the total insurance liability in any given area. While unproven by this study, we believe the results provide evidence of our postulate that farms are attempting to maximize profits by attempting to minimize costs subject to annual cash flow constraints. As the public spotlight has shifted to the treasury costs of the FCI program and the effect of premium subsidy on farm decision making (Smith and Goodwin, 1996), a debate has emerged on whether farmers are utilizing crop insurance to manage risk or maximize return on investment. Given discussion during the 2018 farm bill negotiations, which noted suggestions to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, such as the removal of the harvest price option and the capping of subsidy levels (Bekkerman et al. 2018), a future reduction in subsidy rates appears not completely unlikely. Such a change would result in effectively higher farmer paid premium rates. When premium rates are adjusted upward, the results of this research suggest that farmers' coverage levels will be adjusted downward to account for the increased cost. Thus this research indicates that despite premium subsidy (Goodwin & Smith 2013), farmers are highly price sensitive, indicating they view crop insurance less as an investment, but rather as a risk management tool for which annual cash flow constraints must be taken into account. In the future, the pattern of results found across crops in this study needs to be further validated, preferably by exploiting variation due to a policy or rating change. In this, the continued inclusion of crop insurance questions in the ARMS, specifically regarding coverage level selection, would be of valuable service. Future work might also address the differences found in associations between farm level variables and coverage selection for farms growing corn and soybeans, as opposed to farms growing wheat. As a caveat to these suggestions, it should be acknowledged that based on discussion with crop insurance industry participants and agents, farmers are typically slow to respond or adjust their insurance choices. Whether this is due to the potentially daunting complexity of the modern federal crop insurance program or some other factor is unknown. However, we believe it is not unreasonable to consider crop insurance choices, including coverage level selection, to be \"sticky\" and thus slow to adjust to incentives. Perhaps this is part of the reason that coverage levels creeped upward slowly during the decade of high prices preceding the 2014 farm bill."}]
