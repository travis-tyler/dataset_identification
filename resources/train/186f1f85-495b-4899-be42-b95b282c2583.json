The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11 declared the disease Coronavirus", "text": "Disease 2019 (COVID19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic 2 . COVID19 has claimed over 500,000 lives (as of July 5, 2020) and the pandemic is ongoing 3 .\nGenomic epidemiology from the analysis of viral sequences from all over the world is consistent with the emergence of the virus in late 2019 in China and consequent spread and expansion in Europe, and other parts of the world 4, 5 . More than 50,000 complete genomes of SAR-COV-2 from all over the world are currently available in public databases such as the GISAID initiative (originally known as Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) 6 . While this information is invaluable for understanding evolution of the virus 7 , pathogenesis, and design of diagnostic tools, few studies have been able to combine this with epidemiological data to derive insights on viral spread. These studies have provided information on how the virus is introduced and spread in a population.\nA comprehensive study of circulating variants of the virus in Iceland, which included over 580 complete genomes in combination with epidemiological information (travel history and contact tracing) revealed that while the initial importation of the virus was from China and Southeast Asia subsequent importations were from different parts of Europe 8 . Studies based on complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Guangdong Province in China highlighted the initial importation of virus to the province by travel and limited local transmission 9 . A study of viral genomes from the east coast of the USA combined with travel data revealed the coast-to-coast spread of virus within the country 10 . Initial studies in Washington State uncovered cryptic local transmission 11 . These studies reiterate the importance of combining sequencing data with public health information.\nThe first case of COVID19 in India was detected on January 30, 2020 and case numbers have continued to rise inspite of stringent interventions including nationwide lockdowns. In the first few months of the outbreak, between January 22-April 30, 2020, test results from all over India could be averaged to a positivity rate of 3.9% 12 . Analysis of these cases revealed that the test positivity rate was highest when the samples were from contacts of a known COVID19 positive case 12 .\nA large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes (about 1500 complete genomes as of July 5, source-GISAID) have been sequenced in different parts of India. The first sequences from India were reported from individuals with travel history to China, Italy and Iran 13, 14 .\nAn analysis of 361 complete genome sequences from India showed that five global clades were circulating in India -old Nexstrain clades B, B4, A2a, A3, and a distinct clade A3i 15 . The A2a (European) clade was found to be the most prevalent, followed by A3i 15, 16 . While these studies have added valuable information on circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in India, they have not comprehensively linked genomic data with epidemiological information. This study was therefore undertaken to dissect the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka, a state in South India. Here we report 47 full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences obtained from individuals who tested positive for the virus by RT-PCR and present an analysis of epidemiological information combined with genomic data to elucidate the introduction and spread of the virus in the state. Samples with Ct value > 30 were included when they were considered critical for representing a cluster or if they were from symptomatic individuals."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "We used a tiling primer based approach for whole genome sequencing described by the ARTIC Network using Primal Scheme 9,18 . Briefly, we used the V3 primer set-these are 96 pairs with amplicons of about 400 basepairs (bp) spanning the whole genome except 31bp of the 5' and a part of the 3'UTR. PCR was performed by pooling adjacent/overlapping primers into different pools so as to prevent preferential amplification of short fragments between adjacent primer pairs. Primers were initially used at a concentration of 10\u03bcM as per the protocol, then modified to amplify regions that were missed by increasing primer concentrations to 50\u03bcM. For four regions additional primers were designed and a separate reaction was set up before the pooling step in order to complete the genome. The resulting PCR amplicons were used for preparing libraries for 3 All rights reserved.

Primers were removed from the sequencing reads by trimming 25bp at the ends and additional trimming based on alignment using BBDuk (v1).\nResulting reads were mapped to the RefSeq strain (NC_045512) using Minimap2 (v1.17) within Geneious Prime (Geneious Prime 2020.0.3). A consensus was created for regions with coverage >10x using the 0% majority rule and corrected. Consensus was aligned to the reference to ensure the correct reading frame and annotation was transferred from the reference. Sequences were deposited into the GISAID database.\nPhylogenetic analysis, lineage assignment, detection of SNPs and amino acid replacements Consensus sequences from the 47 genomes from this study were aligned with the reference genome using MUSCLE (v 3.8.425) 19 . The multiple sequence alignment was used to infer the phylogeny using iqtree (v 1.6.12) 20 . A total of 88 DNA models were tested, and the TPM2u+F+I model was selected based on the Bayesian Information Criterion. Maximum likelihood tree was constructed as the consensus tree from 1000 bootstraps, using the reference sequence (NC_045512) as the outgroup. Nodes with bootstrap values > 83% were used for interpretation.\nTime scaled phylogenies were constructed using TreeTime with the multiple sequence alignment described above and the date of sampling as dates.

Clusters (9/12) were limited to a single district excepting clusters C1, C3, C6, and C10 which were spread across districts. Time course of the 12 sequenced clusters and 11 cases with no known contacts indicated that i) lineage A.p7 was introduced recently ii) no new cases from C1 and C4 were detected (as of May 21, 2020) iii) ongoing transmission was evident for lineage B and lineage B.6.

SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in the south Indian state of Karnataka on March 8, 2020 and by May 21, 2020 it had spread to 28 out of the 30 districts of the state resulting in 1578 cases. The data from this study using a combination of genomic epidemiology and contact tracing provides evidence for multiple introductions of the virus into the state, with sustained local transmission. We report the circulation of six lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the state namely- A.p7, B, B.6, B.1, B.1.1, and B.4 (Pangolin lineage nomenclature) . Viruses from both lineages are now circulating in different countries of the world 21 .\nIn this study, 3 of the 47 sequences, belong to lineage A.p7 and were from individuals with travel history to other states within India. This lineage is defined by two SNPs T8782C and C28144T and has been reported from Saudi Arabia, Russia, Turkey, and India 21 . No onward transmission was reported from these three cases, however they indicate continued importation of SARS-CoV-2 into the state emphasizing the need for active surveillance of domestic travel.\nOf the lineages in the state, B.1 (related to GISAID clade G, and Nextstrain clade A2a) and B.1.1 (related to GISAID clade GR and Nextstrain clade A2a) are European clades. Both lineages harbour the D614G mutation on the Spike protein. It has been suggested that viruses with this mutation are more infectious and the mutation was present at higher frequency in samples across the world 16, 24, 25 . Of these two lineages, B.1 was a major contributor to the Italian outbreak 21 . In our study, all seven sequenced samples from a large cluster, C4 (comprising of 35 individuals) belonged to this lineage (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 4 ). This cluster was restricted to Bengaluru city and no new cases were reported from it between 7-21 May. The index case for this cluster was a patient with SARI. Taken together, these observations suggest a hitherto undiscovered link for this cluster to Europe. One other sequence from an individual with no known contact with a positive case in Mysuru district was also assigned to lineage B.1. However, this sequence clustered separately from all the others in the phylogeny and therefore may represent a separate introduction. 8 All rights reserved.

Using a maximum likelihood based approach we were unable to completely separate B and B.6 as some branches had sequences from both clades (Figure 2) . Further, nine of twelve clusters in this study and seven of the eleven cases with no known contact (63.6%) belonged to lineages B/B.6 or both. Lineage B is one of the two clades that were circulating in China in late 2019. Lineage B.6 has earlier been reported from Philippines, UK, North America, Australia, Singapore and has also been reported from other parts of India 15 (Pangolin). The defining mutations for these lineages are similar to that of the A3i clade which has been described as a distinct phylogenetic group in India 15 .\nIndeed, upto a third of the cases in multiple states across the country belong to the A3i clade 15 .\nThese lineages were detected throughout the period in this study and across the state including one domestic traveller who entered the state toward the end of the study period ( Figure 4) .

Some studies had initially proposed a link between viral lineages, transmission and disease phenotypes which have not been substantiated by experimental evidence 26 . The analysis of sequences obtained from symptomatic and asymptomatic (at the time of testing) individuals in this study did not reveal any association with a particular lineage. Symptomatic individuals were spread across lineages B.1, B, and B.6 along with asymptomatic individuals (Figure 2, Supplementary   Figure 2 ). Of the 12 clusters represented in the sequencing data, both the index case and the spreaders were more often symptomatic (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 4 ). However, sequencing did not reveal any mutations that were specifically associated with clinical state.\nOur study had the following limitations -it is a single point analysis and some follow-up data is not available, for instance we do not know if individuals who were asymptomatic at testing later developed symptoms. Further, lineage assignments during an outbreak are dynamic and could change as more data is added and sequencing errors are accounted for. Notwithstanding these limitations, our analysis provides insights about introduction, spread, and establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in Karnataka. Further, we were able to capture both geographic diversity and obtain representation from the ten large contact clusters in the state. This was made possible by linking epidemiological information to genomic data. Integrating such an approach, in real time, into public health measures is essential for an effective outbreak response.\n10 All rights reserved.
