[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "In recent years three sets of research criteria for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been proposed: the International Working Group (IWG)-1 (Dubois et al., 2007 (Dubois et al., , 2010 , IWG-2 (Dubois et al., 2014) , and National Institute of Ageing-Alzheimer Association (NIA-AA) criteria (Albert et al., 2011) . The criteria include biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathology to increase the confidence that subjects with MCI have Alzheimer's disease as underlying cause. However, they differ in the definition of MCI and biomarker abnormality (Visser et al., 2012) (Table 1) . A direct comparison between the criteria is lacking and it remains unclear which criteria are best to use.\nThe IWG criteria use the term prodromal Alzheimer's disease for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and were designed to serve as research criteria. The IWG-1 criteria require episodic memory impairment and at least one abnormal Alzheimer's disease biomarker. This biomarker can be a topographical marker [i.e. medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI or parieto-temporal hypoperfusion on 18 Ffluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET] or a pathophysiological marker (i.e. decreased CSF amyloid-b 1-42 , increased CSF tau, or increased amyloid PET uptake) (Dubois et al., 2007 (Dubois et al., , 2010 . The updated IWG-2 criteria require cognitive impairment in any cognitive domain and either both decreased CSF amyloid-b 1-42 and increased tau, or increased amyloid PET uptake (Dubois et al., 2014) . These criteria specify two subtypes: typical prodromal Alzheimer's disease if impairment on a memory test is present; and atypical prodromal Alzheimer's if only impairment on a non-memory test is present. The NIA-AA criteria use the term 'mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease' and were designed for both clinical and research use. They require cognitive impairment in any cognitive domain and abnormal amyloid markers (i.e. decreased CSF amyloid-b 1-42 or increased amyloid PET uptake) or neuronal injury markers (i.e. medial temporal lobe atrophy on MRI, increased CSF tau, or parietotemporal hypoperfusion on FDG-PET). They relate the number of abnormal biomarkers to the likelihood that MCI is due to Alzheimer's disease (Albert et al., 2011) (Table 1) .\nPreliminary studies have shown that the IWG-1 and NIA-AA criteria have a fair to good predictive ability for progression to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia in subjects with MCI (Bouwman et al., 2010; Oksengard et al., 2010; Petersen et al., 2013; Prestia et al., 2013) . The validity of the IWG-2 criteria has not yet been tested. The aim of the present study is to compare the IWG-1, IWG-2 and NIA-AA criteria on prevalence and outcome of Alzheimer's disease at the MCI stage by means of a large multicentre study."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Subjects were recruited from five multicentre studies: DESCRIPA (Visser et al., 2008) , AddNeuroMed (Lovestone et al., 2009) , German Dementia Competence Network (DCN; Kornhuber et al., 2009) , the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (EADC)-PET (Morbelli et al., 2012) , and American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) study (Mueller et al., 2005 ; Supplementary material); and from eight centres of the EADC: Amsterdam (van der Flier et al., 2014) , Antwerp (Van der Mussele et al., 2014) , Brescia (Frisoni et al., 2009) , Coimbra (Baldeiras et al., 2008) , Gothenburg (Eckerstr\u00f6 m et al., 2010), Kuopio (Sepp\u00e4 l\u00e4 et al., 2011), Li\u00e8ge (Bastin et al., 2010) , and Lisbon (Maroco et al., 2011) .

Although the IWG-1 criteria recommended a cued recall test to define memory impairment, such tests were not available for most studies and we used non-cued memory tests as well. According to the IWG-1 update of 2010, we defined atypical prodromal Alzheimer's disease as non-amnestic MCI with abnormal biomarkers in a post hoc analysis.\nAccording to the IWG-2 criteria, subjects were classified as 'prodromal Alzheimer's disease' if they had impairment in memory (typical prodromal Alzheimer's disease) or nonmemory domains (atypical prodromal Alzheimer's disease) and abnormal CSF amyloid-b 1-42 and tau biomarkers (Table 1) . In the main analysis we pooled typical and atypical prodromal Alzheimer's disease but we also performed analyses for each subgroup separately.\nAccording to the NIA-AA criteria, we distinguished between amyloid (i.e. CSF amyloid-b 1-42 ) and neuronal injury markers (i.e. CSF tau, cerebral glucose metabolism on FDG-PET, medial temporal lobe atrophy score or hippocampal volume). Subjects with MCI in any domain were classified in the low Alzheimer's disease likelihood group if both amyloid and neuronal injury markers were normal, in the high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group if amyloid and at least one neuronal injury marker were abnormal, and in one of the two conflicting biomarker groups if the amyloid marker was abnormal and neuronal injury markers normal [isolated amyloid pathology group (IAP)] or if at least one neuronal injury marker was abnormal and the amyloid marker normal [suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology group (SNAP)] (Jack et al., 2012; Petersen et al., 2013; Vos et al., 2013a) . Of the subjects who had only one biomarker available, subjects were classified in the intermediate Alzheimer's disease likelihood group if the marker that was tested was abnormal and in the uninformative/inconclusive group if the marker was tested normal (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses", "text": "Statistical analyses were done with SPSS version 20.0 with significance set at P 5 0.05.

The model was specified with a random intercept and slope and with centre as a random effect because this model provided the best \u00c02 log-likelihood compared with models with simpler covariance structures.

Seven hundred and sixty-six subjects had data on amyloid and neuronal injury markers (CSF amyloid-b 1-42 with CSF tau, medial temporal lobe, or FDG-PET) and 841 subjects had data on only a neuronal injury marker (medial temporal lobe n = 698; FDG-PET n = 143). Supplementary Tables 3 and 4 show the number of subjects for each biomarker by centre and the characteristics for the total sample and separate biomarker groups.\nPrevalence and outcome Table 2 shows the classification and characteristics of subjects according to the criteria and Table 3 shows the outcome according to the criteria classification. Eight hundred and fifty (53%) subjects had prodromal Alzheimer's disease according to the IWG-1 criteria, and 308 (40%) subjects according to the IWG-2 criteria, either typical or atypical (Table 2) . Subjects with prodromal Alzheimer's disease were more likely to progress to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia (Table 3 and Fig. 1 ) and showed a larger decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination (Supplementary  Table 5 and Supplementary Fig. 1 ) than subjects without prodromal Alzheimer's disease.\nAccording to the NIA-AA criteria, of the subjects with amyloid and injury markers available, 353 (46%) subjects were classified in the high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group, 49 (6%) in the IAP group, 220 (29%) in the SNAP group, and 144 (19%) in the low Alzheimer's disease likelihood group (Table 2) .

Table 4 shows the overlap in classification between the criteria by outcome after 3 years. The requirement of memory impairment for IWG-1 prodromal Alzheimer's disease and the requirement of abnormal CSF amyloid-b 1-42 and tau markers for IWG-2 prodromal Alzheimer's disease resulted in differences in classification compared to the NIA-AA criteria. Furthermore, the NIA-AA conflicting biomarker groups are considered prodromal Alzheimer's disease according to the IWG-1 criteria but not according to the IWG-2 criteria. In subsequent analyses, we dichotomized the NIA-AA criteria in two ways: (i) high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group versus conflicting and low Alzheimer's disease likelihood groups; and (ii) high Alzheimer's disease likelihood and conflicting groups versus low Alzheimer's disease likelihood group. Table 5 shows that the specificity and positive predictive value were highest for IWG-2, whereas the sensitivity and negative predictive value were highest for NIA-AA (ii). NIA-AA (i) showed the highest Youden index.\nIn the subgroup of subjects with only a neuronal injury marker (n = 841), the Cox regression model fit was slightly better for IWG-1 ( \u00c02 log-likelihood 3000) than for NIA-AA ( \u00c02 log-likelihood 3012).

We noted marked differences between the criteria in Alzheimer's disease prevalence and predictive accuracy for Alzheimer's disease-type dementia. The IWG criteria were designed to identify individuals with a high probability of having Alzheimer's disease for research purposes. Indeed, we found relatively high progression rates for Alzheimer's disease-type dementia in subjects with prodromal Alzheimer's disease but we found also that a substantial part of the subjects not meeting prodromal Alzheimer's disease criteria progressed to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia. For the IWG-1 criteria, we demonstrated that the high progression rate in subjects without prodromal Alzheimer's disease is likely due to the presence of subjects with non-amnestic MCI with abnormal biomarkers. For the IWG-2 criteria, we demonstrated that this is likely due to the inclusion of subjects with IAP and SNAP in this group. A remarkable finding was the similar predictive accuracy of IWG-2 typical and atypical prodromal Alzheimer's disease. This corroborates a previous study (Vos et al., 2013b) and supports the use of nonamnestic MCI as Alzheimer's disease clinical phenotype. The NIA-AA criteria were designed both for research and clinical purposes. The prognosis of the low, high and intermediate Alzheimer's disease likelihood subgroups nicely fitted with the proposed terminology.\nIn the subsample with both amyloid and neuronal injury markers available, differences in sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value between the criteria can be explained by whether one or two biomarkers needed to be abnormal. If both were required to be abnormal (as was the case for IWG-2 and NIA-AA high Alzheimer's disease likelihood versus low Alzheimer's disease likelihood and conflicting biomarker groups), positive predictive value and specificity were high and sensitivity and negative predictive value low, consistent with previous findings (van . If one biomarker was required abnormal (as was the case for IWG-1, NIA-AA high Alzheimer's disease-likelihood and conflicting biomarker groups versus low-Alzheimer's disease-likelihood group), positive predictive value and specificity were low and sensitivity and negative predictive value high.\nIn the subsample with only a neuronal injury marker available, the higher specificity for IWG-1 compared to NIA-AA (intermediate Alzheimer's disease likelihood group versus inconclusive group) likely reflects the requirement of memory impairment for IWG-1 prodromal Alzheimer's disease. The progression rate to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia in the NIA-AA intermediate Alzheimer's disease likelihood group was similar to that of the high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group and suggests that many subjects also had abnormal amyloid markers\nThe relatively high progression rate ($20%) for subjects with SNAP is intriguing, as the biomarker profile suggests that non-Alzheimer's disease pathology is likely (Petersen et al., 2013) . We found that subjects with SNAP who progressed to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia had CSF amyloid-b 1-42 levels just above the cut-off. This indicates that the amyloid-b 1-42 cut-offs may have been too conservative, although using a more lenient cut-off would also lead to more false positives. Alternatively, it could be that these subjects have comorbidities so that less amyloid pathology is needed to progress to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia. SNAP could also be an atypical form of Alzheimer's disease with less pronounced amyloid pathology. It is also possible that these subjects have nonAlzheimer's disease pathology with minimal amyloid deposits and are misclassified as Alzheimer's disease-type dementia at follow-up.\nOnly a small group of subjects was classified in the IAP group, likely because most subjects with Alzheimer's disease already have neuronal injury at the MCI stage. Approximately 20% of the subjects with IAP progressed to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia. A previous MCI study did not find any converters with IAP, although this could be due to their relatively short follow-up (1 year; Petersen et al., 2013) . Studies with longer follow-up are needed to see whether all subjects with IAP will eventually progress to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia or have some amyloid pathology unrelated to Alzheimer's disease.\nAvailability of only one biomarker is a common clinical situation. As amyloid assessment is relatively invasive and expensive, often only neuronal injury markers will be measured. In subjects with only injury markers, the prognostic accuracy of the NIA-AA intermediate Alzheimer's disease likelihood and inconclusive groups was very similar to that of the IWG-1 groups.\nA higher progression rate to non-Alzheimer's disease dementia was found in subjects without IWG-2 prodromal Alzheimer's disease compared to those with prodromal Alzheimer's disease and in subjects in the NIA-AA low Alzheimer's disease likelihood and SNAP groups compared to the high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group. This is inline with what is expected based on the biomarker profiles. In general, the progression rate to non-Alzheimer's disease dementia at follow-up was rather low, which could be because the cohorts were designed to study Alzheimer's disease.\nWe found that 29% of the subjects with abnormal CSF amyloid-b 1-42 and two neuronal injury markers (CSF tau and MTL) had only one of the abnormal injury markers. This is likely because the neuronal injury biomarkers measure different pathophysiologies, and abnormality in one does not always mean that the other is abnormal as well, at least at the MCI stage. Subjects with both abnormal injury markers had higher Alzheimer's disease progression rates compared to those with only one abnormal injury marker in combination with amyloid pathology. This is in-line with previous studies (Scott et al., 2010; van Rossum et al., 2012) and suggests that the former group is further in the disease process or has a more aggressive form of Alzheimer's disease.\nThe lack of standardized biomarker cut-offs is a known drawback in the field. We applied centre-specific biomarker cut-offs to correct for possible differences in lab procedures. Use of the same CSF ELISA cut-off for all centres would have led to essentially the same results (Supplementary Table 7 ). Although the use of predefined cut-offs likely resulted in somewhat lower sensitivities and specificities compared to other studies that used cut-offs defined within the sample, our study may better reflect the real diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers/the criteria.\nThis study has several limitations. Because the findings were based on memory clinic or research populations, they may not be generalizable to other settings. For some subjects a MRI assessment was not performed or data were not provided to us, although this is normally part of clinical routine. No autopsy data were available, which might have led to misclassification of Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, we used retrospective data so centres used different cognitive tests and biomarker protocols. Although this reflects current clinical practice, it could have introduced variability. Analyses for the largest cohorts separately showed some variability in prevalence and outcome of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with MCI (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9 ). However, as this variability is typically random, pooling data from all centres is likely to balance out on average. Furthermore, as our main aim was to compare the sets of criteria, variability in operationalization will affect each of the criteria similarly. Standardization of cognitive tests and biomarkers will be an important goal to achieve in the future and many initiatives have started working on this. But even after standardization the criteria may still perform differently in specific settings. Because we used retrospective data, access to tests that measure non-memory domains was limited. Our operationalization of atypical prodromal Alzheimer's disease may therefore not entirely reflect the clinical variants described in the IWG-2 criteria and may be less sensitive to detect atypical cognitive profiles. While the IWG-1 criteria recommended a cued recall test to define memory impairment, such tests were not available for most studies and we used non-cued memory tests as well. New prospective studies should include a wider range of cognitive tests to improve operationalization of the criteria. We used CSF amyloid-b 1-42 as amyloid marker while use of amyloid-PET could have led to different results and would be interesting in light of the IWG-2 criteria. The major strengths of our study include the large sample size of well-characterized subjects and relatively long follow-up.\nOur findings have several implications. Although the IWG-1, IWG-2 and NIA-AA criteria for prodromal Alzheimer's disease can all be used to select subjects for therapeutic trials or clinical follow-up, as they all predict cognitive decline with reasonable accuracy, a certain set of criteria may be preferred for specific purposes. In clinical trials, a high conversion rate is needed. If both amyloid and neuronal injury markers are available, one could best select subjects according to the IWG-2 prodromal Alzheimer's disease group or NIA-AA high Alzheimer's disease likelihood group. This means that subjects with any MCI can be included. If only neuronal injury markers are available, the IWG-1 criteria should be considered rather than the NIA-AA criteria because of the higher specificity due to requirement of amnestic MCI for prodromal Alzheimer's disease. In clinical settings, a refined prognosis is needed and exclusion of the disease is important to reassure patients. The NIA-AA criteria will then offer the most accurate prognosis. As Alzheimer's disease at the MCI stage can manifest as non-memory impairment, a broad definition of MCI should be applied.\nIAP and SNAP are heterogeneous conditions with subgroups progressing to Alzheimer's disease-type dementia and further studies are needed to characterize these subjects' prognosis and underlying pathophysiology."}, {"section_title": "Funding", "text": "This study resulted from a collaboration between centers of the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (EADC)."}]
