[{"section_title": "introduction", "text": "In 2010 the World Scientific book Global Perspectives on Tropical Cyclones: From Science to Mitigation was published (Chan and Kepert, 2010). This included a chapter on track and structure forecasts of TCs (Heming and Goerss, 2010). The aim of this subtopic report is to provide an update on some aspects of this chapter. Many of the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models used for tropical cyclone (TC) track forecasting are described (deterministic and ensemble) together with recent performance statistics. Contributions are also included from Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres (RSMCs) and other operational TC forecasting centres, including usage of NWP models and other forecast aids such as consensus forecasts. An outline of the structure of the report is as follows: "}, {"section_title": "global Models a) European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Model Formulations", "text": "Several ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) model cycles have been implemented since 2014 with many technical and scientific upgrades, including an increase of horizontal resolution in March 2016 of both the High-RESolution (HRES) and ENSemble (ENS). In the same year the ocean model was upgraded from one degree to a quarter-ofdegree resolution, and from 42 vertical levels to 75. With the implementation of IFS cycle 45r1 on the 5 June 2018, HRES became a coupled ocean-atmosphere system, as was then already the case for the ENS for the medium/extended and long-range forecasts. The coupling to the ocean had a significant impact in improving the intensity forecast errors of TCs (Mogensen et al., 2017). Table 2a.1 contains the main model features relevant to forecasting TCs."}, {"section_title": "Recent Performance", "text": "The annual average of HRES TC position forecast errors (all TC basins) over the past decade are shown in Figure  2a.1 (blue lines). The performance of the 10-day TC position forecasts from the ERA5 reanalysis system (run in forecast mode) for 0000 and 1200 UTC has been computed using the same TC tracking software as in operations and the result is included in Figure 2a.1 (red lines). The ERA5 reanalysis is based on IFS cycle 41r2, which was operational between March and November 2016 (see table 2a.1 for details). This dataset provides a useful benchmark against which to compare the HRES operational run since the model configuration used by ERA5 remains consistent throughout the whole period it is compared with the operational run. This helps us to eliminate the year-to-year variability in TC predictability in evaluations of the operational model. Overall there is a good correlation over the year of the annual mean position errors between HRES and ERA5 forecasts, at all lead times. Further details of the production and utility of ERA5 are available in Hersbach et al. (2018). Mean TC position errors for HRES at 120-hour and 168hour forecast lead times have decreased by 25% and 40% respectively since 2008. Successive model upgrades have been responsible for the decrease of the mean position errors over recent years. The differences between HRES and ERA5 forecasts became smaller following the model resolution upgrade in 2010, following continual improvements in model physics and following the addition of new observation systems alongside improvement to the assimi- 3-D Ocean model (NEMO) Ocean wave model (ECWAM) Model error (only ENS) HRES 1 /ENS 2 & 3 Tco1279 (0-10 days) 1 /Tco639 (0-15 days) 2 /Tco319 (16-46 days) 3 Equivalent to 9 km 1 /18 km 2 /32 km 3 137 levels 1 /91 levels 2 to 1 Pa 0.36\u00b0 resolution lation that include using the EDA background information in 4DVAR HRES analysis. At shorter forecast lead times the improvement in mean error has been less pronounced in recent years."}, {"section_title": "Future Developments", "text": "The plan for the next model cycle (46r1) is to allow more 'late' observations to enter the system during the assimilation process, without changing the delivery time of the forecasts. There are also longer term plans to investigate how information from TC near real-time reports (storm position) or the '2-D minimum divergence' method, can help better resolve the wind direction ambiguities, intrinsic to scatterometer wind data, near the centre of TCs. This will reduce errors in the analysed TC position (Figure 2a.1), and, one would expect, in the forecasts also.\nIn the future, we'd like to move to a forecast method which uses a 'super ensemble' (multiple deterministic models, ensemble models and multiple runs) to generate the track and uncertainty areas. The uncertainty area for a specific time would be based on a contour of a heat map, with the contour value having been calibrated on past events and representing the area the system should be in some percentage of the time. With improving NWP skill and availability of ensemble guidance, BoM aims to increase automation of the track generation process but there is still concern at how to interpret outliers and to identify scenarios requiring forecaster scrutiny. This includes cases of both high and low model spread. In line with an increased focus on hazard rather than the TC, forecasters are focussing on the occurrence of wind thresholds for example point based onset of gales. While track is a key element, this approach requires a more sophisticated method of combining track, structure and intensity details rather than viewing these parameters in isolation."}, {"section_title": "Web Links to model information and further verification", "text": "Model upgrades in chronological order, with links to extra information: https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/documentation-andsupport/changes-ecmwf-model The latest confluence page for model cycle 45r1 includes relevant information on the scientific and technical upgrades.

The MetUM is suitable for NWP, seasonal forecasting and climate modelling with forecast times ranging from a few days to hundreds of years. Furthermore, the MetUM can be used both as a global and a regional model. The MetUM's dynamical core solves the compressible non-hydrostatic equations of motion with semi-lagrangian advection and semi-implicit time stepping. Sub-grid scale processes such as convection, boundary layer turbulence, radiation, cloud, microphysics and orographic drag are represented by parameterizations. The global NWP configuration has a spherical latitude-longitude grid with spacing 0.140625\u00b0 x 0.09375\u00b0 (about 10 km at mid-latitudes) and 70 levels in the vertical. More details of the latest model configuration can be found in Walters et al. (2017). For data assimilation, the model uses a hybrid incremental 4D-Var scheme with 44 short forecasts from the Global Ensemble (Clayton et al., 2013). TCs are initialised by assimilating central pressure estimates from regional TC warning centres issued in real time (Heming, 2016). The global NWP version of the MetUM is run four times per day out to 168 hours (0000 and 1200 UTC) and 69 hours (0600 and 1800 UTC). TCs are tracked after the 0000 and 1200 UTC runs of the model (Heming, 2017) and forecast guidance messages issued both on the Global Telecommunications System and the Met Office web site for use by TC warning centres. Figure 2b.1 and 2b.2 show the 5-year running mean of TC track forecast errors from the global MetUM for the northern and southern hemispheres. This shows a long term downwards trend in forecast errors which has accelerated since the introduction of a major model change in 2014 which included the introduction of a new dynamical core, a physics upgrade and increase in horizontal resolution (Walters et al., 2017;Heming, 2016). 5-day forecast errors are now lower than 2-day errors were 25 years ago."}, {"section_title": "Forecast Performance", "text": "\n\nIn recent years, NAVGEM track predictions tend to perform best with respect to other global models in the Northwest Pacific basin (as compared with Atlantic and Eastern North Pacific basins), particularly at later lead times. This can be seen in Fig. 2e.2, which shows track mean absolute error statistics for the 2017 and 2018 Northwest Pacific seasons. The manner in which NAVGEM represents TCs at the initial time and the resolution of the forecast model are best suited for large TCs. The preponderance of large TCs in the Northwest Pacific relative to other Northern Hemisphere TC basin may explain NAVGEM's relatively good performance in that region.\nThe GEM model has a well-known over-prediction bias for TCs, most notable in the model's elevated false alarm rate (Zadra et al. 2014b). A modernization and rebalancing effort for the model physics is currently under way at the CMC, with a focus on improving the representation of the tropical atmosphere. TC tracking results from the new physics package are promising, with a highly significant reduction in the frequency bias, increase in threat score and reduction in track error as shown in Figure 2f.1. These changes are scheduled to be implemented in the global modelling system in mid-2019.\nDue to the large amount of work involved to collect NWP model data from agencies around the world and calculate and publish statistics, results for each calendar year are usually published about 22 months after the end of the year. Thus currently results up to 2016 are the latest available. Large amounts of verification data are available from the WGNE TC Intercomparison web site: http://nwp-verif. kishou.go.jp/wgne_tc. A few examples have been selected for this report. Figure 2h.1 shows track forecast errors for various NWP models in 2016 for three regions: the Northwest Pacific, for TCs in the current operational global model at CMC (blue) and a version of the system with updated atmospheric physics scheduled for implementation in mid-2019 (red) is shown for a two-month period in summer 2016. In all panels, results were obtained using a TC tracking algorithm and comparison with the best track (IBTrACS) dataset for systems of tropical depression strength and greater.  North Atlantic and Australian region. These show that for the Northwest Pacific the ECMWF model was the best performer followed by the KMA and UKMO models. In the North Atlantic the UKMO model was mostly the best performer with KMA and ECMWF also performing well. In the Australian region the NCEP (GFS) model was the best performer with ECMWF being the second best. Figure 2h.2 shows a long time series of 72-hour forecasts for the same three regions. In the Northwest Pacific the EC-MWF model has mostly been the best performer since the start of the intercomparison. There is a clear downwards trend in track forecast errors for many of the models. In the North Atlantic the ECMWF and NCEP (GFS) models have shown to be good performers, particularly in the last decade. The Australian region has only been part of the intercomparison for the last decade and in this region the ECMWF and NCEP (GFS) models perform well.\nAs part of RAL1-T testing, a 4.4 km regional model of the Philippines (domain shown in Figure 3a.1) was used to re-run all 2015 TC cases (a particularly active El Ni\u00f1o year). Figure 3a.2 shows the mean error in storm position relative to observations (as measured by the direct positional error, DPE) as a function of lead time. Corresponding mean track errors derived from Met Office global model (GA6.1) and HWRF operational forecasts are also displayed. Note that the storm sample has been homogenized across the models. Overall, the RAL1-T and GA6.1 models give similar mean track errors (Figure 3a.2a). The DPE increases by  Error in forecast storm position relative to observations (direct positional error, DPE) as a function of lead time for the RAL1-T regional and GA6.1 global models, for (a) all storms in the sample, (b) storms of category 3 and above, and (c) storms below category 3. The solid lines with error bars represent the mean error and 95% confidence intervals on the mean, respectively. The mean track error from the HWRF model is also displayed. The solid grey lines indicate the number of storm cases (see the right-hand axis of each plot). approximately 36 km per day of forecast, reaching a maximum of around 200 km at 120 hours. Although track errors relative to observations are comparable, storm positions are typically different in the two models (not shown, but see Short and Petch, 2018), implying that the large-scale steering flow inherited from the driving global model is modified by the regional model. This is likely due to differences in the model physics, in particular the treatment of convection (not parametrized in the regional model), boundary layer and microphysics. All of these are known to affect TC tracks in numerical models (e.g. Li and Pu, 2009;Fovell et al., 2009;Nasrollahi et al., 2012;Biswas et al., 2014;Shepherd and Walsh, 2017). When the storm sample is stratified by intensity (Figures 3a.2b and 3a.2c), there is an indication that RAL1-T may give improved track forecasts for the most intense storms (category 3 and above, CAT35) at longer lead times, possibly because of the different representation of key physical processes discussed above. However, the limited sample size means this is not a statistically significant result. For weaker storms (below category 3, <CAT35) there is little difference between model track predictions. On average, both models are able to forecast the position of strong storms better than weaker storms. HWRF gives similar mean track errors to the two Me-tUM configurations out to 48 hours or so, but the rate of error growth increases beyond this, leading to a larger mean track error in the latter stages of the forecast.\n\nAt M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, the main verification of TC track predictions is focused on Arome Overseas models. Since they don't have movable domains, the verification sample is small, even when gathering all domains. Nevertheless, these models have shown good skill in TC track forecasts, at least on par with their driving model (ECMWF HRES model), as shown on Figure 3d.2. Occasionally Arome Overseas models perform much better that their driving model for TC track prediction. This ability appears as a positive feedback of better intensity on track. The better representation of the TC intensity and structure during the forecast leads to a more accurate steering flow and then a better track prediction.\nLong term time series plots showing the annual mean track and central pressure errors (verified against JTWC best track data) for the Bureau's dedicated TC NWP sys- Track errors showed a dramatic improvement following the introduction of ACCESS-TC in 2011. Since then, performance has been fairly static, although the 2017 AC-CESS-TC2 results were the best yet at almost all forecast ranges. ACCESS-TC has shown a consistent positive bias in the central pressures, i.e. the modelled pressure is not as deep as the best track estimate. This is expected to improve significantly when we move to a higher horizontal resolution in the next model upgrade.\nThe JTWC provides TC track, intensity, and wind field forecasts for US Government customers in the North Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian Ocean basins. Figure 5b.2 shows the mean track errors for the Northwest Pacific (since 1970) and Southern Hemisphere regions (since 1985). JTWC began producing 120-hour forecasts for the Northwest Pacific in 2000, and in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. In 2000, mean track error at 72 and 120 hours were near 400 km and 600 km. In 2017, mean track errors at 72 and 120 hours were near 250 km and 415 km. The same general trends are evident in the southern hemisphere as well. Taking into account intra-seasonal variability, the implementation of consensus track forecasting at JTWC along with great improvements in numerical modeling capabilities has significantly and steadily reduced forecast track errors, particularly in the later forecast periods.\nThere has been a significant improvement in TC track forecasting over the north Indian Ocean by IMD in recent years. The average track forecast errors of IMD during 2014-18 were 81, 128, 180, 260 and 285 km respectively Fig. 5g.1. The average track forecast errors of various NWP models used by IMD and IMD's official forecasts during 2014-18 for 24-, 48-, 72-, 96-and 120-hour forecasts (RSMC, New Delhi, 2018). The forecast performance of individual NWP models, the MME and IMD's official forecast is shown in Figure 5g.1. It is found that the MME outperforms the individual models. The official forecast accuracy is similar to MME forecast accuracy. In this figure, the operational forecast error has been compared with model errors with a 12 hour lag (i.e. 24-hour model error is compared with 12-hour official error), as the model products used for official forecasts are available with almost 12 hours delay. Considering individual NWP models, it is observed that the HWRF model has the lowest error up to 36 hours. This is followed by the ECMWF model for these lead times. The UKMO model shows the lowest errors for the longer lead times. The track forecast errors based on 2014-2018 as compared to previous five years are shown in Figure 5g.2. There is an improvement of 25-35% for 12-to 24-hour lead times and of 35-45% for 36-to 72-hour lead times. There has been continuous improvement in track forecasts by IMD (Mohapatra et al., 2013a) due to modernization of IMD (Mohapatra et al., 2013b)."}, {"section_title": "Future Plans", "text": "The next major change to the global NWP MetUM is coupling to the ocean which is expected to be operational by 2020. This is not expected to improve TC forecast track significantly, but in trials produces much better predictions of TC intensity in cases where ocean feedback is important, such as slow-moving TCs. In the longer term a completely new modelling framework known as LFRic is being developed to overcome the challenge of weather and climate prediction on the next generation of supercomputers: https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/lfric Fig. 2a.1.

Tropical cyclone research and review  \nJMA will increase the horizontal resolution of GSM from the current 20 km to 13 km within the next five years and enhance its physical processes optimized for the increased resolution, aiming at enhancing the representation of smaller scale features of meteorological phenomena including TCs. This will lead to the higher forecast accuracy. JMA will start all-sky microwave radiance assimilation. In addition, JMA will also improve the assimilation method of high-resolution atmospheric motion vectors derived from Himawari-8. Increase in accuracy of the initial fields of cloud/precipitation areas and initial wind fields is expected with these improvements, which will also result in the higher prediction accuracy of meteorological phenomena including TCs.\nTwo major upgrades are planned for NAVGEM to greatly increase the horizontal resolution of the model. The first upgrade, planned for 2019, increases the horizontal resolution to 19 km, implements a two-time level semi-Lagrangian scheme to replace the current 3-time level scheme, and includes refinements to the model physics and how the physics are coupled with the dynamics. A followon upgrade, planned for 2020, will feature another increase to horizontal resolution (from 19 to 13 km), an increase in the number of vertical levels from 60 to 100, and additional physics improvements. Some of deficiencies in NAVGEM track predictions are thought to be related to the TC synthetic wind profile assimilation technique discussed earlier, which was designed for a much lower resolution model and less sophisticated data assimilation system than contemporary NAVGEM and NAVDAS-AR. Work is underway to develop new techniques for TC initialization that depend more heavily on satellite observations and the model background state rather than TC synthetic observations. With improved initialization of TCs alongside the planned increases in NAVGEM resolution, we expect that the model will make substantial progress in TC track prediction in the coming years. Finally, an initial operational capability at FNMOC for the new Navy Earth System Model (NESM) is planned for 2019. NESM is a coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice-wave model designed for multi-week deterministic prediction and multi-month probabilistic prediction. The deterministic short-term forecast is planned to run once a day out to 16 days lead time, using a 19 km horizontal resolution NAVGEM atmospheric model, the 4.5 km Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), the 4.5 km CICE ice model and 14 km WaveWatch III (WW3) wave model. NESM will provide an exciting new capability for air/ocean/wave coupled predictions of TCs.\nThe future development of regional configurations of the MetUM for TC forecasting will be targeted at improving intensity, rather than track predictions. A change that has recently gone into the models described above is a cap on the air-sea drag coefficient at high wind speeds, as motivated by observational data. Trials have demonstrated this considerably reduces the weak bias in TC surface winds seen in regional and (to a lesser extent) global configurations of the MetUM. Looking further ahead, there are plans to improve the initialisation of TC forecasts (at present, the regional model is somewhat handicapped by having to spin-up strong storms from relatively weak global analyses) and to implement some form of air-sea coupling in the model (along with frictional heating in the surface layer).\nFuture upgrades are being planned for the COAMPS-TC modeling system.

COTC (right panel). data assimilation system for model initialization will be introduced in the next several years. Upgrades to the physical parameterizations (especially boundary layer and microphysics) and an increase in the vertical resolution from 40 to 60 levels are anticipated within 3 years. An increase in inner-most nest horizontal resolution from 4 km to 2 km is planned for 2021 followed by a further increase to 1 km as operational computing resources permit. The air-ocean coupled model will utilize a coupled data assimilation system, the Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (NCODA; Cummings, 2005) and the WaveWatch model (WW3) will be added to the coupled system to better represent the airsea interface. A high-resolution COAMPS-TC ensemble system is being developed to characterize state-dependent track and intensity forecast uncertainty. An 11 member ensemble with 4 km horizontal resolution (and not coupled to an ocean model) is being transitioned to operations at FNMOC later this year.\nJMA will increase the horizontal resolution of GEPS from the current 40 km to 27 km and the ensemble members from 27 to 51 within the next five years. This will also enhance the ability to explain meteorological phenomena including tropical cyclones and achieve higher accuracy of forecasts as well as probability information."}, {"section_title": "c) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (USA) NCEP Operational Models", "text": "NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) provides real-time deterministic and ensemble based TC forecast guidance across the globe, primarily to the forecasters at the National Hurricane Center (NHC), the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC), US Navy Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and various public and private forecast agencies across the world. The deterministic models include operational Global Forecast System (GFS) and two exclusive high-resolution TC specific models -the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecast System (HWRF) and the Hurricanes in Multi-scale Ocean-coupled Non-hydrostatic (HMON) models.

The GFDL FV3 dynamical core (Putman and Lin, 2007) is the dynamical core ( Figure 2c.2) of choice for many global models in the United States, having been implemented in the GFDL suite of global weather and climate models, the NASA GEOS modelling system, and other systems around the world. FV3 was selected as the dynamical core for the US National Weather Service's Next-Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS), on the basis of its superior accuracy, forecast skill, computational performance, conservation properties, and numerical stability. The FV3 dynamical core has been transferred to the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) as the replacements for the NWS's Global Forecast System (GFS) and is scheduled to become operational at NCEP in mid-2019. FV3 uses the forward-in-time scheme and Lagrangian vertical coordinate of Lin (2004), based on the Lagrangian dynamics of Lin and Rood (1997) and the finite-volume pressure gradient force of Lin (1997). FV3 is distinguished from its predecessor, FV (Lin 2004), through the discretization on a quasi-uniform cubed-sphere grid, which avoids the singularity at the poles of the earlier latitude-longitude grid. FV3 has the capability to locally-refine its global cubed-sphere grid by either two-way interactive nesting (Harris and Lin, 2013) or stretching (Harris et al., 2016) using a Schmidt transformation. The version of the FV3 that is run in near real time by scientists at GFDL is referred to as fvGFS. It uses the operational GFS initial condition (cold start), compared to the parallel version now being run and evaluated extensively at NCEP using a cycled data assimilation that has been developed for FV3-GFS. In order to test the robustness and skill of of their version of fvGFS, scientists at GFDL have performed retrospective forecasts for most of 2015, 2016 and 2017, cold started from the GFS initial condition. The TC track performance were evaluated in all ocean basins (Figure 2c.3) for this three year sample, which provided a robust sample size of slightly over 2000 cases. Overall the track performance was found to be as good as the operational GFS, with some reduction in track error, particularly in the Northwest Pacific where the 48-hour and 72-hour track error was reduced 8%. An improved version of fvGFS has been developed at GFDL and has been run daily in real time since July 2018. The new 2018 GFDL version of fvGFS introduces the Yonsei University (YSU) planetary boundary layer scheme and a dynamically-active mixed-layer ocean model. The  2018 GFDL fvGFS also includes a revised positive-definite tracer advection scheme and the number of vertical levels is increased from 64 to 91. Also in this new version, the GFDL microphysics has the capability to be called in-line directly from the dynamics, allowing a much faster calling frequency to the microphysics. So far, the results for the 2018 TC seasons are showing superior track performance with the 2018 GFDL fvGFS compared with both the current operational GFS, the version run in parallel at the Environmental Modelling Center (FV3-GFS) scheduled for operational implementation in mid-2019 and most of the other operational numerical guidance.

Model prognostic fields are  discretized on to a regular latitude/longitude grid with Arakawa C-grid staggering (Arakawa and Lamb, 1977), whilst the vertical discretization utilizes a Charney-Phillips staggering (Charney and Phillips, 1953) and a terrain-following hybrid-height vertical coordinate.

A deterministic 4.4 km grid length model spanning Southeast Asia, with a 1.5 km model for the Philippines nested inside this. This system is run twice a day (0000/1200 UTC) out to 120 hours. 2.

Figure  5a.1 shows a time series of NHC's 24 hour through 120 hour track errors since 1990. The 24\u221272 hour track forecast errors have been reduced by 70 to 75% since 1990 and error reductions of about 60% have occurred over the past 15 years or so for the 96-and 120-hour forecast periods. In 2017, records for accuracy were set at all time periods and the errors were about 15% lower than the previous records at several forecast times. The primary reason for this success are the advancements in technology, specifically the improvements in the observing platforms and the various modelling systems that NHC uses to make forecasts. The horizontal and vertical resolution, and physics in the models today are far superior to what forecasters had available in the 1990s or prior decades. In addition, NHC has found ways to outperform the individual dynamical models by using a balance of model consensus approaches and experience. Consensus models are not true forecast models per se, but are merely combinations of results from other models. One way to form a consensus is to simply average the results from a collection or ensemble of models, but other more complex techniques can also be used. The Florida State University Super-ensemble (FSSE) for example, combines its individual components on the basis of past performance and attempts to correct for biases in those components (Williford et al., 2003). A consensus model that considers past error characteristics can be described as a weighted or corrected consensus. On average, these consensus models have been the most accurate track forecast aids over the past several years and NHC forecasters value these models most when making a track prediction.

Table 5a.1 lists all of the models that NHC uses. Looking ahead to the future, there are a few anticipated challenges in terms of track forecasting. NHC has been experimenting in extending the forecasts out further in time to day 7 (currently 5-day forecasts are made). However, not all of the models are run out to 7 days, which reduces the guidance to NHC and limits the utility of the current consensus model composition at days 6 and 7. The global model ensembles have proven to be quite useful for longer range track prediction. However, it has been shown that the GFS ensemble suite is not dispersive enough to fully capture the uncertainty and possible scenarios. Another issue is how to communicate 7-day track forecasts. The NHC currently uses a combination of deterministic forecasts (i.e. cone graphic) and probabilistic graphics (i.e. wind speed probabilities, storm surge probabilities) to display their prediction and TC hazards. However, it is not known if the (Sampson and Schrader, 2000). At that time, limitations in model availability meant that the consensus was fairly limited. However, over the years, the availability of high-quality NWP models capable of generating a high confidence track forecast has dramatically increased. Beginning in the early 2000s, JTWC began to have access to increasing numbers of these models and started to use the consensus methodology to improve track forecasts. Today, the JTWC utilizes an internally generated, non-weighted, consensus forecast track aid, (CONW), consisting of 10 individual members, including a mix of global, regional and ensemble models (Table 5b.1). The JTWC consensus requires a minimum of two of the 10 members be present in order to generate the CONW tracker. NRL and JTWC annually review the performance and reliability of various models to assess the sensitivity of CONW accuracy to each member and to optimize overall accuracy of the consensus. For instance, in 2017, the USAF Global Air-Land Weather Exploitation (GALWEM) model (AFUM) replaced the JMA TC ensemble mean track forecasts (JENS) in the track forecast consensus.

Figure 5c.3 shows that operational forecasts (black bars) had lower errors than GSM (pink bars) and the four model consensus (GEUA; red bars) gave the most accurate results."}, {"section_title": "d) Bureau of Meteorology (Australia) Forecasting Method and Performance", "text": "Performance of Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) in operational track forecasting is summarized in Figure 5d.1 and Table 5d.1, with values averaged over the past five years. The BoM issues a forecast track out to 120 hours with 'uncertainty areas' which represents the range of possible tracks between analysis time and a certain time. The BoM's standard track forecast process involves a consensus of model guidance, shifting to the analysis position and using average motion to generate a track. Once a system has developed, the standard consensus is the latest  Chan-hom (2015). Right: Northwestwards moving Typhoon Vongfong (2014) (deterministic run) from ECMWF, GFS, UKMO, HWRF, ACCESS-TC (3-day high resolution) or ACCESS-TCX (5-day high resolution), COAMPS (CTCX), JMA, and optionally ACCESS-G or ACCESS-R. When or if available, ECMWF and UKMO ensemble means are also used. The shifting to analysis position and then average track motion avoids jumps in the consensus track when/if model guidance stops being available. The uncertainty areas (for 24-, 48-, 72-and 120-hour forecasts) are initially based on radii calculated from the consensus tracks and climatological track error. The forecasters then have the option to adjust the shape of the uncertainty areas based on guidance (deterministic and ensemble). The BoM has a requirement, in some cases to start issuing tropical system forecasts prior to a tropical disturbance forming. Due to limited guidance at that time range, the usual consensus is two or more runs of the ECMWF, GFS, UKMO, JMA and ACCESS-G models. Depending on the situation, the inclusion of models and past runs is based on comparison to how well the resulting spread matches ensemble guidance. Due to uncertainty in analysis position (or no analysis position at all) the track is generally based on average guidance position or average initial position and average motion (not shifted to analysis). The included models and ensemble guidance is used to inform the uncertainty areas. These early tracks generally exhibit greater forecast error due to errors in where the system develops compounding with errors in track forecasting."}, {"section_title": "Forecasting Challenges", "text": "The BoM's main challenging scenarios are: -Small systems with different steering flows depending on depth of the system, particularly since the small systems can be under forecast by the lower resolution global models. -Small, well structured systems which could move offshore and then rapidly intensify. -Two or more systems interacting which increases forecast error.  -Bifurcation and representing that in a forecast track. We generally try and forecast the most likely scenario and then modify the uncertainty area (which is initially uniform in all directions) to show the remainder of the risk, with the risk being based on guidance."}, {"section_title": "e) RSMC La R\u00e9union (M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France)", "text": "TC track forecasting at RSMC La R\u00e9union essentially relies on the track forecasts provided by the main NWP models available at the Centre. Indeed, while a TC forecaster can beat any numerical model for an individual forecast at a given time, it has become virtually impossible to statistically beat them for a large sample of forecasts, like for a whole cyclone season. Given this reality, the challenge for the TC track forecasting is then to optimize the forecasts provided by the models. The best that can be done is to follow the currently deemed 'best performers' or the consensus of the models that have been assessed to outdo the individual best models. A few years ago, during a certain period the ECMWF HRES model outperformed the other models by such a margin that any consensus built by adding one or several other models just degraded the performance of the track forecast. Currently, this situation does not prevail anymore, as the GFS model has caught up with the ECMWF model in the Southwest Indian Ocean basin. Therefore the outputs from these two models form the base of the track forecasts for a more or less weighted consensus, the main adjustment variable being the weight given to each in the consensus. However, in certain circumstances a consensus would not be appropriate. This is the case when there is a too large discrepancy between the models with track forecasting options that really differ. In such a situation it is the role of the TC forecaster to 1) try to understand the origin of the differences by examining the different fields and 2) to make a choice (with no guarantee of making the right one despite his expertise). While deterministic track forecasts remain the main output of RSMC La R\u00e9union, they say nothing about the inherent uncertainty in forecasts. Since December 2011 the RSMC La R\u00e9union website displays dynamical probabilistic cones of uncertainty around the official track forecasts of the RSMC. Instead of including a cone of uncertainty based on the average error climatology, a more sophisticated probabilistic method is used which more realistically takes into account the real degree of uncertainty of each individual TC track forecast situation. The spread information included in the ensemble forecasts (EPS from the EC-MWF) is used to better assess the uncertainty and construct an EPS-based probabilistic adaptive cone to convey this uncertainty. Dupont et al. (2011) shows that this methodology has skill over just using climatology. The TC track forecast performance of the RSMC La R\u00e9union is shown in Figure 5e.1. While short range forecasts have demonstrated very little or no improvement, forecasts at 48 hours lead time and beyond continue to show improvement. In the past few seasons the forecast errors for 60 hours and beyond have shown the most spectacular reduction, which means that the natural trend of increasing error with time becomes drastically flatter. So much so that the gap between 36-hour forecast errors and 72-hour forecast errors has been divided by more than three since IWTC-8. Also, 72-hour forecasts are now better than the 48-hour forecasts were just one or two years ago."}, {"section_title": "f) RSMC Nadi (Fiji Meteorological Service)", "text": "RSMC Nadi area of responsibility (AOR) is from the Equator to 25\u00b0S and 160\u00b0E to 120\u00b0W covering over 20 million square miles of ocean. Apart from a few ship reports there are no drifting buoys for open waters observations. Land based observations are also very few in most of the island countries which fall in the AOR. In brief this is a data sparse region. RSMC, Nadi issues a 3-day Tropical Cyclone Outlook every day at 0400 UTC from 1 November to 30 April. TC intensity forecasting especially beyond 24 hours remains a challenge at RSMC Nadi. Each TC is different and behaves somewhat differently to similar environmental condition. For most of the systems, normal development of Dvorak T = 1 per day is applied. Midget systems which intensify rapidly are the most difficult ones to forecast where the Dvorak constraint is usually broken. For analyzing a system, we receive Himawari satellite images every 30 minutes from HimawariCloud which is of high resolution and HimawariCast every 10 minutes at lower resolution. The Dvorak technique is applied for analyzing the intensity. For low-level circulation centre location, satellite loops, ASCAT passes, land based observations (if close to land) are used. The intensity analysis can only be verified if there is an ASCAT pass (useful when the TC intensity is below 50 knots) or land-based observation stations near to the TC centre. The Australian TC Module is used for TC official forecasts, tracks maps and issuance of most products. For forecast intensity and track, RSMC Nadi is dependent on global model guidance which is imported from the JTWC website to TC Module. RSMC Nadi does not run any locally developed numerical models. Guidance from GFS, UKMO, JTWC, GFDL and JMA are available from the JTWC collaboration site. ECMWF is entered manually from Tropical Tidbits. A consensus forecast track is prepared from all the above models using TC Module. Sometimes the forecast track is shifted when the TC is approaching a land area. The track is moved a little closer to land area mainly for warning purpose. This is after the experience with TC Evan. For the intensity forecasts, model guidance is used together with the Dvorak rules for intensification and weakening. Examples of TC track forecast errors for TCs in the RSMC Nadi AOR in the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons are shown in Figures 5f.1 and 5f.2."}, {"section_title": "g) RSMC New Delhi (India Meteorological Department) Forecasting Tools", "text": "For short range forecasting (up to 24 hours) IMD uses synoptic, statistical, satellite and radar guidance. NWP guidance is mainly used for 24-120 hour forecasts. Consensus forecasts that gather all or part of the numerical forecast tracks and use synoptic and statistical guidance are utilised to issue official forecast (IMD, 2013). The NWP models used by IMD include individual deterministic models, a multi-model ensemble (MME) and single model ensemble prediction system (EPS). The deterministic models include GFS, the regional WRFDA-WRF-ARW model with 9 km and 3 km horizontal resolutions, HWRF, Unified Model (12 km resolution) and Unified regional model (4.5 km resolution) adapted from UKMO. IMD also makes use of NWP products prepared by some other operational NWP centres such as ECMWF, NC-MRWF, JMA, UKMO and M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France.  The MME technique (Kotal and Roy Bhowmik, 2011) includes five member models; WRF (ARW), GFS (IMD), GFS (NCEP), ECMWF and JMA. The MME product is available about 9 hours late, so, for example, the 36-hour MME forecast is used for 24-hour official forecasts. The Ensemble forecast products from ECMWF, NCEP, UKMO, CMC and JMA are available near real-time. A super-ensemble is also developed based on above ensembles. In India, NCMRWF and IMD run the Unified Model Ensemble Prediction System (UM-EPS) and Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) respectively to provide 7-day forecasts based on 0000 UTC initial condition with a resolution of 12 km each (RSMC, New Delhi, 2018)."}, {"section_title": "Cone of Uncertainty", "text": "Considering the improvement in track forecasting, the radii of the cone of uncertainty based on past five years average track forecast error have been reduced by about 20-25% since 2014 (Mohapatra et al., , 2017; Figure  5g.3). It is being revised every five years and revision is due in 2019. It has its own limitation due to its static nature, especially in the case of recurving tracks.

These forecasts are issued five times a day. However, the track forecast error in the pre-genesis stage is relatively high. This may be due to relatively high initial errors in the estimation of the centre of the depression unlike that of TCs and most of the models do not use vortex initialization or relocation at this stage due to lack of TC vital information from the forecasters."}, {"section_title": "End-of-life Track Forecasting", "text": "RSMC New Delhi issues track forecasts objectively indicating forecast latitude and longitude, whilst the former TC is expected to remain as a depression, even after landfall.

We almost always inherit tracks from the NHC as TCs approach from the south, so by default we have a good initial guidance from their tracks. Historically, we have become accustomed to utilizing other models other than the Canadian Global Deterministic Prediction System as its performance was substandard. However, significant progress has been made with the global model since the introduction of the coupled atmospheric-ocean physics. Climatologically, tropical systems at our latitudes tend to have a 'well-behaved' track as the upper flow is usually well defined. The along-track error component usually dominates the cross-track component for this reason. The error components we use to define our error ellipses (upon which our cone of uncertainty is based) are in Table 5h.1. These numbers have been in use for a few years and are likely in need of updating in the next few years. The biggest challenge in track forecasting for our latitudes remains the speed of systems as they begin to interact with the midlatitude upper flow. CHC find it difficult to find forecast utility of the ensemble information. We do expose some of our clients to 'track spaghetti plots' (i.e. ensemble member tracks) at times to give an indication of NWP possibilities. We are also considering having a look at these member tracks superimposed over the climatological error cone to see how dispersed any specific ensemble run is compared to the error cone values to see if information is revealed. It might be  a simple assessment: the longer the member tracks remain within the error cone the better behaved the system might be. It's more complicated to consider the cross and along track components as well. We may discover that some TCs are suited to longer track forecasts than others."}, {"section_title": "summary", "text": "This report has summarised the latest configurations of many NWP models used for operational TC track forecasting and included performance statistics and future developments.
