There is a growing number of studies on the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the reference genome [18] [19] [20] [21] . From previous viral outbreaks, it is known that as part of the natural evolution of a virus, subpopulations of clades that can affect the severity of a disease emerge and alter the trajectory of a pandemic [22] . It has been reported that while the two major structural proteins, S and nucleocapsid (N) protein are rich in sites of episodic selection, ORF3a and ORF8 had also been shown to carry a lot of mutations [23] .\nIn this study, we investigate the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Netherlands, in the context of global viral population with a particular focus on the later stages of the first wave of the pandemic (from early April to the end of May). We have identified the most variant proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, as well as the most frequent mutations in the Netherlands that also showed high dominance in the rest of the world. We found relatively conserved regions in the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2.

While initially many genome sequences were generated, by April virtually no sequences were determined. Distinct genetic patterns in the SARS-CoV-2 population emerge across the globe In order to get an overview of the viral diversity throughout the pandemic, we used the clade definitions proposed by the GISAID database [17] . We observe the distribution of different clades in the Netherlands resemble that of Australia where the first samples are genetically diverse and there is no dominating variant (subplots in Figure 2) . A similar pattern is seen in other European counties such as the UK and Belgium, while the USA, Canada and Denmark have distinct trajectories with GH clade dominating the population (Additional file 1, Figure S3 ). Also note that clade S has gradually faded out despite its high prevalence before April in several countries, this is particularly noticeable in Australia, China (Figure 2 ), the USA, Spain and Canada (Additional file 1, Figure S3 ). Viral diversity can be observed more clearly when put into context with less diverse populations in other countries where the outbreak had begun the earliest. For instance, China, Singapore and Italy had experienced the outbreak the earliest in the world, and there are only few of the major clades circulating ( Figure 2 , Italy not shown due to small sample size, see Figure S3 for other countries). China had opted for possibly the most severe restrictions; similarly in Singapore, the initial cases of COVID-19 had been followed up with strict precautions, preventing both the spread and new introduction of the virus. While it is tricky to formulate any clear hypothesis since there has not been any submission from either country since April, it is certainly interesting to see the contrast between them and countries where COVID-19 arrived at relatively late stages of the pandemic, such as the Netherlands, Australia and India. The composition of viral genomes in these locations appears to be quite diverse, suggesting multiple introductions of virus.\n.

S:D614G and N:RG203KR amino acid changes comprise a large fraction of the mutation in these regions, ( Figure 4 ); former being one of the mutation that defines G, GR and GH clades. Apart from carrying the majority of mutations observed in the populations, both proteins play an important role in RT-qPCR based diagnostic tests as well as vaccine and drug development [31] . The S protein has been investigated in great detail for its significance in binding to the host cell and a potential target for COVID-19 treatment and vaccine design [32] [33] [34] .\nPrevalence of S:D614G variant has steadily increased over the course of the pandemic: it is observed in all the sequences sampled recently in the world (Additional file supplementary figure S4 ). The location of origin of this variant is still unclear, and its implications for humans infected with COVID-19 remain unknown; however, it appears to be very rare in China despite its ubiquity in rest of the world (discussed further in the following section). Note that there have been no sequences released publicly from China since April, making it more difficult to interpret (bottom subplot for China in Figure 2 ). Thus, it is also likely to be the result of a founder effect commonly observed in viral populations, when the virus spreads very rapidly once in introduced through only a few members of the whole population [35] . Moreover, a study on 453 COVID-19 patients in Sheffield, UK failed to detect any significant link between the trajectory of disease in humans and presence/absence of S:D614G mutation [36] .\nIn order to determine the appropriate primers to use when diagnosing patients with RT-PCR tests or when designing novel primer/probe sequences, variations in the nucleotide sequence should be considered since it plays a crucial role in achieving accurate tests [10, 20] . In light of these, in Figure 4 we have highlighted the predicted epitope regions from [37] and the locations of RT-qPCR primer and probe sequences currently used in the Netherlands with mutations with red and blue rectangles, respectively. Without being too specific, amino-acid positions from 60 to 80, 160 to 170, 340 to 360 and 400 to 420 appear to be relatively stable sites, free of any mutations and could potentially be utilized as primer sequences. This finding is further supported by recent work that combined prior information on the SARS-CoV S and N proteins, and their known epitopes to identify regions in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that could potentially serve as epitopes for B-cells and T-cells [37] .

In the absence of travel restrictions, we observe unique and rare mutations increase in frequency (late April in Figure 6 , highlighted in blue). The UK and the USA have been among the latest to impose control measures, and we see rare mutations peak several times from February till mid-March. As the pandemic progresses, the four most abundant mutations shared across each country (blue lines in Figure 6 ) become well-established as part of the viral genome, while lifting the lockdown leads to again an increase in rare mutations (areas highlighted in blue in Figure 6 ) as they spread and form local clusters of variants. Abundance of small variants suggest community-driven spread, which can be elaborated by monitoring such variants to detect super-spreading events.\n.

As part of the Dutch initiative to investigate transmission of COVID-19 in the Netherlands, Munnink et al. had conducted a detailed analysis on the earlier samples with patient data [11] . More recently, Sikkema et al. have published their findings on COVID-19 infection in health-care workers in early March [43] . Their studies suggest multiple introductions from Italy and Switzerland, as well as localized community transmissions in super-spreading events in late February and early March. In addition, the authors note the diversity of early strains even for patients with similar travel histories, also in parallel with our observations in our study. In addition to Noord-Brabant, Munnink et al. had detected local clusters in Zuid-Holland and Utrecht.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted November 4, 2020. ; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.02.20224352 doi: medRxiv preprint that branching with number 1 contains several provinces; it is also likely that this is a consequence of relaxations in domestic travel restrictions, rather than convergent evolution.\nThe second mutation, NSP14:D390D (purple circles), is tricky to interpret because it is present in only 9 genomes, 7 of which had been sequenced in the Netherlands and the remaining two in the UK. It has first appeared in the UK on March 24 th , during strict lockdown conditions, and it has emerged in the Netherlands in May. We hypothesize this is a small cluster of variants genomes, localized in Limburg only and it has not found the chance to spread outside of the province yet.\nNSP14:S374A (blue circles) is the only non-silent mutation in this list, and is very unique to Zuid Holland; it is present in 35 genomes in total, all collected in Zuid-Holland region within three weeks. Similar to NSP14:D390D, it is highly likely to be a small, contained cluster of individuals.\nORF7a:F87F (pink circles) is also incredibly rare since it was observed only in Gelderland in the Netherlands from late April to early May, and less than five times in any other country. It occurs in only one sequence from Canada in April 13 th , twice in the USA in late March and four times in the UK in mid-April.\n.

Nevertheless, it is surely interesting consider that these four mutations, linked to one another, might also influence the infection in the human host.\nWe have analyzed the most frequent mutations around the world, and found that. Since the rate of sequencing has been fluctuating dramatically and the dataset has been over-represented by the UK, the USA and Europe in general, it is not possible to tell if any change in frequency of mutations over time is caused by the unbalanced sampling or evolutionary advantage/disadvantage.\nWith our phylogenetic study in the Netherlands, we confirmed multiple introductions in distinct provinces as well as the population diversity in the initial samples (Figure 7) . We also detected emerging local clusters, defined by four mutations, N:P383P, NSP14:D390D, NSP14:S374A and ORF7a:F87F, all of which are either entirely unique to the Netherlands or very rarely observed elsewhere (Figure 8 ). N:P383P had occurred at two distinct sections in different regions, we presume this is likely a domestic travel event rather than a convergent mutation. We note the detection and monitoring of such unique mutations could be utilized for tracking the spread of virus and identifying possible routes of transmission during the outbreak. In addition, our findings are in line with previous studies in the Netherlands by Munnink et al and Sikkema et al.; they had also observed sequence diversity in the earliest days of the outbreak as well as community transmission [11, 43] .\nThe single most prominent pattern that we encountered in our study was that despite the continual increase in number of mutations in the genome, diverging away from the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference, there is little diversity in the new variants as we enter the later stages of the pandemic. This suggests the current SARS-CoV-2 reference genome should be re-evaluated, perhaps replaced with a new one that represents the viral population more accurately. Further work is required to investigate implications of an inadequate reference in sequence-based analyses as well as develop alternative models. Having a good quality reference sequence is crucial in sequence-based analyses, and we assert this line of research will continue to supplement the global effort to fight COVID-19.\nThe major limitation of our study is the biased dataset of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Despite our efforts to combine all genome sequences publicly available up to date, due to imbalanced sampling and dramatic changes in the frequency of genome sequencing, our dataset is over-represented by samples from the Europe and the USA and there are several gaps in time since the beginning of pandemic. In addition, most of the viral sequencing today is performed on hospitalized patients. These issues could be circumvented to some extend by stratified sampling or controlled sequencing efforts with random samples collected from individuals. Nevertheless, our findings are significant to understand the viral population diversity within the Netherlands from late March to early May, where our dataset has the most coverage.

Considering the rapid increase in public data and research on this subject, our work is among the more comprehensive ones to lend insight into the genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 in the later stages of the pandemic in April and early May.\nAs a consequence of the natural evolution of a virus, SARS-CoV-2 genome has been diverging from the initial reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 established based on viral samples from Wuhan, China. The six major clades designated by GISAID had varying distributions in different regions, at different points of time through the course of pandemic. We demonstrated that in most countries, viral population goes through an initial phase of high diversity followed by a decline in genetic variety in which the population is comprised of mostly G, GR or GH clades (Figure 2 ). With increased ease of travel, COVID-19 was able to spread rapidly across the world and several studies had reported multiple introductions of a diverse viral population into many countries outside of China that lends itself to a more homogeneous population diverged from the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference [11, 16, 46, 47] . Interesting, we have also observed that China and Singapore, both of which are countries that experienced the outbreak the earliest, harbor a markedly different viral population that remains mostly homogeneous with L being the dominant clade that also includes the Wuehan-Hu-1 reference (Figure 2 ). Note that this could also be the artifact of the dramatic decline in number of sequences from China.\nThe S and N proteins in SARS-CoV-2 genome has received much attention; both have been reported as the most variant proteins [23, 30] and are also significant in RT-qPCR based diagnostic tests as well as vaccine and drug development [31] . We have identified the most variant sites on the S and N proteins in sequences from the Netherlands (Figure 4 ). Koyama et al. had noted the effect of these variants on sequence-based vaccine and therapeutics against COVID-19 [37] . Following their discussion, we highlight their predicted epitope regions derived from SARS and the mutations we detected on the S and N proteins in Figure 4 . In addition, Kim et al. discussed variations on SARS-CoV-2 genes targeted by diagnostic assays in [21] . Similarly, we analyzed primer/probe sequences currently in use in the Netherlands for diagnostics targeting S and N genes ( Figure 4) ; while the specific implications of mutations on the accuracy of diagnostic tests is unknown, we reported the amino acid positions on N gene from 60 to 80, 160 to 170, 340 to 360 and 400 to 420 to be relatively stable, hence suitable for primer design in RT-qPCR tests.\nWhen we observed the global landscape of variants, we found four mutations, S:D614G, N:RG203KR, NSP3:F106F and 5'UTR:241, are not only the most frequent ones, but also have been steadily increasing in the frequency outside of China since the beginning of pandemic. The implications of these mutations thriving in the population individually are currently unknown, speculative at best. However, some studies have suggested certain linked mutations which poses a different question on its own [36] . We also reported the increase in frequency of these shared mutations, regardless of the date of introduction ( Figure 6 ). On one hand, the abundance of these mutations might suggest that viral genome has converged to a new variant, different than the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference. On the other hand, since most of the viral sequences are from diagnostic tests performed on hospitalized patients at the moment, we are looking at only a small portion of the whole virus population in humans and we do not know clearly whether milder, or even asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 also carry these mutations or not. To our knowledge, studies have not found any significant correlation between these specific mutations and the .

Our dataset contained 1338 genomes from the Netherlands, most of them sequenced in the later stages of pandemic in April and early May. We assert our work provides valuable information on the .

We emphasize the little diversity observed globally in recent samples despite the increased number of mutations relative to the established reference sequence, suggesting the current reference may not be representative of the population; potential implications of an inadequate reference on downstream analyses should be investigated."}]
