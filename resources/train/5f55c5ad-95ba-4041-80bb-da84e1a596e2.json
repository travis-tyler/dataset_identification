[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Introduction: Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are associated with increased risk for cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia. SORCS1 encodes a protein-sorting molecule genetically linked to both T2D and AD. The association of SORCS1 with both AD and T2D is sexually dimorphic in humans, with both disease associations showing more robust effects in females. Based on published evidence that manipulation of the mouse genome combining multiple genes related to cerebral amyloidosis, to T2D, or both, might provide novel mouse models with exacerbated amyloid and/or diabetes phenotypes, we assessed memory, glucose homeostasis, and brain biochemistry and pathology in male and female wild-type, Sorcs1 -/-, APP/PSEN1, and Sorcs1 -/-X APP/PSEN1 mice. Results: Male mice with either the APP/PSEN1 or Sorcs1 -/-genotype displayed earlier onset and persistent impairment in both learning behavior and glucose homeostasis. Unlike prior examples in the literature, the behavioral and metabolic abnormalities in male mice were not significantly exacerbated when the two disease model mice (Sorcs1 -/-models T2D; APP/PSEN1 models AD) were crossed. However, female Sorcs1 -/-X APP/PSEN1 mice exhibited worse metabolic dysfunction than Sorcs1 -/-knockout mice and worse memory than wild-type mice. The deletion of Sorcs1 from APP/PSEN1 mutant mice led to no obvious changes in brain levels of total or oligomeric amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) peptide."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. There are approximately 34 million people afflicted by AD worldwide and those numbers are expected to triple over the next 40 years [5] . Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) increases the risk for dementia [15, 19, 42, 69] . Both T2D and dementia are highly complex and share several features, including impaired cognitive function, vascular dysfunction and oxidative and inflammatory stress [15, 54] . Several mechanisms have been proposed for this association, including hypercholesterolemia, vasculopathic factors, and insulin resistance [63] . Environmental factors, such as poor diet and obesity are also known to increase the predisposition to T2D and the risk for dementia [21] . The extent to which dementia is due to AD or due to vascular dementia is an area of great interest, and the pathology of dementia in T2D is usually mixed [1, 43, 65] .\nRare, early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOFAD) is believed to begin with the accumulation of oligomeric forms of A\u03b2 in the hippocampus and cortex. EOFAD is caused by mutations in genes that directly influence A\u03b2 metabolism, most commonly the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin1 (PSEN1) or presenillin 2 (PSEN2). Mice expressing pathogenic mutant forms of human APP, PSEN, or both, are mainstays of in vivo modeling of cerebral amyloidosis in AD research. Of note, mice harboring EOFAD-pathogenic mutations in both APP and PSEN1 have been observed to develop insulin resistance (Ruiz et al. in press [56] ).\nGenetic studies of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) point to a number of susceptibility genes, including several that belong to one of three classes of molecules: the apolipoprotein family (the most notable of which is apolipoprotein E [11, 59] ; the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family [22, 31] ; and the vacuolar protein sorting-10 (VPS10) domain containing receptor family. The ADlinked gene SORL1 belongs to both the LDLR family and the VPS10-domain protein family, and a deficiency in SorL1 protein has been observed in the brains of patients suffering from LOAD [12, 33, 55, 58, 60] . SorL1 has been demonstrated to modulate A\u03b2 generation via an interaction with the core component of the retromer complex, Vps35 [2, 39, 41, 61] . Human and animal studies in AD have implicated Vps35 and other components of the retromer complex [36, 64] .\nMultiple studies have demonstrated a connection between insulin resistance and T2D and increased risk for cognitive impairment in humans [4, 13, 34, 62] . SORCS1, another member of the Vps10 family, has been identified as a potential risk factor for LOAD and is decreased in AD brains [33] . SORCS1 resides at a quantitative trait locus for T2D in mice and rats [10, 14] and has been associated with both T1D and T2D [13] . Previously, we initiated an investigation of the action of SorCS1 on APP metabolism. We observed that endogenous murine A\u03b240 and 42 levels were increased in the brains of female but not male Sorcs1 -/-mice, and this appeared to involve an interaction mediated by the Vps35 retromer complex [29] . This was especially interesting because the genetic linkage to SORCS1 is sexually dimorphic with the linkage to women being more robust. We hypothesized that SORCS1 hypomorphism might contribute to the link between insulin resistance and increased risk for cognitive impairment in humans. A corollary of that hypothesis is that dysregulation of SorCS1 may contribute to both the A\u03b2 disturbance underlying AD and the insulin/ glucose metabolism disturbance underlying DM, with the two genes arranged either in parallel or in series. Kebede et al. [23] demonstrated that Sorcs1-/-mice were not overtly diabetic unless they were crossed with leptin deficient (ob/ob) mice. In contemplating this result in the context of the AD/T2D association with SORCS1, this observation raised the possibility that Sorcs1-/-mice crossed with AD model mice (here, APP/PSEN1 mice) might manifest overt diabetes if stressed by the accumulation of cerebral amyloid. Previous studies show that the combination of a genetic proamyloidogenic phenotype and potentially diabetogenic phenotype (induced by either drug, diet, or genetic manipulations) can lead to exacerbation of either the proamyloidogenic component of the phenotype, the prodiabetogenic component of the phenotype, or exacerbation of both components of the phenotype [8, 18, 20, 38, 46, 51, 52, 66] .\nHere we report characterization of the memory, glucose homeostasis and A\u03b2 pathology in male and female wildtype, Sorcs1 -/-, APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-mice crossed with APP/PSEN1 mice. Unexpectedly, there was a trend for gene targeting of Sorcs1-/-to mitigate, not exacerbate, the metabolic, behavioral, and cerebral amyloid angiopathic pathologies."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Animals", "text": "Male and Female C57BL/6J wild-type (WT; n = 5-14/ group), Sorcs1 -/-(n = 10-16/group), APP Swe x PSEN1-\u0394exon9 (APP/PSEN1; n = 5-11/group respectively) and Sorcs1 -/-x APP Swe x PSEN1 \u0394exon9 (Sorcs1 -/-x APP/ PSEN1; n = 5-9/group) were bred in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Vivarium.

Young male and female WT, Sorcs1 -/-, APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice had similar levels of fasting glucose and insulin (Additional file 1: Figure Figure S1g ,p). However, male Sorcs1 -/-mice were shorter in length than APP/PSEN1 mice and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice had reduced lean mass as compared to WT mice (Additional file 1: Figure S1h ,o). Crossing Sorcs1 -/-with APP/PSEN1 mice did not promote the onset of any metabolic phenotype in either female nor male mice.\nWhen behavior was assessed in Y-maze, both male and female young Sorcs1 -/-, APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice all had worse SA memory performance than WT mice, with only Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 reaching significance in the females and Sorcs1 -/-in the males (Fig. 1a-b) . Memory was also assessed in the novel object recognition (NOR) test, both male and female WT mice had intact memory whereas male and female Sorcs1 -/-, APP/PSEN1, and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice were all impaired and to a comparable degree (Fig. 1c-d) .\nIn order to determine whether cohorts in this study were susceptible to the induction of metabolic dysregulation by high fat feeding, a commonly used metabolic stressor to unveil a metabolic phenotype, all mice were placed on a 60 % high fat diet (HFD) for 4 weeks. All female mice were resistant to diet-induced perturbations in glucose homeostasis ( Fig. 2a) with no genotypedependent differences in fasting plasma metabolic parameters detected at 7 mo of age, consistent with the notion that female sex is protective against a metabolic phenotype (Fig. 2d-e, h-I,l) . After 4 weeks of HFD feeding, differences in body weight observed on regular chow were no longer statistically significant (Fig. 2m ). As noted above for regular chow feeding, female\nSorcs1 -/-mice on HFD continued to have less lean mass than WT or APP/PSEN1 mice (Fig. 2p) . While all mice gained a significant amount of fat mass on HFD, body composition analysis revealed no differences among cohorts (Fig. 2q) .\nAfter 4 weeks on HFD and in comparison to WT mice at baseline (4-5 mo of age), male APP/PSEN1, Sorcs1 -/-, and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice displayed impaired glucose tolerance (Fig. 2b) and APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice impaired insulin sensitivity (Fig. 2c) . Unexpectedly, APP/PSEN1 male had worse glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity than Sorcs1 -/-x APP/ PSEN1 mice (Fig. 2b-c) . Insulin sensitivity was also worse in APP/PSEN1 mice than in Sorcs1 -/-mice (Fig. 2c) . This was also reflected in higher levels of fasting plasma insulin in male APP/PSEN1 mice compared to all other groups (Fig. 2f ) . All other metabolic parameters were unaltered (Fig. 2g , j-k, n) as was body weight (Fig. 2o ) and lean mass (Fig. 2r) .

During this extension of HDF feeding, abnormalities in glucose homeostasis emerged in females cohorts. Both female APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice displayed impaired glucose tolerance (Fig. 3a) , and APP/PSEN1 mice displayed impaired insulin sensitivity (Fig. 3b) . The metabolic phenotype was more severe in female APP/ PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice than in female Sorcs1 -/-mice ( Fig. 3a-b) . After 12 weeks of HFD, fasting plasma insulin levels were elevated in all genotype groups but this elevation only reached statistical significance in female APP/PSEN1 mice (Fig. 3e) .

As observed at baseline and as mentioned above, male Sorcs1 -/-mice had poorer performance than WT mice in SA memory (Fig. 1f ) . No other groups of male mice displayed learning behavior deficits that reached statistical significance. After 12 weeks of HFD feeding, mice were sacrificed to determine whether Sorcs1 deficiency exacerbated brain A\u03b2 accumulation.

Similarly, no differences in A\u03b2 plaque load were detected between the two genotypes (Fig. 4y) . Notably, females had much higher levels of insoluble A\u03b2 in the formic acid fraction than males.\nAs expected due to the absence of human A\u03b2, no plaques were observed in either male or female WT and Sorcs1 -/-mice (data not shown). Interestingly, A\u03b2 was deposited as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in large and small blood vessels within the brains of male and female APP/PSEN1 mice as well as Sorcs1 -/-x APP/ PSEN1 mice (Fig. 5) . Quantification of CAA is challenging at best, but, at the qualitative level, male and female Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice appeared to have less vascular A\u03b2 than APP/PSEN1 mice and when present was confined to large vessels (Fig. 5 ). Microhemorrhages were also detectable within the brains of all cohorts (Fig. 6 ). As observed with the CAA, the brains of both male and female APP/ PSEN1 mice appeared to display more cerebral microhemorrhages than WT mice, and the brain microhemorrhage count was less in Sorcs1 -/-X APP/PSEN1 mice than in APP/PSEN1 mice.

In order to test this hypothesis, we assessed longitudinal aging-related memory behavior, glucose homeostasis, and A\u03b2 pathology in both male and female WT, Sorcs1 -/-, APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-mice crossed with APP/PSEN1 mice.\nIn the present study we demonstrate that when young, both male and female Sorcs1 -/-, APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice display normal glucose homeostasis. This fits with previous studies that have shown that young APP/PSEN1 mice have similar glucose tolerance to WT mice when fed a standard diet [17] . At this age, crossing Sorcs1 -/-mice with APP/PSEN1 did not precipitate earlier onset of metabolic dysfunction in either males or females. Interestingly, young female Sorcs1 -/-displayed lower body weight, shorter body length and reduced lean mass when compared to WT mice. Female Sorcs1 -/-mice were also shorter in length than APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 had reduced lean mass compared to WT mice. This is the first study to report such difference and the cause is unknown. Lean mass is important for insulin action and metabolic control in that it has salutary effects. If two mouse models have the same metabolic flexibility but one has a higher lean mass, one can argue that the beneficial effects of higher lean mass could offset disturbances in metabolic flexibility.\nWhen behavior was assessed in the Y-maze, the Sorcs1 -/-mice X APP/PSEN1 cross was associated with significantly impaired learning behavior in the females and trend for worse performance in Sorcs1 -/-and APP/PSEN1 mice, although this did not reach statistical significance. In males, all cohorts had a worse performance in the Y-maze than WT mice but only Sorcs1 -/-were significantly impaired. When behavior was re-assessed in the females, cohorts were no longer significantly different, the reason for this appears to be the worsening of memory in the WT group, the reason for this is unknown but could possibly due to the high fat diet, or age related decline, rather any change in the other cohorts which were already poor. In the male cohort, the Sorcs1 -/-mice continue to be impaired when compared to WT mice. When NOR was assessed, both male and female WT mice displayed intact learning behavior whereas male and female mice of Sorcs1 -/-, APP/ PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 genotypes were all impaired. This is the first study to demonstrate learning deficits in Sorcs1 -/-or Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice. Unexpectedly in the present study both male and female APP/PSEN1 mice and Sorcs1 -/-mice displayed very early onset learning behavior deficits in NOR. For this reason, the NOR test was not repeated at later time points. Overall, the behavioral data for the Y-maze and NOR for both genders trend in the same direction for the most part. We cannot discount that lack of significance between some groups may be due to lack of power or sensitivity of these tests at the time points tested. Additional studies are required to dissect the temporal onset of NOR deficits in the Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice and any potential sex differences in Y-maze.\nIn order to deliver a metabolic stress to unveil a metabolic phenotype, APP/PSEN1 mice have previously been placed on either a high fat diet or crossed with transgenic models of obesity and/or diabetes. When we placed mice on a 60 % HFD, we found that male APP/PSEN1, display evidence of transient elevated fasted plasma insulin as well as both glucose intolerance and insulin insensitivity. During the development of T2D, \u03b2-cells initially compensate for insulin resistance by increasing the amount of insulin in circulation. This is consistent with previous studies where APP/PSEN1 mice have increased fasted insulin, develop glucose intolerance and become less insulin sensitive when placed on a HFD [9, 35, 52, 70] . These results demonstrate that APP/PSEN1 mice are susceptible to metabolic impairment on a HFD, consistent with a predisposition for the development of diabetes. Male Sorcs1 -/-and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 displayed impaired glucose tolerance when compared to WT mice. Unexpectedly, metabolic abnormalities in male Sorcs1 -/-mice were not exacerbated when crossing this line with the APP/ PSEN1 mouse. Indeed, there was a clear trend for Sorcs1 deficiency to mitigate APP/PSEN1 phenotypes. In general, the metabolic phenotype in the Sorcs1 -/-line was much milder than expected, especially when compared to the APP/PSEN1 line.\nThe female mice in the present study were resistant to metabolic abnormalities when placed on the diet for only 4 weeks. It is well known that female mice are resistant to metabolic effects of a high fat diet, which may account for their delayed onset of metabolic dysfunction when compared to males here. Petterson et al. [44] showed that in response to a high fat diet, plain C57Bl/6 male but not female mice developed hyperinsulinemia, hypotrophic islets, low grade systemic inflammation and an increased macrophage population in their intraabdominal adipose tissue. In contrast, female mice had an elevated anti-inflammatory regulatory T cell population in their adipose tissue [44] . In the present study, after 12 weeks of HFD, female APP/PSEN1 mice displayed metabolic abnormalities and increased fasted plasma insulin levels. Both female APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/ PSEN1 mice had impaired glucose tolerance and APP/ Fig. 6 APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice display micro-hemorrhages within the brain. Perl's blue positive micro-hemorrhages were seen within the brains of cohorts of all male and female WT, Sorcs1 -/-, APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 (n = 2-4/group) when assessed via immunohistochemisty. P > 0.05, Student's t-tests. Data expressed as mean \u00b1 s.e.m. Scale bar = 200 \u03bcm PSEN1 mice had impaired insulin sensitivity. Unlike males, the female Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 had significantly worse glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity than female Sorcs1 -/-mice. The lack of deficit in glucose tolerance in males between Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 and Sorcs1 -/-is most likely due to the latter showing a significant deficit less visible in the females.\nWhile APP/PSEN1 overexpression facilitated glucose dysregulation, despite differences in glucose metabolism seen between Sorcs1 -/-and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 after 12 weeks of HFD, unexpectedly, Sorcs1 -/-crossed onto APP/PSEN1 mice did not modulate brain A\u03b2 levels or oligomer levels beyond the changes already induced by the APP and PSEN1 mutations. The unexpected lack of worsening of pathology in the Sorcs1 -/-x APP/ PSEN1 mice may indicate that A\u03b2 deposition may be the cause rather than the effect of alterations in glucose metabolic observed. In support of this formulation, we have previously described the appearance of metabolic inflexibility in APP/PSEN1 mice following high fat feeding (Ruiz et al., in press [56] ). In the present study, A\u03b2 levels were measured from whole forebrain extracts; therefore, we cannot exclude possible subtle changes in regional A\u03b2 levels relevant to memory behavior (such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex) and/or regulation of energy balance (the hypothalamus). Future studies would need to pick apart regional A\u03b2 response and hypothalamic insulin signaling in Sorcs1 -/-and Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice. We cannot also exclude potential subtle changes in endogenous murine A\u03b2 levels as have previously shown that female Sorcs1 -/-mice have elevated endogenous murine levels compared to WT mice [29] . Previously, Reitz et al. [53] reported that genetic variants in SORCS1 are associated with increased risk of AD and that over-expression of SorCS1 reduces A\u03b2 levels and \u03b3-secretase activity, whereas suppression of SorCS1 increases A\u03b2 levels and APP processing by \u03b3-secretase activity. Unexpectedly, however, ablation of Sorcs1 in the present study impacted memory without affecting production/accumulation of whole brain levels of A\u03b2. Although we can't discount subtle altered levels of endogenous murine A\u03b2 in Sorcs1 -/-mice as we have previously reported [29] nor changes in regional A\u03b2 as discussed above, there may be other more generalized effects that SORCS1 may have on memory and neurodegeneration. Prominent neuronal expression of the Vps10p-domain sorting receptor family, of which SORCS1 is a member, has resulted in recent data supporting their role in neuronal activity, plasticity related processes and neurogenesis [53] . Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated links between SNPs in SORCS1 and cognition. Printy et al. [49] assessed atrophy profiles against genetic markers in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, finding associations of cerebral atrophy with SNPs on APP but also ventricular enlargement with SNPs on SORCS1. Reitz et al. [53] also assessed the impact of genetic variation in SORCS1 and memory retention and found three SNPS were associated with memory retention.\nStudies in other systems examining the relationship between AD pathology and diabetes have yielded variable results. One study revealed no association of the two pathologies [16] . In another study, cerebral amyloidosis was only exacerbated in diabetics carrying the APOE \u03b54 allele [43] , while in another, the result was that AD pathology was reduced among diabetics [7] . Interestingly, one of these studies also showed that the combined effects of carrying the \u03b54 allele and being diabetic increased the risk for a dementia that was clinically classified as vascular dementia [43] . Previous studies have also shown an association between both diabetes and vascular dementia [27, 30, 42] . More recently, Arvanitakis et al. [3] found that diabetes was associated with increased risk of brain infarction but not AD pathology in older individuals. At a recent workshop on AD and T2D at the US National Institutes of Health, the consensus was that the clinical cognitive decline in diabetics was probably more attributable to vascular dementia (Stoeckel, Gandy, and Arvanitakis, manuscript in preparation).\nIn the present study we assessed vascular A\u03b2, finding A\u03b2 in blood vessels within the brains of both male and female APP/PSEN1 mice as well as Sorcs1 -/-x APP/ PSEN1 mice. Qualitative assessment revealed that both male and female APP/PSEN1 mice displayed abundant deposits of A\u03b2 in both large and small caliber vessels. Female Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice appeared to have less vascular A\u03b2 than APP/PSEN1 mice and, when present, CAA was restricted to large caliber vessels. Male Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 appeared to display relatively less vascular A\u03b2, and, again when present was restricted to large vessels. It is possible that reduced CAA could be a marker of altered A\u03b2 trafficking and/or clearance, which should be an area of interest in future study. We also assessed microhemorrhages, and bleeds were detected in all mice assessed after HFD. Microhemorrhage in the WT mice is consistent with increased risk of hemorrhagic strokes associated with poor diet and obesity [45] . Both male and female APP/PSEN1 mice tended toward greater numbers of bleeds than WT mice. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that APP/PSEN1 mice are prone to vascular alterations, which are exacerbated on a HFD [52] . Both male and female Sorcs1 -/-mice revealed more bleeds than WT mice.\nThe extent to which dementia in humans is due to AD rather than to vascular dementia is an area of great interest, and the pathology of dementia in T2D is usually mixed [1, 43] . Human studies have yielded a range of results, with some, but not all, linking cerebral amyloidosis to insulin resistance [68] . Mouse models have been similarly variable. When APP mice are crossed with the leptin-deficient ob/ob model they showed no change in A\u03b2 burden, however both amyloid angiopathy and angiitis were increased together with exacerbated cognitive dysfunction [66] , while in contrast when Tg2576 mice are crossed with Irs2-/-insulin resistant mice show reduced A\u03b2 pathology and cognitive improvement [24] . Recently, Ramos-Rodriguez et al. [51] crossed APP/ PSEN1 mice with the with the morbidly obese and diabetic db/db model, finding fewer plaques, a shift in soluble/insoluble pool of A\u03b2, increased microglia activation and increased hemorrhage burden in the crossed mice. Niedowicz et al. [38] also crossed APP/PSEN1 mice with db/db mice, finding that the crossed mice displayed extreme obesity, diabetes and parenchymal A\u03b2 deposition with strikingly severe cerebrovascular pathology of aneurysms and small strokes. As with the present study, the crossed mice in the Niedowicz study did not develop elevated levels of A\u03b2 deposition. The crossed mice had more impairment in learning behavior in the Morris water maze than db/db or APP/PSEN1 alone. Neither the crosses of Ramos-Rodriguez [51] nor those of Niedowics [38] predicted the results that we observed wherein the diabetogenic mutant mitigated the phenotype of the AD model.\nPrevious studies in diabetic models have documented increased angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, consisting of immature, unstable blood vessels leading to increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier [32, 38, 47, 48] . In the present study, we found evidence of both vascular A\u03b2 and microhemorrhages, however, Sorcs1 -/-x APP/ PSEN1 mice did not display an exacerbated phenotype; if anything, there was a trend toward reduced vascular A\u03b2 and hemorrhage load in the Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice when compared with the APP/PSEN1 mice. Similarly, a recent study in which diabetes was induced in APP/PSEN1 mice using streptozotocin treatment documented reduced amyloid angiopathy when compared to sham controls. This was associated with a slight reduction in plaque load and increased microglial activation [50] . In the case of the genes and models that we have studied, we tentatively conclude that metabolic abnormalities in female Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice are not linked to changes in A\u03b2 metabolism nor in brain bleeds; however, further detailed quantitative investigation of the vasculature in this model would be required to establish this proposed conclusion. The role of inflammation in the Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice also requires further investigation.\nIn accordance with the present study, Kebede et al. [23] assessed the metabolic profile of female Sorcs1 -/-mice over time, finding that without intervention they do not develop diabetes. Glucose intolerance was apparent in Sorcs1 -/-mice tested at 20 weeks of age. As with the present study, no mutation-related differences in fasted plasma insulin were observed up to 18 weeks. No abnormality in insulin sensitivity was detected at 12 weeks. The authors went on to place the Sorcs1 -/-mice on a HFD, and, while they saw trends toward elevated glucose levels in response to a GTT, the trends were not significant. When Kebede et al. [23] crossed the female Sorcs1 -/-mice with the leptin-deficient model of obesity (ob/ob), the crossed mice went on to develop diabetes, with elevated levels of fasting glucose and insulin as well as impaired glucose tolerance and sensitivity. On top of a diabetic phenotype, Sorcs1 deficiency in the ob/ob model lead to severe depletion of insulin granules in pancreatic \u03b2-cells, leading the authors to suggest that Sorcs1 is involved in vesicular trafficking and possibly biogenesis of insulin granules. As with the present study, the metabolic phenotype of Sorcs1 -/-mice as characterized by Kebede et al. [23] required genetic or diet-induced obesity to be triggered. Therefore, as with the unexpectedly mild metabolic and amyloidosis phenotypes of Sorcs1 -/-x APP/PSEN1 mice as opposed to the exacerbated phenotypes of other combined diabetic/cerebral amyloidotic mouse models, the APP/PSEN1 transgenes were apparently less stressful to beta cells and/or insulin action when compared to the metabolic stress induced by db/db. Previous studies show that the combination of a genetic proamyloidogenic phenotype and potentially diabetogenic phenotype (induced by either drug, diet, or genetic manipulations) can lead to exacerbation of either the proamyloidogenic component of the phenotype, the prodiabetogenic component of the phenotype, or exacerbation of both components of the phenotype [8, 18, 20, 38, 46, 51, 52, 66] . Unexpectedly, not only did the two genetic lesions not exacerbate each other in the present study, the Sorcs1 deficiency tended to partially correct the diabetogenic phenotype of the APP/PSEN1 mice. It is worth noting that \"bidirectional exacerbation\" is not universally observed, since Murakami et al. [37] reported that insulin receptor mutation-induced insulin resistance failed to exacerbate an Alzheimer's-like phenotype in mice. Thus, while our experience is in the minority, our observations of no bidirectional exacerbation are not singular.\nKebede et al. [23] have demonstrated that stressing Sorcs1-/-mice by crossing with db/db is required to reveal the islet failure phenotype. The formulation for the basis of that model is that missorting and misprocessing of insulin constitutes the underlying pathogenesis. Our data would suggest that the APP/PSEN1 proamyloidogenic phenotype is not sufficiently metabolically stressful to cause islet failure. This is our qualitative explanation for the non-exacerbation of the metabolic phenotype. Our formulation for the mechanism by which Sorcs1-/-modulates A\u03b2 generation involves retromer dysfunction and promotion of generation of the pool of A\u03b2 that arises from wildtype APP. For wildtype APP, 75 % of secreted A\u03b2 is generated by endosomes and 25 % is generated in the trans Golgi network (TGN). However, when the substrate is Swedish mutant APP (i.e., APPKM670/671NL), the compartmental stoichiometry is altered, such that 75 % of secreted A\u03b2 derived from Swedish APP is generated in the TGN and only 25 % is generated in the endosome. We would propose that Sorcs1-/-, by disrupting protein sorting in the TGNendosomal system, reduces access of TGN BACE (\u03b2-APP sorting enzyme) to Swedish APP, thereby partially reversing the proamyloidogenic phenotype."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In the present study we assessed memory, glucose homeostasis, and brain biochemistry and pathology in male and female WT, Sorcs1 -/-, APP/PSEN1, and Sorcs1 -/-X APP/PSEN1 mice. Male mice with either the APP/PSEN1 or Sorcs1 -/-genotype displayed earlier onset and persistent impairment in both glucose homeostasis and in learning behavior. Unlike prior examples in the literature, the behavioral and metabolic abnormalities in male mice were not exacerbated when the two disease model mice (Sorcs1 -/-models T2D; APP/PSEN1 models AD) were crossed. In contrast to the male Sorcs1 -/-X APP/PSEN1 mice, female Sorcs1 -/-X APP/PSEN1 mice showed later onset but worse metabolic dysfunction than Sorcs1 -/-knockout mice and worse memory than WT mice. The deletion of Sorcs1 from APP/PSEN1 mutant mice led to no obvious changes in brain levels of total or oligomeric A\u03b2 peptide. In general, unexpectedly, there was a trend for gene targeting of Sorcs1-/-to mitigate, not exacerbate, the metabolic, behavioral, and amyloid pathologies. Mixed pathology is a feature of some -perhaps most -late life dementia, raising the likelihood that compound genotypes may be required in order to approximate the pathology in mice, these results indicate that compound genotypes of highly complex diseases (such as AD plus T2D) may yield unexpected phenotypes that limit their utility."}, {"section_title": "Additional file", "text": "Additional file 1: Figure S1 .
