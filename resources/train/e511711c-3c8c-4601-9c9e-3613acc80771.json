Whereas other types of affordable housing programs such as public housing have experienced disinvestment and a steep decline in political support over the last half a century, LIHTC remains a popular program because of its structure as a public-private partnership. This satisfies a more progressive agenda of providing affordable homes, while also minimizing direct federal investment and oversight by providing incentives to the private market. Rather than directly subsidizing the rents of tenants, the LIHTC program provides tax credits to developers to lower their construction costs and in return, a certain percentage of the units within the development must be rented as affordable at 60 to 80 percent of area median income (AMI). At first glance, this program seems resoundingly successful as it reliably generates new affordable housing units. However, little research has been done on the impact of these LIHTC developments on the neighborhoods in which they are built, or on the residents of these neighborhoods. The majority of LIHTC properties are built in low-income neighborhoods. This is not only motivated by developers opting to build in areas where land costs will be lower, but because the LIHTC program actually incentivizes construction in areas defined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as Qualified Census Tracts, which are census tracts where 50% of residents have incomes that are less than 60% of Area Median Income (AMI). While the program was formulated ostensibly to better the lives of low-income Americans, it does not address those low-income residents already living in the neighborhoods earmarked for LIHTC development. The LIHTC program is effective at building affordable housing, but it is also a costly program. A study by the State of Washington found that LIHTC projects often take twice as long to execute compared to market rate projects due to their complexity (Mitchell et al, 2009) which leads to higher legal and administrative cost. Despite its success as an affordable housing generator, it's important to analyze the impact of the program not just for residents within the four walls of the development, but those in the surrounding community who have little control over the changing landscape of their neighborhood. Lance Freeman (2016) makes the point that gentrification does not happen organically: \"often lurking behind the \"invisible hand\" are activists and policymakers who wish to nudge the market to produce certain outcomes.\" This paper takes on this important question of how the construction of LIHTC housing impacts neighborhoods and seeks to understand whether the LIHTC program's mechanisms lead to gentrification. Gentrification is a term that people often use in a negative, or even ominous way. The common narrative is that gentrification leads to higher housing prices, and an influx of higher income residents, thus pushing the existing residents out of the neighborhood due to an increase in rent, or an unmanageable increase in property taxes. There is also a narrative that gentrification is a positive force that provides more benefit than harm. An influx in high income residents entices new businesses into the neighborhood, strengthens the tax base and eliminates blight. While there have been some studies on LIHTC's impact on factors directly related to gentrification, such as housing prices and education or income levels (Field, 2018), only one existing study looks at LIHTC's impact on gentrification (Jaskolka, 2015), which uses household income as a proxy for gentrification. Recognizing that gentrification is a phenomenon that encompasses a more complex set of neighborhood and demographic changes, I aim to more fully capture gentrification by using a seven-factor index, using demographic and market change variables at the level of Census tract. I limit my sample to only tracts that are classified as part of a metro area using the USDA's rural-urban continuum codes, as gentrification is only expected to occur in urban areas. Looking at changes between 2010 and 2018, I will determine whether LIHTC investment leads to gentrification."}, {"section_title": "POLICY BACKGROUND", "text": "The Low Income Housing Tax Credit was established by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to provide incentives to the private sector to build or rehabilitate low income housing. While most federal affordable housing programs are administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the LIHTC program is administered by the Internal Revenue Service (Schwartz, 2015). It is the largest subsidy for the production of low-income rental housing and supports construction or rehabilitation of about 100,000 affordable housing units each year (Fischer, 2018). There are two different types of Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, 4% credits and 9% credits. The 4% credits are allocated on a non-competitive basis for acquisition, or rehabilitation or new construction projects that have additional federal subsidies. The 9% credits are for new construction projects and are allocated on a competitive basis. Credits are issued to the state Housing Finance Agencies based on the population of the state. As of 2018, states are given either a total $3.1 million, or $2.70 per capita, whichever is the larger amount of the two (Tax Policy Center, 2018). The state Housing Finance Agencies develop their Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP), which details the requirements for developments that receive the tax credits and provides incentives for developments that achieve a certain state-held objective such as energy efficiency measures, minimum cost per unit, or a certain level of affordability. The program mandates that developers either make 20% of units affordable to people with 50% of AMI, or 40% of the units affordable at 60% or AMI, but states can incentivize lower AMI levels or more affordable units. Because the project is competitive, developers often offer more than the minimum affordability requirements. Developers who are interested in receiving tax credits submit a proposal to the HFAs, which are scored based on their compliance to the QAP. The projects that are selected receive the credits. Because developers typically need capital, rather than tax credits, the developers find investors who are willing to purchase the credits. Most investors in LIHTC projects are financial institutions, or corporations that have a large enough income tax liability to fully use the tax credits (Tax Policy Center, 2018). For-profit developers conduct the majority of LIHTC development, but mission-driven nonprofit developers also participate in the program. While successful, the LIHTC program has recognized flaws. The program requires a high level of subsidy, large enough that profit-driven developers determine that they can afford to offer some units at lower rates. Additionally, there are many middlemen who are a part of putting together LIHTC deals, who require payment. In short, the program has some areas of inefficiency. Even when projects are successful, they do not remain affordable forever. The intention of the program is that all properties maintain their affordability restrictions for 30 years, meaning that after this time they can raise all rents to market rate. There is even a loophole called a \"qualified contract\" that allows owners to get out of the affordability requirement after a mere 15 years. Legislation was introduced June 2019 to close this loophole so all properties must remain affordable for at least 30 years. Some states, such as California, have extended this affordability requirement to 50 years for properties within the state."}, {"section_title": "LITERATURE REVIEW", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Gentrification", "text": "Although gentrification may seem like a contemporary phenomenon, the term was actually coined by a British sociologist in 1963 to describe the phenomenon in London as middle, and upper-middle class people (the gentry) moved in and refurbished previously working-class homes (Glass 1964). The concept of gentrification has however become more prescient since the 1990's, as middle-and upper-class Americans began to eschew the white picket fence suburban dream for the city life. The trend has become even more significant in the 2000s, leading policymakers to become very interested in the concept of gentrification and its consequences. There is not a singular definition of gentrification, but the term is broadly defined by most as a transformation of a previously low-income area that includes an influx of higher socioeconomic status residents, and an increase in investment. (Zuk, 2015, Mcaig, 2015, Ross, 2016. As low-income areas become more desirable to higher income individuals, the median income in those neighborhoods begin to rise with the influx of new residents. Due to increased demand, and the greater purchasing power of new potential residents, the value of homes increases. In order to serve the new class of residents in the neighborhood, the area becomes more desirable for investment and thus the landscape of the neighborhood begins to change, and more amenities begin to pop up in the neighborhood. This sounds like a positive thing for all involved, but how much do the original residents of these low and moderate income (LMI) neighborhoods benefit from these changes? Activists, residents and advocates consistently identify displacement as their primary concern surrounding gentrification (Zuk, 2015). The theory being that when neighborhoods gentrify and housing costs increase, it becomes unaffordable for lower income residents who then are forced to leave their neighborhood in search for a more affordable option. Whether or not gentrification leads to displacement is a major question that researchers have tried to answer but have failed to determine definitively. Ding et al. (2015) do not find that gentrification leads vulnerable residents to move out more frequently than similar residents in non-gentrifying neighborhoods, but report that those who do move end up in areas with lower average incomes than the areas of origin. Using Medicaid data to look at poor children in gentrifying areas of New York City, Dragan et al. (2019) find that poor children in gentrifying neighborhoods are only slightly more likely to move than poor children in non-gentrifying areas. This work looks only at New York City, however, and we cannot be sure that the pressures and incentives to leave or stay in a neighborhood in New York City are identical to the landscape in a neighborhood in for example, Atlanta Georgia. McKinnish et al. 2010 Most research on gentrification identifies factors that make a neighborhood susceptible to gentrification in the first place. First, the neighborhood must be within a central city, as these are the neighborhoods experiencing the influx of new residents. The neighborhoods also must be low income to start, which is typically determined in comparison to the average incomes in the broader metro area (Mcaig, 2015, Freeman, 2005, Ding et al., 2015. Despite the ubiquity of the conversation on gentrification, this phenomenon is only occurring in a small number of cities around the country (Mcaig, 2015). The determinants of what makes a neighborhood \"gentrified\" is more up for debate. Some point to one single indicator, such as an increase in median income (Jaskolka, 2015), or an increase in college educated adults (Rigolon & N\u00e9meth, 2019, Baron, 2014, but, recognizing the nuanced nature of the subject, many others use multiple variables to make up their measure of gentrification including income, education, or neighborhood factors (Field, 2016, Ding et al., 2015, Freeman, 2005. Another aspect of gentrification that affects low income families is succession. As a neighborhood gentrifies, are new low-income families able to move in and enjoy the benefit of increased prosperity, or is that a reward only for higher income movers? Freeman (2005) found that non-poor and college-educated people are more likely to move into gentrifying neighborhoods, while those with lower incomes and lower levels of education are less likely to move into gentrifying neighborhoods. Ding et al. (2015) found that gentrifying neighborhoods in Philadelphia lost low cost units at a much faster pace than nongentrifying neighborhoods, thus making the area unattainable for new low income residents. As previously discussed, there is not sufficient evidence to prove conclusively that gentrification systematically displaces low income residents, but when studies focus on the fate of minority residents in gentrifying neighborhoods, the results from empirical investigations look quite different. Richardson et al. (2019), using the same gentrification measure utilized in the Freeman 2005 displacement, but the paper uses data from 1990-2000, which may be too early to capture some of the more significant effects of gentrification as it has ramped up over the last decade, as suggested by Baum-Snow and Hartley (2016). The authors use census data to determine that white prime-aged households were more likely to choose downtown neighborhoods starting in 2000 compared to past years."}, {"section_title": "Location of LIHTC", "text": "While there are no requirements on where LIHTC is built within a state, the state's QAP will provide points for building in \"Qualified Census Tracts,\" which are by definition low income neighborhoods. Developers who agree to build in QCT's are eligible for a \"bonus boost,\" or thirty percent more credits than developments not located in QCTs. This is a sizeable incentive for developers, which researchers have found significantly impacts where LIHTC housing is built. Casey Dawkins (2011) looks at individual LIHTC geographic data to determine whether LIHTC developments are clustering together in low income areas. The results show that LIHTC developments are likely to be clustered together in Qualified Census Tracts. The author notes that this is in conflict with the stated goal of most contemporary affordable housing programs, which is the deconcentration of poverty. Baum-Snow and Marion (2009) use regression discontinuity design to further determine causality of the QAP incentives and LIHTC placement in QCTs. They compare neighborhoods that qualify as QCTs to those that are just above the income cutoff to qualify, and find that Census tracts just above the income cutoff receive an additional six LIHTC units on average relative to tracts just below the threshold between 1994 and 1999. Ellen et al. (2018) looked at individual level data from 12 states to see where different demographics of LIHTC tenants lived, as not all LIHTC tenants are the same. The results and found that poor and minority LIHTC residents were more likely to live in lower income neighborhoods than wealthier and whiter LIHTC tenants. It's important to note that the same \"basis boost\" is provided to areas designated as \"Difficult to Develop Areas,\" which are typically higher income areas where building costs are high, and which FHFA has identified as a marker of an \"area of high opportunity.\" However, because of these higher building costs fewer developers find it feasible to access those credits. The results bring in to question the motivations of the Federal and State entities that determine the incentive structure for tax credits. If the objective of the LIHTC program is to help low income families, there should be stronger incentives to build in high opportunity areas, since evidence has shown that families living in higher income neighborhoods have better economic and health outcomes, particularly for children (Chetty et al., 2015). Although there has been some progress in recent years towards stronger incentives for construction in lower poverty neighborhoods (Fischer, 2018), more could be done to ensure that low income families reach areas of high opportunity. Studies have also looked at how LIHTC development has impacted neighborhoods, and many have noted that the impact is significantly different depending on whether the neighborhood was high or low income prior to LIHTC development. There is not a consensus in the literature as to whether LIHTC construction increases or decreases housing values. On the one hand, using both OLS and instrumental variable techniques, and data from 1990-2000, Baum-Snow and Marion (2009) find that an increase in LIHTC units in a census tract is associated with an increase in housing values in that area. The magnitude of this result was significantly higher using instrumental variables than OLS. Jaskolka 2015, on the other hand, finds no relationship between LIHTC development and housing values, although she limits her sample to central cities which could explain the different results. Looking specifically at New York City, Ellen and Schwartz (2007) find that upon completion of a LIHTC development, there is an immediate positive impact on housing prices, in comparison to housing price changes in the surrounding neighborhood. The report notes that the positive effect does diminish over time, but the price gap remains significantly higher post LIHTC than it had been at the baseline. Diamond and McQuade look at the impact of LIHTC on neighborhoods of different income quartiles. They find that LIHTC has a significant and positive effect on housing prices in the lowest income quartile tracts: within 0.1 miles of a LIHTC property, housing values increase by seven percent after the development is operational. In higher-income tracts, the impact is either negative or insignificant. This could explain the variation in findings from previous reports that have not sorted by income level of tract. Gentrification is a loaded term, that instills hope in some, and fear in others, \"Gentrification is painted alternately as a destroyer of neighborhoods or a savior of cities\" (Freeman, 2016). We cannot make a definitive determination about whether gentrification will positively or negatively affect an individual, as it is dependent on various measurable and immeasurable factors. Although there is substantial research on the impact of LIHTC in surrounding neighborhoods, the research on whether LIHTC has led to gentrification is limited and does not include a strong measure for gentrification. My work attempts to bridge this gap so that we can better understand the impact of this policy and contribute to the discussion on how the program can be improved. To form a more robust measure for gentrification, I conducted a review of existing quantitative definitions of gentrification and included the variables that appeared to contribute most significantly to the phenomenon. I began with Lance Freeman's (2005) frequently cited definition, which includes educational attainment, neighborhood reinvestment, and household income. Freeman posits that educational attainment is a superior measure than income to determine gentrification because an increase in income can be the result of \"incumbent upgrading\" rather than a flow of outsiders into a community. However, the increase in the proportion of higher SES residents in a community is the primary component of most definitions of gentrification and cannot be overlooked. Higher levels of education certainly imply increased income, but it does not confirm it. For this reason, I chose to include income as well as educational attainment. Freeman included housing price as a proxy for reinvestment. Housing price is another commonly cited measure (Field, 2016, Ding et al., 2016 that is used as a proxy for neighborhood reinvestment. However, Freeman neglects to include rental prices in his measure. In 2004, the year before his work was published, the percentage of Americans who owned homes was near the highest it had been in forty years at 69%. However, starting in 2005, that rate declined rapidly, falling six percentage points by 2017 a . Some of this decline was certainly due to the financial crises, where many were forced out of homeownership. Even before the crisis however, prices were increasing faster than wages since (Rexrode, 2018) thus making home ownership unattainable for more people. Because of the significant number of people living in rental properties, particularly in urban areas, rental price is also an indicator of reinvestment, as developers capitalize on the demand for rental properties and upgrade existing housing to be rented at higher prices. I also include an increase in white population as an indicator of gentrification. While the evidence is mixed as to whether gentrification leads to the outmigration of minority residents, it is clearer that an influx of white residents is typical in gentrifying neighborhoods (McKinnish et al., 2010, Freeman, 2005. Finally, I include the quantity of housing stock-both rental and owned as an additional indicator of reinvestment. Increased demand to live in a neighborhood incentivizes developers to produce more units of housing in that neighborhood. a Data derived from HUD Homeownership Rate table, which can be found in the Appendix"}, {"section_title": "CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESIS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "As indicated in Figure 1, the conceptual model underlying the present study, there are many factors that determine where LIHTC housing will be built. Developers are incentivized by both government incentives/policies, and market factors. In terms of government policies, at the Low Income Housing Tax Credits do not cover anywhere near the full cost of development and maintenance of a multifamily development. This is why market factors remain incredibly important in the minds of developers when they are choosing where to build their property. Like with any product, demand is a major factor. If there is no demand for this type of property, it doesn't make financial sense to build it and allow it to remain vacant. Developers look to build in areas where demand is high. Also, availability and cost of land is obviously an essential component. Developers need to find an available lot to develop their property, and the cost needs to be low enough to make the project feasible. Finally, neighborhood amenities are considered when determining LIHTC location. This plays into demand as well. LIHTC developers want their properties to be in areas with amenities so that tenants will desire to leave in their building."}, {"section_title": "Determinants of where LIHTC is Built", "text": "Consequences of LIHTC subtracted the original variable from the year of the survey to get the age of the property at the time of the survey. For example, if median year housing was built in a tract was 1987 in 2010, I subtracted 2010 from 1987 to find the median age of housing stock. I then did the same in 2018, and then converted it to a percent change like the other variables. Tables 1 and 2 present means and standard deviations for all variables included in this analysis for 2010 and 2018, respectively. As shown, median housing prices increase from 2010 to 2018, which is expected, considering inflation and the general trend of increasing housing costs in the US. The median number of white people living in metropolitan areas increases by over 200 people per tract, which illustrates the \"return to the city\" trend that has been occurring over the last 20 years. Another interesting observation is that over the nine-year period included in this study, the median age of housing stock only increased 1.6 years. This suggests that there has been significant new construction in urban areas that has been lowering the median age of housing stock. As expected, the number of people with a bachelor's degree or higher increases by 2018. Increasing numbers of people with bachelor's degrees or higher is a national trend, that is particularly significant in urban areas."}, {"section_title": "Data Limitations", "text": "Because I am using a 5-year estimates, which is an average of five years of data, the amount of change observed may be smaller than if data from 2010 and 2018 exclusively was used.

To capture the degree of gentrification over time, I divided the continuous gentrification index into tertiles. The bottom one-third of results are considered \"low\" gentrification, the mid third are \"medium\" gentrification, and the top third are considered \"high.\" Next, I cross-classified this measure by each of my independent variables measured in 2010. This shows how areas that would ultimately gentrify, looked at the baseline of 2010. As shown in Table 3, the median household income in areas that would go on to experience high levels of gentrification is $43,861 compared to $43,870 in low areas, and $49,353 in moderate areas. This aligns with the standard definition of gentrification, which requires the areas to be low income prior to gentrification. Tracts that experienced low and high gentrification both had median household incomes significantly below the real median income in 2010 of $49,445. Rental and housing prices do not follow the same pattern. The tracts that are expected to have high levels of gentrification have the highest rents at $844/month compared to $840/month in moderate, and $713/month in low anticipated gentrification tracts. Housing prices are the highest in the moderately gentrified tracts at $231,439, with high gentrification tracts close behind at $225, 463 and tracts expected to experience low gentrification with $194,880. This could be because rental units are contracted more frequently so the price can respond more quickly to market forces in the neighborhood. In 2010, the number of LIHTC properties in a tract that is expected to gentrify is already higher at 1.75 properties per tract on average than in low or moderate tracts, which have an average of 1.5 units per tract, TABLE 4 presents a portrait of Census tracts in 2018 according to the degree to which they gentrified over the period from 2010 to 2018. Here we see that in areas with the highest level of gentrification, housing is the most expensive compared to the other tracts in the sample with a mean home price of $262,474 and mean rental price of $1,063. This makes sense, as the new influx of residents apply pressure to the housing market and influence the price. We can see the influx of new residents by comparing the population differences between the two time periods. The tracts experiencing high levels of gentrification accepted the most new residents at an average of 894.5, whereas moderately gentrified tracts had an average of 322.6 and low gentrification tracts actually lost 81.7 residents on average. Specifically, we see that white residents left low gentrification tracts in favor of high gentrification tracts. In 2010, there was an average of 2997 white residents in areas expected to experience the lowest levels of gentrification. In 2018, low gentrification tracts had lost an average of 175 white residents. Moderate tracts accepted an average of 180 new white residents, and high gentrification tracts received 676 new white residents. Another significant finding is the dramatic decrease in the mean age of the housing stock in areas with high levels of gentrification. Whereas in 2010 there was little difference in the mean age of the housing stock between the three categories, in 2018 the difference is stark. In high gentrification areas housing stock has decreased in age by 22.6 years to an average of 17,9 years. Whereas the other two categories remained close to their 2010 averages. This implies that in high gentrification tracts, there has been significant new development that brought the average age of housing down. Finally, we see that all categories of tracts experienced an increase in the mean number of LIHTC properties, but highly gentrified tracts boast the most LIHTC properties with a mean of 2.2. My next step was to see how the gentrification index varied based on the level of LIHTC investment per tract. (the last year available in the LIHTC database). As shown in Table 6, this resulted in a highly statistically significant P value (<.001) and a coefficient of .13. This suggests that there is a positive relationship between the number of LIHTC units in census tract and gentrification. I then progressively added my control variables, starting with demographic factors, and then economic factors and neighborhood effects. While the effect on gentrification decreased once all the controls were in place, from .13 to .06, it remained positive, and statistically significant at the 5% level. This shows that while there are many factors associated with whether a neighborhood will gentrify, LIHTC properties do contribute to gentrification. The percent change in the number of residents aged 25-34 remained statistically significant at the 1% level in all the models it was a part of. In the model with all of the controls included, the coefficient is .35. Young adult residents appear to be a strong indicator of gentrification. Percent change in unemployment also remained significant at the 5% level, with a coefficient of -.04. The percent change in vacant housing remained marginally significant (P value <.1) with a coefficient of -.02, suggesting that gentrified areas negatively associated with vacant housing units. The age of the housing stock was statistically significant at the 1% level, with a coefficient of -.34. This is consistent with the results in Tables 3 and 4, which showed a dramatic decrease in housing age for highly gentrified tracts. Finally, the percent change in housing size contributes significantly (P value <.01) to gentrification, with a coefficient of 2.14."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION", "text": "When measuring the impact of a policy or program, it is important to understand both the intended, and the unintended consequences. My goal for this analysis was to determine whether the production of Low Income Housing Tax Credit properties contributed to gentrification of the neighborhoods in which the housing was located. The results of this analysis concluded that the number of LIHTC properties in a tract is associated with gentrification. As discussed earlier in this paper, gentrification is not inherently bad. It increases amenities and resources in neighborhoods. However, there is some evidence that it can cause displacement, and it can certainly change the character of a neighborhood so that it no longer is familiar to those who have lived there the longest. As shown in the analysis, tracts experiencing high levels of gentrification had the greatest population increase, and the greatest increase in the white population. Highly gentrified tracts also experienced the most housing construction, as seen by the 22.6-year decrease in the average age of the housing stock. Higher rental and housing prices are also shown to be a result of gentrification. All of these changes will certainly impact the experience of existing residents in the neighborhood, and the ability of lower income residents to live in these highly gentrified tracts. Because State Housing Finance Agencies are charged with writing the guidelines for LIHTC development in their state, it will be important to review what incentives are being placed on developers to build in certain locations. We can refer to the controversy over the Opportunity Zones program as a cautionary tale. The Opportunity Zone Program was implemented in 2017, with the intended purpose of generating development in \"economically distressed communities by providing tax incentives to developers\" (IRS, 2020). Each Governor was given the discretion to designate their own Opportunity Zones. However, this program has been the subject of some scrutiny as Opportunity Zone projects are being built in wealthy communities, catering towards the needs of the wealthy. For example, a luxury apartment building in Houston which boasts a \"yoga lawn,\" and pool as some of its amenities is receiving this benefit (Drucker et al, 2019). This illustrates how important it is to scrutinize where a state is incentivizing construction. While building LIHTC housing in higher income areas is generally a good thing for low income residents, considering critically what states are prioritizing for LIHTC construction, and ensuring that the wellbeing of tenants is the primary focus rather than lining the pockets of developers is important. Another question that this finding brings up is whether developers would have built in those areas without the tax credits. Developers often look for areas with lower land values, but where there is an expectation for economic growth in the near future. Since these buildings are associated with gentrification, it's possible that developers understood the trends in the area, and anticipated such changes would occur. If this is the case, developers receive quite a large tax benefit to build housing that only dedicates a small portion of its units to low income people, and potentially quickly reaps the benefits of a gentrifying community and increased market rate rents. It begs the question whether the LIHTC is the best tool for affordable housing generation, considering its immense cost."}, {"section_title": "Study Limitations", "text": "Gentrification is the process of change over time. In order to learn about the gentrification process post-recession, which is an important era in the gentrification of cities, I was limited to a rather short time period of 2010-2018, with a 5-year estimates as the proxy for each year. This may diminish the results for gentrification as the gap between the two time periods is not that large. Another limitation is the endogenous nature of gentrification. All of the variables used in the index, and as controls are related to each other which impacts the model.
