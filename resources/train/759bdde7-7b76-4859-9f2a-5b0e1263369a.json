Some positive attitudes toward learning and school experiences 29. Enjoyment of humor, play, and fantasy This list is so wide-ranging that it tends to lose its value by virtue of its comprehensiveness. In fact, most definitions of social competence are considerably more circumscribed. Typically, these definitions incorporate social skills, attainment of social goals, maintenance of interpersonal relationships, and ability to make appropriate social judgments and act accordingly (also known as social problem solving). For example, Siperstein (1992) refers to social competence as the \"marriage of social knowledge and social action\" (p. iv). Schaefer and Edgerton (1983) propose a conceptual model of academic competence, social adjustment, and psychosocial development that integrates social and emotional behavior, motivation, approaches to learning, and cognition. Reschly and Gresham (1981) suggest that social competence is comprised of both adaptive behavior (independent functioning skills, physical development, academic competencies, and language development) and social skills (interpersonal behaviors, selfrelated behaviors, and task-related behaviors). Social competence has also been examined in relation to outcomes (success in social roles), and to behavioral traits that are thought to be predictive of positive social behavior (Greenspan & Granfield, 1992 S I I In considering the issue of assessing social competencies, Chandler and Chapman (1991) question whether one should consider competencies as \"private\" and \"intrapsychic\" or as residing somewhere in the space between individuals, tasks, and contexts. Social competence, by its very nature, involves other individuals. Assessment of social competence must take into account the judgments of significant individuals in the child's social milieu. This is commonly referred to as social validity (Gresham, 1983a;. The most significant individuals in a child's life are peers, parents, and teachers, and many assessments of social competency include information from one or more of these sources. We define social competency as those skills and behaviors of a child that lead to positive social outcomes with the individuals residing in a given setting and that avoid socially unacceptable responses. Following Strayhorn and Strain (1986), we suggest three \"broad-band competencies\" as paramount for achieving social competence: 1. Kindness, cooperation, and appropriate compliance (rather than hostile and defiant behavior) 2. Appropriate extroversion, i.e., interest expressed in people and things, and active socialization rather than interactions that are withdrawn and timid 3. Pragmatic language abilities, i.e. such social aspects of communication as interpreting nonverbal cues, understanding and using humor, initiating and responding appropriately to overtures, and referential communication Assessment of social competence requires that attention be devoted to such intraindividual attributes as those listed above, as well as to contextual factors that support or influence individual competences. It is essential to focus not only on the child's actions and behaviors, but also on his/her interactions with others and the judgments of those in the child's setting who are familiar with the child and the norms of the situation."}, {"section_title": "S I", "text": "Research Describing the Importance Of Social Competence. Extensive research has taken place concerning the importance of social competence and the skills that contribute to that competence. Social skills distinguish between students in kindergarten through third grade whom teachers rate globally as high or low on adjustment (McConnell, Strain, Kerr, Stagg, Lenker, & Lambert, 1984). They are significant predictors of academic achievement, kindergarten through sixth grade (Clark, Gresham, & Elliot, 1985;Reschly, Gresham, Graham-Clay, 1984;Swartz & Walker, 1984). One study of fifth graders, using the adolescent revision of the Walker-McConnell Scale of Social Competence and School Adjustment, found teacher ratings of social skills to be the best predictor of future academic achievement, school adjustment, and delinquency in the next three year period (Walker, Stieber, & Eisert, 1991). Skills that are positively correlated with popular sociometric ratings are considered important for social competence. Among these are the ability to initiate and respond to social overtures, use peers as resources, and display appropriate affection, friendliness, sociability, leadership capabilities, moderately high self-esteem, intellectual ability, academic performance, and success experiences (Guralnick, 1986;Hartup, 1983). Overall, cooperation, communication, social participation, and validating/supporting others are identified as important predictors of peer acceptance (Oden & Asher, 1977;). In contrast, deficient social skills and behavior problems, particularly aggressive behaviors, correlate with children who are socially unpopular (Frentz, Gresham, & Elliot, 1991;Gottman, Gonso, & Rasmussen, 1975;LaGreca & Santogrossi, 1980;Oden & Asher, 1977). Specific social behaviors that are negatively related to peer acceptance include: devious, aversive reactions (Hartup, 1983;Roff, Sells, & Golden, 1972), depressed mood (Asher, 1990;Boivin, Poulin, & Vitaro, 1994), 12 I I I I withdrawal (Boivin, Poulin, & Vitaro, 1994;Rubin, Le Mare, & Lollis. 1990), and aggression and disruptedness (Boivin, Poulin, & Vitaro, 1994;Dodge, 1980;Dodge & Frame, 1982;Asher, 1990;Coie & Koeppl, 1990;Vol ling et al., 1993). Although aggression is highly associated with peer rejection, it is also found with very popular children, but is then offset by the presence of socially competent behaviors (Vo lling et al., 1993). In combination with decreased prosocial and cooperative behaviors, aggression is predictive of peer rejection (Dodge, 1983;Parkhurst & Asher, 1992;Vol ling et al., 1993). Rejected children, whether aggressive or withdrawn, differ from nonrejected peers in terms of their inability to meet peer expectations of prosocial behaviors, teacher expectations of classroom behaviors, and the frequency of reactive aggression. Lack of social skills correlates with several negative outcomes, including: increased school drop-out rates (Ullman, 1957), adolescent and adult mental health problems (Cowen et al., 1973;Rubin & Ross, 1988), juvenile delinquency (Hartup, 1983;Roff, Sells, & Golden, 1972;, and dishonorable discharge from military service (Roff, Sells, & Golden, 1972). Several studies demonstrate that conduct problems persist over time into adulthood (Strayhom & Strain, 1986). Apathy/withdrawal scores in preschool predict scores in the fourth grade (r. = .28) (Kohn, 1977). Moreover, in a four year longitudinal study attention problems and social rejection in kindergarten predicted later learning disabilities (Vaughn, 1993), whereas teacher ratings of problem behaviors in the second grade predicted negative outcomes in the fifth grade (Hymel, Rubin, Rowden, & Le Mare, p Assessment of Social Competence Page 7 1990). If labeled negatively by peers, negative interactions on the part of peers are more likely, and peers tend to overlook the positive behaviors of that child (Dodge, 1980;Hymel, Wagner, & Butler, 1990). Some correlates of peer acceptance/rejection are not directly related to behavior. These include: birth order [youngest are more popular] (Roff et al., 1972) health [poor health associated with rejection] (Roff et al., 1972) familiarity [positive relationship with acceptance] (Guralnick, 1986;Hartup, 1983;Howes, 1988;Ladd, Price, & Hart, 1990) handicapping conditions [negative relationship with acceptance] (Hartup, 1983) It is advisable to obtain information about some of these areas in considering whether the social skills demonstrated by a child will be adequate for a judgment of positive social competence by peers. For example, birth order may be significant in the acquisition of social skills and achievement because of the socializing influence of parents and siblings. Similarly, children exhibit more advanced social skills with peers who are familiar (Guralnick, 1986;Howes, 1988), and sustained contact with peers provides an important context for the development of peer interaction skills (Howes, 1988, Ladd, Price, & Hart, 1990). Several studies of social competence among children with disabilities have also been completed. Swanson and Malone (1992) conducted a meta-analysis of 39 studies that dealt with social skills and learning disabilities. They concluded that learning disabled children clearly have \"lower social acceptance than their peers without handicaps\" (p. 440). High effect sizes were found for personality problems, immaturity/inadequacy, and task-related behaviors. Poor pragmatic language skills were identified as another possible factor, but only three studies examined this area. Problems in motor coordination and physical activity were also found to correlate with peer ratings and loneliness. These"}, {"section_title": "14", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE studies defined peer ratings in terms of quality as well as quantity of social relationships (Doan & Scherman, 1987;Hartup ,1983;Hops & Finch, 1985;Page, Frey, Talbert, & Falk, 1992)."}, {"section_title": "Measuring Social Competence", "text": "Depending upon the conceptualization of social competence, assessment has been undertaken in various ways. As in so many other areas of inquiry, how the behavior is defined determines how the construct is measured (Dodge et al., 1986;Gresham & Reschly, 1987). The various methods designed to assess social competence can be organized into two categoriesdirect and indirect measures."}, {"section_title": "Direct Measures", "text": "Direct measures of social competence include instruments used to collect information through observations or interviews with children. The four main types of direct measures used to evaluate children's social competence include: naturalistic and experimental observations, hypothetical problem sets, self-rating scales, and sociometric techniques."}, {"section_title": "Observations", "text": "Some observational measures are conducted in a natural context while others are conducted within experimental situations (e.g., Stipek, Feiler, Daniels, & Milburn, 1995;Turnure & Zig ler, 1964). Naturalistic observations of children's social behaviors have been used to develop an understanding of children's peer relationships, determine appropriate goals for improving social behavior, and assess the outcome of social skills interventions (Honig & McCarron, 1988;LaGreca & Stark, 1986;Strassberg et al., 1994). Many researchers utilize naturalistic observational measurements during free play times, particularly when examining prosocial behaviors (e.g., sharing, helping, and cooperation). Aggressive behaviors and levels of play are also frequently used as observational categories. Some examples of the use of structured naturalistic observations with young children are the Bronson Social and Task Skills Profile (Bronson, 1985), Howes peer play S p S S p I p I scale for children 1-5 years (Howes & Matheson, 1992), and Howes adult scale for children less than 5 years old (Howes & Stewart, 1987). The Bronson Social and Task Skills Profile (Bronson, 1985) is based on an information processing model that emphasizes the importance of goal orientation and organizational skills. The observation categories record a \"child's use of effective strategies for choosing and reaching goals in three areas: use of time in the classroom setting, mastery task activities, and social activities with peers\" (Hauser-Cram, Bronson, & Upshur, 1993, p. 485). It has been used with children who are developmentally disabled as well as those who are typically developing. Six 10-minute observations per child are completed by a trained observer. Frequency and duration of both social and mastery variables are recorded during each observation (Hauser-Cram, Bronson, & Upshur, 1993, Bronson, 1994. Various experimental tasks have been used in observational studies including behavioral role plays and simulations, mother-child problem-solving situations, and art, puzzle and block building tasks. Behavioral role plays and simulations entail creating situations where children are asked to act out or respond to particular parameters with the investigator observing. However, Gresham (1986) cites seven simulation studies, that do not demonstrate validity. The behaviors observed in these simulations do not predict sociometric status nor do they correlate with naturalistic observations of the same behaviors. In other experimental observations, researchers observe social interaction and emotion regulation during problem-solving tasks. For example, Pianta and his colleagues observed problem-solving situations between mothers and children where the dyads work together to complete a fine motor and a verbal task (e.g., block building, naming objects in a category) during a fifteen minute period (Lothman, Pianta, & Clarson, 1990;Pianta, & Caldwell , 1990;Pianta, Erickson, Wagner, & Kreutzer, 1990;Pianta, Smith, & Reeve, 1991;Pianta & Lothman, 1994). Prior to beginning the tasks, the mother is instructed 16 p p p S S S (when the child is not present) to teach the tasks to the child and help the child to perform them correctly. Immediately after the interaction, the researcher completes 5point global ratings on the mother's supportive presence and quality of instruction, the child's reliance on the adult for help, and the child's negativity/anger, and affection. Stipek and colleagues (1995) conducted observations of an experimental situation where individual children were involved in art, puzzle, and block building tasks. Observers rated each child's level of dependency, preference for challenge, anxiety, and pride in accomplishment. To measure dependency, observers recorded the similarity of the child's art construction to that created by the adult, the child's requests for assistance or for the examiner's opinion or approval, the number of times the child looked at the adult's art work or puzzle, and whether the child waited for the adult to begin before starting the puzzle task. Preference for challenge was measured by showing children cards with increasing numbers of objects to be counted or added, and by allowing children a choice of completing a puzzle that they had previously been unable to complete (under a timed condition) or one that they had completed. A child's challenge was determined by whether s/he selected a card with a higher number of items to count or a puzzle that s/he had previously been unable to complete. Anxiety ratings were completed as each child engaged in the various tasks. Ratings for pride in accomplishment were based on whether the child smiled upon completing the puzzle or verbally drew the examiner's attention to his/her completed p11771e However, cultural differences in displays of emotion may make this rating category somewhat problematic, particularly among children for whom it may be inappropriate to draw attention to personal accomplishments. Strengths. Naturalistic observations can be repeated frequently, and when observations are performed by someone outside the social milieu, subjective bias is minimized. Observations of experimental tasks are less costly than naturalistic 17 I I I I I I observations and may be completed in a single time period. They are also useful for observing behaviors that may occur with low frequency in natural settings. Concerns. Two concerns that face observational studies are cost and interrater reliability. Even when adequate interrater reliability has been achieved at the outset, there is potential for observer drift (i.e., differences in how raters interpret behaviors over time). Training observers, completing multiple observations, and arranging the time for coding the data contribute to the high cost of this type of measure. In an experimental setting, validity is affected by the unfamiliar adult and unfamiliar situations. In addition, cultural differences .among children render some measures inappropriate for certain populations. In order to obtain valid assessments of behavior, multiple observations in multiple settings may be necessary. For example, Gibb andJacobson (1988, cited in Foster et al., 1993) found that unpopular boys utilized different entry strategies for cooperative and competitive tasks and needed to be observed on different occasions. Extended time for observations is also necessary. When examining family interaction, Patterson (1982, cited in Foster et al., 1993 found that 60-100 minutes collected over three to five sessions was the absolute minimum needed to evaluate performance. Observers generally code the frequency of behaviors when using these measures. However, it may be the quality of the behavior (e.g., the type of eye contact) rather than the frequency that is important for social competence. In addition, the presence of an observer (or video equipment) may alter the child's responses. Finally, some behaviors that influence peer relationships may only occur away from adult surveillance (Foster et al., 1993)."}, {"section_title": "Hypothetical Problem Sets", "text": "Social problem solving or hypothetical problem sets have been used in studies of social cognition. The child is presented with hypothetical dilemmas and asked to interpret a peer's intentions (attribution measures) or to generate and evaluate solutions to social a problems. These measures answer the question, \"does the child know what skill should be used and can the child make social judgments?\" Social problem solving sets do not tell how often (or whether) the child actually uses these skills. Among children with poor social ratings, Bandura (1977) makes the distinction between skill deficits, performance deficits, self-control skill deficits, and self-control performance deficits. Social problem solving sets assess only skill deficits. Presentation of the hypothetical dilemmas may be verbal, videotaped, or use enactments (e.g., with puppets). Mize and colleagues used hypothetical problem sets in studies with preschoolers. With low SES preschoolers, the friendliness of the children's initial responses during enactments with puppets were more predictive of their peer group acceptance and teachers' ratings of social competence than the children's verbal scores on the Preschool Interpersonal Problem-Solving Test (PIPS, Mize & Ladd, 1988). For the middle income preschoolers, the friendliness of their initial verbal responses with the puppets and the number of responses given during the enactment situation were the strongest predictors of their observed behavior and teacher ratings of their aggression and friendliness (Mize & Cox, 1990). In another study, Hubbard and Cillessen (1993) asked boys aged 5-7 years (4 = 220) to generate responses to hypothetical situations presented in a story format. The problems included group entry, object loss or damage, object conflict, and activity conflict. Results were coded according to use of social strategies (25 codes) and compared with sociometric classifications. Popular boys generated more strategies in the compromise/negotiate and wait/hover categories and had fewer aggressive responses than average boys. Rejected boys could also be differentiated from average boys according to their strategy use. Dodge and his colleagues have published a large body of work using hypothetical measures in examining his social-information processing model. Dodge's model outlines five steps involved in social problem-solving: encoding social cues; interpreting the cues; generating potential responses; deciding on the response and evaluating consequences; and enacting the chosen response. Variation in these processing steps shows predictable variation in behavior (and peer status) across several studies (Crick & Dodge, 1994;Dodge, 1993;Dodge & Crick, 1990;Dodge & Feldman, 1990;Lochman & Dodge, 1994). Dodge (personal communication, 1995)  Responses generated to interpersonal dilemmas are examined for the appropriateness of the responses generated (coded as aggressive, nonaggressive/inept, or competent) and the number of solutions a child is able to generate (up to ten). Children's competence in this area increases with age. Evaluation of effectiveness of solutions to interpersonal problems is investigated by presenting different solutions to children and having them tell the examiner whether they believe these are good or poor solutions to the problems and the reasons why. Dodge has found some developmental trends in this area, but they are unreliable until the third grade or later. In measuring these three areas, Dodge and colleagues used a combination of videotaped scenarios and hypothetical stories. The videotaped vignettes (fi = 24) were used to assess children's ability to attend to and encode social cues, generate a single response to hypothetical problems, and evaluate the effectiveness of the responses proposed by the administrator. The hypothetical stories ( n = 8) were used to assess hostile/benign attribution and solution generation. Children were asked why a certain situation occurred and then asked to generate as many behavioral solutions as possible (up to 10). The mean number of solutions per problem was computed. Dodge and associates : Weiss, Dodge, Bates, & Pettit, 1992) administered these social cognitive measures to young children from a variety of ethnic groups and from homes with a wide range in SES (Hollingshead four factor index ranged from 14-66 out of possible range of 8-66). In the first two cohorts (n = 309 and n = 275), children who showed \"less attention to relevant cues, greater hostile attributional biases, a tendency to generate aggressive responses to hypothetical problems, and positive evaluations of the likely outcomes of aggressing\" received one or more ratings of aggression six months later (as measured by peer and teacher reports) (Weiss et al., 1992). Concerns. The time needed for administration and scoring of children's responses to the hypothetical problem sets is not described within the various studies using these measures. While great attention was paid to balancing gender and ethnicity in Dodge's videotaped segments, little attention was paid to either of these issues in the illustrations used to accompany the hypothetical stories. Because each child is asked to \"imagine this is you,\" in the various hypothetical stories, it is important that all children can identify with the illustrations presented. Using multiple sets of illustrations is one way to address this concern. c) 1 Finally, receptive language abilities may confound the results of social cognitive measures. Reliance on verbal hypothetical situations may reduce the applicability of these procedures to some populations, for example, preschool children, individuals with poor listening comprehension or limited cognitive and language ability. Self-rating scales Self-rating scales enable children to respond to varied stimuli (typically paper and pencil questionnaires) with judgments concerning specific aspects of their development. The topics addressed within self-rating scales often focus on children's perceptions of self-concept, problems in school, sense of well-being, or school achievement. Three commonly used self-rating scales are reviewed below."}, {"section_title": "The Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance for Young", "text": "Children (Harter & Pike, 1984) is a self-rating scale that taps children's perception of their cognitive competence, physical competence, peer acceptance, and maternal acceptance. Children respond by first pointing to pictures that they believe are most like them and then indicate degree of similarity. A teacher rating scale is available that parallels the child instrument by documenting the teacher's perception of the child in the same areas. This instrument has been used in several studies (e.g., Howes & Matheson, 1992) and allows for comparison with other samples. It fills a gap in the assessment realm by rating children's judgments about themselves in specified domains. Harter (1990) reports that for children younger than age eight, cognitive and physical competence combine into one factor, and social acceptance and conduct items combine into a second factor. Young children have difficulty differentiating discrete areas of self-concept because of their limited understanding of specific concepts such as self-worth (Harter, 1990). Although this measure reports on children's judgments about self, it does not give a clear picture of how these areas may differentially influence children's self-esteem. In addition, some difficulty is reported with primary age children's understanding of the task when this Asher & Wheeler, 1985; Cassidy & Asher, 1992) is a self-rating scale consisting of sixteen questions related to children's feelings of social adequacy (e.g., \"Is it easy for you to make new friends at school?\"), loneliness (e.g., \"Do you feel alone at school?\"), and subjective estimations of peer status (e.g., \"Do the kids at school like you?\"). In addition, there are eight \"filler\" items focusing on children's hobbies and preferred activities (e.g., \"Do you like playing card games?\"). Early versions of this instrument required children to respond to a five point Liken scale. The current adaptation asks children to respond to each question with a \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"sometimes.\" Factor analysis reveals that the items load on a single factor with low to moderate correlations (.25 to .58). The LSDQ has been used in conjunction with peer sociometrics with elementary age children (kindergarten -sixth grade). The self-report of loneliness discriminated the children with low peer acceptance (i.e., those who were rejected by their peers). A subscale of three items from this instrument (\"Do you feel left out of things at school?\", \"Do you feel alone at school?\", and \"Are you lonely at school?\") obtained the same relationship with sociometric status as the full scale. Therefore, these questions might be useful in combination with other measures in the ECLS. intrinsic motivation (Gottfried, 1990), resilience (Werner, 1990), and achievement (Short, 1992). In addition, students' emotional response to school appears to affect teacher reactions and support of the student (Skinner & Belmont, 1993). Studies using the FAS suggests it is sensitive to differences in observational measures of the quality of child care and the nature of instruction (i.e., didactic, skills-based approaches vs. child centered methods) (Stipek et al., 1995;Howes, 1995). Children are asked to respond by pointing to one of five schematic drawings. The drawings include faces ranging from an extreme frown to an extreme smile, or five circles of increasing size. The average time for administration is ten minutes. One concern relates to the stimulus items which include a sketch of a teacher, who is female and the faces of children who all appear to be Caucasian. Although, Stipek and colleagues (1995) used the instrument with children of various ethnic groups reporting no difficulties, the lack of diversity represented in the faces on the instrument may be problematic. When asked to select the face that is most like them, young children should be able to identify easily with the pictures. In addition, the FAS is reported as sensitive to marked differences in teaching style (those classrooms that could not be clearly categorized as didactic/skills based or child-centered/constructivist were eliminated from the study), although there is no indication of its sensitivity to more subtle differences in and teachers often object to negative nominations because of concern about possible negative side effects, but research does not substantiate these fears. Children may also be asked to nominate peers with whom they would like to play (or take with them on a vacation, etc.) or who possess certain attributes or behaviors (e.g., \"shares a lot\", \"is mean\", \"gets angry easily\"). In peer rating scales, students are given a class roster and asked to rate from 1-5 how much they like each peer. With younger children, photographs are used, and they choose between a sad face, neutral face, and happy face for each classmate (\"don't like\", \"kinda like\", and \"like a lot\"). One peer nomination technique asks children to identify peers who fill a social role or exhibit a certain attribute. For example, a child might be asked to nominate three peers who could best be described as angry, shy, or helpful (Eisenberg et al., 1988;Vol ling et al., 1993). Some standardized measures using this format for peer evaluation include the Class Play (Bower, 1960), the revised Class Play (Masten, Morison, & Pelligrini, 1985), and the Pupil Evaluation Inventory (Pekarik, Prinz, Liebert, Weintraub, & Neale, 1976). In the Class Play procedure, children are asked to nominate peers who would best fill certain roles in a hypothetical play. Half the roles are negative, and half are positive. This approach is useful for assessing the behavioral characteristics of some children, but is not useful with children under the age of eight because of their undifferentiated social 2J Page 19 perceptions. The Class Play procedure has been used most often with children who are 9-12 years old. Young children may have difficulty differentiating social roles and skills of peers, basing their decisions on very visible negative behaviors, for example, aggression and frequent disruptions . Young children also give higher ratings to peers who do well in school. As children grow older, their social perceptions become more differentiated and they are more sensitive to interpersonal subtleties. For example, they develop increasing ability to determine peer norms, adjust to the viewpoints and communications of others, interpret interpersonal contexts, and flexibly adapt their behavior to the demands and feedback of a given situation (Bierman & Montminy, 1993). When sociometric measures are used with young children, each child is first asked to name the photographs of all of his/her classmates in order to assure recognition. Researchers have used pictorial sociometric ratings and nominations with children as young as three years of age obtaining acceptable reliabilities on the children's ratings (Howes, 1988). Howes presented children with pictures of their classmates one at a time and asked the children to place them in one of three different size bowls (large, medium, or small) to indicate how much they wanted that child as a friend. Peer ratings were computed as the average score received by each child. Re liabilities for ratings ranged from .76 for three year olds to .84 for six year olds, increasing with age in a linear fashion. Re liabilities for nominations ranged from .54 for three year olds to .77 for six year olds. The high reliabilities in this study may have been due in part to the amount of time the children spent together each day and the stability of their peer groups. Each child had been with their peer group a minimum of 8 months (range = 8-60 months). Vitaro and colleagues (Vitaro, Gagnon, & Tremblay, 1990;Vitaro, Tremblay, Gagnon, & Boivin, 1992;Vitaro, Tremblay, Gagnon, & Pelletier, 1994) used peer nomination and ratings in a group-administered situation with children as young as kindergarten employing booklets with photographs of all of the children in the class. They reported \"adequate temporal stability,\" for the children's ratings, however, actual reliabilities were not available. For peer nominations, children were asked to circle the pictures of the children nominated for each category. For the peer ratings, children were asked to place one of three stickers (happy, neutral, or sad face) beneath the photograph of every child in the class to indicate how much they liked each child. This measure had less predictive accuracy than teacher behavior ratings. Fantuzzo and colleagues (Fantuzzo, Manz, & McDermott, 1994) Cowen et al. (1973) found that, although teacher ratings of children were highly correlated with observed behaviors and problems in children, the sociometric nominations of third graders were more predictive of children who later experienced mental health problems. This suggests that sociometric nominations should be strongly considered for the ECLS beginning in third grade. Sociometric ratings can be obtained reliably from children as young as three when the peer group has been together for at least eight months (Howes, 1987). It appears that sociometric techniques will provide information that supplements, rather than supplants, teacher and parent rating instruments. Peers have access to more diverse social behavior and situations than can be assessed by teachers and parents. Gresham and Stuart (1992) contend that \"information provided by peers cannot be obtained from other sources and Unlike nominations, peer ratings lack a significant effect for gender (Wasik et al., 1993). It appears that when children rate the entire class rather than the extremes (i.e., positive and negative nominations), gender is less of a factor in judgment. When peer groups are less stable, assessment of friendship patterns by teachers may be more reliable. In Howes's study of preschoolers (1987), teacher and peer friendship nominations concurred for 78% of the possible friendship dyads; the majority of disagreements (87%) pertained to the reciprocity of the relationship (unilateral versus reciprocal friendships). Other researchers also report significant correlations between teacher and peer nominations. In addition to being more reliable, teacher nominations predict a greater proportion of the variance found in observations of interaction (Connolly & Doyle, 1981). This might argue for the addition of an item to the ECLS battery that asks teachers and parents to name the child's three best friends. This could provide an independent measure of the stability of the child's friendships. Concerns. Peer ratings with children younger than second grade require the use of photographs of every child in the class. It may be difficult to obtain ratings on children who move to new schools and such movement greatly increases the number of children who need to be consulted. The requirement of having a photograph of every child in the class means that more than the 24,000 children in the ECLS sample would be involved. Since as few as eight students per class may participate in kindergarten, data would need to be collectedas would parental permissionsfrom a very large number of students. Mobility patterns will also decrease the amount of time some children spend with the same peer group, thus reducing the reliability of this measure for the ECLS. Ostensibly these ratings are based on ongoing interaction and observation of the child over time. The discussion of indirect measures includes two main categories, instruments that focus mainly on psychopathology and problem behaviors, and instruments that include both positive and negative behaviors."}, {"section_title": "Measures of psychopathology and problem behaviors", "text": "Instruments measuring problem behaviors abound in the literature. Discussion here will be limited to two widely used instruments, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983) Peterson, 1986). Additional problem behavior instruments are described in Appendix B. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Teacher Report Form (TRF), and Youth Self-Report (YSR) (Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1988;Achenbach, 1991a;1991b) are parallel rating scales for parents, teachers, and children over the age of eleven years. Raters record problems and competencies of children and report the degree to which stated behaviors are true for the child in the previous six months. The majority of the items (n = 118) address problem behaviors and are negatively worded, e.g., \"cruel to animals\", \"overweight\", \"secretive, keeps things to self\", \"talks too much\", \"whining\" (CBCL, Achenbach & Edelbrock, 1983). A short social competency component on the CBCL asks parents to relate the activities of the child (e.g., jobs, sports, hobbies, clubs), organizations in which the child participates, and the child's close friends, and to rate the child's school performance and his/her ability to get along with others. These welldesigned instruments are very widely used in research. There is both a conceptual and empirical basis for the items. Norms are available by age and gender and the manuals present studies that demonstrate the reliability and validity of these instruments (Christenson, 1992).  (Zill, 1990, cited in Love, 1994. The BPI is used so widely that \"it can now essentially be considered a benchmark for other measures\" (Love, 1994, p. 20). Concerns. The problem behavior instruments primarily assess psychopathology and do not adequately measure skills related to a child's social competence or provide a balanced portrayal of the child. For example, many of the items on these instruments are negatively worded\"can't get along with teachers\" \"feels worthless \" (Behavior Problems Index). Since prosocial behaviors and positive social skills appear to have a mediating effect on the aggressive tendencies of children and their subsequent popularity (Dodge & Feldman, 1990;Ladd, Price, & Hart, 1990;Vol ling et al., 1993) 1) good student (\"is good in reading\", \"is a self-starter\", \"does original work\"); 2) gutsy, adaptive assertiveness (\"expresses ideas willingly\", \"is able to question rules that seem unfair or unclear to him\"); 3) rules (\"is polite and courteous\", \"is well behaved in school\" ); 4) peer sociability (\"is affectionate toward others\",\" plays enthusiastically\"); and 5) frustration tolerance (\"copes well with failure\", \"accepts criticism well\"). Due to limited psychometric information, restricted normative sample, and limited age applicability, the HRI was not explored further for the ECLS."}, {"section_title": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE", "text": "The SSRS (Gresham & Elliot, 1990)  Empathy (behaviors that show concern and respect for others' feelings and viewpoints), and Self-control (behaviors that emerge in conflict situations, such as responding appropriately to teasing, and in nonconflict situations that require taking turns and compromising). The factor structure for these subdomains is very strong at the elementary level. The factors for the parent and teacher forms include items that are sensitive to the influences of that specific environment (i.e., home or school). There is no research regarding the individual subscale predictability for school-related outcomes other than social skills. The Social Skills scale uses two types of ratingsfrequency and importance. Only the frequency ratings are used to obtain raw scores for the scales and subscales. Importance is defined for teachers as importance of each behavior for classroom success and is used in devising interventions. The teacher form includes only the cooperation, assertion, and self control subscales. (The cooperation, assertion, and responsibility subscales appear on the parent form.) Examples of items from the teacher's scale include: \"Controls temper in conflict situations with peers\", \"Responds appropriately to peer pressure\", and \"Initiates conversations with peers\". Though the SSRS does not address specific areas of communication (e.g., referential communication), it does contain many items that call upon adequate pragmatic communication, e.g., on the teacher edition: \"introduces himself', \"compromises in conflict situation\", \"says nice things about himself or herself when appropriate\", and \"invites others to join in activities\". r-S Cultural and ecological validity are important in examining the use of adaptive and social-emotional instruments (Anderson & Messick, 1976;Greenspan & Granfield, 1992;Gresham & Reschly, 1987;Swick & Hassell, 1988). Because of the differences among students and families in cultural mores, social competence instruments should ascertain the importance of a given behavior in that environment. The SSRS uses multiple raters who are familiar with the child's social context in order to assess the cultural and ecological validity of its items. Teachers and parents rate the importance of the item, as well as their perception of the frequency with which the child exhibits that behavior or trait. Parents are told that the questionnaire is designed \"to measure how often your child exhibits certain social skills and how important those skills are to your child's development. Ratings of problem behaviors are also requested.\" Teachers are given similar instructions, being told that the questionnaire is designed to measure how often a student exhibits certain social skills and how important those skills are for success in their classroom. Because the importance of an item is assumed to be constant across all children in a classroom, teachers need only be asked to complete the importance rating once, which is helpful for the ECLS. The importance ratings are not used in computing the score on the SSRS, and they are independent of the frequency ratings. Correlations between these two measures are not reported. For the ECLS, importance ratings are necessary for understanding the congruence between home and classroom priorities.  Subscales, from .01 to .57 for the Problem behaviors Subscales, and from -.37 to -.72 for the Academic Competence Scale). However, the total scale correlations were more consistent (.55 for problem behaviors, -.68 for social skills, and -.67 for academic competence). The second study focused on correlations between the SSRS Teacher form and the Child Behavior Checklist-Teacher Report Form (CBCL-TRF). Higher and more stable correlations were reported between the SSRS Problem Behavior scale and the CBCL-TRF (r = .59 .81 for related constructs). The parent forms of the CBCL and the SSRS also showed correlations among similar constructs (r =. 50 -.73 Problem Behaviors, and r = .15 .58 for social competence). The lower correlations can be attributed to method variance, i.e., to differences in how social behavior was assessed. Unlike the SSRS, both the SBA and the CBCL highlight the absence of problem behaviors rather than the presence of positive social behaviors."}, {"section_title": "The third validity study examined the relationship between the SSRS Elementary", "text": "Teacher form and the Harter Teacher Rating Scale. The Harter measures five domains of self-perception rather than social skills. Moderate to high correlations were reported, suggesting that students who are rated as well-adjusted on the Harter scale tend to have well-developed social skills, higher academic competence, and relatively fewer problem behaviors, as measured by the SSRS (r = -.44 --.66 Problem Behaviors and r = .56 -.70 Social skills). Once again, the total scale scores showed the highest correlations. Research With the SSRS. In a recent study, the SSRS was used to compare students with learning disabilities, mental impairment, and those who had never been referred (Bram lett, Smith, & Edmonds, 1994). It discriminated between handicapped and nonhandicapped, but could not differentiate group membership according to handicapping condition (i.e., learning disabled vs. mentally impaired). This finding was consistent with work of Gresham, Elliot, and Black (1987) who were able to classify subjects as mildly handicapped or nonhandicapped on the basis of the SSRS with 75% accuracy. Discrimination by the SSRS among the subgroups of mild handicapping conditions (learning disabled, behaviorally disordered, mentally impaired) did not occur. In contrast, another study did find that the SSRS discriminated between severely emotionally impaired, mildly behaviorally disordered, and nonreferred students (Stinnett, Oehler-Stinnett, & Stout, 1989). An examination of the different demographic, ethnic, and language factors that might affect social skills of preschoolers confirmed a lack of detectable differences on the basis of race and ethnicity. The only differences were those based on the parents' employment status, child's gender, and the language level of the child (Elliot, Barnard, & Gresham, 1989). In a recent investigation with a Head Start population, Fantuzzo, Manz, and McDermott (1994) used the SSRS to assess the social skills of low income African-American children. The SSRS was found to have three reliable factors: Self-control, Interpersonal Skills, and Verbal Assertion. Reliability coefficients for these factors were .91, .88, and .79. The Problem Behavior Scale showed two factors, Internalizing Problem Behaviors and Externalizing Problem Behaviors (coefficients of .88 and .77 respectively). The SSRS was used successfully by Fantuzzo and his colleagues as a measure of BEST COPY AVAtLALLL. p I convergent and divergent validity in a subsequent study of a play interaction scale (Fantuzzo, Sutton-Smith, Coyle, Manz, Canning, & Debnam, 1994). Gresham and Elliot (1988) examined the importance ratings teachers assign to the different skills on the SSRS. Skills related to academic functioning (\"classroom survival skills\") were more important to teachers than the peer-interaction items. The teachers did not vary in their ratings as a function of race (teacher or student), sex, or classification status of student (learning disabled vs. nonhandicapped). Comparisons of the SSRS with sociometric classifications indicated that popular students demonstrated more social skills and fewer problem behaviors than did the children who were classified as rejected by their peers (Stuart, Gresham, & Elliot, 1991). Behavioral differences between white and Native American preschoolers, and the importance assigned to those skills by their parents and teachers were assessed using the SSRS (Pow less & Elliot, 1993). Teachers and parents of Caucasian children rated their children as more socially skilled than did the parents and teachers of Native American children. Teachers and parents of Native American children showed a moderate agreement with one another in their ratings of the importance of social skills. The correlation between Caucasian parents and Native American parents on importance ratings was low, as was the correlation between the importance ratings of Caucasian and Native American teachers. This emphasizes the value of including importance ratings within the ECLS in order to understand the cross-cultural differences that may be present in a classroom. Developmental Changes. Overall, the social skills literature shows little relationship between social skills and age within the elementary school period. Walker and McConnell (1988)  Elliott (1990) conclude that \"there do not appear to be any strong, consistent developmental trends in the social skills as assessed by the SSRS\" (p. 120). This parallels other research and theory (Cairns, 1986;Pettit, 1992;Stuart, Gresham, & Elliot, 1991). Cairns (1986) asserts that there is a \"conservation of social pattern\" that dictates increasing resistance to change once a social pattern is established. In other words, once a child has established a pattern of interpersonal interaction, the child seeks to repeat the familiar pattern in new situations and interactions. The only research on social competence that demonstrates detectable change among elementary students according to age/grade level is in the area of social cognition discussed in direct measures (Feldman & Dodge, 1987). When students in first, third, and fifth grades were presented with three kinds of socially important situations (i.e., initiating entry into peer group, responding to teasing, and response to ambiguous provocation), the children's' ability to interpret peer's intentions and to generate, evaluate, and enact competent responses increased with age. However, interactions between gender, sociometric status, and age indicate the complexity of social informationprocessing, particularly among children with low sociometric status. In order to chart growth in individual children in the area of social competence, it may be necessary to examine the cognitive processes a child uses to determine appropriate behavior utilizing a direct measure. Concerns. Although the SSRS has many positive features, it also has several shortcomings. Specifically, we suggest the following modifications to the SSRS in response to concerns about its use in the ECLS. Length. The SSRS is one of the briefest instruments available that measures social skills: it requires approximately ten minutes to rate each child. Given the large number of children that will be sampled from each classroom in the base year of ECLS, the time burden on teachers is very important to evaluate. Therefore, as items were added to the SSRS in order to address other concerns, items were eliminated in order to keep the total"}, {"section_title": "40", "text": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE I number of items less than the original SSRS (n = 57). The global ratings of academic competence were removed, given that the teachers will rate individual performance of children in the academic areas on the Teacher Questionnaires. Because the factor structure of the SSRS is quite robust, with substantial numbers of items included in each factor, it should be possible to eliminate some items in each factor without seriously impairing the validity of the instrument. In the original SSRS, teachers complete two parallel scales: one that accounts for frequency of specific behaviors and another that evaluates the importance of those behaviors in specific classrooms. Since research with the original instrument (Gresham & Elliot, 1988) showed that teachers did not vary in their ratings as a function of race (teacher or student), sex, or classification status of student (learning disabled vs. nonhandicapped), in the interest of reducing time burden, we suggest that this information be completed once by each teacher. Accordingly, the \"how important\" ratings have been placed on a separate form so that the teacher only needs to complete this once for the entire classroom. Positive Affect and Behavior. The SSRS does not address several positive areas of functioning. Since positive is not always the opposite of negative (Wasik, Wasik, & Frank, 1993;Aber, 1995) and children who are high in both positive and negative attributes have different developmental outcomes from those that are high in negative only, we added items to address the more positive aspects of affect and behavior, e.g., \"Shows enjoyment of learning.\" \"Displays positive mood.\" Approaches to Learning. Although there are several task orientation items on the original SSRS, not all dispositions for learning are addressed, specifically those concerned with approaches to learning. Such items as \"Persists in completing tasks.\", \"Shows creativity in work and play\", and \"Shows eagerness to learn new things\" were added. I I S S S I S Response Format. Due to negative skew in scores on social skills (98% scored above 27 raw score), Gresham and Elliot used linear interpolation to assign standard scores. We believe that the truncated response format on the original scale may have contributed to this phenomenon. We changed the three point scale to a four point scale and added a \"Not Observed\" response. This may help discriminate more clearly, increase the range of scores, and alleviate the negative skew. Cultural Artifacts. The child whose temperament is slow to warm, who is a follower rather than a leader, or who is raised in a subculture that does not value child assertiveness, could be penalized by the number of items in the original scale that require initiation and self-assertion. Because assertion is associated with peer competence Van Hasse lt, Hersen, & Bellack, 1984), we did not eliminate it altogether, but did reduce its presence in the questionnaire. Moreover, many of the items in the original SSRS required substantial inference by teachers. These items were adapted to decrease the amount of interpretation required on the part of the teacher, e.g., \"Responds appropriately to peer pressure\" was changed to \"Firmly and persistently says 'No' to peer pressure to misbehave\" and \"Responds appropriately when pushed or hit by other children\" was changed to \"Firmly tells an aggressive peer to stop hurtful acts (e.g., \"Stop hitting,\" or \"No pushing\").\" The importance rating of these items, as judged by both parent and teacher, will help us to clarify potential cultural differences. Preschool. The original preschool version is a downward extension of the elementary scale. Consequently, it does not address the developmental level of preschoolers (e.g., items include \"Produces correct schoolwork\", \"Introduces himself or herself to new people without being told\", \"Appropriately questions rules that may be unfair\"). Items were adapted to reflect more accurately the activity of children at this age, e.g., \"Easily joins others in ongoing play\", \"Uses free time in a constructive way\", and \"Easily adapts to changes in routine.\" S S S S I Pragmatic Language. The SSRS contains several communication items. However, there are no items that address nonverbal communication, e.g., reading and interpreting social cues. Difficulty in the nonverbal areas of pragmatic communication is an important feature that discriminates the learning disabled and mentally impaired populations from typically developing children (Naidu & Kalyan, 1922;Weller, Strawser, & Buchanan, 1985;Straub & Roberts, 1983). Items were added to address this: \"Appropriately uses nonverbal communication (e.g., facial expressions, nods, waving...);\" \"Is sensitive to the feelings of others.\" Summary. Of all the approaches to assessing social competence reviewed above, the SSRS appears to be the most promising for use with the ECLS. It is relatively brief, inexpensive, and easy to administer. It is designed to obtain information from multiple sources (parents, teachers, and students in grade 3 and above). It has a preschool version, although there are questions about its factor structure. It focuses on prosocial behavior and social competence skills, rather than primarily on problem behaviors. The research on the SSRS supports its construct validity and its ability to discriminate between several different population groups. Overall, it is the \"most technically well-developed social skills rating system available\" (Walker et al., 1991). In response to concerns about the scope of the SSRS, it has been modified and augmented for assessing children's social skills and approaches to learning. Information from the ECLS pilot will further inform the development of this instrument."}, {"section_title": "Summary of Indirect Measures", "text": "Social competence is a multi-determined psychological construct that combines social action with social knowledge or judgment. For more than a generation researchers have proposed a range of definitions for social competence that incorporate such intraindividual characteristics as kindness, cooperation, interest expressed in people and things, and pragmatic language abilities, along with a focus on the child's interactions with others. Numerous approaches to measurement have been put forward, some of BEST COPY AVAILABLE which are highly time-intensive and complex to use. Of all the rating scales that have been devised to measure this construct, the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS), with its tripartite focus on social skills, problems, and academic competence comes the closest to meeting sound theoretical and empirical criteria.

Adaptive Behavior Definition", "text": "Adaptive behavior was originally studied in assessments of mentally impaired individuals. Recently, adaptive behavior has been examined in other populations, including those with learning disabilities ; children from divorced families (Guidubaldi & Perry, 1985); and children in foster care (Hochstadt et al., 1987;Pearson & Lachar, 1994). Deficits in adaptive behavior were noted for children in these groups when compared with nondisabled children from intact families."}, {"section_title": "The American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) defines adaptive behavior", "text": "as \"the quality of everyday performance in coping with environmental demands. . . .

It concerns the \"effectiveness with which individuals meet expected standards of personal independence and social responsibility based on age and cultural factors\" (Barnett & Zucker, 1990). AAMR has identified ten areas of adaptive behavior: communication, home living, self-care, health and safety, self-direction, community use, leisure, functional academics, work, and social skills."}, {"section_title": "Assessments", "text": "Traditionally, adaptive behavior was assessed by interviewing the individual's primary caregiver personally (Doll, 1965 Brown & Leigh, 1986) 3) Scales of Independent Behavior (SIB; Bruininks, Woodcock, Weatherman, & Hill, 1984) 4) Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS; Sparrow et al., 1984;. 5) American Association on Mental Retardation Adaptive Behavior Scales (ABS; Lambert, Nihira, & Leland, 1993 ) The ABIC is part of the System of Multicultural Pluralistic Assessment (SOMPA; Mercer, 1979). SOMPA was designed to avoid cultural bias in the assessment of adaptive behavior. Toward that end, school-related behaviors were intentionally excluded. The ABIC shows very little correlation with intellectual ability (diSibio, 1993). The ABIC was standardized solely on children from the state of California and has not been revised, thus the norms are rather dated at this time. For these reasons, it was not examined in depth. The Adaptive Behavior Inventory (ABI) has a lower age range (5.0-18.11) that is too limited for our purposes. Since the ECLS will enroll some children who enter kindergarten before the age of five, and since a Head Start cohort is included as well, a five year old basal will limit the data that can be collected as a baseline. Moreover, the ABI is a lengthy instrument and does not include a sensory or motor component. Because motor development is not assessed on measures of social skills, but has been found to correlate with popularity as well as to be important for the development of self-help skills, this is a weakness of this instrument. The information available concerning its psychometric properties is acceptable. However, the lower limit of the age range and lack of a motor component led to rejection of this instrument. The Scales of Independent Behavior have poor test-retest reliability and some lessthan-acceptable internal reliability coefficients. It also has a potentially confusing response format (Evans & Bradley-Johnson, 1988). The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (Sparrow, Balla, & Cicchetti, 1984; are available in a survey form, an expanded form, and a classroom edition. The Vineland scales are the most widely-used instrument in the field of adaptive behavior (Pearson & Lachar, 1993). The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Classroom Edition (VABS-CE; Sparrow, Balla, & Cicchetti, 1985) is standardized on children aged 3 -12.11 and is the most recent addition to the Vineland Behavior Scales. The VABS-CE has adequate psychometric properties (Harrison, 1985). However, the Classroom Edition does not present separate interrater or test-retest reliability. Unlike the other Vineland scales, the VABS-CE is administered as a questionnaire rather than in interview format. The Vineland scales are available in Spanish. It is lengthy (244 items), and Kamphaus (1987) contends that some items may be interpreted incorrectly by teachers. Many items are well below the developmental level of children in kindergarten, e.g., \"imitates sounds of adults within a few seconds of hearing them\", \"sucks or chews on crackers\", \"imitates simple adult movements, such as clapping hands or waving good-bye\", \"uses common household objects for play\". Other items would not be known to most teachers, e.g., \"makes own bed correctly\", \"sweeps, mops or vacuums floor completely, without assistance, when asked\", \"puts clean clothes away without assistance, when asked\". Thus, length and content render the Vineland Scales of questionable value for the ECLS. the highest level achieved by the child. According to the manual, the scores on the subdomains do not convert to normative scores. The items in Part Two of the scales = 37) examine more extreme maladaptive behaviors (e.g., self-abusive behaviors, inappropriate physical contact). Similar to the VABS-CE, the ABS also requires information that may not be known by the teacher in a regular education classroom (e.g., how the child cares for his/her room at home, does laundry, sets table, washes dishes). The length, content, and interview format of administration render this instrument of questionable use to the ECLS."}, {"section_title": "Summary: Adaptive Behavior", "text": "Increasingly in the study of adaptive behavior, emphasis has been placed on the social competence of the child, as this is proving to be more crucial for successful functioning in the community than is the negotiation of the physical world, or self-help skills (Greenspan & Granfield, 1992;Pearson & Lachar, 1994). Social competence had a prominent role in the initial conceptualizations of adaptive behavior but Greenspan and Granfield (1992) "}, {"section_title": "Ell. Learning Styles and Approaches to Learning", "text": "The Technical Planning Subgroup of the National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) defined \"approaches to learning\" as the \"inclinations, dispositions, or styles rather than skills that reflect the myriad ways that children become involved in learning, and develop their inclinations to pursue it. . . . Curiosity, creativity, independence, and persistence are some of the kinds of approaches that enhance early learning and development.\" These approaches are mediated by cultural, gender, and temperament differences among children. Katz (1985) defines dispositions as \"relatively enduring 'habits of mind' or characteristic ways of responding to experience across situations. Examples of dispositions include curiosity, humor, creativity, affability, and quarrelsomeness\" (p. 1). It is of interest to note the overlap between this statement about \"dispositions\" and some of the competency statements reproduced in the Anderson and Messick (1976)  The psychometrics of these instruments range from non-existent to highly questionable (Bishkin, 1992;Goldman, 1992;Hughes, 1988;Jenkins, 1992;Kiewra & McShane, 1992;Robertson & Brown, 1992;Westman, 1988;Wright, 1992). The Reading Styles Inventory has the most positive reviews, but more construct validity studies are needed (Benson, 1992;Corkhill, 1992). The research involving these instruments consists of case studies, unpublished research (much of it in dissertations), and ERIC documents (Snider, 1992). Reviews of literature on modality matching have not been supportive of this construct either (Kavale & Forness, 1987, cited in Snider, 1992Tarver & Dawson, 1978, cited in Snider, 1992). In addition, with the exception of the Reading Styles Inventory, which has a special edition for children under eight years of age, the learning style instruments are all selfreport. Problems with reliability in self-report instruments with young children are legion (Foster et al., 1993;Harter, 1990;Zimet & Farley, 1987). Gresham (1986) notes that for young children (CA <8) self-report measures have \"abysmal validity evidence \" and \"should not be used . . . until and unless more convincing data are available to support their use\" (p. 163). In short, none of the currently available learning style instruments meets the needs of the ECLS. In addition to psychometric considerations, the structure of these instruments does not correspond with the definition of \"dispositions for learning\" that has been proposed by the Resource Panel of the NEGP. In the absence of existing instrumentation, we suggest the use of adjective definers in a rating scale as an acceptable way to examine approaches to learning. Placing adjective definers regarding curiosity, humor, inventiveness, independence, persistence, and creativity at opposite ends of scales, or using them to develop specific rating scales may be a useful way to understand the personality of the child and the dispositiOns they bring to the learning process. "}, {"section_title": "IV. Conclusion", "text": "Children's social competence is strongly influenced by their first socialization experiencethe family (Cohn, Patterson, & Christopoulos, 1991;Pettit, Harrist, Bates, & Dodge, 1991). Over time, children extend their social milieu to extrafamilial settings and increase their peer competency skills, prior to their entry into public school (Howes, 1987). Thus, they enter school with social interaction patterns that are already well established and appear to be relatively resistant to change (Cairns, 1986;Pettit, 1992). Adapting to the school environment may be unproblematic for the child who is socially competent. The child who is not socially adept will require schools that respond to this need if the child is to experience success in that environment. This is especially significant in view of the fact that social skills necessary for the school environment predict the student's later achievement (Clark, Gresham, & Elliot, 1985;Reschly, Gresham, & Graham-Clay, 1984;Parker & Asher, 1987;Swartz & Walker, 1984). The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study is designed to provide research and data \"to increase our understanding of the dynamics of school achievement, particularly those factors that contribute to the differential achievement of important subgroups of the population\" (NORC, 1993, p. 2-1). Because social competence is a crucial factor in contributing to differences in achievement, any study that seeks to examine variables contributing to achievement must carefully consider the student's social skills.

As noted, the adaptive behavior area not addressed by the SSRS that was found to be significant in the research literature is motor skills. A global measure of motor development could be added to the SSRS, or the motor domains from the Vineland could be used to supplement the parent report instrument. In addition to adding other dispositions for learning to both parent and teacher questionnaires, some assessment of the social validity of these dispositions should also be administered, particularly in the home. The use of an importance ratingas is the case on the SSRS overallshould suffice for this purpose. In summary, the Social Skills Rating System, with some augmentations and adaptations, should address the relevant skills and behaviors that predict a child's social competence, adaptive behavior, and disposition for learning. The SSRS is the most psychometrically sound instrument of social skills available and clearly the most closely aligned with the goals of the ECLS. In the pilot study, the ECLS could administer the Feelings about School and hypothetical problem sets to determine if they provide sufficient additional information to warrant their inclusion in the battery of instruments.
