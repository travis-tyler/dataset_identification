[5] [6] [7] [8] In clinically normal older adults 9,10 and individuals with mild cognitive impairment, 11 higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels have been observed in female apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 carriers compared with male carriers. In a 2018 meta-analysis of multiple independent cohorts with CSF data, Hohman and colleagues 10 found greater CSF total and phosphorylated tau in female APOE \u03b54 carriers than male carriers, with findings driven by abnormal levels of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2). Sex differences in A\u03b2 burden alone have not been reported in older adults, 11-13 supporting the notion that sex differences may be more likely to appear downstream after the onset of A\u03b2 accumulation. 5, 10 To our knowledge, studies have yet to fully explore this notion, 8 with little attention paid to elucidating sex differences in regional tau deposition in the context of A\u03b2 burden and APOE \u03b54. The primary aim of this study was to determine the extent to which sex differences exist in regional in vivo tau deposition in clinically normal older adults using positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging. Specifically, we examined the influence of sex to modify the well-characterized cross-sectional association between regional tau PET and global A\u03b2 PET.\n14- 16 We also investigated the degree to which sex and APOE \u03b54 might interact to influence regional tau PET. We hypothesized that women would exhibit greater tau PET signal than men for a given level of global A\u03b2 burden and that tau PET signal would be greater in female APOE \u03b54 carriers compared with male carriers. For HABS, the time between the first tau PET scan and the closest A\u03b2 PET scan was a median (interquartile range) of 54 (14-135) days (maximum, 3.3 years). For ADNI, the interval was a median (interquartile range) of 8 (3-42) days (maximum, 4.8 years). Some participants had a duration delay of longer than a year between scans (HABS: n = 9; ADNI: n = 9 clinically normal individuals), and as such, we covaried for scan interval in our analyses.

A series of hierarchical linear regressions were conducted to examine the influence of sex on the association between tau and A\u03b2, after adjusting for age and delay between tau and A\u03b2 scans (model 1). There were some missing data for APOE genotype (n = 34 for HABS; n = 7 for ADNI), and as such, we ran separate analyses including main associations of APOE (model 2).

On models of interest, we probed the association of differing levels of A\u03b2 burden on the percentage sex differences on tau retention. As extratemporal regions were used to test for specificity in the temporal regions, we refer to these as post hoc.

To measure cognition, we used the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite, 35 which has been applied across these cohorts in previous publications. 35, 36 The baseline cognitive time point was considered within 18 months of the tau scan; for HABS this resulted in up to 5 follow-up time points and for ADNI, up to 3 follow-up time points.\nA final meta-analysis estimate was calculated for sex, sex \u00d7 A\u03b2, sex \u00d7 APOE, and sex \u00d7 A\u03b2 \u00d7 APOE on EC tau in clinically normal older adults from both HABS and ADNI using the Metafor package, version 2.0 (R Project for Statistical Computing).

We did not find a significant influence of gray matter volume on our results. Further, this association may carry some level of specificity, as other extratemporal regions did not exhibit this interactive A\u03b2-by-sex effect on tau signal. However, this interaction was dependent on PVC for the NCs from both cohorts, suggesting that partial volume adjustment facilitates detection of this association at lower levels of tau.\nMinimal, 6 if any, 11,12,36 sex differences have been found cross sectionally in levels of global A\u03b2 burden in clinically normal older adults, although some evidence suggests sex differences in A\u03b2 burden may be related to menopausal stage 6 and parental family history. 37 In the current study, we found a trend toward slightly higher median A\u03b2 values in women, similar to a 2018 study. 38 As such, subtle association with sex on A\u03b2 may be apparent at the earliest stages of disease. It is possible that a sex-modifying effect on the association between A\u03b2 and tau reflects a secondary pathway driven by sex-specific lifestyle determinants, such as cardiovascular disease or inflammation. 39 For instance, heightened inflammatory responses have been reported in women, 8 which is an important consideration given that AD may be influenced to some extent by immune system function. In addition, men show disproportionate mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease in midlife, arguably leaving older male survivors to exhibit reduced cardiovascular disease risk factors for AD"}, {"section_title": "40", "text": "; however, older women could maintain persistent cardiovascular disease risk and thus be exposed to greater vascular and AD comorbidity. The influence of sex steroid hormones also cannot be discounted as a possible mechanism, 41 although we were unable to measure these association in these predominantly older cohorts. By contrast, sex-APOE interactions were unclear, with only clinically normal ADNI female APOE \u03b54 carriers showing elevated signal in the tau meta-ROI. Epidemiologic studies show sex differences in clinical risk are largely discernable within the context of APOE \u03b54, 11, 42, 43 particularly between the ages of 65 to 75 years compared with APOE \u03b54 clinically normal male carriers. 44 Female APOE \u03b54 carriers with abnormal levels of CSF A\u03b2 also exhibit higher CSF tau than male carriers. 10 It is possible that our comparatively lower statistical power may have hampered the abil- 48 Finally, cellular models of AD tauopathy, using hyperphosphorylated tau-overexpressing P301L cells, show that treatment with progesterone and estrogen significantly recovers cellular bioenergetic function (ie, mitochondria), 49 suggesting a potential mechanism underlying female susceptibility to tauopathy in AD that may be driven by depleted progesterone/ estrogen during menopause. 50 Together, these animal and cellular models of AD support a female-specific vulnerability to AD pathophysiology. An unresolved question related to these data is that of survival bias. 8 Clinically normal men, particularly those who carry APOE \u03b54, 51 may struggle to maintain clinical health in the presence of elevated A\u03b2 and tau burden (perhaps due to vascular contributions) and thus may exhibit poorer resilience to increasing pathological burden. Clinically normal men in the ADNI group, for instance, showed lower dynamic range for A\u03b2 and lower IT tau retention compared with women. We did not have statistical power to robustly assess this issue, and so the association of survival will need to be explored with larger cohorts. Further, extricating the sex biological component from the epiphenomenon surrounding gender construct (eg, different education/occupational attainment, lifestyle) will need to be explored to determine the association of these factors."}, {"section_title": "Strengths and Limitations", "text": "A strength of this study is the replication of our findings across 2 independent studies of aging with A\u03b2 and tau PET. However, the magnitude of association was notably higher in the ADNI clinically normal group; since the ADNI clinically normal group were older than the HABS clinically normal cohort, exhibited lower memory performance, and had greater dynamic range in tau SUVrs, it is possible that the ADNI clinically normal group were further along the preclinical trajectory than the HABS clinically normal group. This is highlighted by the 10% sex difference in EC tau; although the ADNI clinically normal group hit this difference within the A\u03b2 cut-off, the HABS clinically normal cohort exhibited this difference far above their established cutoff. This may also be a function of other factors such as different dynamic range of the amyloid PET radiotracers, methodologic differences in PET processing pipelines for [\n18 F]flortaucipir, and potential unexplained and idiosyncratic components of the cohort. However, these cohorts are convenience samples and involve recruitment and sampling biases that may result in a lack of generalizability of findings. In addition, it is possible that sex-specific partial volume effects may be inherent in these data, although we found no association of gray matter volume on our findings. In an exploratory analysis, we examined whether the interaction of sex and EC tau influenced cognitive decline. Entorhinal cortex tau was chosen owing to the sex effects that were seen in the previous models. We did not find a significant interactive sex \u00d7 EC tau association with cognitive decline (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Owing to issues of power and limited follow-up neuropsychological observations post-tau scan in both cohorts, these preliminary null findings should be approached with caution. Our future work will explore these associations in more depth once we have statistical power to examine interactive associations in the context of longitudinal cognition. Finally, we predominantly focused on temporal ROIs, although we did find some preliminary evidence of main effects of sex on an extratemporal region of the brain.
