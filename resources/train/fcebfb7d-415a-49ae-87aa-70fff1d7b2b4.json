Because of this, NSF anticipates that, in the short run, U.S. R&D performance abroad will also continue to expand in absolute terms. The second consecutive real increase in industrial basic research expenditures matched the 5-percent constant-dollar increase in applied research and development. Following a decade of declining constant-dollar basic research funds, this rise was mainly the result of increases in funding by the drugs and communication equipment industries. R&D directors attributed the increase in the drugs industry to-an apparent change in R&D policy, favoring more theoretical work intended to lead to significant medical breakthroughs. Communication equipment industry personnel noted that increased funthAmental work reflected the intent to expand into new product areas. Significant increases in funds for research and development in coal, solar, :And geothermal sources of energy, and in energy conservation have occurred in the past two years. Increases ranged front 39 percent in coal, to 85 percent in geothermal. Companies continued to direct the major portion of their energY R&D funds in the areas of oil and nuclear fission, which together composed 64 percent of all industry's energy research and development. The petroleum and motor vehicles industries registered the largest R&D funding increases of major R&D performers. Both went up 19 percent. The petroleum industry's rise resulted primarily from energy-related R&D projects, particularly in oil exploration and synthetic fuels. The increase in the motor vehicles industry waS attributed by company R&D officials primarily to increases in projects designed to meet Government regulatory requirements for emission control and fuel economy. Results of a preliminary test indicated that in 1977 Aircraft and missiles firms devoted about 5 percent of their total company-funded R&D resources to noise abatement and emission control projects that would not have been undertaken in the absence of Government regulations. Of the seven top R&D-performing industries, the petroleum and machinery industries have shown the highest annual growth rates in the 5-year period, 1972-77, 14 percent and 13 percent, respectively, This is in comparison with the allindustry rate of 9 percent. tahles showing trends for key R&D funding variables.

Automotive industry personnel noted higher outlays for R&D projects to meet regulatory requirements for fuel economy and emission standards. Most industries registered R&D gains in real terms between the two years; a major exception was the drugs industry. Officials of this industry cited a change in emphasis in their R&D programs--a.move toward MOfe basic research and away from applied research or development, which is usually more costly.

This sharp rise, 5 percent in real terms, continues a general trend of realdollar increases begun in 1972. These 'gains have closely approximated the pattern of industrial sales growth during the 1971-77 period. The 1977 rise can be partially attributed to increases in company spending for energy R&D projects, and research and development pOrformed to meet GovernMent regulatory requirements, which have especially affected the motor vehicles, chemicals, and drugs industries.

Industrial R&D directors have indicated that a portion of the anticipated increase in R&D activity is attributable to protects conducted to Meet Government regulatory requirements. A test question, designed to measure this factor, obtained sufficient response from the aircraft and missiles industry to conclude that in 1977 this industry spent approximately 5 percent of its company R&D funds on activities which would not have been undertaken in the abince of Government regulations. R&D personnel in that industry also noted that this research and development was generally in the areas of aircraft emiSsions and noise control.

The rises in recent years  are primarily attributable to R&D i ncreases for defense and energy, and increased outlays for development of the space shuttle. The two Federal agencies with primary responsibility in these areas, the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), together provided more than four-fifths of the Federal total R&D support to industry ($6.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively) with the bulk of the remainder coming from DOE. Historically, over three-fourths of all Federal R&D funds to industry has gone to two industrieselectrical equipment and communication, and aircraft and missiles. These two industries perform the bulk of space and defense research and development for the Federal Government. In addition, the electrical equipment industry is the largest performer of Federal energy research and development.

Approximately 1 percent of all. R&D-performing firms, or 128 R&D-performing companies, had more than 25,000 employees during 1977. These 128 companies reported R&D expenditures of $22 billion, 73 percent of the U.S. industry total. On the other hand, companies with less than 1,000 employees, which comprised 91 percent of the number of R&Dperforming firms, reported only 5 percent of the total R&D expenditures during the year. The federally funded R&D effort was even more concentrated among large companies. Of the 128 R&D-performing,companies with more than 25,000 employees, 73 reported Federal R&D funding during 1977. These 73 companies performed 84 percent of all the federally financed research and development during the year. The four U.S. companies with the largest R&D expenditures during 1977 performed 20 percent of all industrial research and development for the year. (For perspective, note that these same four companies accounted for 9 percent of the total net sales of R&Dperforming manufacturing firms and 8 percent of their total employment during 1977.) The source of funding for their R&D activities was roughly proportional to their total share of the effort; these firms received 19 percent of all Federal R&D funds contracted to industry and performed 21 percent of all company-sponsored 'research and development duriog the year. Examination,of the R&D performance of the major companies in each industry indicates, that the large companies dominate the R&D field. Table 1 for selected industries showS the percentage of total and Federal R&D funds expended by the top 4 and top 20 companies in each industry. Note that thetop 20 companies perform virtually all the federally funded research and development in most industries. . Between 1967 and1974, the average R&D/net sales ratio tor all manutacturing industries dropped sharpk from 4,2 percent to 3.1 percent, where it remained through 1977. The aircraft and missiles industry and the electrical equipment industry, the largest industrisil performers of federal research and development, were the primary factors in this trend as a result of the federally funded portion of industrial R&D expenditures declining from 51 percent in 1967 to around 36 percent in 1974 and subsequent years. Those high technology industries that are less involved in Federal R&D programs showed slight increases in their R&D/net sAles ratios, or remained at roughly the same level throughout the 1967-77 period. A ..eflection of corporate attitudes and policies on research and development as a means of achieving company growth can be seen in the relationship between the amount of companies' own funds (excluding Ft!deral awards) spent for research and development and net sales. The company R&D/net sales ratio has remained relatively constant for more than 20 years. It has been 2.0 percent since 1972 and has never been higher than 2.2 percent since this series began in 1957. Among individual industries, the ratio of company R&D/net sales has also tended to be relatively constant over time, although the size of each ratio is largely dependent upon the degree of R&D intensity of a particular industry. For example, corm._ panies in highly competitive, technical industries such as office, computing and accounting machines, and professional and scientific instrumentsmust invest a large portion of their budgets in research and development to help ensure future sales in areas where technology is changing rapidly; thus their ,company R&D/net sales ratios are high (9.4 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively, in 1977). On the other hand, company research and development in an industry such as petroleum refining and extraction, while extremely important in this age of energy concern, is relatively small when compared to the volume of sales made by the industry. The company R&D funds/net sales ratio in the petroleum industry was 0.6 percent in 1977. (The ratio for the petroleum industry does not contain expenditures for exploration for new sources of fuel.) The total R&D fundsinet sales ratio tends to be more changeable than the company ratio in those industries which are heavily dependent upon Federal support; while companies as a rule make gradual changes in their own spending, the gain or loss of a Federal contract can cause wide yearly swings in a company's total R&D expenditures. For example, the total R&D/net sales ratio in the aircraft and,missiles, industrY went from a high o128.3 perierif in 1964 io a low of 12.7 percent in 1975 and 1976, and climbed to 13.0 percent in 1977. Federal R&D expenditures for space had been increasing with the growth of the .e.fe Apollo lunar landing program and reached a peak in the late sixties. Thereafter, Federal R&D funds for space declined each year through 1973 as the expenditures for the spa( e shuttle, begun in 1970, were not as large as those for the Apollo program. Federal R&D space expenditures began an upswing again in 1974 with increased outlays for space shuttle development. The aircraft and missiles industry is of course greatly affected each time there are such large changes in Federal outlays for space research and development. At the same time, gradual increases in Federal defense R&D outlays have helped to minimize the fluctuations in this industry."}, {"section_title": "Character of Work", "text": "All three types of R&D activity, basic: research, applied research, and development, ,increased by 11 percent between 1976 and 1977, the second consecutive year that all three rose at the same rate. Following a decade of increases larger in applied research and development than in basic research, the 1976-77 pattern reflects the change in R&D strategy mentioned in the \"Company R&D Funds\" section."}, {"section_title": "Basic research", "text": "in 1977 industrial basic research spending rose to $910 million, increasing by 11 percent over the preceding yearthe same growth rate as applied research and development. If measured in constant dollars, this represents a 5-percent increase, the second consecutive real increase following more than a decade of steady decline. Industry officials in basic research-intensive industries see this as the start of a reversal of that trend. Larger companies are the largest performers of basic research. In 1977, 66 companies, representing over one-half of the R&D-performing companies with 25,000 or more employees, reported basic research expenditures. These large companies performed 54 percent of all industrial basic research. The percentage of R&D performers with basic research expenditures declines as the size of firms becomes smaller. Smaller and medium-sized firms, however, devoted a higher percentage of their R&D funds to basic research than did firms with 25,000 or more employees. Three-quarters of total industrial basic research was financed by companies' own funds in 1977. In the past this number has fluctuated from 75 percent to 80 percent of funds for basic research. Although the chemicals industry received the largest absolute amount from the Federal Government for basic research, $68 million, this industry also spent nearly four times that amount of its own funds on basic research. On the other hand, nonmanufacturing industries, which include independent R&D laboratories, received 85 percent of their basic research funds from the Federal Government. just 2 percent of all Federal R&D support to industry was for basic research in 1977. The Federal Government has traditionally depended upon universities and colleges to perform the majority of the Federal basic research effort. As in the past, the chemicals industry, including drug companies, led all other industries in basic reseprch performance with a 1977 expenditure of $336 million-11 percent above the 1976 level. Other longer sufficiently profitable for drug companies to market marginal improvements in or reformulations of existing drugs. Instead, the industry is searching for breakthrough products which will yield a significant return on the amount spent for testing. ,They feel that these proucts can best be found through an increased basic research effort. Communication equipment industry officials also cited a desire to find new products and expand into new markets as responsible 'for their increase in expenditures for basic research. The distribution of funds for industrial basic research by field of science has fluctuated little since 1967. Almost one-half of industrial basic research in 1977 was in the physical sciences, with approximately 70 percent of this total in chemistry. Engineering accounted for an additional 26 percent of industry's basic research performance. This concentration by field reflects the dominating interests.of the chemicals and electrical equipment industries in basic research.  ( her hso-thirds ot the combined applied wsearch and development expenditures were made by four industries. Airc ratt and missiles $7,0 billion); elec-trical equipment and communications ($5.8 billion); machinery ($3.9 bil4iom; and motor vehnicles i$3.3 bil)ion). Since applied research and development expenditures have historically accounted for over 95 percent ot total R&D spending, the pattern of expenditures for both Federal and company applied research anti development has closely paralleled that of total re. search and development. Almost 80 percent of Federal support was channeled into two industriesaircraft and missiles (S5.5 billion, representing 78 percent of the total applied research and developmemi expenditures of that industry) and electrical equipment and communication ($2.7 billion, or 46 percent of the total industry efforu. citol'earT ' By product field The NSF industrial survey collects statistical data on applied research and development not only by individual industry, but also on a prodUct field basis within each industry. (See tables 8-50 through B-55 of the companion volume.) Product field data provide a valuable supplement to the broader-based, traditional industry classification. In the industrial R&D survey, companies are classified by industry as a total unit into the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code which contains the largest percentage of their sales. Thus, the classification for conglomerates and other diversified cornpanies may not wholly represent the field in which their research and development is accomplished. For example, a company which has most of its sales volume in a food subsidiary would be included in the food industry category although most of its R&D program May be iiirideatoWardIfs-Chemicals businesi. The product field data show the exact product field where applied research and developMent is directed; irrespective of the primary industrial classification of the performing firms. In using these data, it should be emphasized that company officials usually do not keep their official records by product field; thus. greater emphasis is placed on the use of informed estimates in providing these data. Seventy percent of all industrial applied research and development expenditures in 1977 were made in six product fields: Electrical equipment and COMmuniation, $5.9 billion; machinery, $3.6 billion; aircraft and parts, $3.1 billion; guided missiles and spacecraft, $3.0 billion; motor vehicles and other transportation equipment, $2.6 billion; and chemicals, $2 9 billion. Many (ompanies are becoming increasingly sified in !!L.., markets they serve and their R&D ex penditures are also being spread over a wider variety of products. The following tabulation shows a \"specialization\" ratio tor selected industries; that is, the percentage of applied research and development that a company 6irects towards its major product field. The spetializatioii ratios were derived by dividing the R&D funds spent on an industry's primary product by the total applied research and development expenditures of that industry."}, {"section_title": "WO 1977", "text": "Ownitcak and allied cxiuti.

The first two reasons would dilute the proportion of research and development done in a. company's major product field, while the third would generally tend to increase the specialization ratio of a company."}, {"section_title": "Energy R&D", "text": "Industry's performance of energy research and de velopment reached $1.9 billion in 1977, an increase of 20 percent during the year. According to company officials, expenditures ANiere expectea to rise an additional 11 percent during 1978. Since 1972, the first year that data were collected for this category, energy R&D performance by industry has risen at an average annual rate of 22 percent.  A frequently used measure, which allows comparisons of relative unit costs between industries, is the cost per R&D scientist and/or engineer. These ratios vary sharply by individual industry, depending on the type of R&D activity undertaken. The all-industry average for funds spent on R&D programs increased 6 percent during 1977 to $76,400 per scientist or engineer. Although the all-industry average of cost per scientist or engineer has increased every year during the 1972-77 period, there has been no growth at all in this ratio when put in terms of constant dollars. Corporate outlays per scientist or engineer, on a constant-dollar basis, rose from $55,300 in 1972 to $56,000 in 1973, fell to a 12-year low of $52,300 in 1975, and rose again to $54,000 by 1976. This reflects the real-dollar decline of R&D expenditures (caused by a drop in Federal outlays) which Occurred between 1973 and 1975. Although the actual corporate outlays for these R&D scientists and enginfers and their supporting personnel increased 51 percent between 1972 and 1977, the proportion of R&D funds spent on wages and salaries has declined. The share of R&D expend. . 'itures attributed to materials and supplies also dedined 11 percent' since 197Z-Whilelfie proportion for other costs increased 9 percent. Industrial leaders have attributed this rise to increases in overhead, particularly energy and real e4ate costs, and a rapid Ose  in depreciation. Table 3 shows R&D expenditures broken down by the major costs. The ratio of scientists and engineers in industry to total employmenv increased to 27 in 1977 from its 1972 low of 24. During the .1972-77 period industry experienced relative economic health, increasing sales nearly 22 percent in real terms. At the same time, companies increased their R&D programs, hiring more scientists and engineers (14 percent more than in 1972) as well as increasing funds 'for R&D. programs. Total industrial employment rose less than 4 percent over this entire period. Department of Commerce data indicate that from 1972 to 1974 the cOnstant-dollar value of inventories increased, probably due to the recession during that period. In 1974 to 1977 the real value of inventories actually declined. This may indicate a desire on the part of industrial firms to. reduce the value of inventories. Thus, companies did not need to hire more production workers, .but, in view of increasing R&D programs; did need additional R&D scientists and engineers. iirdormant e tit these researe h \u00ab.nters in 1956, Census adjusted data tor that year ( t ul lit It'd in the 1957 survey) to pros ide corn par,ible trend data tor 1956 and adier 'years Data on sc icrilit ii pets' nnel are not directly comparable with data in surveys tormedy conducted by BIS f or example, the' reporting unit used m the Census surveys ot industrial research and deyelopment is the t'onipany, which is det pried to Inc lude establishments under connnon ownership or control Surveys ot sc. lento I( and technical personnel conducted by 1115 were on an establishment reporting.una basis f urther, the Census surveys Obtain data on the number Of R&D scientists and engineers on a toll time.equi.valent f TE ) basis, unlike the surveys of MS in who h data were provided in terms of scientists and engineers primarily employed in research and development Other variations in the two sets of da fa may be the result of different off ices in the sante company preparing the estimates, or the varying response. rates of the two surveys.

Federal or company funds), and geographic location, net sales, total employment, and R&D scientists and engineers, was based on company records and these data elements could be considered art accurate reflection of company al (Ivan's Questions on sc ientific and technical information (ST I) expenditures and company research and development as indirect costs of 1-ecir,ral contracts were found to be very difficult for companies to answer and the data were determined to be unreliable. These items were removed from the survey Also deleted was the question on the employment of scientists and engineers in terms of \"man.years Analysis of historical data showed little differences between. these employment data and the average of two January totals; this finding was Confirmed by company officials. It was learned that most companies do not maintain separate accounts for salaries and wages for scientists and engineers and tor suppotting personnel and that the estimates provided in the survey were extremely weak Therefore, the item was simplified to obtain a total figure for scientists, engineers, and supporting personnel The breakdown of R&D expenditures by basic research, applied research, and development data was cited as one of the more difficult items to provide and one requiring further clarification in the definitions and instructions, To assist respondents in overcoming these difficulties, a number of steps were taken, First, Census Bureau personnel offered suggestions regarding specific problems. Cprinpany officials were eiscour. aged to rely to a greater extent-on \"informed estimates-when precise data were not available: Some changes weremadeto the survey form to emphasize the more important instructions, to provide the opportunity to report that certain R&D activtties were not undertaken by the firm, and to clarify the definitions of both net sales and \"contracted-out\" research and development.      1957 1963 1966 1967 1968 1969 , 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 $4,335 $7,270 $8,332 $8,365  (3) (1) (2) (3) (2) (2)   146 1,362 (3) 184 1,137 (3) 1,057 (2) 0 (3) 1,093 (2)  (3)   $ 8,869 $ 9,857 $10,283 $10,645 $11,522 $13,068 $14,647 $15,559 $17,377 $19 (3)  .'71 (2)   1957, 1953, nO 1966-78 In thousarnial    1957, 1963, and 1966-77 SIC coda 19571963196619671968196919701971197219731974197519761977  .4 22,23 (1 / .5 .5 .5, .5 .6 .5 .5 .4 .4 .4 .4 .4 .4 ,4 .3 .4 .4 .8 .7 .9 . .9 .7 .7 .6 .13 .8 .8 331.32,3398,3399 .7 .7 .8 .7 .7 .7 .7 .6 ,5 .

This is one of a series of surveys conducted to assist us in better understanding and strengthening the overall national effort in research and development. The Foundation is well aware of the increased reporting burden on\"industry in recent years. In response to this problem, each item on the survey form has been carefully reviewed to determine if some of the requested data could be collected less frequently than annually. This has led to'a decision to alternate between \"he full survey form, similar to the enclosed questionnaire designed for the 1977 survey, and an abbreviated form containing mly principal data elements. This abbreviated version will be used next year for the first time to collect 1978 data. We hope that this will be of assistance in reducing your overall reporting burden. Data obtained in this survey of industry are used by Government officials in developing policies and programs to strengthen science and technology. Individual companies have also found the data valuable-in assessing and planning their own research and development programs. since industrial firms account for approximately three--fourths of total R&D performance, the suzvey results represent a ,--mmior Odurce of needed information in this area. lb provide you with some of the keY' findings from last year's survey, 411spon be providing you, through the Bureau of the Census, with copies of a release which summarizes the results of that stugly. ''..10morth-deitailed-report, providing substantial additional data, is 'expected to be available later in the spring. The U.S. Bureau of the Census responses for the Foundation. should be directed to the U.S of the Census, Washington, D. -2 -collects and compiles the survey Inquiries ,tegarding the survey . Department of Commerce, Bureau C. 20233. Your participation in this survey is very much appreciated. Enclosed are report forms and file copies of Census Form RD-1, \"Survey of Industrial Research and Development During 1977,\" an instruction manual to assist you in completing the report, and a letter from the National Science Foundation, which sponsors this survey, describing the importance of the survey results. The instruction manual provides guidelines for reporting. However, it is recognized that book records for particular items may not be maintained. In such cases, carefully prepared estimates are acceptable. This report is authorized by law (title 13, United States Code). Items 2A and 2B, and columns 2 and 4 of item 5C, are a basic part of the statistic:.,l program of the Bureau of the Census for manufacturing companies and, if not reported in this survey, would have to be reported on mandatory Census Form MA-121. Response to the remainder of the inquiries is voluntary; however, your cooperation is needed to make the results comprehensive, accurate, and timely. By section 9 of the law (title fl), your report to the Census Bureau is confidential. It may be seen only by sworn Census employees and may be used only for statistical purposes. The law also provides that copies retained in your Ailes are Ammune from legal process. Requests for copies of the resulting publications and questions concerning the form should be directed to Mr. Paul Beasley of our Industry Division, phone (301) 763..-5598. We appreciate your past cooperation with the Bureau of the Census and look forward to your continued participation in this important survey.   Far the purposes of this questionnaire, research and development includes activities carried on by persons trained,either fOnnally or by experience, in the physical sciences including related engineering, and the biological sciences including medicine but excluding psychology, if the purpose of such activity is to do one or more of the following things: I, Pursue a planned search for new knowledge, whether or not the search has reference to a specific application, 2. Apply existing knowledge to problems involved in the creation of a new product or process including work required to evaluate possible uses. We recognize that the reporting activities of such latter groups will requiseo the use of estimates for some of the questions.  pany has two or more laboratories, the expenditures of some of these laboratories may be all classified in one or another type of research arid development on the basis of the function assigned to the laboratory. There are laboratories assigned only development type work. There are others engaged only in applied or basic research. If research and development work is done in production units as well as in various laboratories, the research and development work in the production units will generally be of a development type. The separate classification of clearly identifiid development operations, particularly in the industriee producing expensive prototypes, wifl greatly reduck the balance to be distributed. The distribution' will have to be estimated on the irsis of a review iof individual projects or en the basis of other summaries of the work, -Please use the definitions for basic, appl_ked, and development, as given above. If, despite these instruct' ons, you feel that you ate :unable to distribute your research and development expenditures into groupings approximating the casegoriei requested, please write to the Bureau of the 'Census describing your accounts and indicating your special problems. The Bureau may be able to make Or obtain some suggestions that will be hrlpful in completing the report form. Types of Activity Included in Development -The design and operation of pilot plants or Semi-works plants so long as the principal purposes are to obtain experience and to compile engineering and other data to be used in evaluating hypotheses, in writing product formulas or in establishing finished product specifications, in designing special equipment end structures required by 3 process, and in preparing operating instructions or manuals. The engineering activity required to advance the design of a produCt or a process to the point where it meets specific functional and economic requirements rind can be turned over to manufacturing units. The design, construction, and testing of preproduction prototypes and models and \"engineering follow-through:' in the early production phase is included. The development of designs for special manufacturing equipment and tools is included but tool making and tool tryout are not included. The preparation of reports, drawings, formulas, specifications, standard practice instructions or operating manuals, and other media for transmitting to operating units informatioe obtained, from the above activities is included, Plowever, the groduction of detailed construction drawings' Or' -manufactUring .1guiipriMs. is' -not included.' question, \"When does-development end and production begin?\" is often asked. If the primary objective Is to make further improvements on die product or 'process, then the work comes within the definition of research and development. If, on the other NNW' the product or process is substantially \"set,\" and the primery objective is to develop markets-of-to'''. do preproduction planning, or to get the production process going smoothly, then the work is no longer research 'and developmeet. Record energy R&D spending according to type of energy. Coal R&D activities are to be assigned into three sub-categories. \"Synthetic fuels\" includes programs designed to convert coal to gaseous and liquid products. \"Mining\" is composed of programs for developing equipment and techniques to improve the productivity and recovery rates of coal mining. \"Coeservatlen and Utilizatioe\" includes R&D activities undertaken to reduce consumption either at the point of energy use or in the transmission. transportation, storage, and conversion of energy. 'Examples of such are R&D undertaken primarily to reduce fuel consumption 1, manufacturing, to improve the efficiency of transportation of energy products, or to produce an end product which is more efficient in energy consumption. \"All ether energy\" includes areas such as wind, waste, hydroelectric, etc. Also include in this category, (F), the development of energy equipment which cannot be readily classified in A to E. If the energy source is waste or any other area with pollution abatement aspects. consider carefully whether one of the purposes of the project is pollution abatement. In a limited number of cases, the separation of joint (multiple) costs which is encouraged in the preceding peragraph may not be feasible. In this circumstance, include total protect cost if the primary purpose of a Proiect is ener:y R&D; do not include any of project cost if this primary purpose of the project is other than energy R&D, increase equipment ckirability in corrosive environments, to conserve energy (include as enerp R&D) and natural resources, or to increva employee comfort, safety, and health. Moe can be two tyPoo of Pollution abatement R&D spending, In some cases, the only purpose of the R&D spending is pollution abatement. Examples me spending On projects to improve or design alternatives to electrostatic precipitators, wet scrubber systems, waste treatment systems, effluent monitoring devices, etc. In such cases, irallude the total exPenditures on the R&D Project. In other cases, pollution abatement Is one of several purposes, Examples are spending on Projects to improve production processes or products and simultaneously reduce the emission of poi lutants. Pollution abatement purposes could also be combined with other types of environmental control purposes such as energy conservation or employee safety and health. In all these instances, estimate and report only the portion of cost incurred due to the pollution abatement purpose. In a limited number of cases, the separation of joint costs which is encouraged in the Predgqing ParagrePh may not be feasible. In this circumstance, do not include any of project cost unless the primary purpose of the project is pollution abatement. When the primary purpose is pollution abatement, include the total project cost in your answer. Do not include any of project cost as being for pollution abatement if expected pollution abatement benefits arc incidental. Incidental benefits are those obtained at no extra cost. Show R&D spending accordingto the form of pollution being abated. For example, \"air\" has three sub . ThIs fepoit Should cover yOuf entire company, including air suDsicl lanes and affiliates, unless otheiwise designated. Enter \"None\" where appropriate rather than leaving a blank space. Reasonably accurate estimates are acceptable.    044044eschimpry isimplovaitt"}]
