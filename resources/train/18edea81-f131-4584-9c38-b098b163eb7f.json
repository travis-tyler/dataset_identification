Variable resolution global simulations offer a computationally efficient alternative to global high resolution that combines the advantages of global simulation in representing the global circulation with high resolution in regions of interest. Such approaches have shown some success in capturing global and regional climate (Chen et al. 2011; Zarzycki et al. 2015) and also TC statistics (Harris and Lin 2014; Zarzycki and Jablonowski 2014; Fowler et al. 2015 ), yet the simulation advantages of such an approach over traditional limited area modeling is not well understood.\nIn this study, the capacity of two different mesh refinement approaches to capture Northwest Pacific TC activity is compared. Specifically, the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-ARW, Skamarock et al. 2008 ) is used with a tropical channel domain (Done et al. 2013 ) and compared with the global atmosphere-only Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS, Thuburn et al. 2009; Ringler et al. 2010) . The impact of horizontal grid refinement over the Northwest Pacific is compared between the models: WRF uses a two-way nesting approach (Michalakes et al. 2004) , and MPAS uses a variable resolution mesh . The capacity of each model and refinement method to capture smooth transitions across the grid refined region and the large-scale seasonal climate is demonstrated using large-scale cloud patterns, midtropospheric jet structure, and precipitation, and the influence on TC activity is examined. For a case study of the active 2005 North Atlantic TC season, Fowler et al. (2015) demonstrated the capacity of MPAS using mesh refinement over the North Atlantic to capture the frequency and general locations of North Atlantic TCs. This study focuses on TC activity over the Northwest Pacific TC; a region of very different large-scale forcing of TCs and TC formation pathways (McTaggart-Cowan et al. 2013) .\nThe next section describes the methodology, datasets, and an automated TC detection and tracking method. In Sect. 3, sensitivity of the large-scale climate to model and grid refinement method is presented. Section 4 presents differences in TC activity across models and grid refinement methods. Conclusions are drawn in Sect. 5."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model setups", "text": "To support this comparison study between two grid refinement approaches, model versions are selected to allow use of the same microphysical parameterizations. MPAS-A version 2.0 and WRF-ARW version 3.5.1 allow for the use of common microphysical schemes, though their interaction with grid resolved flow will differ between the models and resolutions. Both models use the Kain-Fritsch cumulus parameterization scheme (Kain 2004) , the WSM6 single-moment microphysics scheme , the Yonsei University planetary boundary layer scheme (Hong et al. 2006) , the Noah land surface scheme (Chen and Dudhia 2001) , and the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) short and long wave radiation schemes (Collins et al. 2004) .\nWRF and MPAS are fully compressible non-hydrostatic models. In the horizontal, WRF tropical channel domain is based on latitude-longitude coordinate using Arakawa C-grid, and MPAS is based on unstructured centroidal Voronoi C-grid meshes. In the vertical, WRF tropical channel domain uses a terrain-following hydrostaticpressure coordinate, and MPAS uses a height-based hybrid smoothed terrain-following coordinate (Klemp et al. 2007) . WRF model top is 10 hPa, MPAS model top is 30 km, and both models have 50 vertical levels. Figure 1 shows the WRF model computational domains that comprise a tropical channel domain (similar to that used by Ray et al. (2011) , and referred to hereafter as domain01) and a nested domain (referred to hereafter as domain02) over the Northwest Pacific. Domain01 has dimensions 361 \u00d7 121 grid points and horizontal grid spacing of 1.0\u00b0 (111 km at the equator). Domain02 has dimensions 501 \u00d7 251 grid points and horizontal grid spacing of 0.2\u00b0 (22 km at the equator). Domain01 spans 60\u00b0S-60\u00b0N with periodic boundary conditions in the east-west direction (Fig. 1) , and domain02 covers the main regions of observed TC genesis and TC tracks over the Northwest Pacific basin (85\u00b0E-5\u00b0W, 5\u00b0S-45\u00b0N). WRF lateral boundary conditions use linear relaxation over five grid points (one specified point and four relaxation points). WRF nesting can operate as both one-way or two-way: two-way allows both downscaling from domain01 to domain02 and upscaling from domain02 to domain01, whereas one-way nesting only permits downscaling. In this study, two-way nesting is used to be consistent with the flow across scales inherent to MPAS. Kalnay et al. 1996) at 2.5\u00b0 grid spacing for the atmosphere and NOAA Weekly Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperatures (OI-SST, Hurrell et al. 2008 ) at 1.0\u00b0 grid spacing. WRF and MPAS use NNRP and OI-SST for initial conditions, and OI-SST for surface boundary conditions. Additionally, WRF domain01 uses NNRP for lateral boundary conditions. All boundary conditions update every 6 h. Qian et al. (2003) showed two timescales of regional climate model spin up; a rapid 1-2 day geostrophic adjustment of the initial mass and wind fields to be in balance with the model dynamics, and a slower 2-3 week adjustment to the state of the model climatology. Although spin up will vary by model and domain size, given that most TC activity takes place after June 1, and our analysis focuses on the period July-August-September, our results should not be significantly impacted by model spin up.\nFour simulations are conducted (Table 1) to allow for comparison between models and comparison between uniform resolution and the use of grid refinement. For the WRF model, a simulation using a single tropical channel domain at 1\u00b0 is referred to hereafter as WRF_D1, and a simulation with an added nest over the Northwest Pacific at 0.2\u00b0 is referred to as WRF_D2. Hereafter, WRF_D2 is the combination of domain01 and domain02, and treated as one dataset for the analysis. For MPAS, a simulation with a uniform mesh at 120 km is referred to as MPAS_UM and a simulation with mesh refinement over the Northwest Pacific from 120 to 23 km is referred to as MPAS_VM. Multi-year simulations or ensemble simulations of a single year would be necessary to account for internal variability and assess model skill. Rather than assessing the skill of the models, this study focuses on single-year simulations to demonstrate the capacity of a variable resolution mesh for seasonal TC simulation, and identify potential benefits above the nesting approach to mesh refinement."}, {"section_title": "Cyclone detection and tracking", "text": "TCs are analyzed using an automated TC detection and tracking algorithm based on Suzuki-Parker (2012) .

This restriction prevents connections with newly generated TCs."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity of seasonal climate to model and grid refinement", "text": "WRF uses two-way nesting in which small scales generated on domain02 are temporally and spatially filtered as the domain01 grid points in the region of domain02 are replaced with domain02 information at each domain01 time step. As a result, it is possible that discontinuities at the domain02 boundary could modify weather systems as they transition across the boundary. For MPAS, Skamarock et al. (2012) showed the variable mesh transition zone produced no such problems for the case of 5-day forecasts.\nHere, the influence of the two grid refinement approaches is explored on seasonal timescales. Figure 3 shows OLR for WRF_D2 and MPAS_VM at 18UTC September 15th 2005-a time that had a TC in each simulation. Although there is an abrupt resolution change at the nest boundary, for example over Northeast to Northwest Pacific, Northwest Pacific to Bering Sea, and India Ocean to Southeast Asia, WRF nesting appears to perform reasonably well at capturing smooth transitions in features evident in the cloud patterns at the nest boundary, at least qualitatively. MPAS, that allows gradual change across scales, also handles well the transition of features within the variable mesh region."}, {"section_title": "Cloud patterns", "text": "Differences become apparent, however, on longer timescales. Seasonal mean OLR differences between WRF_D2 and WRF_D1 from July to September (JAS, Fig. 4a ) shows abrupt changes along some sections of the nest boundaries, particularly along the southern and eastern boundary. The difference field between MPAS_VM and MPAS_UM (Fig. 4b) on the other hand, does not show any cloud field discontinuities on seasonal timescales across the region of mesh refinement. Figure 5 shows summer (JAS) mean wind speed at 500 hPa for NNRP, WRF_D1, WRF_D2, MPAS_UM, and MPAS_ VM. An ensemble or multi-year simulation approach would be needed to make a formal skill assessment, whereas the comparison with NNRP presented here is to demonstrate capacity to capture the major seasonal large-scale flow patterns. The simulated large-scale flows generally compare favorably with NNRP, but with some notable exceptions. At the poles, MPAS simulations deviate substantially from NNRP and among themselves. In WRF_D1 and WRF_D2, anomalously strong large-scale flow is located over the Southwest Pacific Ocean and is likely due to an influence of the fixed southern boundary at 60\u00b0S. MPAS, on the other hand, is able to capture a more realistic jet structure over the Southwest Pacific.\nOver the Northwest Pacific, the impact of mesh refinement for both WRF and MPAS is an equatorward shift in the westerly jet maxima and an increase in the jet magnitude. For both WRF and MPAS this may be a consequence of the enhanced TC activity in the mesh-refined simulations (shown later in Fig. 9 ). For WRF_D2, however, the jet appears to be constrained along the northern boundary of domain02, and then distorts as it exits the region of the nest. MPAS_VM, on the other hand, produces a smooth jet structure with no distortion (Fig. 5) .\nThese flow features can also be seen in the local (between 130\u00b0E and 160\u00b0E) zonal mean wind speeds at 500 hPa for NNRP and the four simulations (Fig. 6 ). This longitude band covers the region of grid refinement and the anomalously strong flow over the Southwest Pacific. Again, large-scale variations in the local zonal mean wind speeds compare reasonably well with NNRP, expect at the poles. MPAS_UM and MPAS_VM capture the latitudes and approximate magnitudes of the wind speed maxima in the southern mid-latitudes, whereas WRF_D1 and WRF_ D2 severely overestimate these peak winds. Again, the jet maxima over northern mid-latitudes is shifted equator-ward and increases in magnitude in the mesh refined simulations compared to uniform mesh simulations for both WRF and MPAS. In addition, the northward flow in WRF_D2 is the weakest among the simulations, suggesting a modification of the jet by the nesting approach. Figure 7 shows daily mean (JAS) precipitation for Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP, 1.0\u00b0 resolution, Adler et al. 2003) , Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission 3B43 (TRMM, 0.25\u00b0 resolution, Huffman et al. 2007) , and the four simulations. Again, comparison with observations is presented here to demonstrate capacity to capture the major seasonal large-scale precipitation patterns rather than to formally assess model skill. To quantify similarity between datasets, the bias and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients are calculated and presented in Table 2 . Although all simulations overestimate precipitation amounts globally by approximately 1.0 mm/day the large-scale spatial precipitation patterns compare favorably with GPCP and TRMM (Table 2) ."}, {"section_title": "Precipitation", "text": "For the region of the Northwest Pacific, where summer precipitation is dominated by convective systems, the bias of each simulation is slightly higher than the global value and the correlation slightly lower. The effect of grid refinement is to further increase the regional bias for both WRF and MPAS with no substantial change in regional correlation. The high internal variability of TCs ) is likely preventing any improvement in regional correlation with mesh refinement. Figure 8 shows zonal mean daily mean (JAS) precipitation for global and local (between 100\u00b0E and 180\u00b0E, covering the Northwest Pacific) regions, for GPCP, TRMM, WRF_D2, and MPAS_VM. Although the effects of the relaxation zones at the northern and southern lateral boundaries (60\u00b0S, 60\u00b0N) and nesting boundary zones (5\u00b0S, Fig. 6 Seasonal zonal mean wind speed at 500 hPa for July-AugustSeptember 2005 between 130\u00b0E and 160\u00b0E corresponding to the region of grid refinement and the anomalously strong flow over the Southwest Pacific (Fig. 4) , for a zonal wind speed (Eastward is positive) and b meridional wind speed (Northward is positive) 45\u00b0N) are evident in WRF_D2, large-scale variations in both the global and local zonal mean total precipitation are generally well captured in WRF_D2 and MPAS_VM compared with GPCP and TRMM. But the amounts are overestimated. From a regional perspective, WRF_D2 overestimates precipitation over the South Pacific around 30\u00b0S, corresponding to the southern shear line associated with the anomalously strong large-scale flow at 500 hPa (Fig. 5c) . Overestimation is greatest in WRF_D2 and MPAS_VM over tropical regions where convective activity is dominant (Fig. 8c) . Figure 7 indicates this overestimation is most pronounced for the coastal areas of continents and islands, and also in regions of large-scale convergence over the oceans, rather than confined to the region of high resolution.\nMPAS_VM is able to produce smooth precipitation features from the East China Sea to Alaska, across the region of refinement (Fig. 7) . MPAS_VM captures the jet from East China Sea to Alaska, whereas the jet simulated by WRF_D2 is constrained by lateral and nesting boundaries. It seems likely that both the global domain and smooth transition between fine and coarse resolution for MPAS contribute to the smoother jet structure (shown earlier in Fig. 5 ) and smoother precipitation features over the (Fig. 7) . This smooth transition permits extra-tropical transitioning cyclones to exit the region of refined mesh unimpeded by shocks associated with abrupt resolution of the nesting approach."}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity of tropical cyclone activity to model and grid refinement", "text": "The previous section hypothesized that precipitation differences in tropical and subtropical regions may be partly attributed to differences in TC activity. Figure 9 (Table 3) , the general area of TC genesis points and tracks compares well with IBTrACS. Additionally, MPAS_VM enhances TC activity over the Southern Indian and Southwest Pacific basins, unlike WRF_D2 that does not appear to substantially influence basins outside the region of grid refinement. Mizuta et al. (2012) showed that modification of cumulus parameterization-specifically, the treatments of entraining and detraining plumes, reducing the conversion rate of cloud water to precipitation, and suppressing the conversion near the cloud bottom-improved simulation of monthly mean precipitation and TC activity over the Northwest Pacific. It is likely that the overestimation of TC frequency and convective rainfall over tropical regions presented here may also be in part attributed to details of the cumulus scheme. Indeed, Bullock et al. (2015) showed a reduced wet bias in TC simulations using WRF by tuning the convective adjustment timescale in the Kain-Fritsch scheme.\nTo examine the simulation of re-curving TC tracks over the Northwest Pacific (Archambault et al. 2013) , Fig. 10 depicts the zonal averaged TC tracks for IBTrACS, WRF_ D2, and MPAS_VM. Zonal averaging only uses TCs generated within the region (125\u00b0E-160\u00b0E, 5\u00b0S-25\u00b0N, indicated in Fig. 10 ). The trajectory of the zonal average MPAS_ VM track closely follows that of IBTrACS but is shifted to the West by approximately 400 km. The zonal average WRF_D2 track however follows a different trajectory and recurves too early (at lower latitude) compared to IBTrACS and MPAS_VM. As noted in the previous section the westerly jet of WRF_D2 appears to be constrained along the northern domain02 boundary (Fig. 5c) , with the jet Fig. 8 Seasonal mean daily precipitation for July-August-September 2005, for a global zonal average, b local zonal average between 100\u00b0E and 180\u00b0E corresponding to the longitude band of the Northwest Pacific, and c the ratio of cumulus to total precipitation maximum located further south than in NNRP or MPAS_ VM; and, the southerly flow component flow is the weakest of each case (Fig. 6b ). This analysis suggests that the deviation of the large-scale flow due to the nesting and lateral boundary conditions adversely affects the mean TC track.\nTo explore the influence of grid refinement on TC structure, Fig. 11 depicts the relationships between TC minimum pressure at mean sea level (PMSL) and TC maximum 10 m-height TC wind speed over the Northwest Pacific, for all 6-hourly track data points for IBTrACS, WRF_D1, WRF_D2, MPAS_UM, and MPAS_VM. As expected, both grid refinement methods result in stronger wind speeds compared to the simulations without grid refinement, leading to improved wind-pressure relationships compared with IBTrACS. But the grid refinement simulations still miss the most intense observed winds, despite capturing the lowest observed PMSL. MPAS produces lower PMSLs and higher wind speeds than WRF, at both coarse and high resolution. Furthermore, MPAS_VM produced PMSLs lower than observed.\nTo explore TC intensification rates, Fig. 12 shows timeseries of mean TC minimum PMSL after mean genesis time for TCs over the Northwest Pacific, for IBTrACS, WRF_D2, and MPAS_VM. Data are plotted when the averaging sample size is \u226510 TCs and for IBTrACS, when wind speed is \u226517 m/s for consistency with the definition of simulated TCs. The mean intensification rates and overall intensity evolution in terms of PMSL are reproduced reasonably well for both WRF_D2 and MPAS_VM. The simulations were set up to be comparable in terms of physical parameterizations, and the region and level of refinement from approximately 100 to 20 km grid spacing over the Northwest Pacific. Rather than assessing the skill of the models, this study demonstrates the capacity of a variable resolution mesh for seasonal TC simulation, and identifies potential benefits above the nesting approach to mesh refinement. The ability to capture smooth transitions between the two resolutions varied between models. WRF nesting showed adverse influence of the nest boundary, with the boundary evident in seasonal average cloud patterns, contortions of the seasonal average mid-level jet structure, and abrupt changes in seasonal average precipitation. MPAS variablemesh, on the other hand, showed far smoother cloud patterns, smoother mid-level jet structures comparable to reanalysis data, and no imprint of grid refinement in the seasonal average precipitation. Additionally, WRF simulations generated an anomalously strong southern hemisphere midlatitude jet at 500 hPa over the Southwest Pacific Ocean that is likely attributable to the fixed southern domain boundary.\nPrecipitation totals were overestimated in both models and this wet bias appeared to be greatest over tropical regions where convective activity is dominant rather than confined to the region of high resolution in the grid refined simulations. For both models, grid refinement led to increased TC frequency in the region of refinement compared to simulations without grid refinement. Both grid refined simulations reproduced reasonable TC genesis regions, wind-pressure relationships, and mean intensification rates. However, WRF nesting appeared to adversely affect TC tracks through a contorted jet structure and steering flow associated with the nesting. MPAS variable-mesh substantially increased TC activity over the Southern Indian and Southwest Pacific basins, outside the mesh refined region. WRF nesting, on the other hand, did not appear to substantially influence basins outside the region of grid refinement. Though not explored here, it is possible that some of the differences in seasonal climate and TC activity between WRF and MPAS may be attributed to differences in the dynamical cores (Reed and Jablonowski 2012) . The role of physics, dynamics, and their interaction on variable grids and the potential simulation benefits remains to be fully explored.\nLimited area models such as the WRF model have been used widely to study regional climate and high impact weather (e.g. Tulich et al. 2011; Bruy\u00e8re et al. 2014; Done et al. 2013) . MPAS simulations compared favorably with WRF model simulations in the capacity to capture largescale climate features and TC activity. This study demonstrates capacity of variable mesh refinement for seasonal TC simulation and provides a foundation upon which subsequent studies may assess the skill of MPAS for capturing regional climate. Potential benefits of MPAS for regional climate simulation have been identified by reducing some of the problems associated with traditional nesting approaches to regional refinement. These benefits also come at a reduced computational cost. Table 4 summarizes the relative costs increases of the two mesh refinement techniques for the model setups used here and run on the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Yellowstone system. Ratios of total CPU time show that variable resolution MPAS increased the cost by 8.5 times that of a uniform MPAS coarse mesh, whereas the addition of the nested domain in WRF increased the cost by 13.6 times that of the parent WRF domain. There are many factors driving these differences (not quantified here) including different scaling between WRF and MPAS and the need for a global reduction in the MPAS timestep with variable mesh refinement."}]
