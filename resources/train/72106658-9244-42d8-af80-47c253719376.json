This cross-sectional study assessed relationships between plasma cortisol levels and neuroimaging biomarkers, specifically brain glucose metabolism and gray matter volume, across the AD spectrum.\nMethods: Cognitively normal older adults and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia were included from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

Relationships between plasma cortisol and AD neuroimaging biomarkers were assessed using regions-of-interest and voxel-wise analyses.\nResults: Across the entire cohort, higher plasma cortisol was also related to lower gray matter volume, most notably in the left lateral temporal-parietal-occipital regions.\nImportantly, higher plasma cortisol concentration was also related to hypometabolism, especially in lateral temporo-parietal and medial parietal regions. When stratified by diagnosis, these negative associations were most pronounced in MCI and AD patients.\nInterpretation: High plasma cortisol was associated with hypometabolism predominantly in AD-sensitive regions.

Known as the most important human glucocorticoid released by HPA axis activation, cortisol modulates homeostatic body functions, including negative feedback mechanisms in the brain 2 . Elevated levels of circulating cortisol over time may, however, prompt brain injury and increase vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases [3] [4] [5] .\nThere is evidence that HPA axis activation and dysregulation may aggravate pathological processes related to AD. Cortisol levels, commonly measured in blood plasma/serum, salvia, urine or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), are increased in patients with AD and amnestic MCI 6, 7 . Moreover, higher cortisol levels were previously related to gray matter atrophy in the hippocampus [8] [9] [10] [11] across the AD spectrum, from cognitively normal older adults, to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and clinical AD. These brain changes may contribute to cognitive deficits 9, 10, 12 and higher risk of clinical progression 7, 13, 14 associated with stress hormone elevation.\nBy contrast, effects of circulating cortisol on cerebral glucose metabolism are largely unknown in the course of AD pathogenesis. Decreased glucose metabolism within frontal-temporal-parietal association cortices, measured using positron emission tomography (PET), is a key feature of prodromal and clinical AD [15] [16] [17] . Chronic exposure to increased glucocorticoid concentration was formerly linked to impaired glucose metabolism in the hippocampus and other brain areas in rat models 18 as well as in hypercortisolemic patients with Cushing syndrome 19, 20 . Given these observations, we hypothesize that brain glucose metabolism may be affected by the actions of stress hormones along the AD spectrum.\nThe present cross-sectional study aimed to determine the relationship between plasma cortisol levels and cerebral glucose metabolism, measured using 2-[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET), across the AD spectrum. First, we assessed the effect of plasma cortisol on gray matter volume, measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with the aim to replicate previous findings 8 . Secondly, we investigated the unexplored relationship between circulating cortisol and FDG-PET. The methodological approach was chosen to highlight specific regional patterns of cortisol-associated effects in each imaging modality."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Cross-sectional data used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer "}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Participants were selected from the ADNI database (ADNI I cohort) with regard to availability of following assessments: (i) baseline plasma cortisol concentration, (ii) baseline structural (high-resolution T1-weighted) MRI, and baseline cerebral FDG PET (subgroup).
