This has been codified topographically in neuropathologic tau staging schemes [4, 5] .\nThe recent development of radiolabeled positron emission tomography (PET) ligands for tau tangles [6] [7] [8] has enabled NFTs to be imaged in the brains of living humans. Initial studies have demonstrated that in vivo tau PET images show diverse patterns of tracer binding consistent with those observed in neuropathologic studies, providing strong prima facie evidence that these ligands reflect the distribution of tau pathology in the living brain [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .\nThe availability of these PET tracers and other biomarkers has stimulated the formulation of classification frameworks for clinical AD research based on sequential biological changes in the brain [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . These criteria enable the severity of cognitive and functional impairment to be complemented by objective measures of disease pathology and are refining the concepts of both diagnosis and stage in the study of AD. To date, much of the emphasis has been on dichotomized biomarker measurements, indicating the presence or absence of different pathological changes [21] , exemplified most recently by the A/T/N system based on abnormal amyloid, tau, and/or neurodegeneration [16] . However, the stereotypical patterns of NFT localization also allow for a more granular regional staging of tau pathology per se, and neuropathologic observations can inform image-based classification or staging schemes that can be applied to tau PET images in vivo [10, 11] . These topographic image classification schemes provide a concise summary of the anatomical distribution of tracer binding that conveys the extent of regional involvement. Interpretation of these profiles within a staging framework rests on the assumption that certain profiles succeed others as the disease progresses. Findings in both neuropathology studies and emerging data with tau PET tracers support this view, with the degree of regional involvement associated with amyloid status, cognitive performance, and clinical disease stage [10, 13, 22, 23] .\nOne of these recently described staging algorithms [10] is based on small regions of interest (ROIs) in the anterior temporal and occipital lobes and classification rules that match as accurately as possible the 6-stage operationalized neuropathologic staging scheme proposed by Braak et al. [4] . This approach confirmed the predominance of stereotypical tau PET patterns in individuals across the AD spectrum, but 7% of the scans in that study were not able to be matched to one of the a priori-defined patterns, which could be a limitation for prospective use of that method in clinical research. Moreover, the very small ROIs in that scheme are potentially sensitive to variations in image preprocessing, atrophy, and experimental noise. In addition, the medial temporal lobe (MTL) regions distinguishing stages 1-3 are potentially prone to contamination from adjacent extraparenchymal signals (e.g., optic nerve) and to tracer binding in the choroid plexus. As a result, it may be difficult to reliably distinguish between stages 1, 2, and 3 using that method. Finally, the more advanced stages 5-6 do not capture the variability across subjects in the broader neocortical involvement of tau in the later stages of AD.\nMotivated by these limitations, we propose two simpler tau PET staging schemes that use fewer, larger ROIs and simplified decision rules. The first of these also targets regions restricted to the anterior temporal and occipital lobes but uses larger atlas-based masks and consolidates regions in the MTL. The second is based on the average signal in each of the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes, thus sampling more of the cortex overall. The rationale for these alternative schemes is to improve robustness to image noise (e.g., test-retest), simplify implementation, and minimize unclassifiable scans. In the case of the second scheme, the rationale was also to provide more dynamic range in the assigned stages for cases with more widespread tau load. Here, we evaluate these two schemes, in comparison to that previously described [10] , applied to flortaucipir F 18 scans acquired in a test-retest scenario and in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 (ADNI-2) study. In addition to profiling each scheme as a staging tool, we also assess the three staging schemes when dichotomized to define each scan as tau positive or tau negative."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data sets", "text": "Data from four tau imaging studies were used to form three data sets for the present analysis. The first data set was a set of flortaucipir F 18 scans from N 5 14 young healthy individuals visually and quantitatively (bilateral entorhinal cortex standardized uptake value ratio [SUVr] , 1.2) determined to be tau negative and used as a reference sample [10] . These scans were drawn from an exploratory phase 1 study and from a larger phase 2 study (NCT02016560) undertaken as part of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals' clinical development program for the flortaucipir F 18 PET radiotracer. The second data set was a test-retest study (N 5 21, retest interval 4-28 days) in participants assessed as cognitively normal (CN) or diagnosed with either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or symptomatic AD [24] . This data set was used to assess within-subject reproducibility of the staging algorithms. The third data set comprised N 5 98 participants in the ADNI-2 that received a flortaucipir F 18 PET scan.

For the ADNI-2 study, preprocessed flortaucipir F 18 PET scans were downloaded from the ADNI Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (http://adni. loni.usc.edu) site. The MRI scan was spatially normalized to the MNI152 T1 MRI template, and this transformation was then applied to the same participant's tau PET scan. All tau PET images were then transformed into SUVr images using a cerebellar gray matter reference region."}, {"section_title": "Tau classification algorithms", "text": "Each of the classification schemes was based on binarizing the mean SUVr signals within a predefined set of ROIs and then seeking to match the resulting profile with expected patterns. The three tau PET staging schemes evaluated were as follows:\nTemporal-Occipital Classification (TOC): This recently published approach [10] was explicitly designed to mimic as closely as possible, in terms of brain regions sampled and decision rules, the Braak 2006 operationalized neuropathologic guidelines [4] . This scheme uses small ROIs localized around the anterior temporal lobe (hippocampus, transentorhinal cortex, fusiform cortex, middle temporal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus) and in the occipital lobe (extrastriate and primary [striate] visual cortex). Simplified Temporal-Occipital Classification (STOC): This approach was developed as a simplified version of TOC, modified to use fewer and larger ROIs from standard atlases, located in the medial, lateral, and superior temporal lobes and in the primary visual cortex, as well as simpler decision rules. Lobar classification (LC): This approach is simpler than both TOC and STOC and uses whole-lobar average signals from the temporal (T), parietal (P), and frontal (F) lobes. This scheme has the fewest and largest ROIs, sampling most of the cortical gray matter and even simpler decision rules to assign stages.\nFor the TOC scheme only, the tau PET images were gray matter masked for compatibility with the published method [10] . This was achieved by thresholding each individual participant's gray matter tissue probability map at 25% and binarizing to yield an individualized gray matter mask. Gray matter masking was not applied to the regions used in the STOC and LC schemes as preliminary analyses suggested that this did not improve performance. The ROIs are illustrated in Fig. 1 and are further described in the Supplementary Material.\nFor each scheme, both stereotypical and atypical expected profiles (binary patterns across the staging ROIs) were predefined (Tables 1-3 ). In the case of both TOC and STOC, these profiles included hippocampal-sparing or medial temporal-sparing variants of the more advanced stage patterns. In the case of LC, the number of permutations was sufficiently low that we enumerated all possible profiles, with those expected to reflect the stereotypical progression of AD being T2P2F2 / T1P2F2 / T1P1F2 / T1P1F1. Atypical patterns included T2 with P1 or F1, and T1P2F1. For each scheme, the profiles for each hemisphere were matched independently to the predefined set of permitted patterns, and the most advanced profile was assigned to the scan."}, {"section_title": "Thresholds for binarization", "text": "Thresholds for all schemes were determined on an ROI-specific basis [25] with respect to the mean and standard deviation flortaucipir F 18 SUVr values from 14 younger healthy control subjects (age 21-31 years, average 26.2 years) determined to be \"tau negative\" based on visual inspection (the same set used in ref. [10] ). Thresholds were determined for each scheme so as to yield comparable absolute SUVr thresholds as previously published for TOC. For TOC, the threshold in each ROI was defined as 2.5 standard deviations above the mean of this reference set; this resulted in threshold SUVr values ranging from 1.22 to 1.36 (average 1.28) [10] . For STOC, to obtain threshold SUVr values with an average of 1.28 (range 1.24 to 1.31) as obtained for the TOC approach, a criterion of three standard deviations above the mean of the reference set was used. For the LC staging approach, threshold SUVr values with a similar average of 1.28 (range 1.26 to 1.30) were also obtained using a criterion of three standard deviations above the mean of the reference set. The threshold values, and a comparison with results obtained with threshold values calculated as 2.5 standard deviations above the mean for all three schemes, are provided in the Supplementary Material.\nFor the purposes of dichotomizing scans to \"tau negative\" (T2) or \"tau positive\" (T1) based on regional involvement, we defined tau negative as stage 0-3 in TOC, stage 0-1 in STOC, and stage 0 in LC and accordingly, tau positive as stage 4-6 in TOC, stage 2-4 in STOC, and stage 1-3 in the LC scheme (irrespective of whether the profiles were typical or atypical)."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analysis", "text": "Test-retest reliability was assessed by the percent of participants whose stage assignment was identical on both test and retest scans.

For the TOC scheme, the atypical variants of the stage 3 profiles were primarily hippocampal sparing, whereas the atypical variants of the stage 4 and 5 profiles were mainly characterized by sparing of the extrastriate visual cortex (Fig. 2B ). For the STOC scheme, in contrast to their stereotypical stage counterparts, the MTL-sparing profiles were overall perithreshold (Fig. 2C ). With the LC scheme, using temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes only, 100% (98/98) of the cases evidenced a stereotypical profile ( Table 4 ).\nMean SUVr images for all subjects assigned the same stage are shown in Fig. 3 , illustrating the whole brain patterns beyond the specific ROIs used for classification. The precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex, along with the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, are minimally involved for stages classified as having tau in the MTL but not the lateral temporal lobe, but have notably increased signal at stages corresponding to the presence of tau outside the MTL (TOC stage 4 and STOC stage 2).\nThe degree of stereotypy in the sequential regional involvement of the regions used in each of the staging schemes is illustrated in Fig. 4 . In all three schemes, higher global cortical SUVr (which ranged from 0.89 to 1.78) was associated with positivity in more of the staging regions, with more of the \"later\" regions being positive as the global SUVr increases. SUVr values in the individual ROIs were also associated with global cortical SUVr (R 2 5 0.15-0.76 for TOC, 0.28-0.81 for STOC, and 0.76-0.87 for LC), with the weakest associations in TOC and STOC observed for the occipital cortex ROIs. When the scans were ranked by the order in which each region becomes positive, in the order encoded in the staging schemes, the patterns reveal a predominant stereotypy overall, wherein \"later\" regions turn positive only when \"earlier\" regions are already so. This relationship was cleanest for the LC scheme. Consistent with these observations, when quantified using Spearman rank correlations, the average stereotypy values in the left and right hemispheres were 0.32 and 0.36 for TOC, 0.76 and 0.74 for STOC, and 0.89 and 0.91 for the LC scheme.\nThe assigned stages were significantly associated with global cortical SUVr for all three schemes (TOC: R 2 5 0.41, P , .0001; STOC: R 2 5 0.48, P , .0001; LC: R 2 5 0.62, P , .0001). The relationship was cleanest for the LC scheme with a monotonic and near-linear relationship observed between LC stage and global SUVr (Fig. 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Relationship to disease stage and amyloid status", "text": "The distribution of assigned tau PET stages across disease stage and amyloid status is illustrated for each staging scheme in Fig. 6 .

We evaluated three different topographic staging schemes on flortaucipir F 18 scans in a test-retest scenario and from subjects from the ADNI-2 tau PET pilot study. The three schemes were largely consistent (90%-94% concordance) when dichotomized to categorize scans as T2 or T1. Most (82%-96%) of individuals determined as T1 were also A1, in contrast to only 35% to 41% of individuals determined as T2. Overall, moving toward fewer, larger ROIs and simpler decision rules resulted in more consistent stage assignments across test and retest scans and fewer unclassified or atypical profiles.\nThe TOC and STOC schemes have most of their dynamic range associated with the earlier phases of AD-related tau accumulation, distinguishing differential involvement of anterior temporal lobe regions before substantial spread to the wider neocortex. The STOC scheme did not attempt to distinguish differential involvement of mesial temporal subregions captured in TOC stages 1-3 because these may be a feature of normal aging [26] and the onset of measurable cognitive symptoms may be associated with the appearance of tau in the lateral temporal regions [9] . Other brain regions commonly observed in association with tau outside the mesial temporal lobe, such as the precuneus and orbitofrontal cortex, and visible in the stage-specific images in Fig. 3 , were not explicitly used in these schemes. However, a wide range of neocortical tau patterns are unlikely to be distinguished by the more advanced TOC or STOC stages. Thus, classification schemes like TOC or STOC might be more useful in the study of populations very early in the course of disease (e.g., preclinical AD), where sensitivity to the early spread of tau in the anterior temporal lobe may be of particular interest. However, the present study shows that this sensitivity to more precise regional involvement may bring with it an increased risk of misclassification due to image noise. In contrast, the LC scheme is likely to be relatively insensitive to differential levels of tau localized to the anterior temporal lobe but, given its more linear rela-tionship with global tau burden and explicit sampling of the wider neocortex, may have more utility in the more advanced stages of tau accumulation. It is also likely that the larger ROIs used in the LC method are relatively Fig. 4 . Stereotypy of regional profiles for the three staging schemes in the ADNI-2 data set.

This may be because the whole occipital lobe includes contributions from both lateral and medial parts of the occipital lobe, which can be involved at different stages of tau spread in AD [4] . Occipital lobe tau binding may indicate posterior cortical atrophy [27, 28] or might also represent a contribution from concomitant Lewy body pathology, as indicated by a recent tau imaging study in Lewy body dementia [29] and observed occipital hypometabolism noted in individuals with pathologically confirmed Lewy body copathology [30] .\nThe thresholds used for ROI-wise binarization in this study were chosen for consistency with our previous report [10] . The use of lower thresholds would result in more ROIs being positive and would be expected to shift the overall distribution of assigned stages higher. However, it may also lead to increased \"false positive\" ROIs and potentially to an increased number of profiles that do not fit an expected pattern. The threshold value(s) will also likely depend on the SUVr reference region. In particular, a flortaucipir reference region based on pixels exhibiting behavior suggestive of nonspecific binding in the white matter has recently been proposed for flortaucipir F 18 scans [31] . The question of threshold definition remains open. Clinical correlations and relationship to disease progression can provide information on the thresholds that may be most clinically relevant.\nThe predominantly stereotypical presentation of tau pathology in AD is the primary rationale behind topographic staging schemes. However, neuropathology studies have also noted some degree of case-to-case variability [1, 4, 5] , and others have proposed specific subtypes of AD based on variant presentations of tau (e.g., hippocampal sparing or limbic predominant) [32] . The TOC and STOC schemes both allowed for limited number of atypical profiles, mainly based on sparing of medial temporal structures or the extrastriate visual cortex. Recent tau PET imaging studies in atypical variants of AD (such as logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, posterior cortical atrophy, and earlyonset AD) have shown anatomical profiles of flortaucipir F 18 binding that differ still more substantially from those observed in amnestic AD [27, [33] [34] [35] . The LC approach may be best placed to identify these AD variants that appear to have distinct tau PET presentations in the neocortex that can be efficiently summarized on the basis of differential lobar involvement.\nAlthough this PET tracer exhibits robust test-retest performance when assessed using conventional regional methods [24] , the three staging schemes assessed here evidenced different sensitivity to scan-to-scan variability in SUVr. The TOC scheme had the worst test-retest consistency in assigned stages, with quite different stage classifications observed for some subjects (e.g., stage 0 to atypical stage 4). It is likely that this reflects both the small size of the ROIs (with potential contributions from both inherent signal variability and slight scan-to-scan differences in image alignment) and the number of ROIs on which the staging is based (higher chance of a variability-induced change between positive and negative in one or more of the regions when the signal intensities are perithreshold). The results with the STOC and LC schemes bear out our hypothesis that a combination of larger regions (reducing the test- retest variability in image noise per se) and fewer regions (reducing the combinatorial chances of a perithreshold signal changing state) would result in a more robust performance. These findings also highlight the importance of assessing test-retest variability of staging and other analytical methods that depart from conventional ROI analyses.\nLimitations of the present study include the limited sample sizes, especially in the more severely symptomatic categories (amnestic MCI and AD). Whereas the results with the TOC scheme were qualitatively consistent with those previously reported in an independent data set [10] , further study of these approaches in other data sets is warranted. The staging schemes were designed to assess AD-related tau pathology and assessed here only in well-defined research cohorts targeting older participants in the aged or sporadic AD spectrum; their applicability and performance in more general aging populations, early-onset, or autosomal-dominant patients or in clinical practice remains to be evaluated.\nIn conclusion, tau PET staging schemes could be useful tools to concisely index the regional involvement of tau pathology in living subjects and as the basis of a dichotomized definition of tau positive or tau negative. Simpler schemes are likely to be more robust. Algorithms such as STOC based on temporal lobe subregions may be more sensitive to early AD-related tau spread, whereas sampling the wider neocortex such as in the LC scheme may be more useful in participants with a greater overall tau burden."}]
