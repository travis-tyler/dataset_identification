During 2004-06, the production expenses (excluding operator dwelling expenses) of all U.S. farms and ranches averaged $213 billion annually (USDA, ERS, Farm Income Data Files). The portion consisting of fi xed and variable cash expenses during this period averaged $195 billion, up 12 percent from the average of the previous 3 years. 1 U.S. production of vegetables (including potatoes and pulse crops) and melons occurs on less than 7 million acres, about 2 percent of all harvested cropland. However, from this small footprint comes a diverse set of highvalue products, which generated 16 percent of all farm cash receipts and 8 percent of U.S. farm export value during 2004-06 (USDA, ERS, Vegetables and Melons Briefi ng Room). Refl ecting the intensive, high-cost nature of U.S. vegetable and melon agriculture, total farm cash expenses of such farms averaged $288,036 per farm in 2004-06 and accounted for roughly oneseventh of total U.S. farm cash expenses. The largest vegetable and melon farms (those with more than $1 million in sales) averaged $2.9 million in total cash expenses. Cash expenses for all farms and ranches with more than $1 million in sales averaged about 40 percent less, at nearly $1.7 million. National or regional information on production expense components that are specifi cally for the vegetable and melon sector has not been widely available until now. Most farm fi nance research has grouped vegetables and melons with fruit and tree nuts and treated the combination as one sector (Lucier et al.). No previous studies have focused solely on the expenses of vegetable and melon farms (Jinkins and Lucier). Using data from USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), this report explores the major expense components of specialized U.S. vegetable and melon farms from 1998-2006. Basic questions include: What proportion of the total cash expenses of U.S. vegetable and melon farms consist of labor, fertilizer, or fuel? How do vegetable and melon farm expenses vary by size of farm and geographic location? How have expenses changed on specialized vegetable and melon farms over the past decade? By answering these questions and providing key data, this report aims to contribute to the knowledge of this agricultural sector's fi nancial picture. The report briefl y touches on each of the major expense components for vegetable and melon farms, along with changes in these expenses over three 3-year periods (1998-2000, 2001-03, and 2004-06). In addition to data for all specialized vegetable and melon farms, the discussion includes expenses for four major farm sizes and four census regions, along with comparisons with expenses on all U.S. farms."}, {"section_title": "What Are Specialized Vegetable and Melon Farms?", "text": "For this report, farms are defi ned as specialized vegetable farms if vegetables and melons account for at least half the total value of farm production.

Fertilizer expenditures, for example, are variable costs because they generally increase as the number of planted acres increases. Fixed expenses such as property taxes and depreciation remain the same during a production cycle even if no crops are grown. Vegetables: Small Footprint, Big Impact sales for a substantial proportion of their farm income. On average, specialized vegetable farms accounted for more than half of all the farms producing vegetables in the United States and contributed nearly 90 percent of the total value of U.S. vegetable production during [2004][2005][2006]. In addition to a national overview, specialized vegetable farms are examined in this report according to four census regions: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West (fi g. 1). Regionally, these farms tend to be most heavily concentrated in the South, with substantial numbers also found in the Midwest and West (fi g. 2). However, the West dominates in terms of crop value, with about two-thirds of the national total for vegetable and melon farms. Although a signifi cant volume of vegetables is also grown in the Midwest and Northeast, operations in these areas tend to rely more on other crops for their farm revenue. Specialized vegetable farms were classifi ed into four groups based on total farm value of production: small (value of production less than $40,000), medium ($40,000 to $249,999), large ($250,000 to $999,999), and very large (more than $1,000,000). About 8 percent of specialized vegetable farms are classifi ed as very large, each producing $1 million or more of agricultural commodities in 2004-06 (fi g. 3). The very large farms accounted for 88 percent of the total value of vegetables produced by all specialized vegetable farms and tend to be concentrated in the West. Vegetable and melon farms that produced less than $40,000 worth of commodities (small farms) made up 70 percent of these farms, yet accounted for just 1 percent of the total value of production. Small farms are largely concentrated in the South. The specialized vegetable and melon farm group consists of hundreds of individual commodity markets, each with unique supply and demand characteristics. Thus, the aggregate data for specialized vegetable and melon farms may not be representative of any single commodity within the industry.

However, changes in input or product prices are not the only factors determining net revenue. Many growers may have been able to offset any negative income effect from price changes through gains in productivity (i.e., becoming more effi cient).

Farm chemicals (up 3 percent) and custom services (up 3 percent) had the slowest gain in prices over the period. In 2007, strong demand from fi eld crop farmers helped push fertilizer and seed prices higher, while rising interest rates boosted the cost of credit. Concurrently, strong world demand for petroleum and limited U.S. refi nery capacity pushed diesel fuel prices higher. These increases resulted in a 7-percent increase from a year earlier in the prices paid for production inputs by vegetable and melon growers. In 2006, vegetable and melon growers had also experienced a 7-percent surge in input prices. Further substantial increases are expected in 2008, led by escalating prices for fuel and fertilizers."}, {"section_title": "Cash Expenses Highest in the West", "text": "Refl ecting larger farm sizes and a greater share of farm acres in vegetables, total cash expenses on specialized vegetable and melon farms during 2004-06 were highest in the West. In the West, specialized vegetable and melon farms averaged 548 acres per farm, compared with 199 acres in the Midwest and Annual change in prices paid by farmers for selected inputs the low of 133 acres in the Northeast. About 52 percent of the total acreage of specialized vegetable farms in the West was devoted to vegetables and melons (with the remainder usually planted to rotational crops or kept fallow). On a per-farm basis, cash expenses averaged $884,554 in the West during 2004-06-up 41 percent from 1998-2000 and easily the highest among the four regions (app . table 3). Per-acre expenses were lowest in the Midwest for all three periods, refl ecting the heavy concentration of low-cost machine-harvested vegetables for processing, such as sweet corn, green beans, and green peas. On a per-acre basis, total cash expenses of specialized vegetable and melon farms in the West averaged $1,605 per acre, 30 percent higher than during 1998-2000. During 2004-06, the per-acre total cash expense in the West was 84 percent greater than the next-highest region, the South, refl ecting the greater share of farm area devoted to vegetables and melons. Because so many different crops are represented within these data, the average expense per farm or per acre would seem too low to those producing such high-value crops as fresh-market tomatoes, bell peppers, or broccoli. However, in addition to these high-cost commodities, the data are also capturing such low-cost crops as pumpkins, sweet corn, wheat, and dry beans, which moderate the aggregate per-farm and per-acre averages depicted here."}, {"section_title": "Variable Expenses Rising", "text": "Variable expenses are production-related cash expenses that fl uctuate with acreage or output. They include such items as seed, fertilizer, chemicals, fuel, custom work, and hired labor. During 2004-06, annual variable expenses across all specialized vegetable and melon farms averaged $240,510 per farm-79 percent of total cash and noncash expenses. Noncash expenses consist largely of depreciation and do not include charges for management and operator and unpaid labor. Variable expenses in 2004-06 were up 27 percent from 1998-2000, led by increased outlays for fuel and oil, seeds and plants, and fertilizer and chemicals. Hired labor (excluding custom work) was the single largest expense item on specialized vegetable and melon farms. The production of many freshmarket vegetable and melon crops tends to be labor intensive. This is because fi eld operations such as thinning, cultivating, irrigating, and harvesting must frequently be accomplished by skilled hand labor to avoid damage to tender plants and to assure the product meets the stringent quality and appearance criteria expected by consumers. For this reason, labor expenses tend to be much greater for fresh-market crops, compared with those of the highly mechanized processing side of the industry. Agricultural chemicals (including fertilizers) were the second-largest variable cash expense for specialized nonorganic vegetable and melon farms-accounting for about 21 percent of total variable expenses. Seed and transplants are also an important annual expense, with many vegetable commodities (such as tomatoes, broccoli, and watermelon) produced from transplants or costly hybrid seed. In addition to variable cash expenses, vegetable and melon farms have fi xed (overhead) cash outlays such as insurance premiums, real estate and property taxes, interest, rent, and lease payments. When these fi xed cash expenses are added to variable cash expenses, specialized vegetable and melon farms averaged $288,590 in total cash expenses during 2004-06. In comparison, nonspecialized vegetable and melon farms averaged $209,583, due primarily to their greater share of livestock and other crops, which generally incur lower cash expenses."}, {"section_title": "Labor Is Vital and Costly", "text": "Farm labor is an important input for most agricultural operations, but it is essential for many specialized vegetable and melon farms. Maintaining access to an affordable labor pool is critical to the industry. With some exceptions, most fresh-market growers depend on hand labor for harvest and other fi eld and packing activities. The timing of labor availability is also critical to vegetable and melon growers, who must harvest crops within a specifi c window during the growing cycle to ensure optimal quality. According to the U.S. Department of Labor's National Agricultural Workers Survey, fruit and vegetable farms accounted for two-thirds of all hired crop workers in the United States. 2 For vegetables and melons alone, 78 percent of workers were hired directly by growers, with the other 22 percent sourced through labor contractors. Payments to stakeholders (lenders, hired labor, and nonoperator landlords) averaged $123,781 per vegetable and melon farm during 2004-06, 16 percent more than during 1998-2000, with the increase refl ecting the impact of lower interest rates on debt-servicing costs and increased labor productivity. Labor remains easily the largest stakeholder on U.S. farms. The total labor expense on U.S. farms and ranches (cash wages and contract labor) averaged nearly $24 billion annually in 2004-06. Commercial farms account for more than three-fourths of all hired labor expenses in agriculture. 3 Although the importance of labor varies by crop, vegetable and melon farming (especially for fresh-market crops) generally depends much more on hand labor than most other U.S. farm enterprises (although fruit and other horticultural products are also labor dependent). For example, fresh-market vegetables are often produced from transplants grown in a greenhouse and set in the ground by hand. Vegetables are also often thinned and cultivated by hand. Most fresh-market vegetables are grown under irrigation, which can also be labor-intensive, depending on the method employed (e.g., drip vs. fl ood or furrow). One of the most critical times for labor in the production cycle for fresh-market crops is during harvest, when the tender fresh vegetables are picked, sorted, and packed mostly by hand. Although some mechanization is beginning to appear in fresh-market crops (virtually all processing vegetables are machine harvested), such as green beans, sweet corn, and some leafy crops, hand labor remains a critical harvest-time input. For all specialized vegetable and melon farms, labor expenditures averaged 30 percent of total cash expenses-tops among all expense categories (fi g. 5). Labor's share of total cash expenses generally rises with farm size, ranging from 9 percent on small farms to 31 percent on large and very large farms. On small farms, the operator and family generally provide a greater share of the labor. On all U.S. farms and ranches, labor accounted for 14 percent of cash costs. Among the four census regions, the share of cash expenses represented by labor varied from a high of 36 percent in the South to a low of 28 percent in the Midwest. This difference can be partly explained by the prevalence of vegetable farms geared toward the production of processing vegetables such as sweet corn, snap beans, and green peas in the upper Midwest. Thanks largely to mechanization, fewer labor hours are required to produce vegetables used in canned, frozen, and dehydrated products, resulting in lower total and unit costs. In the South, vegetable farms largely supply the fresh market; only a small fraction (5 percent or less) of the Nation's processed vegetables is produced in this region."}, {"section_title": "Manufactured-Input Costs Rising", "text": "Rising prices for oil and natural gas have resulted in increased costs throughout the farm economy, with direct impacts felt in manufactured, or energy-based, inputs such as fuel, fertilizer, and pesticides. Vegetable and melon growers must combat a wide range of weeds, insects, and plant diseases to harvest the blemish-free produce most of today's consumers have come to expect. U.S. farms and ranches spent $12.5 billion on fertilizer (including soil conditioners such as lime) and another $8.8 billion on various pesticides (such as insecticides and fungicides) during 2004-06. Higher prices for natural gas (a feedstock for nitrogen fertilizers) and strong world demand for potash and phosphate helped drive fertilizer prices and expenses up over the past few years. Natural gas prices have eased since peaking in 2005, but since then, high crop prices have led to rising acreage and strong world demand and high prices for all fertilizers. This has increased expenses for vegetable and melon growers since 2005 even though the average farm's fertilizer and chemical expense had already risen 25 percent from 1998-2000 (table 1). Expenditures for fertilizers and chemicals, 18 percent of cash costs, were the second-largest cash expense for all specialized vegetable and melon farms. This national expense share was unchanged over each of the 3-year periods studied.  Fertilizer and agrichemical expenses as a share of cash expenses on vegetable and melon farms ranged from 9 percent on small farms to 18 percent on larger farms. During 2004-06, with the exception of the Northeast (where the expense was 15 percent), the fertilizer/chemical expense share was 18 percent for each region. The smaller share in the Northeast refl ected the prevalence of smaller vegetable farms in the region. These smaller farms likely raise a different mix of crops and practice a different intensity of production than larger operations. Although the prevalence of certifi ed organic vegetable acreage is not much different in the Northeast region (2 percent) than nationally (nearly 3 percent), practices such as use of manure in place of chemical fertilizers may be more common on smaller farms. In comparison, fertilizer and chemical use tends to be less intensive on total U.S. farms and ranches-where it represents about 13 percent of cash expenses-than on specialized vegetable farms, U.S. farms and ranches spent $13.4 billion for fuel, oil, and electricity during 2004-06. The unit cost of petroleum-based fuels such as diesel and gasoline rose sharply, as refl ected by a 156-percent jump in the index of prices paid by farmers for fuels between 1999 and 2006. As a result, fuel and oil expenses for farms in 2006 were much higher than in 1999. 4 Fuel and oil accounted for 5 percent of the cash expenses of all specialized vegetable and melon farms in 2004-06-up from 3 percent during both the 1998-2000 and 2001-03 periods. Much of the rise in manufactured-input costs occurred after 2005. As a result, other than the higher cost for fuels, these price increases are not well represented in the 2004-06 expense averages. During 2004-06, the fuel share of total cash costs declined as farm size increased, ranging from 9 percent for small farms to less than 5 percent for very large farms. Regionally, there were only minor differences in the fuel share of cash costs."}, {"section_title": "Interest Expenses Up, but Well Below Historic Peak", "text": "In addition to variable cash expenses, vegetable and melon farms have fi xed cash expenses, such as insurance premiums and interest payments. Interest expenses cover the cost of carrying both real estate and non-real-estate debt. Non-real-estate interest covers debt for such items as machinery purchases and annual operating loans. During 2004-06, U.S. farms and ranches incurred $12.5 billion in interest expense, with about 45 percent used to service non-real-estate debt. Although farm interest expenses have risen over the past decade, interest rates and expenses remain low relative to historical highs (Council of Economic Advisers). The low interest rates have kept this expense below the all-time nominal dollar highs experienced during the early 1980s, when short-term rates approached 20 percent. Non-real-estate interest expenses during 2004-06 were about half the peak reached during 1981-83. The lower interest rates have helped vegetable and melon growers cope with the cash-fl ow demands of the cost-price squeeze. Interest expenses on all specialized vegetable and melon farms averaged $8,217 per farm annually during 2004-06-down from $9,765 during 2001-03. This amounted to about 3 percent of all cash expenses in 2004-06. Although the interest expense was greater for beef and dairy farms, the 2004-06 interest expense on vegetable and melons farms was greater than the average across all farms and ranches ($4,654 per farm). This was a refl ection of generally higher land and operating costs for vegetables and melons. Much of the U.S. vegetable and melon industry is concentrated on relatively expensive land on the urban fringe and along coastal areas, which raises both land rent and interest on real estate debt. The per-acre operating costs for many vegetable and melon crops are also much greater than for fi eld crops such as wheat, corn, or soybeans, which elevates debt-servicing costs for short-term operating loans. Interest expenses for vegetable and melon farms decline with increasing farm size, with 10 percent of cash expenses of small farms consisting of interest payments, compared with 2 percent for very large vegetable farms. This may indicate that large farms are able to self-fi nance a greater portion of their operations and receive more favorable interest rates."}, {"section_title": "Other Expense Items", "text": "Seed and transplant expenses averaged $10.4 billion during 2004-06-up 17 percent from 2001-03 and 42 percent from 1998-2000. Most of the increase in seed expense has been the result of higher prices for seeds and transplants, with seed prices on a steady upward trend over the past decade. Between 1998-2000 and 2004-06, seed prices increased 38 percent, driven by the widespread development and adoption of various high-cost hybrid varieties. Although seed costs are higher, these new varieties are an important source of the productivity gains that have helped sustain the favorable fi nancial position of the vegetable and melon sector. After labor, nonoperator landlords who rent and lease land to farmers are the second-largest stakeholders in the vegetable and melon sector. During 2004-06, the average specialized vegetable and melon farm paid $29,192 annually to these stakeholders-10 percent of all cash expenses and the same share recorded in 1998-2000. For all of U.S. agriculture, these rental payments (excluding landlord capital consumption) averaged $12.6 billion (6 percent) during 2004-06, unchanged from 2001-03."}, {"section_title": "Selected Financial Ratios", "text": "Controlling production expenses, a key to the fi nancial viability of specialized vegetable and melon farms, can be viewed in several ways. To capture the short-and long-term dimensions of farm fi nancial viability, this analysis considers two measures of production expenses for the whole farm: (1) total cash expenses, which include variable expenses (such as seed, fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, repairs, and hired labor) plus fi xed expenses (overhead items such as rent, taxes, insurance, and interest payments), and (2) economic costs, which are total cash expenses plus an allowance for depreciation and imputed returns to management, land, and operator and unpaid labor. A farm may survive for a year if revenue covers no more than variable expenses, and perhaps for several years if revenue covers total cash expenses, particularly if the operator is able to draw on cash reserves, borrow against assets, or use income from off-farm sources. However, such measures are usually temporary. For longrun fi nancial viability, revenue must cover economic costs. For example, in the short run, the allowance for depreciation may be deferred, and aging machines may be repaired. But in the long run, as machinery wears out, a shortage of funds for replacing machinery may affect the ability of the farm business to generate revenue. The cash-expense ratio measures how much a farm operation must spend for inputs and overhead items for each dollar of income it produces (fi g. 6). It is calculated by dividing total cash expenses by gross cash farm income. According to this measure, specialized vegetable and melon farms spent $78 on inputs and overhead items for every $100 of income produced during the 2004-06 period-about the same as for all farms and ranches. The cashexpense ratio declined as farm size increased. The largest vegetable farms incurred $75 in cash expenses for every $100 of income they earned in 2004-06. In contrast, expenses of the smallest vegetable farms were more than the income they produced-$120 of cash expense for every $100 of income. Specialized vegetable and melon farms in the Northeast, a region dominated by small farms, had the highest cash-expense ratio. The economic cost ratio measures how much a farm operation must spend over the long run for all cost items (cash, noncash, and imputed expense) and is calculated by dividing total economic costs by gross farm income. According to this measure, specialized vegetable and melon farms incurred $88 in total economic costs for every $100 of income they earned during 2004-06. This compares with $98 in economic costs for all U.S. farms and ranches (USDA, ERS, ARMS Briefi ng Room). The smallest vegetable farms incurred total expenses of almost twice the income they produced-$193 of longrun expenses for every $100 of income-while larger farms produced enough income to cover total economic costs. Specialized vegetable and melon farms in the West, an area featuring many large farms, had the lowest economic cost ratio among the four census regions (fi g. 7)."}, {"section_title": "Major Issues Could Affect Future Expense Mix", "text": "Several issues in current national focus could change the mix of crops produced by vegetable and melon growers and how these crops are produced. These issues include immigration and labor, diet and health, and environmental issues related to water and agricultural chemical use. Changes in farming operations resulting from these concerns could affect the expense profi le of vegetable and melon farms. For example, if nutritional recommendations to eat 5 to 9 fruits and vegetables per day were taken to heart by consumers, more resources would need to be devoted to vegetables and melons, bidding up land costs and increasing rents. Further, if environmental   Specialized vegetable farms: Economic cost ratio by region, 2004-06 regulations were to dictate reductions in chemical fertilizer and pesticide use, the adoption of organic techniques or increased use of mechanical cultivation (to control weeds) would change the share of chemicals in the expense mix. Labor, a major expense of vegetable farms, is now at the forefront of a national debate. If stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws were to reduce the labor available to vegetable farms, fresh-market production of some crops might be reduced or eventually moved to other countries. Some fresh-market crops (e.g., snap beans, sweet corn, green peas, leaf lettuce, and asparagus) might be able to switch to mechanized harvesters. Mechanized harvesters are used on most processing crops and a portion of several freshmarket crops, but are generally not as effi cient or effective as hand harvesting for the fresh market. Widespread use of mechanization in the fresh market would reduce labor's share of expenses, while increasing capital and fuel costs. Ultimately, the path taken may be similar to that of processing vegetables, with total costs being reduced as effi ciency increases and seed varieties are coordinated with mechanization. Specialized vegetable and melon farms accounted for more than half of all the farms producing vegetables in the United States and contributed nearly 90 percent of the total value of U.S. vegetable production during 2004-2006. Vegetable and melon growers rely on products produced by dozens of input industries in order to produce the hundreds of commodities and products important to national health and well-being. Using data from USDA's Agricultural Resource and Management Survey (ARMS), this report detailed the major expense components of specialized U.S. vegetable and melon farms by region and farm size. The total cash expense per acre for specialized U.S. vegetable and melon farms increased 32 percent between 1998-2000 and 2004-06. Labor was found to account for 30 percent of total cash expenses of all vegetable and melon farms. For farms in the South, labor accounted for 36 percent of cash expenses. Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals made up the secondlargest expense category, with 18 percent of total cash expenses-a share unchanged during each of the 3-year periods studied. For farms in the Northeast, fertilizer and chemicals accounted for 15 percent of cash expenses, also largely unchanged over the study period. Fuel and oil accounted for 5 percent of total cash expenses, with only small regional variations. Expenses of specialized vegetable and melon farms vary by size of farm and by geographic location. Because of greater average farm size, a larger share of farm acres in vegetables and melons, and multiseason production ability in California and Arizona, farms in the West stood apart from those in the other three regions. Total average cash expenses in the West during 2004-06 were 84 percent greater than those in the next highest region (the South). The Midwest had the lowest expenses per acre because of the heavy concentration of lower cost, machine-harvested processing vegetables. In the current era of high-priced alternative fi eld crops, growers have a choice as to which crops to produce, and the cost of producing alternative crops-as well as the price received-has a bearing on the mix of crops grown."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The farm-level data for this report were derived from the USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS).
