Altitude, as used in this report, refers to distance above the vertical datum. The surficial or water table aquifer beneath the tribal lands is the primary source of potable water supply for at least 6 percent of the households on the tribal lands. Oyster fisheries and other marine ecosystems are critical to the livelihood of many residents living on the tribal lands, but are susceptible to contamination from groundwater entering the embayment from the surficial aquifer. Contamination of the surficial aquifer from flooding during intense coastal storms, nutrient loading from fertilizers, and septic effluent have been identified as potential sources of human and ecological health concerns on tribal lands. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) facilitated the installation of 17 water table wells on and adjacent to the tribal lands during March 2014. These wells were combined with other existing wells to create a 32-well water table monitoring network that was used to assess local hydrologic conditions. Survey-grade, global-navigation-satellite systems provided centimeter-level accuracy for positioning wellhead surveys. Water levels were measured by the USGS during May (spring) and November (fall) 2014 to evaluate seasonal effects on the water table. Water level measurements were made at high and low tide during May 2014 to identify potential effects on the water table caused by changes in tidal stage (tidal flux) in Shinnecock Bay. Water level contour maps indicate that the surficial aquifer is recharged by precipitation and upgradient groundwater flow that moves from the recharge zone located generally beneath Sunrise Highway, to the discharge zone beneath the tribal lands, and eventually discharges into the embayment, tidal creeks, and estuaries that bound the tribal lands to the east, south, and west. Water levels in many of the wells in the network fluctuated in response to precipitation, upgradient groundwater flow, and tidal flux in Shinnecock Bay. Water level altitudes ranged from 6.66 to 0.47 feet (ft) above the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 during the spring measurement period, and from 5.25 to -0.24 ft (NAVD 88) during fall 2014. Historically, annual and seasonal precipitation seem to indicate long-term water level trends in an index well located in the town of Southampton, correlates with changes in storage in the upper glacial aquifer, but does not necessarily indicate water level extremes in the shallow groundwater system. To place the study period in perspective, calendar year 2014 was the 32d wettest year on record, with precipitation for the year totaling 48.1 inches, a 2.6-percent increase from the annual average (46.9 inches per year), based on 81 years of complete record at the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service cooperative meteorological station at Bridgehampton, New York. Estimated recharge to the water table beneath the tribal lands from precipitation for 2014 is 25.4 inches. Tidal flux caused water levels in wells to fluctuate from 0.30 to -0.24 ft during May 2014. Water levels in wells located north of Old Fort Pond and beneath the southernmost extent of the tribal lands were most influenced by tidal flux. During June 2014, hydrographs indicate that tidal flux influenced water levels by 0.48 ft in a well located near the southernmost extent of the tribal lands approximately 0.3 miles north of Shinnecock Bay, and was zero at a well located approximately 0.5 miles south of Montauk Highway, and 0.4 miles west of Heady Creek, near the geographic center of the tribal lands. Tidal-influence delay time (time interval between peak hightide stage and corresponding peak high-water level) ranged from 1.75 hours at the well located near the southernmost extent of the tribal lands, to more than 4 hours at a well located north of Old Fort Pond, near the northwestern part of the tribal lands. Estimated hydraulic-conductivity values derived from the results of specific-capacity tests that were completed at nine observation wells during March 2015 were used to calculate average linear velocity. Average linear velocity along conceptualized flow-path segments of the upper glacial aquifer located beneath the tribal lands was estimated using an assumed effective porosity value, and hydraulic-conductivity and hydraulic-head values that were interpolated from measured values. Groundwater travel times were estimated by dividing the length of the flow-path segment by the average linear velocity along the flow-path segment. Total estimated groundwater travel time along a conceptualized flow path, beginning near Sunrise Highway and terminating at Shinnecock Bay, is approximately 45 years using a porosity value of 30 percent. A surficial-silty unit was identified from approximately 0 to 10 ft below land surface at multiple locations beneath the tribal lands. The lithology of the surficial unit was verified by interpreted gamma log results obtained from select wells, and auger-rig drill cuttings from an observation well located near the geographic center of the tribal lands. The altitude of the unit varies with topography and was delineated along a cross section line that trends north-south along the approximate centerline (spine) of the tribal lands. The altitude of the hydrogeologic contact between the upper glacial and the Magothy aquifers generally decreases from northwest to southeast, occurs at a depth ranging from about 150 to 200 ft beneath the tribal lands, and was identified at two locations north of the tribal lands, near Sunrise Highway and Sebonac Road. Results of electrical geophysical surveys indicate that the depth to the freshwater/saltwater interface decreases from north to south with decreasing water level altitude, and the Magothy and upper glacial aquifers contain saltwater at varying depths along the north-south trending section. Results of the surveys also indicate that the Magothy aquifer beneath the tribal lands contains brackish and salty water and is not considered a source of potable water supply. In general, depth to the interface increases with increasing geographic distance from the coastline.

The Shinnecock Nation lands encompass a reservation of approximately 1.2 square miles (760 acres), nominally 1.6 miles (mi) long, and 1 mi wide (variable). The tribal lands are south of Montauk Highway and between three interconnected marine water bodies-Heady Creek to the east, Shinnecock Bay to the south, and Old Fort Pond to the west. The approximate northernmost boundary of the tribal lands extends northeast from Old Fort Pond, along Montauk Highway and terminates at Heady Creek to the east. Residential and commercial properties of the town of Southampton are along Montauk Highway and north of the tribal lands. The Shinnecock Inlet is approximately 3 mi west of the southernmost extent of the tribal lands and hydraulically connects Shinnecock Bay to the Atlantic Ocean. The inlet was formed during The Great New England Hurricane of 1938 and is the easternmost inlet of five inlets that cut the discontinuous outer barrier island south of Long Island. The easternmost segment of the outer barrier island extends east from the Shinnecock Inlet to the village of Southampton, and is approximately 300 feet (ft) south of the southernmost extent of the tribal lands across Shinnecock Bay (fig. 1). The Shinnecock Nation became the 565th federally recognized Indian tribe by the United States Government in October 2010 (Shinnecock Nation, 2014). The Shinnecock Nation has a population of 662 residents who live in 256 housing units (U.S. Census, 2016). The Council of Trustees is an elected governing body comprising seven individuals that serve 2-year terms as the tribe's primary administrators. The Council of Trustees is advised by the Council of Elders, and assisted by 10 advisory committees that provide information to inform decision making (Shinnecock Nation, 2014). The advisory committees assist the council on a variety of issues including education, housing, governance, land management, natural resources, veteran's affairs, finance, education, public safety, and health care. In addition to assisting the Council of Trustees, the tribe's natural resource committee works with consultants from the private and public sector to better understand ongoing environmental and human health concerns on the tribal lands. Oyster fisheries and other marine ecosystems are critical to the livelihood of many residents living on the tribal lands, but are susceptible to contaminants entering the embayment from the shallow groundwater flow system. The quantity and quality of groundwater being discharged to marine water bodies may adversely affect the health and long-term sustainability of marine flora and fauna (Schubert and others, 2010). Harmful algal blooms resulting from nutrient enrichment are a substantial threat to the fisheries on Long Island and may be responsible for the decline of oyster yield from the Shinnecock Bay (Gobler and others, 2012). Rising sea level and saltwater intrusion, infiltration of storm overwash (surge) from intense coastal storms, nutrient loading from fertilizers, and septic effluent from wastewater disposal systems have been identified as potential sources of contamination to the surficial aquifer beneath the tribal lands. Approximately 6 percent of the households on the tribal lands use domestic wells that tap the surficial aquifer as their primary source of potable water supply (Shavonne Smith, Shinnecock Nation, written commun., 2014). Defining the configuration of the water table and the flow of shallow groundwater from recharge zones to the surrounding embayment is crucial to identifying sources of potential contamination. The Shinnecock Nation has asked the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to define baseline hydrologic conditions of the water table beneath the tribal lands to support decision making by tribal government and inform water resource, ecological, and infrastructure planning decisions.

This study was completed with cooperation from the Shinnecock Nation who provided access to their land and primary-source documents; and the Suffolk County Department of Health Services who drilled the new water table wells presented in this report."}, {"section_title": "Hydrogeologic Setting", "text": "The Shinnecock Nation tribal lands are underlain by a sequence of Quaternary-and Cretaceous-age sediments that unconformably overlie Precambrian crystalline bedrock ( fig. 2). The Quaternary-age sediments where permeable and saturated below the water table form the upper glacial aquifer (McClymonds and Franke, 1972). The Cretaceous-age sediments form, in descending order, the Magothy aquifer, Raritan confining unit, and Lloyd aquifer. The Quaternaryage sediments include Pleistocene moraine and outwash deposits and Holocene beach, marsh, and stream (fluvial) deposits ( fig. 3). The Pleistocene moraine deposits, known as Ronkonkoma Drift, are present north and northwest of the tribal lands (Swarzenski, 1963). Glaciotectonic processes caused folding and faulting of bedding in the moraine deposits (Nemickas and Koszalka, 1982), which are characterized by foreset beds composed of sand and gravel with lenses of till and silt and clay. Permeability of these sediments is highly variable because of their heterogeneous nature. The Pleistocene outwash south of the moraine is well sorted and highly permeable deposits of sand and gravel. These stratified deposits were carried as suspended sediment or bed load, or both, in melt water from the moraine and were laid down on a shallow dipping outwash plain in a moderate-to-lowenergy environment. In general, sediment sorting increases with distance from the moraine. Holocene beach and marsh sediments have been deposited near coastlines and tidal creeks. Permeability of these deposits is variable. The upper glacial aquifer unconformably overlies the Magothy aquifer at an altitude of about 200 ft below sea level near the tribal lands. The Magothy aquifer consists of fineto-medium-grained sand and clay with interbedded lenses of coarse sand and solid clay. The sediments were deposited in a transitional fluviodeltaic environment (Lonnie, 1982) and coarsen downward to gravels, which commonly are present at the base of this hydrogeologic unit. Clay minerals, muscovite, lignite, pyrite, and iron-oxide concretions are common in the Magothy aquifer (Perlmutter and Geraghty, 1963;McClymonds and Franke, 1972). The Magothy aquifer locally is about 700 ft thick (fig. 2;Smolensky and others, 1989). The Magothy aquifer is intruded by saltwater at lower altitudes (approximately 300 ft below sea level near Sunrise Highway), and is not considered a source of potable water supply on the southern fork of Long Island near the tribal lands. The Magothy aquifer unconformably overlies the Raritan confining unit at an altitude of about 900 ft below sea level near the tribal lands (Perlmutter and Geraghty, 1963). The Raritan confining unit is a low-permeability formation primarily composed of clay and silty clay with a few lenses of sand that hydraulically isolates the Magothy aquifer above from the Lloyd aquifer below. The Raritan confining unit locally is about 300 ft thick (fig. 2;Smolensky and others, 1989). The Raritan confining unit overlies the Lloyd aquifer at an altitude of about 900 ft below sea level near the tribal lands (fig. 2;Smolensky and others, 1989). The Lloyd aquifer consists of fine-to-coarse grained sand and gravel with interstitial clay and clay lenses. The Lloyd aquifer is confined by the Raritan clay and is poorly to moderately permeable (McClymonds and Franke, 1972). The Lloyd aquifer locally is about 250 ft thick. The Lloyd aquifer unconformably overlies Precambrian crystalline bedrock at an altitude of about 1,400 ft below sea level near the tribal lands (fig. 2;McClymonds and Franke, 1972). The Precambrian bedrock is composed of igneous and metamorphic rock that is poorly permeable. The bedrock surface generally dips to the southeast at about 65 feet per mile (McClymonds and Franke, 1972). Little information is available for the Raritan confining unit, Lloyd aquifer, and bedrock beneath the tribal lands because no test borings or wells have penetrated them in this area."}, {"section_title": "Climate and Precipitation", "text": "The climate of the Shinnecock Nation tribal lands is affected by the Atlantic Ocean, Great Peconic Bay, and the Long Island Sound (fig. 1). The large marine water bodies buffer the air temperature that contributes to relatively mild winters and cooler summers. The tribal lands (and the southern fork of Long Island in general) receives less precipitation in the form of snow during winter months as compared with areas further inland because of the warming effect the marine water bodies have on air temperature. During summer, prevailing winds out of the south and southwest move cooler air from the Atlantic Ocean to the peninsula (Nemickas and Koszalka, 1982). A National Weather Service (NWS) meteorological station (USC00300889) in Bridgehampton, N.Y., has operated continuously from summer 1930 to 2016 ( fig. 1). The station is approximately 8 mi east of the tribal lands in the town of Bridgehampton at an altitude of approximately 60 ft above sea level. Air temperature data recorded at the Bridgehampton meteorological station indicates that the 2014 annual mean temperature was   Fuller (1914) and Nemickas and Koszalka (1982). 50 degrees Fahrenheit (\u00b0F). The highest daily air temperature recorded for 2014 was 86 \u00b0F during September, and the lowest was 5 \u00b0F during January. Precipitation data from the Bridgehampton meteorological station was used to identify potential precipitation influence on the shallow groundwater flow system beneath the tribal lands (figs. 1, 4, and 5). Daily and monthly precipitation data were retrieved from Northeast Regional Climate Center records and tabulated in spreadsheets for analysis (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2015). The records indicate that a 7-month period of total monthly precipitation data is missing for 1930, an 8-month period is missing for 2011, a 5-month period is missing for 2012, and a 1-month period for 2013-average annual precipitation was not calculated for these years. Monthly precipitation totals were not calculated for months missing more than 3 days of daily data. In some cases, data were estimated from nearby meteorological stations to fill in missing total monthly precipitation values (figs. 4 and 5). Average annual precipitation for the 81-year period of complete record at Bridgehampton is 46.9 in/yr. During calendar year 1996, the Bridgehampton station recorded 67.5 in. of precipitation making it the wettest year on record. In 1965, the station recorded 30.7 in. of precipitation making it the driest year on record. Calendar year 2014 was the 32d wettest year on record with total annual precipitation of 48.1 in. or 2.6 percent greater than the annual average (figs. 4 and 5). The National Weather Service defines the winter season as December through February, the spring season as March through May, the summer season as June through August, and the fall season as September through November. The average total seasonal precipitation for winter, spring, summer, and fall recorded at the Bridgehampton station is 12.2, 12.2, 10.4 and 12.0 in., respectively. The total seasonal precipitation for winter 2013-14, and spring, summer, and fall 2014 is 14.8, 13.5, 6.8, and 11.9 in., respectively. Precipitation in winter 2013-14 and spring 2014 is 21 and 11 percent greater than seasonal  1930 1932 1934 1936 1938 1940 1942 1944 1946 1948 1950 1952 1954 1956 1958 1960 1962 1964 1966 1968 1970 1972 1974 1976 1978 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 Total annual precipitation, in inches   averages, and in summer and fall 2014 is 35 and 1 percent below the seasonal averages, respectively. Winter, spring, summer, and fall 2014 were the 13th, 31st, 69th, and 34th wettest seasons, respectively, on record at the Bridgehampton station (figs. 4 and 5). The growing season on the southern fork of Long Island is from April to September when evapotranspiration is at its highest for the year. Periods of water surplus are more frequent in the nongrowing season when compared with the growing season because of reduced evapotranspiration (Fetter, 1976). Total precipitation for the 2014 growing season is 15.9 in., which is 27 percent lower than the average total growingseason precipitation (21.8 in.) during the 82-year record at the Bridgehampton meteorological station. The total growingseason precipitation for 2014 ranked as the 11th driest growing season on record. Total precipitation for the 2014 nongrowing season is 23.2 in., which is 7 percent below the nongrowing season average total precipitation of 25.0 in. It is ranked as the 49th wettest nongrowing season during the 81-year record."}, {"section_title": "Methods of Investigation", "text": "The Suffolk County Department of Health Services (SCDHS), in cooperation with the USGS, drilled and constructed 17 observation wells in the upper glacial aquifer near the water table on and near the tribal lands beginning in March 2014. These observation wells were combined with existing fire-suppression wells and USGS or SCDHS observation wells completed in the water table aquifer to constitute a 32-well network used in this study ( fig. 6; table 1). Groundwater measurements from the network were taken during low and high tides in May and November 2014 to determine the configuration of the water table. Continuous water level recorders were deployed in select wells to identify the influence of tidal fluctuations and precipitation on the water table aquifer, and to provide water level data for estimating hydraulic conductivity from specific-capacity tests and compute travel times. Interpreted contours were created   Figure 6. Location of the Shinnecock Nation tribal lands study area, observation wells, and test borings, Suffolk County, New York. "}, {"section_title": "Water Table Well Network", "text": "Seventeen water table observation wells cased with 2-inch (in.) polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were installed on and near the tribal lands in 2014 ( fig. 6; table 1) using direct-push and hollow-stem-auger drilling methods. Criteria for selecting the observation well locations included (1) a representative distribution of the water table underlying the tribal lands, (2) outpost locations that could provide hydrologic boundary conditions and constrain contour lines, and (3) sparsely populated areas, absent of utility infrastructure, that are accessible to the drill rig. Screen-zone locations were determined by offsetting (installing) the top of the screen zone approximately 5 ft below the estimated depth-to-water using USGS depth-to-water maps (Monti and others, 2013). A direct-push drilling method was used to drill 15 water table wells ( fig. 6; table 1). The direct-push drilling method used percussion and the static vehicle weight as the source of energy to advance the tool through the subsurface. The penetrated unconsolidated material was displaced in the subsurface as the tool advanced; therefore, no soil samples were available for analysis (Geoprobe Systems, 2014). Two-in. diameter PVC casing was inserted through the drill stem and the drill stem was removed to set the well at the desired depth. The total sounded depth of the 15 observation wells that were drilled using the direct-push method ranged from 19 to 46 ft below the top of casing (wellhead). A hollow-stem auger drilling method was used to drill two of the water table wells (wells S-133042 and S-133047; fig. 6; table 1). Rotational speed and downward pressure on the augur flights were used to advance the auger head through the subsurface. Successive auger flights were added until the desired depth was reached. The hollow-stem drilling method allowed the well to be drilled and constructed simultaneously, which prevented caving of the borehole wall (Shuter and Teasdale, 1989). The construction of well S-133047 was atypical because approximately 75 ft of additional well casing (sump) was added below the screen zone so that borehole geophysical logs could help identify the lithology penetrated by the well drilling. The sounded depths of wells S-133042 and S-133047 were 61 and 103 ft below top of casing, respectively. Spin-up samples (auger cuttings) were collected during augering operations but were not considered representative of the penetrated formation except at very shallow depths. Ten observation wells were existing fire-suppression wells constructed in the 1970s and used instead of traditional fire hydrants as sources of water to suppress fire where no public water-supply network was available ( fig. 6; table 1). Water level depths in fire-suppression wells must be maintained within the suction limit of centrifugal pumps; therefore, the existence of a fire-suppression well at a given location usually indicates a depth to the water that is equal to or less than 25 ft (Nemickas and Koszalka, 1982). Fire-suppression wells are constructed of 6-in. steel casing; however, screen-zone altitude information is unavailable (or poorly documented) but must be located above, or at the altitude of the bottom of the well. Water levels in fire suppression wells can be considered representative of the water table altitude because the sounded well depths in these 10 wells range from 39 to 69 ft below the top of casing. Five observation wells were existing USGS or SCDHS observation wells ( fig. 6; table 1). Well diameter and construction material of these wells are variable. Sounded well depths range from 50 to 228 ft below top of casing."}, {"section_title": "Wellhead Surveying", "text": "Single-base real-time kinematics (RTK; commonly known as rover-base Global Position System [GPS]) were used to provide centimeter-level accuracy to position objective points (well locations and vertical control) in an altitude-sensitive-controlled network. The single-base RTK surveying method requires a base station composed of a dual-frequency receiver mounted over a benchmark having a known, precisely determined location and altitude. The base station receives a satellite signal that it rebroadcasts to the objective points (mobile or rover receivers at well locations) for comparison of the signal received at the base station to the satellite signal received by the rover units. The rover receiver then calculates a correction (difference) between the known (benchmark) location and the rover locations by taking fixes on the signal transmitted from the base station, as the coordinates of the base station are known. This comparison of signals received by the rover receiver generates a correction signal from the base station to the rover receiver, resulting in positional corrections to the rover receiver in real time. These corrections are used to derive an altitude at the objective points (Rydlund and Densmore, 2012). The single-base RTK method assumes similar satellite geometry and atmospheric conditions (and other sources of positional error) at the locations of the rover and base because of the relatively small baseline distance between stations. The baseline distance between the rover stations on the tribal lands, and the base station in Bridgehampton, N.Y., is approximately 5 mi ( fig. 1). Observed positional data were localized to increase the positional accuracy of the objective (rover) points using observations from two National Geodetic Survey (NGS) Level 2 benchmarks located within 1.5 mi of the tribal lands. The vertical control network was established over the course of 2 days during August 2014. Wellhead (top of casing) altitudes were determined by conventional (differential) leveling methods by measuring the vertical difference between a point of unknown altitude (wellhead) and a point of known altitude (established vertical control) (McCormac, 1983). Standard USGS differential leveling methods (Kenney, 2010) were followed during all leveling operations."}, {"section_title": "Water Level Measurements", "text": "Water level measurements were either taken manually with a chalked, graduated steel tape or a calibrated electric tape, from the wellhead (measuring point), or calculated from pressure-transducer output that was recorded automatically by data loggers installed on select observation wells. Manual depth-to-water measurements were made in accordance with standard USGS procedures (Cunningham and Schalk, 2011). Depth-to-water measurements were converted to water altitude (levels) values by subtracting the depth-to-water measurement from the wellhead altitude. Depth-to-water measurements using the steel tape or calibrated electric tape method are considered accurate to about 0.01 ft (Cunningham and Schalk, 2011). Vented submersible pressure transducers were installed in wells S-133040, S-133046, S-133047, S-133049, S-133053, and S-133054 and were programmed to measure and record the height of the water column above the sensor and water temperature every 15 minutes. Data logged on these instruments were downloaded and corrected for instrument drift based on manual depth-to-water measurements that were made from the wellhead measuring points during periodic field inspections from May to November 2014. These corrected data were then converted to water altitude values. Hydrographs were created from these data for analyses (figs. 7 and 8; appendixes 1 and 2).

This interpolation technique was used because it does not infer anomalies or trends in the data used to determine water table values at locations (points) where data do not exist, termed interpolation points or unknown-valued points. Interpolated values are a linear combination of products involving the known (measured) data values and corresponding weights; they are constrained by, and are required to be within the range of the known values. Natural Neighbor interpolation first creates Theissen polygons around the known data points (water table measurements at wells) that are closest to the interpolation point. Another polygon (Voronoi polygon) is then constructed around the interpolation point. The percentages of overlap between the Theissen polygons surrounding the known points and the Voronoi polygon surrounding the interpolation point are used to develop interpolation weights that associate the local values within each Theissen polygon to the unknown-valued point, thereby determining the value at the interpolation point (Sibson, 1981). A GIS tool that applied mathematical functions (Nearest Neighbor interpolation) to a continuous (raster) surface, as described above, was used to create a depth-to-water surface map. The interpolated (Natural Neighbor) surface was subtracted from a high-accuracy, three-dimensional land-surface altitude model (topography) of Suffolk County, which resulted in a continuous surface (raster) that defines the thickness of the unsaturated zone (depth-to-water) on the tribal lands. The land-surface altitude model was created using light detection and ranging (lidar) measurements based on the geospatial product for coastal flood mapping (U.S. Geological Survey, 2012) (Monti and others, 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Specific-Capacity Tests and Derived Estimates of Hydraulic Conductivity", "text": "Specific-capacity tests were completed at nine observation wells during March 2015 to collect the specific capacity of the well per foot of well screen, and to derive estimates for the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments opposite the screen of the water table wells (table 2).

The hydraulic conductivity of the sediments opposite the screens of the water table wells was estimated from specific-capacity test data using the empirical formula presented by McClymonds and Franke (1972), which is based on the Theis non-equilibrium equation (Theis and others, 1954). This formula expresses the average hydraulic conductivity as follows: where K avg is the average hydraulic conductivity of the material opposite the screened interval, in feet per day; and SC is specific capacity of the well per foot of well screen. For each specific-capacity test, a submersible pump was used to discharge water from the water table well, and a calibrated bucket and stopwatch were used to measure the discharge rate (Chu, 1996). Water levels in the pumped well were measured with a calibrated electric tape during ambient conditions before pumping started, and during the pumping to document water level drawdown (Stallman, 1971). Water levels in the pumped well also were recorded on a logarithmic schedule using a vented submersible pressure transducer.

Equilibrium or steady-state conditions were defined when the rate of water level change was less than or equal to 0.01 ft per 10 minutes (Cunningham and Schalk, 2011). Seven of the nine tested wells reached apparent equilibrium conditions within the first 10 minutes of pumping, and the remaining two wells reached apparent equilibrium conditions within the first 30 minutes (Halford and others, 2006). When possible, wells were pumped during predicted peak high or low tide in Shinnecock Bay, when the rate of sea-level change is minimal, to reduce the potential effects of tides on water levels. Water level drawdown data for wells S-133046 and S-133053 indicated a tidal influence after water levels reached apparent equilibrium sometime after pumping began. Water level fluctuation because of apparent tidal influence was omitted from the specific capacity per foot of well screen calculation because changes were minimal (less than 0.05 ft) and do not substantially affect the outcome, and tidal effects seemed to have occurred after apparent equilibrium was reached in the well."}, {"section_title": "Applied Borehole and Surface Geophysical Methods", "text": "Borehole-and surface-geophysical methods were applied during April 2015 to delineate subsurface lithology and estimate the depth of the freshwater/saltwater interface below the tribal lands.

The water table is the surface of the upper glacial aquifer and defines the top of the shallow groundwater flow system beneath the Shinnecock Nation tribal lands. The groundwater flow system is recharged by precipitation and upgradient groundwater flow that moves from the recharge zone located generally beneath Sunrise Highway to the marine water bodies that bound the tribal lands to the east, south, and west ( fig. 6). The altitude of the water table surface is influenced by daily tidal cycles in the Shinnecock Bay, seasonal variations in precipitation, and substantial local daily precipitation events. Water levels measured in the upper glacial aquifer characterize the configuration of the water table, and indicate distribution and movement of groundwater through the shallow flow system. The sediments in the upper glacial aquifer are of glacial origin and were deposited during the Pleistocene epoch. These sediments lie unconformably on top of the Cretaceous-age sediments that comprise the Magothy aquifer. Parts of the upper glacial and Magothy aquifers contain saltwater at variable depths beneath, and adjacent to, the tribal lands that is indicated by geophysical data. Results of gamma (nuclear) log surveys ( fig. 10) along cross section A-A\u2032 indicate a variable thickness of the upper glacial aquifer and depth to the underlying Magothy aquifer and a finegrained unit at land surface. Specific-capacity tests provided a means to assess the water-transmitting capacity and physical properties of the upper glacial aquifer. For the purpose of this study, the hydrologic assessment is limited to the upper glacial and the shallow Magothy aquifers located beneath, and adjacent to the Shinnecock Nation tribal lands."}, {"section_title": "Upper Glacial Aquifer", "text": "The glacial origin of sediments composing the upper glacial aquifer distinguished it from the underlying Magothy aquifer and allowed for identification of the geologic contact between these hydrogeologic units. The contact between the upper glacial aquifer and Magothy aquifer was interpreted from historical USGS records (core samples, geologist logs, geophysical logs, and published geologic contacts) and borehole gamma logs (Nemickas and Koszalka, 1982) (Smolensky and others, 1989). Pleistocene-age sediments that comprise the upper glacial aquifer tend to have more reactive (nonconservative) minerals as compared with the Cretaceous-age sediments which comprise the Magothy aquifer. In general, sediments weathered from granitic-type parent rocks deposited more than 34 million years ago will typically be quartz-rich and contain few reactive minerals such as feldspars, biotites, and hornblendes (Goldich, 1938) (Langmuir, 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Contact With Underlying Magothy Aquifer", "text": "The geologic contact of the upper glacial aquifer with the underlying Magothy aquifer was identified in a general northsouth trending section of borehole gamma logs extending from well S-73370, located north of Sunrise Highway and Sebonac Road, to the southernmost extent of the tribal lands, located south of observation well S-133053 (cross section A-A\u2032, fig. 10). The interpreted contact of the upper glacial aquifer with the Magothy aquifer is present beneath the tribal lands at about 150 to 200 ft bls, and generally decreases in altitude from northwest to southeast. Depth estimates for the contact of the upper glacial aquifer with the Magothy aquifer are based on the mineralogical content and alteration of the sediments constituting these hydrogeologic units, grain-size sorting (which indicates depositional environment), borehole geophysical logs, and previously published reports (Nemickas and Koszalka, 1982;Smolensky and others, 1989). The glacial drift deposits can range from well to poorly sorted and can contain a variety of silicate minerals weathered (physical, mechanical, chemical) from granitic-type parent bedrock. Generally, sediments that compose the upper glacial aquifer tend to be more chemically reactive than the older sediments in the Magothy aquifer. Upper glacial aquifer sediments tend to be less radioactive, and produce less natural gamma radiation, than sediments in the Magothy aquifer ( fig. 10). Borehole gamma logs indicate that sediments in the Magothy aquifer show a much greater range of gamma radiation than sediments in the upper glacial aquifer. This difference is related to the mineralogic composition and sediment sorting of the hydrogeologic units. The Magothy aquifer, in contrast with the upper glacial sediments, tends to be enriched with diagenetic clays (kaolinite clay and other stable clay-bearing minerals) that constitute weathering products from geochemical reactions (dissolution), as dissolved ions in groundwater react with nonconservative minerals (Goldich, 1938;Langmuir, 1997). Clay layers (lenses) deposited as coastal plain sediments (fluviodeltaic) in low-energy environments (Perlmutter and Geraghty, 1963) are also common in the Magothy aquifer. Natural gamma radiation typically increases in the Magothy aquifer, compared with the upper glacial aquifer, because of the increased clay content of the sediments that facilitated identification of the contact between these aquifers ( fig. 10)."}, {"section_title": "Surficial-Silty Unit", "text": "A surficial-silty unit was delineated from approximately 0 to 10 ft bls at wells S-133041, S-133045, S-133047, S-133048, S-133052, and S-133053.

The lithology of this unit was indicated by increased gamma radiation of surficial sediments and verified by analysis of auger-rig drill cuttings from observation well S-133047. The cuttings indicate a silty component from 0 to 5 ft below land surface, but were not analyzed below 5 ft bls because they are considered less representative of formation. The thickness of this unit seems to vary with topography from north to south along the cross section of A-A\u2032 ( fig. 10). Gamma logs indicate the altitude of the silty unit is variable and located subparallel to land-surface topography. The loess-like unit was deposited on top of the glacial outwash plain in a low-energy, possibly eolian (wind-blown) depositional environment. This unit may retard infiltration of storm overwash from coastal storm inundation and could decrease saltwater contamination of the water table aquifer. Additionally, recharge to the water table from precipitation may be reduced in areas where the surficial-silty unit is prominent because of inhibited infiltration and increased overland runoff. Further study is required to characterize this deposit.\nA surficial-silty hydrogeologic unit located within the upper glacial aquifer was confirmed by gamma logs recorded in wells along cross section A-A\u2032 that has implications for groundwater flow and the quality of groundwater on the tribal lands ( fig. 10). The silt may have been deposited on the shallow-dipping glacial outwash plain as windblown sediment from the Ronkonkoma moraine located north and northwest of the tribal lands. The low permeability of the surficial-silty unit has the potential to impede recharge to the water table from precipitation and to increase runoff. Where the silty unit is prominent and (or) competent, the fine-grained material can restrict downward movement of water and contaminants (Clawges and others, 1999) and can reduce contamination to the water table from infiltration of salty overwash during large coastal storms. The presence of ponded water from poor drainage could create an environment for mosquitos and other pests to thrive. Additional study would be required to map the surficial-silty unit elsewhere on the tribal lands in addition to where this unit has been identified above and below the water table along section A-A\u2032."}, {"section_title": "Water Table Configuration and Conceptualization of Groundwater Flow", "text": "The water table below tribal lands is the surface of the upper glacial aquifer at which atmospheric pressure is equal to pore-water pressure (Fetter, 2001). The depth to the water table beneath tribal lands generally increases with increasing distance from the coastline, and ranges from 0 ft bls near Shinnecock Bay, to 29 ft bls near Montauk Highway (figs. 9 and 10). Shallow groundwater primarily flows horizontally, lateral and parallel to bedding within the glacial-outwash deposits that comprise upper glacial aquifer. Groundwater flow tends to be many times greater in the horizontal direction (along bedding) as compared with the vertical direction (across bedding). Anisotropy of the upper glacial aquifer on Long Island is about 10:1, in other words, the hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal direction is 10 times greater than in the vertical direction (McClymonds and Franke, 1972). Conceptual descriptions of groundwater flow in this report are limited to horizontal-flow components because (1) a lack of well pairs screened at different altitudes in the upper glacial aquifer prevent analyses of vertical-flow components; and (2) historical anisotropy estimates for the upper glacial aquifer on Long Island (McClymonds and  indicate that more than 90 percent of groundwater flow is in the horizontal direction. Water level contour maps indicate that shallow groundwater flows from the recharge zone (highest water levels), generally beneath Sunrise Highway near the higher topography glacial moraine, to the discharge zone generally south of Montauk Highway near the lower topography glacial outwash, and eventually to the marine water bodies that bound the tribal lands (figs. 3 and 11). Shallow groundwater beneath tribal lands generally flows orthogonal to water level contours from the spine (north-south trending line that delineates the centerline of the peninsula) of the peninsula, to the east, south, and west, and discharges into the surrounding embayment and tidal estuaries as upward flow, and to tidal creeks as seepage or base flow ( fig. 11). Other sources of discharge include evapotranspiration, and surface runoff (Fetter, 1976). In general, the water table is higher and the slope of the water table (gradient) is steeper during spring as compared with fall because of increased precipitation during the spring months and lower evapotranspiration because of dormant vegetation during late fall, winter, and early spring. The amount of groundwater in the upper glacial aquifer is greater in spring than in fall as mainland springtime water level altitudes exceed 5 ft relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) near the recharge zone along the moraine near Sunrise Highway in wells S-132299, S-133043, and S-133563 (figs. 6 and 11). The altitudes of water levels in these wells are less than 5 ft in fall, indicating a decrease in slope of the water table surface in this area. The location of the 2-ft water level contour (line of equal water level) and the larger spacing between all water level contours during fall (reduced hydraulic-head gradient) compared with water level contours during spring indicates that groundwater in the shallow system is flowing slower in fall than in spring ( fig. 11). The 2-ft contour extends south from Montauk Highway about 0.6 mi at its most southern extent in spring 2014; the 2-ft contour extends south of Montauk Highway less than 0.15 mi at its most southern extent in fall 2014. The slope of the water table tends to increase near tidal creeks where the topographic gradient is larger because of erosion from tidal flux. Lower permeable sediments deposited near tidal creeks also may be responsible for the increased hydraulic gradient in this area. The slope of the water table near tidal creeks along Montauk Highway is less pronounced during fall when compared with spring. The only negative water level recorded during this study is -0.24 ft at well S-133049 during fall 2014, which could indicate a landward encroachment of saltwater beneath this area of the tribal lands."}, {"section_title": "Recharge", "text": "Recharge to the water table beneath the tribal lands comes from precipitation and upgradient groundwater flow. Water table contour maps indicate that groundwater generally flows south from the recharge zone (highest water table altitude) beneath Sunrise Highway to the discharge zone (lowest water table altitude) beneath the tribal lands ( fig. 11). Continuous water level data from select wells screened in the upper glacial aquifer indicate that water levels increase during and following most precipitation events ( fig. 7). Recharge from precipitation was estimated for calendar year 2014 by subtracting evapotranspiration and direct runoff from total precipitation. The estimate does not account for recharge from upgradient groundwater flow, which could be a substantial source of inflow considering the water table beneath the tribal lands is a groundwater discharge zone. Peterson (1986) (Thornthwaite and Mather, 1957). The estimated evapotranspiration value can be considered a representative average because no extreme annual precipitation events occurred for this time period. Average annual precipitation from 1968 to 1975 is 45.4 in., which is 3 percent lower than the average annual precipitation during the 81-year record.

The period from 2001 to 2010 averaged 53.2 in. of annual precipitation, which is 13 percent higher than the average total annual precipitation for the 81-year period of record. February (7.01 inches) and March (13.25 inches) 2010 rank as the wettest February and March of record because substantial daily precipitation events occurred on February 24-26 (4.93 in.), March 13th (2.81 in.), and March 29-30 (7.95 in.). Approximately 75 percent of the total precipitation for the two record months (February and March 2010) occurred during 6 days. Extreme daily precipitation events, combined with elevated ambient groundwater levels from above average seasonal recharge, or annual recharge, or both, generally indicate extremely high water level conditions in the shallow groundwater flow system near the tribal lands. The lowest water level altitude ever measured (4.01 ft) at well S-8836 was in August 1968 following the second driest July (0.61 inch) during the period of record, a 5-month period of below average precipitation (April-August), and an unprecedented dry period when 5 of the 6 previous years precipitation averaged 36.8 in., which is 22 percent below the average total annual precipitation. The summer of 1968 was the 9th driest summer during the period record. Extended periods of above or below average annual precipitation (drought) seem to have an additive (cumulative) effect on water levels in well S-8836 but do not necessarily indicate water level extremes. Large-scale daily precipitation events seem to have a greater effect on discrete water levels in well S-8836 than total annual precipitation. Total annual precipitation seems to indicate long-term water level trends, and correlates with annual changes in storage in the upper glacial aquifer, which is generally represented by water levels in well S-8836. Monthly water level altitudes from well S-8836 were plotted against total monthly precipitation for a 12-month period for 2014 to show the effects of seasonal precipitation on water levels (fig. 5). The seasonal response of water levels in well S-8836 to precipitation is generally considered representative of the water table beneath the Shinnecock Nation tribal lands ( fig. 5). The water level altitude in well S-8836 for 2014 was highest during April following 2 months of above average monthly precipitation. The second lowest water level (5.30 ft) for 2014 was recorded in October following below average monthly precipitation in June, July, August, and September. The lowest water level measured at well S-8836 (5.25 ft) for 2014 was in November following below average precipitation during 4 of the previous 6 months (June-November), and below average seasonal precipitation for the summer (35-percent below) and fall 2014 (1-percent below). The total growing-season precipitation for 2014 ranked as the 11th driest growing season on record. Discrete water level measurements from well S-8836 generally correlate with above or below average monthly precipitation, or seasonal precipitation, or both. Seasonal water levels in well S-8836 decreased from spring (May) to fall (November) 2014.

In general, the largest seasonal water level difference is north of Sunrise Highway near the recharge zone (moraine) and the smallest seasonal water level difference is at the extreme southern tip of the tribal lands, where water levels increased from spring to fall. The magnitude of seasonal water level changes generally increased from south to north, except at well S-133049, where water levels decreased by 1.22 ft from spring to fall. The water level altitude decreased throughout the well network from spring to fall except at wells S-133039 and S-133053-water level altitude in these wells increased less than 0.05 ft ( fig. 12). Spring water level altitudes ranged from 6.66 to 0.47 ft above sea level (asl) at wells S-132299 and S-133039, respectively, and on the tribal lands ranged from 2.82 to 0.98 ft asl for wells S-133040 and S-133049, respectively ( fig. 11).

These data were compared with tide stage data recorded at 15-minute intervals at a NOAA tidal station located at Ponquogue Point, New York (station 8512451; fig. 1), to identify potential tidal influence on the water table located beneath the tribal lands ( fig. 8; appendix 2).

A water level difference contour map was created to show the distribution of water level change from high tide to low tide during May 2014 ( fig. 13).

The line of zero water level change generally trends from the northeastern part of the tribal lands to the southwest. Water levels north of the zero water level change line generally have higher water levels at low tide compared with high tide; water levels to the south of the zero water level difference line generally have higher water levels at high tide compared with low tide.

Literature indicates that specific capacity per foot of well screen for upper glacial aquifer wells on Long Island range from 0.1 to greater than 4 gal/min/ft 2 (McClymonds and Franke, 1972). Seventyfive percent of the upper glacial wells tested are between 0.5 and 2.5 gal/min/ft 2 , and have a median value of 1.3.

The hydraulicconductivity estimates are less accurate for wells with screen lengths less than 15 ft because the contribution to discharge from materials above and below the screen zone may increase (McClymonds and Franke, 1972). Although the wells that were pumped for this project have 5-ft screen lengths, they are screened directly (1 to 5 ft) below the water table. The saturated thickness above the screen zone for the pumped wells is small so the contribution of downward flow to total discharge during pumping is reduced.

It is important to note that average linear velocity underestimates the true (or interstitial) velocity of a water particle moving through a porous media. True water particle velocity is greater than average linear velocity because particles of water move along nonlinear flow paths that are highly irregular and dependent on sediment sorting and grain size (Freeze and Cherry, 1979). The true velocity of a water particle moving through a porous media is indeterminate and irrelevant for this study.

The G-H principle uses the density ratio of freshwater (1.0 gram per cubic centimeter [g/cm 3 ]) to saltwater (1.025 g/cm 3 ) to estimate the depth of the interface below a datum. The principle states that for every 1 unit of freshwater head above a datum, the depth to the freshwater/saltwater interface is 40 units below the datum. The G-H principle assumes that the aquifer is under hydrostatic conditions, unconfined, and homogeneous. It underestimates the altitude of the freshwater/saltwater interface in some field settings when the hydrostatic assumptions are not satisfied-this is typical in coastal areas where subsurface freshwater flows to marine water bodies under steady-state (ambient) conditions. Additionally, the boundary separating the freshwater zone from saltwater zone is diffuse due to the geologic characteristics of the porous media and the intermixing of two chemically distinct waters, therefore it is more accurately defined as a transition zone where mixing of freshwater and saltwater occurs (Freeze and Cherry, 1979).

In general, depth to the interface increases with increasing geographic distance from the coastline, and increasing water table altitude. "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The water table below Shinnecock Nation tribal lands is contained mostly in highly permeable Pleistocene glacial drift and outwash sands; near the coastline and tidal creeks, Holocene beach and marsh deposits contain a water table. Results of specific-capacity tests indicate that hydraulic conductivity of the upper glacial aquifer (water table) ranges from 170 to feet per day beneath the tribal lands. The lowest hydraulic conductivity was measured at well S-133040 near the northwestern part of the tribal lands near Old Fort Pond. Hydraulic conductivity increases from the northwest to southeast beneath the tribal lands and generally decreases with decreasing distance to the Ronkonkoma Moraine, that is comprised of poorly sorted glacial drift deposits ( figs. 3 and 14). Water levels in water table observation wells were measured at high and low tide during May and November 2014. A water level difference map was created to show the spatial distribution of the apparent effect of tidal stage change in Shinnecock Bay on water levels in wells. Generally, water levels were typically higher at high tide than at low tide, or minimal change was indicated except near the northwestern part of the tribal lands. The map, however, indicates that water levels located near the northwestern part of the tribal lands were higher during low tide than at high tide. Apparent tidal effects on water levels in wells increased from northwest to southeast beneath the tribal lands. Analyses of hydrographs indicate that the largest tidalinfluence delay time occurred at well S-133040 near the northwestern part of the tribal lands. The hydrograph indicates an apparent 4.2-hour delay time between peak high-tide stage in Shinnecock Bay, and peak high-water level in the well. The small linear distance from the well to the embayment (approximately 500 feet) and the large tidal-influence delay time indicate that the sediment near this part of the tribal lands may not transmit energy from tidal flux (pressure wave) efficiently to the observation well because of low hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material between the well and Shinnecock Bay. This may be attributed to the proximity of S-133040 to the glacial drift deposits located northwest of the tribal lands, because sediment sorting decreases with distance to the moraine. The measured hydraulic conductivity at well S-133040 (170 feet per day) is characteristic of a silty sand (Freeze and Cherry, 1979), and the negative tidal-influence water level differential (water levels higher at low tide than at high tide) collected during May 2014, support the hypothesis that the aquifer material near this part of the tribal lands is of lower permeability compared with other areas. Furthermore, a gamma log recorded at well S-133040 shows an increase in gamma radiation near the well screen, which could indicate that the well penetrates fine-grained aquifer material derived from a radioactive (inorganic) parent (source) rock, as gamma radiation typically increases with decreasing grain size ( fig. 6 and appendix 3). The spatial extent of the low-permeability silty sand can be estimated, but is unknown at this point. Mapping of this silty-sand hydrogeologic unit would require additional study."}, {"section_title": "Saltwater in the Upper Glacial and Magothy Aquifers", "text": "The approximate depth of the freshwater/saltwater interface beneath the tribal lands ranges from 190 ft below land surface (-160 feet relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988) near Montauk Highway, to 0 feet below land surface (sea level) at the coastline. A cross section of the freshwater/saltwater interface along A-A\u2032 indicates the altitude of the interface is variable and increases from north to south with decreasing water table altitude. The upper glacial aquifer along A-A\u2032 contains freshwater from well S-73370 to Montauk Highway. At this point, the freshwater/saltwater interface intersects the hydrogeologic contact between the Magothy and upper glacial aquifers, and the upper glacial aquifer is salty at depth, below the interface. The pore water in the Magothy aquifer beneath the tribal lands is salty and not useful as a source of potable water supply. Residents with domestic supply wells withdraw potable water from the wedge-shaped (bubble) freshwater zone beneath the tribal lands. Distance from the well screen to the freshwater/saltwater interface can affect the quality and chemistry of the water. The delineation of the freshwater/saltwater interface can be used to inform plans to select the screen zone altitude for new (future) domestic supply wells on the tribal lands. In addition, temporal monitoring of the interface could indicate landward encroachment of salty water because of withdrawals from the shallow aquifer beneath the tribal lands, or from upgradient stresses."}, {"section_title": "Groundwater Flow", "text": "Shallow groundwater flows from the inland recharge zone (highest water levels), generally beneath Sunrise Highway, to the discharge zone generally south of Montauk Highway, and eventually to the marine water bodies that bound the tribal lands ( figs. 3 and 11). Groundwater flow in the shallow system beneath tribal lands is generally from the spine of the peninsula, to the east, south, and west, and discharges into the surrounding embayment and tidal estuaries as upward flow, and to tidal creeks as seepage or base flow. Paired observation wells screened at offset depth intervals could be used to define upward vertical-flow components in the groundwater flow system because the tribal lands are located on top of a coastal groundwater discharge zone. The freshwater\\saltwater interface that is located at variable depths beneath the tribal lands can also create an upward flow component because of the increased density of the saline water near the zone of diffusion. Paired observation wells were not included in this study. Shallow groundwater beneath the tribal lands primarily flows horizontally and parallel to bedding planes within glacial outwash deposits, and tends to be many times greater in the horizontal direction (along bedding planes) than in the vertical direction. Groundwater travel times can be calculated using the techniques and physical principles described in this report but are limited by the assumption that groundwater flow is only in the horizontal direction. Additionally, general or average estimates of the hydraulic properties that were used in time-of-travel calculations can seriously affect the outcome (accuracy) of the computations along the flow-line segments that extend from north of the tribal lands southward to Shinnecock Bay. Accurate and robust time-of-travel estimates can be determined using U.S. Geological Survey and (or) commercially available three-dimensional groundwater modeling software that can simulate the movement of a water particle through a complex, nonhomogeneous groundwater flow system as exists beneath the tribal lands. Deep test borings with sediment samples would support detailed geophysical data collection to help define the hydrogeologic framework and water quality of the upper glacial aquifer beneath the tribal lands. Additional studies that yield detailed information on the hydrogeology and hydraulic properties of the shallow groundwater flow system are required to support decision making by the tribe's natural resource team as they attempt to solve or mitigate human and ecological health concerns on the Shinnecock Nation tribal land."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Understanding the shallow groundwater flow system beneath the Shinnecock Nation tribal lands is critical to identifying potential sources of contamination to the upper glacial aquifer and the marine water bodies that bound the tribal lands to the east, south, and west. Many residents living on the tribal lands depend on the oyster fishery in Shinnecock Bay for their livelihood. Additionally, 6 percent of the households on the tribal lands withdraw water from the upper glacial aquifer as their primary source of potable water supply. In March 2014, the Suffolk County Department of Health Service (SCDHS), in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), drilled 17 water table wells on and adjacent to the tribal lands. These wells were combined with other existing wells to create a 32-well water table monitoring network that was used to assess local hydrologic conditions. Seasonal effects on the water table.-Groundwater levels measured during May and November 2014 were used to evaluate seasonal water level changes in wells. Seasonal water level differences observed in the 32-well network ranged from 2.18 to -0.03 feet (ft), and averaged 0.86 ft. For the wells located on the tribal lands, seasonal water level difference was less than 1 ft except at well S-133049 (1.22 ft). This anomalous condition may be due to the withdrawal of shallow groundwater for domestic use near the observation well during the summer and fall months. Total seasonal groundwater volume loss (change in storage) for the upper glacial aquifer beneath the tribal lands from May 2014 to November 2014 is approximately 20 million gallons, assuming a porosity of 30 percent. Tidal effects on the water table.-Water level measurements were made at high and low tide during May 2014 to identify potential effects on the water table caused by changes in tidal stage in Shinnecock Bay. Water level differences for wells on the tribal lands ranged from 0.30 to -0.11 at wells S-133053 and S-36403, respectively. Negative values indicate that groundwater levels are higher at low tide, as compared to high tide, in Shinnecock Bay. The -0.06 ft tidal water level difference for well S-133040, and the 4.2 hour time lag between peak high-tide stage and peak high-water level quantified from hydrograph data, indicate that water levels in this well are out-of-phase with the tidal cycle in Shinnecock Bay. The 0.30 ft water level difference for well S-133053, and a 1.75 hour time lag between peak high-tide stage and peak high-water level, indicates that this well may be in-phase with the tidal cycle in Shinnecock Bay. In general, tidal effects on water levels increase from the northwest to southeast in the shallow flow system beneath tribal lands. Recharge from precipitation.-Precipitation data from the Bridgehampton meteorological station was used to identify precipitation influence on the shallow groundwater flow system beneath the tribal lands. Average annual precipitation for the 81-year period of complete record at Bridgehampton is 46.9 inches per year. Total annual precipitation for 2014 is 48.1 inches and estimated recharge to the water table beneath the tribal lands from precipitation for 2014 is 25.4 inches. Water levels from water table observation well S-8836, were plotted against annual and monthly precipitation to show the effects of precipitation on historical groundwater levels from 1950 to present. Extended periods of above or below average annual precipitation (drought) seem to have an additive (cumulative) effect on water levels in well S-8836 but do not necessarily indicate water level extremes. Discrete water level measurements from well S-8836 generally correlate with monthly or seasonal precipitation. Seasonal water levels in well S-8836 decreased from spring to fall 2014. The highest water level altitude ever measured at well S-8836 was recorded during April 2010, which followed a 2-month period (February-March) of more than 20 inches of precipitation. The lowest water level altitude ever measured at well S-8836 was in August 1968 following the second driest July (0.61 inch) during the period of record, a 5-month period of below average precipitation (April-August), and an unprecedented dry period when 5 of the 6 previous years precipitation averaged 36.8 inches. Extreme daily precipitation events or extended periods of drought may indicate extreme water level conditions in the shallow groundwater system. Five of the six instrumented wells responded to substantial daily precipitation events during the period of record. Water levels in well S-133040 and S-133046 increased by 0.26 and 0.24 ft, respectively, apparently in response to an approximate 2.34-inch precipitation event that occurred during October 22 to 24, 2014. Water levels increased by 0.39 and 0.38 ft in S-133049 and S-133053, respectively, in response to a 0.4-inch precipitation event that occurred on August 13th. Well S-133047 apparently did not respond to any precipitation events during the period of record. Hydraulic conductivity.-Specific-capacity tests were completed at nine observation wells during March 2015 to derive estimates for the hydraulic conductivity of the sediments opposite the screen of the water table wells. Hydraulic-conductivity values estimated from specific capacity averaged 500 feet per day (ft/d), and ranged from 170 to 680 ft/d at wells S-133040 and S-133043, respectively. In general, hydraulic conductivity is lowest near the northwestern part of the tribal lands near Old Fort Pond, and increases from northwest near observation well S-133040 (less than 200 ft/d; appendix 3), to the south and southeast near well S-133054 (greater than 600 ft/d), and with increasing distance from the moraine. Measured hydraulic-conductivity values were used to create a continuous surface hydraulic-conductivity model of the shallow flow system beneath and adjacent to tribal lands for groundwater travel time estimates. Groundwater travel time.-Groundwater travel time was estimated along conceptualized flow-path segments (A-G) by dividing the length of the flow-path segment by the average linear velocity along the flow-path segment. Estimated average linear velocity ranges from 2.3 ft/d along flow-path segment B, to 0.5 ft/d along flow-path segments D, F, and G. The distance-weighted-mean linear velocity along the 2 mi flow path is 0.9 ft/d. Estimated groundwater travel time along flow segments A to G totaled 45.5 years using a porosity value of 30 percent. Surficial-silty unit.-A surficial-silty unit was delineated from approximately 0 to 10 ft bls at wells S-133041, S-133045, S-133047, S-133048, S-133052, and S-133053. Gamma logs indicate the altitude of the silty unit is variable and located subparallel to land-surface topography. The unit was deposited on top of the glacial outwash plain in a low-energy, possibly eolian (wind-blown) depositional environment. A sample from auger-rig spin up verified the lithology of this poorly permeable surficial unit. Upper glacial/Magothy aquifer geologic contact.-The interpreted contact of the upper glacial aquifer with the underlying Magothy aquifer is present beneath the tribal lands at about 150 to 200 ft bls and generally decreases in altitude from northwest to southeast. The geologic contact was interpreted from the mineralogical content and alteration of the sediments, grain-size sorting, borehole geophysical logs, and previously published reports. Generally, sediments that compose the upper glacial aquifer tend to be more chemically reactive than the older sediments in the Magothy aquifer. Upper glacial aquifer sediments tend to be less radioactive, and produce less natural gamma radiation, than sediments in the Magothy aquifer. Borehole gamma logs indicate that sediments in the Magothy aquifer show a much greater range of gamma radiation than sediments in the upper glacial aquifer. Freshwater/saltwater interface.-Borehole-and surfacegeophysical methods were applied during April 2015 to estimate the depth of the freshwater/saltwater interface below the tribal lands. The depth to the interface ranges from 325 ft near well S-132657, about 2 mi north of the tribal lands along Sebonac Road, to 18 ft at well S-133053 within 0.3 mi of Shinnecock Bay. The shape of the interface resembles a wedge with its base (deepest depth to the interface) located below the recharge area (high water levels) of the upper glacial (water table) aquifer north of the tribal lands and an estimated depth of the freshwater/saltwater interface at 0 ft near the coastline at the southernmost extent of the tribal lands. In general, depth to the interface increases with increasing geographic distance from the coastline. Results of the surveys also indicate that the upper glacial aquifer beneath the tribal lands contains brackish and salty water at variable depths that range from approximately 190 ft below land surface near Montauk Highway to 0 feet below land surface (sea level) at the coastline. The Magothy aquifer contains saltwater south of Montauk Highway and is not considered a source of potable water supply for the Shinnecock Nation.
