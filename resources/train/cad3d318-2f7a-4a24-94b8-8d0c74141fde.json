[{"section_title": "", "text": "Blacks and Hispanics have suffered a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 in the United States. [1][2][3] There has also been attention to rising rates in the rural United States. 4 However, with the exception of 2 recent commentaries in this journal, 5,6 little attention has been paid to intersections between rurality and race/ethnicity in COVID-19 outcomes. Rural does not automatically equate to White. Racial/ethnic minorities account for 20% of the US rural population, are geographically isolated, and face significant health challenges. 7 Therefore, it is important to understand the variation in COVID-19 outcomes across rural counties with greater racial/ethnic minority representation. Thus far, COVID-19 infection rates have been lower on average in rural than in urban counties, but a third of rural counties are in the White House Coronavirus Task Force \"red zone,\" 8 and rural counties may experience higher COVID-19 case fatality rates if outbreaks occur. 9,10 Rural populations are older and have higher rates of chronic health conditions that increase the risk of COVID-19 mortality. 10 Rural areas have also had lower testing rates and a less robust health care infrastructure to deal with cases. 9,10 Since 2010, 126 rural hospitals have closed. 11 Even when hospitals are available, most do not have the capacity to deal with a surge in cases, 12 and only 1% of the nation's ICU beds are located in rural areas. 13 Beyond these general risk factors, there are several reasons to expect higher COVID-19 mortality rates in rural counties with larger shares of Blacks and Hispanics. 3 Potential explanations include social determinants of health (eg, low socioeconomic status [SES], employment conditions, housing overcrowding, and inadequate health care access) and comorbidities. 6 Rural Blacks have lower SES 14 and life expectancy 13 than both rural Whites and urban Blacks. Rural Blacks also have higher rates of the same chronic diseases that increase the risk of death should one contract COVID-19 (heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory diseases) [15][16][17][18][19][20] and shamefully low access to health care. 21,22 Blacks are also more likely to work in service occupations that require face-to-face contact with customers 23 and are more likely than Whites to live in multigenerational homes and with extended kin, 24 conditions that reduce the ability to socially distance and increase the risk of disease transmission. 25 Moreover, during the early spread of COVID-19 in the United States, we found that testing rates were lower in states with more Black and poor residents. 26 All these factors increase the risk of COVID-19 death. Rural counties with large shares of Hispanics also appear to be at risk of high COVID-19 infection rates. A large share of rural Hispanics live in counties with meatpacking plants, which employ a disproportionate share of Hispanic workers. 27 A recent study showed that rural counties with meatpacking plants with outbreaks of COVID-19 have average infection rates 5 times higher than the rest of rural America. 28 Despite lower chronic disease rates than Whites, rural Hispanics have high poverty rates, 29 are often residentially segregated, 30 and face significant health care access challenges, including lower insurance rates 31 and deportation fears that may reduce their willingness to seek health care. 32 "}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Analyses were restricted to the US's 1,976 nonmetropolitan counties based on the USDA Economic Research Service's Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCCs). 33 Counties with RUCCs 4-9 were classified as nonmetropolitan. COVID-19 deaths from March 2 to July 26, 2020, came from USAFacts. 34 Our dependent variable was daily increase in deaths. We merged COVID-19 mortality data with data from the American Community Survey, 2014-18, 35 and Area Health Resource Files, 2018-19. 36 Our independent vari-ables were county percent non-Hispanic (NH) Black and percent Hispanic. Because these variables are highly skewed, we recoded them to quartiles for regression. Covariates included adjacency to a metropolitan county (RUCCs 4, 6, and 8), percentage aged 65+, median household income quartiles, county designation as a health professional shortage area, quartiles for physicians and hospital beds per 100,000 population, and state fixed effects. Because the outcome of interest is a longitudinal count (daily increase in deaths), we used mixed-effects negative binomial regression. Binomial models were preferred over Poisson because the outcome is overdispersed and has a high zero count. 37 The log of the population served as the offset variable in our models. Random intercepts accounted for repeated observations within counties. Model results are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRRs)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "There were 9,431 documented COVID-19 deaths across all US rural counties between March 2 and July 26, 2020. The mean is 4.77 deaths, with a mean rate of 17.8 per 100,000 population, and 42% of rural counties have had no documented deaths. As shown in Figure 1 Figure 2 shows a graded relationship between county percent Black and COVID-19 deaths. Both counts and rates are highest and have grown the fastest in the highest percent Black counties (Quartile 4). Counties in Q4 of percent Black have an average COVID-19 mortality rate of 39.3 per 100,000 population compared to 7.0 in Q1 counties. Mortality rates are much more comparable across the percent Hispanic quartiles than across the percent Black quartiles. Although mortality rates are highest in Q4, the gap between the highest and lowest percent Hispanic counties is much smaller than the gap between NH Black quartiles. Model results predicting the average daily increase in COVID-19 deaths as a function of county racial composition are presented in Table 1. IRRs represent the average percentage increase in the daily COVID-19 death rate. Model 1 controls only for state fixed effects. We found that counties with the highest percent Black and percent Hispanic populations have significantly higher average daily increases in COVID-19 deaths. The IRRs   change very little with the introduction of covariates (Model 2). Compared to counties with the lowest percent Black (Q1), counties with the highest percent Black (Q4) had an average daily increase that was 70% higher (IRR = 1.70, CI: 1.48-1.95, P < .001). Compared to counties with the lowest percent Hispanic (Q1), counties with the highest percent Hispanic (Q4) had an average daily increase that was 50% higher (IRR = 1.50, CI: 1.33-1.69, P < .001). Adjacency to a metropolitan county was associated with a 22% higher average daily increase in the mortality rate, and average daily increases were significantly lower in counties with higher median household income and more physicians per capita."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "COVID-19 mortality is not distributed equally across the rural United States, and the COVID-19 race penalty is not restricted to cities. In this national study of rural counties, we show that the average daily increase in COVID-19 mortality since early March 2020 has been significantly higher in rural counties with the largest shares of Black and Hispanic residents. This study did not examine potential explanations, but as with urban areas, the rural United States has a long legacy of structural and systemic racism that influences access to socioeconomic and health care resources, resulting in severe health inequities. COVID-19 is the latest in a long line of inequities that disproportionately affects racial minority populations. Several interventions are needed to reduce these geographic and racial/ethnic disparities. First, we must increase free COVID-19 testing in rural areas generally, but especially in rural areas with vulnerable population groups. Surveillance is important both because governments need to know where to allocate limited treatment resources and because individuals may be more likely to self-isolate if they know there are positive cases in their community, thereby reducing virus spread. 38 Second, local governments should work with trusted community-based organizations, including the faithbased community, to help educate, test and trace, and provide necessary resources to Black and Hispanic residents. Thanks to a long history of racist medical practices, there is understandable Black community distrust in the health care system. Hispanic immigrants may fear deportation should they seek services. Working with trusted community partners may facilitate community access to conduct testing and contact tracing and provide education and services. Ultimately, any policy intervention that aims to prevent or mitigate COVID-19 in rural America must prioritize places with the least resources, the most vulnerable populations, and the worst health outcomes. 5"}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Our analyses are ecological and do not examine individual mortality risk. We are also unable to calculate race-specific mortality rates with data currently available. It is possible that Whites also have higher COVID-19 mortality rates in counties with larger shares of Blacks and Hispanics if the conditions in these counties increase the risk of underlying health conditions that increase the risk of transmission and death (eg, insufficient testing, poor health care access, and social determinants). We encourage state and county health departments to release testing, infection, and mortality data by race/ethnicity so that researchers can identify intersections between geographic and racial/ethnic inequities."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The COVID-19 landscape changes rapidly. These preliminary findings reflect significantly higher mortality rates in high percent Black and Hispanic rural counties during the first 5 months of virus spread in the United States. These vulnerable populations have less access to health care and have higher rates of the same chronic health conditions that increase the risk of complications and death from COVID-19. As rates continue to rise, federal, state, and local governments must actquickly to properly educate residents about the severity of COVID-19 and provide adequate supplies and resources to these high-risk places."}]
