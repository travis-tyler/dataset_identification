The replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 can be broadly divided into three processes viral entry, viral RNA replication and lastly, viral assembly and exit from the host cell which is depicted in Figure 1 . Recent studies revealed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to that of SARS-CoV. Recently, Qamar et.al [14] reported the following phytochemicals screened against SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro which are depicted in Figure 2 .

The example of molecular graph is depicted in Figure 3 . Since physical properties or bioactivities are expressed in numbers whereas chemical structures are discrete graphs, in order to associate graphs with numbers one has to rely on graph-theoretical invariants such as local vertex invariants, e.g. vertex degree, distance sum, etc. Hundreds of topological indices have been introduced so far.\nThe main aim of this study is to develop a quantitative structure property relationship between two-dimensional(2D) topological indices, calculated physicochemical parameters of phytochemicals screened against SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro . Experimental data used in this study were taken from [14] . In this paper we have considered five topological indices viz., the first Zagreb index M 1 (G) [6] , the second Zagreb index M 2 (G) [6] , Randi\u0107 index R(G) [15] , Balban index J(G) [2, 3] and the sum-connectivity index SCI(G) [25] . The formulae for these topological indices are give below:\nwhere w(u) (resp. w(v)) denotes the sum of distances from u (resp. v) to all the other vertices of G.\nThe productivity of the above mentioned topological indices were tested using a data set of phytochemical, found at [2] and https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. The data set consists of the following data: docking score, binding affinity, molecular weight and topological polar surface, which is given in Table 1 . Note: The molecular weight and topological polar surface of NPACT00105 could not find. Therefore, we do not include this molecule for QSPR-analysis.\nThe topological indices values of phytochemical structures ate given in Table 2 .

In particular, the sum-connectivity index (SCI) and the first Zagreb index (M 1 ) are two important parameters to predict the molecular weight and the topological polar surface area of phytochemicals respectively. Our study may help the researchers in the field of lifescience in finding the anti-covid-19 drugs."}]
