[{"section_title": "", "text": "Research indicates that mathematics coursetaking is related to positive academic and economic outcomes. Studies have found that high school students who take more rather than fewer mathematics courses are more likely to attend college (Levine and Zimmerman 1995) and to have higher levels of educational attainment (Goodman 2011). Research also suggests high school students who complete higher level mathematics courses are more likely to attend college than are those who complete lower level mathematics courses (Lucas 1999) and are more likely to graduate from college (Rose and Betts 2001). Even among students with the same level of educational attainment, additional high school mathematics courses and higher levels of mathematics courses are associated with higher earnings as adults (Rose and Betts 2004). For several decades, national longitudinal surveys have collected data on high school mathematics coursetaking and student demographics. Using these data, researchers have consistently found that students from lower socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds take lower level courses than do those from higher SES backgrounds (Stevenson, Schiller, and Schneider 1994). This Brief uses more recent national data that include a new series of survey items to explore students' mathematics coursetaking and their motivations for this coursetaking. Previous research on students' coursetaking motivations has been mostly qualitative and has focused on the expectations of school staff, parents, and peers (McDonough 1997). Using the new data, this Brief is able to examine a broad range of student-reported motivations for mathematics coursetaking. Of particular interest here is how mathematics coursetaking, motivations for this coursetaking, and students' plans for after high school interact. The Brief explores this issue in several ways. First, it examines the relationship between students' coursetaking and their plans for the year after high school. Second, it examines self-reported motivations for coursetaking and their relationship to future plans. Finally, previous research has shown that students from higher SES backgrounds pursue more education than those from lower SES backgrounds (Rouse and Barrow 2006;Schnabel et al. 2002), which might explain SES differences in mathematics coursetaking. This Brief examines whether SES differences in mathematics coursetaking remain when comparing students with the same plans for after high school. Data for this Brief were derived from the Base-Year collection of the High School  "}, {"section_title": "STUDENTS' PLANS FOR THE YEAR AFTER HIGH SCHOOL", "text": "Percentage distribution of ninth-graders, by their plan for the year after high school: 2009 1 Includes students who reported that their plan for the year after high school was to enroll in both an associate's degree program and a bachelor' s degree program.

Each individual motivator is presented in this Brief in italics: (1) college entry or success (sometimes shortened to college), (2) school requirements, (3) personal interest, (4) career needs, (5) parent encouragement, and (6) school encouragement. 1 How does mathematics coursetaking differ among students with different post-high-school plans? Ninth-graders' current mathematics coursetaking can be categorized into three levels, based on the highest course taken: 3 \u2022 No mathematics or mathematics below algebra I (e.g., general mathematics); \u2022 Algebra I (including integrated mathematics I); and \u2022 Mathematics above algebra I (e.g., algebra II, geometry). In fall 2009, more than half of ninthgraders (52 percent) were taking algebra I, and an additional 29 percent were taking mathematics above algebra I (table 1). The remaining 19 percent is composed of 10 percent who were not taking a mathematics course and 9 percent who were taking a mathematics course below algebra I. In terms of their future mathematics coursetaking, 89 percent of ninthgraders reported that they plan to take 3 or more years of mathematics during high school, and most (61 percent) reported that they plan to take 4 or more years. 4  MATHEMATICS COURSETAKING, BY POST-HIGH-SCHOOL PLANS Percentage of ninth-graders taking mathematics above algebra I and percentage who plan to take 4 or more years of high school mathematics, by plan for the year after high school: 2009 1 Includes students who reported that their plan for the year after high school was to enroll in both an associate's degree program and a bachelor's degree program.

These findings do not mean that students see mathematics as irrelevant to work. When asked if their current mathematics course is useful for a future career, 84 percent of ninth-graders agreed that it is (see supplemental table 1 at http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/pubsinfo.asp?pubid=2015990). 3 Among students with the same post-high-school plans, do students from different socioeconomic backgrounds differ in terms of their mathematics coursetaking and their motivation for mathematics coursetaking?
