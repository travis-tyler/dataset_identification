[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Biomarkers from multiple modalities have been shown to correlate with cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD) and in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the relationships of these markers with each other, and the use of multiple markers in concert to predict an outcome of interest, are areas that are much less explored. Our objectives in this study were (1) to evaluate relationships among 17 biomarkers previously reported to associate with cognition in PD or AD and (2) to test performance of a five-biomarker classifier trained to recognize AD in identifying PD with dementia (PDD). To do this, we evaluated a cross-sectional cohort of PD patients (n = 75) across a spectrum of cognitive abilities. All PD participants had 17 baseline biomarkers from clinical, genetic, biochemical, and imaging modalities measured, and correlations among biomarkers were assessed by Spearman's rho and by hierarchical clustering. We found that internal correlation among all 17 candidate biomarkers was modest, showing a maximum pairwise correlation coefficient of 0.51. However, a five-marker subset panel derived from AD (CSF total tau, CSF phosphorylated tau, CSF amyloid beta 42, APOE genotype, and SPARE-AD imaging score) discriminated cognitively normal PD patients vs. PDD patients with 80% accuracy, when employed in a classifier originally trained to recognize AD. Thus, an AD-derived biomarker signature may identify PDD patients with moderately high accuracy, suggesting mechanisms shared with AD in some PDD patients. Based on five measures readily obtained during life, this AD-derived signature may prove useful in identifying PDD patients most likely to respond to AD-based crossover therapies."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common adult-onset neurodegenerative disease, affecting an estimated 1 million people in the United States alone [1, 2] . PD is pathologically characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain and the presence of Lewy body inclusions containing alpha-synuclein [3] .\nIn addition to the hallmark motor symptoms of bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity, most PD patients develop cognitive impairment (CI), with up to 83% progressing to dementia [4] [5] [6] [7] . PD patients who progress to dementia (PDD) have reduced quality of life and independence [6, 8] , which adds to the cost of care [9] , and results in additional stress for families and caregivers [9] .\nThe need to develop and to understand the role of various biomarkers for PD, and for endophenotypes within PD, is increasingly recognized [10] [11] [12] [13] . Defined by the National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Definitions Working Group, a biomarker is \"a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention\" [14] . While common uses of the term often refer to biochemical or imaging-based measures, in the most generic form, biomarkers might originate from multiple types of data. For the purposes of this paper, we considered clinical, genetic, biochemical, and imaging-based biomarkers.\nAlthough the field is still young, and far from consensus, various candidate biomarkers from these disparate modalities have been reported to associate with cognitive performance in PD (S1 Table) . Clinical correlates of poorer cognition in PD include older age [4] , greater motor severity [15] , male sex [16] , a motor phenotype characterized by postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) [4] , increased disease duration [17] , and the presence of hallucinations [18] or depression [15] . From the genetics literature, variation in APOE [19] , MAPT [20] , COMT [20] , and GBA [21] have been reported to moderate risk for CI in PD. Previously reported biochemical correlates of cognitive decline in PD include lower levels of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta, specifically the disease-implicated form of amyloid beta known as A\u03b242 [22, 23] , and lower levels of plasma epidermal growth factor (EGF) [24, 25] , while higher levels of CSF total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) associate with poorer cognition in Alzheimer disease (AD) [23] . Finally, many imaging-based measures have been reported to associate with cognitive performance in PD [26] ; as one example, a global pattern of brain atrophy known as the Spatial Pattern of Atrophy for Recognition of AD (SPARE-AD) has been reported to associate with cognitive decline in both AD [27] and PD [28] .\nIt is notable that many of the biochemical and imaging-based biomarkers for cognitive performance in PD are \"crossover\" biomarkers from AD. No doubt this reflects in part the relative paucity of available candidate PD biomarkers [29] . In addition, however, neuropathological data suggest that CI in PD and in AD may in fact share some mechanistic underpinnings. Specifically, postmortem examinations demonstrate that 29-50% of PDD patients have A\u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles characteristic of AD [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] concurrent with PD-defining alphasynuclein pathology.\nWhile there is an emerging literature on individual PD biomarkers, how biomarkers from various modalities correlate with each other, and whether they represent the same vs. different underlying biological processes, is not well understood. In the present study, we cross-sectionally evaluated a panel of 17 biomarkers spanning multiple modalities in a densely-characterized cohort of 75 PD patients across a spectrum of cognitive abilities. We sought to understand the relationship of these 17 biomarkers to each other. Additionally, because 5/17 markers in our panel have been strongly implicated in AD, we tested the hypothesis that an AD-derived biomarker signature might identify PDD as well."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Please see S1 Methods for additional details."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "UPenn Udall Cohort.

As expected, the two most closely correlated markers in our 75-subject cohort were MODHY and UPDRS-III score, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.51 (Fig 2A) . On the whole, however, we did not find that our 17 candidate biomarkers were highly internally correlated, in analyses performed with (S1 Fig) or without (Fig 2A, S2 Table) adjustment for cognition, suggesting that they may be capturing different biological signals.\nWe performed hierarchical cluster analyses to further explore correlations among candidate biomarkers, as well as among individuals in the cohort. As shown in Fig 2B, this cluster analysis corroborated our finding that candidate biomarkers were not highly internally correlated. Examining the patient dendrogram, however, we observed that at a high branchpoint, one cluster captured all the PDD subjects, with PD-CN and PD-MCI individuals admixed.\nA subset of five AD-derived biomarkers is highly correlated in AD but not in PD\nIn AD, five of the 17 candidate biomarkers assessed here have been reported to demonstrate substantial classification utility: CSF A\u03b242, CSF t-tau, CSF p-tau, the SPARE-AD pattern of global brain atrophy, and genotype at the APOE locus [19, 22, 23, 28] . We therefore investigated these five AD-derived markers in 109 cognitively normal and 101 AD subjects from the ADNI cohort.\nCSF A\u03b242, CSF t-tau, CSF p-tau, SPARE-AD score, and APOE genotype were strongly correlated in ADNI subjects (Fig 3A) . Moreover, evaluating subjects by hierarchical cluster analysis based on these five markers in the ADNI cohort resulted in a large cluster highly enriched in AD patients.\nWhen we performed a similar analysis using the five AD biomarkers in the UPenn Udall cohort, however, we found that they were less internally correlated in PD patients (Fig 3B) .

Indeed, some have argued that in at least some PD patients, dementia results from an \"Alzheimer\"-ization of the brain concomitant with the development of Lewy body inclusions containing alpha-synuclein [50] .\nTo evaluate this hypothesis, we first trained a logistic regression classifier using these five markers to classify cognitively normal vs. AD subjects from ADNI.\nAs expected based on the cluster analyses, a classifier using CSF p-tau, CSF t-tau, SPA-RE-AD score, APOE genotype and CSF A\u03b242 measures performed well in discriminating AD from cognitively normal ADNI subjects. Indeed, in ten-fold cross-validation within the ADNI cohort, our logistic regression classifier separated AD vs. normal subjects with an accuracy of >96% (95% CI 0.93-0.98, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) 0.99, sensitivity 0.96, specificity 0.96, Fig 3D) .\nThe logistic regression classifier was trained in the ADNI cohort to identify AD; we next asked if this exact classifier could discriminate PD-CN vs. PDD patients from the UPenn Udall cohort. Indeed, the five-marker AD-derived classifier distinguished PD-CN from PDD subjects with 80% accuracy (95% CI 0.67-0.90, AUC 0.87, sensitivity 0.88, specificity 0.79, Fig 3D) . Rerunning this analysis using the 74 PD individuals with no imputed data (one SPARE-AD score for one PD patient was imputed) did not change the results (accuracy 0.80, AUC 0.86).\nBecause our cohort was prospectively enrolled, PD patients in different cognitive categories were not age-matched, reflecting, instead, the innate distribution of ages found in PD patients across a spectrum of cognitive performance. As a consequence, PDD patients were significantly older than individuals in other cognitive categories. We therefore asked whether the older age of the PDD individuals could be driving the ability of our AD-derived classifier to identify them. As shown in Fig 4A, however, PD patients classified as AD-like by this five-marker classifier represent a range of ages, with two-thirds falling within the interquartile range of ages for the PD-CN group.\nWe further asked whether each of the markers individually associated with cognitive category and whether this association persisted after adjustment for age. Of the five markers comprising our AD-derived classifier, only two associated significantly with cognitive category in bivariate logistic regressions-SPARE-AD score and CSF A\u03b242. Notably, in the five-marker AD-derived classifier, SPARE-AD score contributed most to classification, with the largest coefficient. SPARE-AD score remained significantly associated with cognitive category after adjustment for age, while the p-value for association of CSF A\u03b242 levels with cognitive category increased from 0.005 to 0.088 after adjustment for age. In both cases, the addition of age as a covariate did not change the direction and minimally affected the coefficient for the biomarker of interest.

These two groups were compared for performance on memory-specific tests.

However, in most cases, a small number of candidate markers, usually from the same modality, are used to predict an outcome of interest. As a consequence, we gain an increasing number of associations between individual markers and various clinical outcomes, but the relationships among these individual markers remain unclear.\nIn PD, the clinical outcome of CI and dementia has been studied in detail, with the advent of multiple candidate biomarkers reported to correlate with current cognitive state and future cognitive decline [4, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 25, 51] . The focus on CI and dementia in PD reflects the fact that this aspect of PD occurs in the vast majority of patients [4] [5] [6] [7] , exacting a significant personal and financial cost [9] . Moreover, while there are currently no neuroprotective therapies and only marginally effective symptomatic therapies for PD-MCI and PDD, at least two broad mechanisms for explaining this PD phenotype exist.\nSpecifically, Braak and Braak have hypothesized that dementia may develop in PD as alphasynuclein pathology spreads from brainstem-limited patterns to involvement of the neocortex [52, 53] . An alternative, but not mutually exclusive, mechanistic hypothesis for the development of dementia in PD has emphasized the role of the concomitant AD-defining senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles found in a large proportion of PD patients; put simply, proponents of this theory posit that an AD-like process may drive the development of PDD in at least some patients [34, 50, [54] [55] [56] [57] .\nHere, we first sought to understand relationships among multiple individual markers that have been linked to CI and dementia in PD. To this end, we evaluated a deeply characterized cohort of PD patients, ascertaining their characteristics across 17 candidate biomarkers spanning multiple modalities. These markers have not previously been studied together in a cohort of patients.\nSomewhat surprisingly, these 17 markers did not show a high degree of internal correlation, with the two most highly-correlated markers, MODHY and UPDRS-III score, demonstrating a correlation coefficient of just 0.51 across the 75 PD patients in our cohort.\nOur second objective in this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that an AD-like process may drive the development of PDD. To address this question, we evaluated a subset of five markers strongly linked to AD-CSF p-tau, CSF t-tau, SPARE-AD score, APOE genotype, and CSF A\u03b242 -in our PD patients. Intriguingly, a logistic regression classifier using these five markers trained to recognize AD could also discriminate PD-CN from PDD subjects. Indeed, classification accuracy was high, at 80%, with balanced sensitivity and specificity, despite the relative lack of internal correlation among these markers in PD subjects compared to AD subjects. Our finding is thus consistent with the hypothesis that the development of dementia in PD and AD may share biological mechanisms, manifesting as a shared biomarker signature. Supporting this hypothesis is our clinical finding that cognitively impaired PD patients deemed AD-like have poorer performance on both the memory subsection of the Mattis DRS and on the HVLT-R recall than cognitively impaired PD patients who are classified as not AD-like. We note here that AD-like PD patients had lower scores for both immediate free recall and recognition on the HVLT-R, but only the former difference was statistically significant. It is possible that this reflects small sample numbers and that a larger sample size would show differences between groups on both aspects of the HVLT-R. However, some PD patients have been reported to show impairment of free recall with relative sparing of recognition memory compared to AD patients [43, 58, 59] , raising the possibility that even in cognitively impaired PD patients with an AD-like biomarker profile, the specific nature of the memory deficit may still differ from AD.\nOur in vivo biomarker findings corroborate multiple lines of evidence suggesting some degree of shared pathophysiology in AD and PDD. First, postmortem neuropathological examination reveals that up to 50% of PDD patients have concomitant AD pathology [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Second, biochemical investigations suggest that the individual proteins aggregating in PD and in AD-and in particular the alpha-synuclein protein characteristic of PD, and tau protein characteristic of AD-may each enhance the formation of pathological inclusions of the other protein [60] [61] [62] [63] .\nSeveral limitations of our study should be acknowledged. First, we studied a relatively small sample of PD patients. Because of this limitation, we chose not to develop and cross-validate classifiers within the PD group itself at the present time, as our numbers within this group might be insufficient to develop robust classifiers. In addition, further validation in larger cohorts of the predictive ability of our five-marker AD-derived classifier to correctly identify PDD patients would be a valuable addition to the current report. It is important to note, however, that the strength of our study lies not in the number of subjects enrolled, but in the depth of their characterization across multiple modalities, resulting in a dense and highly complete dataset collected from a prospectively enrolled cohort, which will be made publicly available. Indeed, it is precisely the depth of characterization in our cohort that allows us to demonstrate, for the first time, the relative lack of correlation among these disparate cognitive biomarkers.\nSecond, our cohort has moderate PD, with a median disease duration of 6.9 years. Thus, it remains to be seen whether our findings, and in particular the ability of an AD-derived classifier to correctly identify PDD subjects, would generalize to other stages of disease.\nThird, as is frequently encountered in the clinic, the PDD patients in our study are older than the PD-MCI or PD-CN patients. We guarded against the possibility that our AD-derived classifier may simply be detecting an aged biomarker profile by evaluating the age distribution of individuals deemed AD-like and by performing further analyses adjusting for age. However, it is possible that at least some of the signal detected by our classifier could still be due to increased age. In this regard, given the younger age of the PD-MCI individuals in our cohort, it will be interesting to see if those classified as AD-like now will be more likely to develop dementia in the future.\nIn summary, we show that it is possible to use a small panel of biomarkers to discriminate PD patients with and without dementia, and, further, that the discriminating biomarkers may reflect an underlying process shared with AD. We note that the concept of shared pathophysiology between AD and PD/PDD has important ramifications. In AD, therapies targeting the generation and deposition of A\u03b2 are in clinical trials now [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] . Should any of these agents show promise in large human AD trials, evidence for shared pathophysiology in these two diseases might suggest the evaluation of these therapeutics to prevent dementia in PD-CN subjects at greatest risk of developing dementia, or to treat manifest dementia in PDD patients. Moreover, the development of classifiers selecting the most AD-like of PD patients-and thus the PD patients most likely to respond to \"crossover\" therapies-may be of substantial practical use.
