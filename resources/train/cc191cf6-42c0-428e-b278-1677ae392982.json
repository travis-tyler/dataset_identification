Methods: We searched PubMed, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and used the Web of Science tool in June 2015. Studies were included if they were published in English, presented results from primary or secondary analyses, used data about children in the US, provided obesity incidence data on children 0 to 18 years born after 1970, and did not pertain to clinically defined populations (disease, medication use, etc.). Author(s), study year, study design, location, sample size, age, and obesity incidence estimates were abstracted.\nResults: Nineteen studies were included, three of which used nationally representative data. The median study-specific annual obesity incidences among studies using U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) growth charts were 4.0%, 3.2%, and 1.8% for preschool (2.0-4.9 years), school aged (5.0-12.9 years), and adolescence (13.0-18.0 years), respectively. This pattern of declining obesity incidence with age was consistent between and within studies.\nConclusions: Studies of childhood obesity in the US indicate declining incidence with age. Childhood obesity prevention efforts should be targeted to ages before obesity onset. Longitudinal data and consistent obesity definitions that correlate with long-term morbidity are needed to better characterize the life history of obesity."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "C hildhood obesity is a major public health concern, as the prevalence of obesity worldwide is believed to be increasing. 1 In the United States, obesity prevalence among children ages 6-11 years more than tripled from 4.2%-15.3% between 1963-1965 and 1999-2000 . 1 Although recent studies have reported decreased obesity prevalence among younger children, in 2011-2012, 16 .9% of children in the United States were classified as obese, with prevalence being highest at ages 12-19 and lowest at ages 2-5 years. 2 In the past three decades, increases in obesity prevalence have been observed among children of all ages, 2,3 though differences in obesity prevalence have been documented by age, 2 race and ethnicity, 1 gender, 2 and geographic region. 4 Obesity in childhood has been associated with subsequent obesity in adulthood, other chronic diseases, and high medical costs, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] so understanding the emergence of obesity in childhood may offer opportunities to improve health at all ages.\nWhile the prevalence of obesity among children in the United States has been well documented, 2, 3 less is known about obesity incidence. Prevalence of obesity for a given age group is a composite of preceding and concurrent incidence and remission for children. Detailing age-specific obesity incidence is important for elucidating peak periods of obesity onset to identify and maximize intervention opportunities and minimize healthcare costs. Tracking of childhood obesity into adulthood calls for intervention efforts to prevent obesity that are timed to precede onset, and age-specific incidence estimates contribute to this perspective. 13, 14 Estimating incidence for racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups may be useful for understanding the disparities in obesity that have been observed across age groups. 6, [10] [11] [12] We present results from a systematic review of studies that have estimated the incidence of obesity among children in the United States."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The procedures used in this review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) statement. We conducted systematic searches of peer-reviewed journals in June 2015 using PubMed, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Key words used for all searches were ''obesity'' and ''incidence.'' Incidence was searched as a medical subject heading (MeSH) term in PubMed. ''Child: birth-18 years'' was used as a search filter. Searches were not restricted by publication date. The studies identified through these search criteria were reviewed independently by two authors according to the following criteria: (1) published in English; (2) presented findings from analysis of primary or secondary data; (3) presented data from the United States; (4) provided estimates of obesity incidence among children ages 0-18 years or provided data from which incidence could be calculated; and (5) used data from individuals born after 1970. Studies of clinically defined populations, specifically those with a particular disease or medication regimen, were excluded, but control arms of intervention trials were included. Hand searches of the references of these articles were performed and the Web of Science Cited Reference Search tool, which identifies other articles referencing a specific study, was used for key articles. This review protocol was not registered prior to its outset.\nA data extraction spreadsheet was used to assess whether articles met inclusion criteria and to compare studies. For each study, the first author collected the following information: author(s) and year of publication; years of data collection; study design (cohort versus randomized trial; representativeness); location in the United States; sample size; age at baseline and follow-up; years of birth; and obesity incidence estimates. If the study included data for individuals both younger and older than 18, only data for children less than 18 years were retained if age categorization permitted such subsetting. If subsetting was not possible, the study was excluded. Among intervention studies, only data on the control or nonintervention group were abstracted. One study did not estimate incidence but provided sufficient data for us to perform the calculation (number of children at risk for obesity at baseline and number of children obese at a later point). We reported cumulative incidence (incidence proportion) from each study, defined as the number of newly obese children during study follow-up divided by the number of nonobese children potentially at risk for obesity at baseline. Because studies varied in length of follow-up, we estimated annualized incidence proportions using cumulative incidence estimates from each study divided by years of follow-up.\nStudies included convenience and representative samples, used differing study designs (e.g., observational cohort or randomized controlled trial), measures of adiposity (body mass index [BMI] or skin fold thickness), and definitions of obesity (cutpoints defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] International Obesity Task Force [IOTF], etc.). Such heterogeneity made formal statistical meta-analysis impractical. Similarly, this variation in study design and obesity measurement made it difficult to use uniform criteria or a single measurement to systematically assess bias. Potential biases at study and outcome levels are discussed in the limitations section.\nThe majority (15 of 19) of studies measured adiposity with BMI and defined obesity according to CDC cutpoints for BMI-for-age-and-sex at or above 95th percentile, or used CDC weight-for-length charts for infants. Due to the small number of studies within each age group, studies using the current CDC cutpoints or weight-for-length charts for infants were summarized by the median studyspecific annualized incidence for each of the following age groups: infancy (0-1.9 years), preschool (2.0-4.9 years), school aged (5.0-12.9 years), and adolescence (13.0-18.0 years). These age groups were selected because they capture major developmental stages. Studies on children whose ages spanned two groups were included in median calculations of both age groups. To visualize age-specific trends in incident obesity, we plotted the annualized cumulative incidence of obesity against the age range of study follow-up. This was summarized with a weighted simple linear regression with weights for each study, defined as the inverse of the variance of the study-specific incidence estimate. Study-specific baseline risk varied by known demographic factors, so studies were categorized into two groups: (1) predominantly high-risk population (> 50% racial/ethnic minorities or a single high-risk socioeconomic community) and (2) not predominantly high-risk population (all other studies).\nTo consider temporal changes in environments that may have been linked with obesity patterns over the decades being studied, a sensitivity analysis was performed by decade of birth. In the 2000s, a shift in the obesity category definition occurred, so we examined whether the change influenced our findings. A second sensitivity analysis examined only studies using the CDC obesity definition published during and after 2007."}, {"section_title": "15,16", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Literature Identification and Selection", "text": "We identified 2135 articles: 1068 in PubMed, 698 in EMBASE, and 369 in CINAHL (Figure 1 ).

Three of these, including a nationally representative study, reported higher obesity incidences among boys compared with girls, 20, 22, 30 with a maximum difference in annual incidence of 0.9% (5.5% and 4.6% for boys and girls, respectively) at ages 11.7-13.5 years. 20 Two studies reported higher annual obesity incidence among girls: 3.2% for girls versus 0.5% for boys 11 and 5.0% for girls versus 4.0% for boys, 26 respectively.

The same trend of decreasing childhood obesity incidence with increasing age was observed when restricting to studies published during and after 2007 (see online supplementary Figure S1 at www.liebertpub.com/jpm and at www.liebertonline.com) after most researchers had adopted proposed terminology changes occurring in the 2000s."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This systematic review synthesized current knowledge about the incidence of obesity from early childhood through adolescence in the United States. The main finding is that across studies, annual incidence declined with age: the median incidence proportion was 4.0% at ages 0-1.9 years, 4.0% at 2.0-4.9 years, 3.2% at 5.0-12.9 years, and 1.8% at 13.0-18.0 years.\nThese patterns are also consistent with some studies of obesity incidence among adults in the United States. A study using 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data used self-reported height and weight at the time of the study and one year previously to calculate obesity incidence among adults \u202118 years in the United States, and found obesity incidence decreased with age: 6.4% at ages 18-29 years, 4.8% at 30-49 years, 3.3% at 50-69 years, and 1.5% at ages 70 years and over. 33 These patterns were robust to adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region, physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking, alcohol use, and baseline BMI. However, a study using the nationally representative National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health Waves II and III) estimated annual incidences at 1.9% at ages 13-15 years, 2.4% at 16-17 years, and 2.4% at 18-20 years. 34 The declining incidence with age could suggest exhaustion of the pool of children susceptible to incident obesity, or may reflect aspects of growth dynamics associated with development, such as regression from obese to nonobese states, adiposity rebound, and pubertal changes in body composition. Four studies reported obesity remission rates in addition to incidence. Among obese infants (0-23 months), 63.5% were not obese at follow up 24-35 months later. 22 One study reported annual remission rates ranging from 13.3%-20.3% for children ages 5-14 years. 10 A third study reported annual remission rates between 8.0% and 24.1% among adolescents. 21 The fourth study indirectly reported annual remission for infants (0-1 year) of 64.4% and for ages 3-4 years at 37.5%. 29 Relating the observed patterns in age-specific obesity incidence with what is known about patterns in obesity prevalence requires further understanding of the timing and reasons for obesity remission and normal growth dynamics.\nThe downward trend of obesity incidence with age observed in this study is consistent with some studies from outside the United States. For example, a large prospective cohort in southwest England in 2011 reported annual incidences of 1.2% at 3-11 years and 0.4% at 11-15 years. 35 Other studies from outside the United States have shown different patterns. In a 2012 study in northern Germany, annual obesity incidence was 0.6% at mean ages of 2-6 years and 0.7% at mean ages of 6-10 years. 36 Incidence patterns may differ by race and ethnicity, with four of the six studies examining incidence by race reporting that Black and Hispanic children experienced higher agespecific incidence rates than white children. 10, 18, 21, 30 Higher incidence and lower remission rates among Blacks and Hispanics 10,21 may partially explain the higher obesity prevalence observed among these children. 10, 18 Limitations There were several limitations to this review. Many studies used convenience data or data that were not initially designed with the primary intention of studying obesity incidence. Consequently, study designs, measurements of obesity, populations, cohorts, and locations of studies were not optimal and differed widely. Only three studies used nationally representative data. 17, 18, 30 Among the studies drawing on data from intervention programs, 20, 23, 28, 31, 32 many focused on specific populations, such as schools in high-risk areas 28, 31, 32 or Native American reservations, 23 limiting the generalizability of the results. The heterogeneity in population was a challenge for literature synthesis, making straightforward comparisons between studies difficult. Because BMI can easily be calculated using self-reported or directly measured height and weight, BMI-for-age-andsex and weight-for-length percentile growth charts are a common measure included in large-scale studies. While not an ideal measure, BMI is an acceptable indicator of adiposity. 37 However, the potential of BMI categories to predict future health risks remains unclear. 38, 39 Most studies involving children older than 2 years used the CDC BMI percentile cutoffs for overweight and obesity, but other studies used IOTF cutoffs or other definitions. The use of different definitions across studies impedes comparison. IOTF cutoff points produce lower estimates of obesity prevalence and higher estimates of obesity incidence in comparison to CDC cutoff points. 34, 40, 41 It will be important to determine which cutoffs are best suited for identifying future health risks. World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards have been recommended for monitoring weight up to age 2 years, but there is no consensus obesity measure for children younger than 2 years. 42 Two studies included in this review used CDC weight-for-length \u202195th percentile to define obesity in children under age 2 years. 22, 29 WHO and CDC weight-for-length growth charts are not comparable. 43 Identifying a measure of unhealthy weight for children under age 2 years will be useful, since studies have shown that obesity may originate early in life."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The literature on incidence of childhood obesity is relatively sparse and is heterogeneous in populations and study design. The studies to date have indicated that obesity incidence is highest at the youngest ages and declines with age through adolescence. They have also shown that incidence proportions may differ by gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The patterns suggest the need to focus obesity prevention early in life. However, limitations in existing data sources suggest that future surveillance of population-based patterns of obesity incidence will benefit from consistent use of measures with predictive capacity for future health outcomes, carried out in representative populations periodically assembled in order to understand incidence of childhood obesity, risk factors, and changes in these measures over time. The information from such systematized and representative surveillance could make it possible to (1) investigate etiologic explanations for incidence and remission of obesity, (2) identify windows of opportunity for effective intervention, and (3) evaluate the impact of ongoing interventions."}]
