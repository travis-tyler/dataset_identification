For example, in the 2015 NAEP mathematics assessment, 49% of Grade 4 students with disabilities who participated in the assessment scored below basic level compared to 14% of students without disabilities. This achievement gap of 35% is larger than ethnicity-based achievement gaps in the same NAEP data (e.g., White vs. Black or White vs. Hispanic). This gap is even worse in eighth grade, with 72% of SWD performing below basic compared to 24% of their peers without disabilities (National Center for Education Statistics, 2015). In addition to this cross-sectional data, recent longitudinal analyses of mathematics outcomes from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) further illustrate early and persistent gaps as students already showing deficits in the fall and spring of kindergarten are very likely to show similar or worse deficits in fifth grade (Morgan, Farkas, Hillemeier, & Maczuga, 2016). Other longitudinal studies show persistent poor performance and widening of gaps in mathematics for students with disabilities through middle school (Schulte & Stevens, 2015). These findings clearly document the poor performance in mathematics for students with disabilities and illustrate the importance of identifying proven instructional practices for all students supported by strategies to provide intensive intervention for very young learners at the greatest risk of falling increasingly behind. Researchers have demonstrated that many elementary school students showing low performance in academic areas could demonstrate positive growth if provided with intensive intervention (e.g., Bryant et al., 2011;Dowker & Morris, 2015;Fuchs et al., 2013;O'Connor, Harty, & Fulmer, 2005;Vellutino et al., 1996). Schools have taken different approaches to intervening with students who struggle academically, implementing a variety of response-tointervention (RTI) approaches. RTI is conceptualized as a multitiered systems approach that encompasses general and special education, provides increasingly intensive levels of research-based instruction or intervention at each tier, and includes screening and frequent monitoring of student growth to track both student progress and the need for instructional modifications. Ideally, intensive instruction in an RTI system involves research-based interventions and strong implementation of those interventions. The research presented in this special section continues an emerging and promising line of research investigating the efficacy and implementation approaches of intensive intervention, specifically in the area of mathematics. Related efforts in research and evaluation have sought to better understand the promise of RTI as a system of screening and identifying which students receive additional support in core content areas. For example, the recent evaluation of RTI screening practices in reading completed by the Institute of Education Sciences (Balu et al., 2015) used a rigorous regression discontinuity design across a number of sites. However, it was unable to assess fidelity of implementation to provide a sense of the quality or dosage of intensive reading intervention students were receiving. Ongoing efforts to conduct research on intensive interventions in the context of RTI support systems should carefully consider issues of rigorous screening and clearly defined samples, detailed descriptions of the intensive interventions used, and full accounting of the implementation methods. The studies in this special section accomplish this while exploring systematic variations on \"intensity\" when providing mathematics intervention to struggling learners. School districts are increasingly tasked with identifying and implementing best practices and policies for remediating low-performing students. Students who consistently struggle in reading and/or math are commonly pulled into intervention classes to receive more intense and targeted instruction. Districts and schools make difficult decisions about how to allot student and teacher time as well as resources to remediate those students who demonstrate the greatest need. Important questions surround these practices about how best to spend limited time with students, which content and skills should be targeted and when, and what level of coordination is optimal between regular math classrooms and intensive intervention classes. In each article in this special section, researchers describe how they worked closely with partner school districts to implement intensive interventions and to study the efficacy of those interventions for improving early mathematics outcomes. One of the potential benefits of this work may well be in helping districts make better use of limited resources to provide appropriate intensive interventions to the right groups of students. The purpose of this special section is to examine the role of intensive intervention in improving mathematics achievement for SWD in Grades pre-K-4 within an RTI framework. Each of the studies operationalizes \"intensive\" in different ways to understand what kinds of intervention approaches are likely to be successful for specific groups of learners in helping to improve mathematics performance. The research presented in the following articles was supported by the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) at the Institute of Education Sciences. Since it first began making awards ten years ago, NCSER has made a considerable investment in research projects aimed at improving the quality of mathematics intervention for students with disabilities. Each of the studies presented in this special section was funded to develop or test the efficacy of mathematics interventions for students with disabilities."}, {"section_title": "Articles in This Special Section", "text": "This special section includes four research studies in the area of intensive mathematics interventions for students in Pre-K through fourth grade. In addition, the special section includes two commentaries. The first article by Barnes and colleagues focuses on an efficacy trial of Pre-K Mathematics Tutorial (PKMT), which is implemented alone and in combination with cognitive attention training. The goal of the research was to identify best practices for improving the mathematical knowledge of preschool children who are especially low performers in mathematics. PKMT was designed to provide intensive instruction on a core set of math concepts to help low-performing children build a strong foundation of informal mathematical knowledge and includes 20 activities that use concrete materials to support learning related to number, arithmetic, space, geometry, and measurement (Barnes et al.). This study is of particular interest given recent advances in our understanding of cognitive science principles and the implications for teaching and learning in formal settings (e.g, Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel, 2014). In addition, attentional control has been shown to be critical in early mathematics learning for both typically developing children and those with disabilities (Geary, Hoard, Nugent, & Bailey, 2012;LeFevre et al., 2013), and attentional capacity has also been shown to be responsive to explicit training in preschool children (Rueda, Checa, & Combita, 2012). Further, attentional control may be adversely affected by math anxiety, which can be more prevalent in low math achievers (Hart et al., 2016). Although the attention training in this study had no effect on students' overall mathematics performance, the authors discuss several important attention-training variables that could be relevant for future projects, including timing, duration, and type of attention training. This research contributes to an important line of inquiry related to the use of cognitive training as a potential avenue for improving academic outcomes, particularly for students who often present with deficits and more limited cognitive resources. The second article by Clarke and colleagues shares results from a randomized controlled trial examining the efficacy of a Tier 2 kindergarten whole-number intervention, ROOTS, that was implemented in 37 classrooms across four school districts. Students were screened into the study and then randomly assigned to one of the two ROOTS groups or to the control group. This study investigates students' performance using ROOTS relative to the counterfactual and also includes a delayed posttest to assess the effects of ROOTS in the middle of first grade. ROOTS focuses heavily on building early number concepts (counting and cardinality, operations and algebraic thinking, and number and operations in base ten) with learners and adopts a teacher-directed instructional approach. This study finds immediate effects favoring ROOTS on four of six mathematics measures but no effects in the follow-up study with the same cohort in first grade. Of particular interest in this study is the experimental manipulation of group size in the treatment condition such that students receive the ROOTS program either in groups of two or five. Although data collection for this study is still ongoing related to group size, the question is important as schools and districts are increasingly forced to make staffing decisions related to special education and intensive interventions. The third article by Fien and colleagues presents results from the development and testing of an individualized mathematics gaming intervention, NumberShire, targeting whole numbers for first-grade students. NumberShire is grounded in explicit instruction principles such as instructional scaffolding, guided practice, feedback, and differentiated support to individual learners. Similar to ROOTS, the NumberShire program focuses heavily on building understanding of early number concepts (e.g., counting and cardinality, operations and algebraic thinking, and number and operations in base ten). The results of the study showed effects favoring treatment on proximal measures of whole-numbers concepts and skills but no effects on more distal measures, which included items on a wider range of mathematics concepts, including measurement and geometry. The promise of technology-based interventions for students with disabilities is highlighted in this article. NumberShire is delivered to students individually, which allows for differentiation based on student needs and also allows for potentially detailed and interesting follow-up analyses related to engagement, persistence, and dosage. Furthermore, technology-based interventions, if shown to be effective for this population, could potentially represent a cost-effective delivery model of intensive interventions. Other researchers have demonstrated the potential promise of technology-based interventions for improving math outcomes in young children (Praet & Desoete, 2014;Salminen, Koponen, R\u20ac as\u20ac anen, & Aro, 2015). The final article by Fuchs and colleagues (this issue) investigates the risk-severity hypothesis, in which at-risk students with more severe initial mathematics deficits are expected to respond less to intervention than those with less severe initial deficits. To explore this hypothesis, the authors conducted a secondary analysis of several sequential randomized controlled trials of a fraction intervention at fourth grade. Students in the 16th to 35th percentile were compared to students below the 16th percentile. The studies included not-atrisk samples in order to examine postintervention achievement gaps on fractions understanding. On proximal measures, the authors see no difference in performance across initial academic achievement levels and conclude that the fractions intervention is similarly efficacious, regardless of students' incoming mathematics performance. Such analyses of responsiveness are important to consider, particularly for practitioners as they make decisions about which interventions to use with which students. The first commentary by Woodward discusses design issues across the articles, including the comparison condition in each of the studies and the role of the instructional interventionists in each study. This is followed by a discussion of explicit instruction and the contrasting visions of mathematics education commonly adopted by special educators and mathematics educators. Woodward concludes with considerations for the role of technology in special education. In the second commentary, Gersten examines several critical issues relating to intensive intervention in mathematics. First, he ponders the lack of consistent effects on more distal mathematics outcomes and calls for secondary analyses to understand why effects don't transfer to broader measures of mathematics learning. He then discusses the need for intervention alignment to core curricula versus standards documents. He concludes with a discussion of the implications for studying responsiveness to intervention for various groups of students and considers alternative approaches to teaching mathematics to young children with attention problems."}, {"section_title": "Special Education and Mathematics Education", "text": "Although these articles focus on intensive interventions often provided in \"pull-out\" settings, an issue under the surface of each of the articles is related to the nature and quality of mathematics instruction being provided in the general classroom. A young student entering second grade who cannot accurately place digits on a 0 to 10 number line, do single-digit arithmetic, or correctly compare magnitudes of two numbers may well have developmental dyscalculia but could also have been in K and first-grade classrooms with little to no high-quality mathematics instruction. Such a student would likely have been screened into each of these intervention studies based on these or similar methods. If this student then responded well to an effective mathematics intervention, would we consider this student to have a mathematics learning disability? If the student did not respond well to an intervention, could we more reliably reach such a conclusion? Such questions will remain difficult to answer and it is likely that more effective general classroom mathematics instruction could go a long way in addressing low performance for all students. More rigorous research studies are needed to better identify effective mathematics programs for all students, particularly in the early grades. It is also likely that stronger and more productive collaborations between the special education and mathematics education communities could result in models of instruction that better serve all students but particularly those who are low performing. Woodward (this issue) highlights the predominant model of instruction employed in these intensive mathematics interventions-explicit instruction (some also use the term \"direct instruction\"). Given the more student-centered view that predominates in the mathematics education community, few in that community would describe mathematics instruction as being \"direct\" or \"explicit.\" In fact, some might consider such viewpoints to be directly opposed. More sustained efforts to productively bring these two communities together are necessary in order to improve mathematics instruction for all students."}, {"section_title": "Research on Mathematics Learning Disability", "text": "The research presented in this special section contributes to a growing literature related to the learning of mathematics for students with learning disabilities (e.g., Berch & Mazzocco, 2007;Chinn, 2015). In this literature, researchers have used various terms to characterize a given study sample such as mathematics learning disability, mathematics difficulty, developmental dyscalculia, or dyscalculia (see Mazzocco, 2007 andSz\u0171cs &Goswami, 2013 for issues related to defining these terms). It is important for the field to make proper distinctions about the types of math learning challenges that arise largely due to neurocognitive or genetic factors versus the challenges that result predominantly from environmental factors. A useful definition of the more neurocognitive disorder has been provided by Sz\u0171cs and Goswami (2013): We define developmental dyscalculia as persistently weak mathematical performance of developmental origin, related to the weakness of some kind(s) of cognitive function(s) and/or representation(s); appearing when concurrent motivation to study mathematics and access to appropriate mathematics education is normal. Research on cognitive function related to dyscalculia points to a number of possible contributing factors such as verbal and visual working memory, spatial skills, attention, inhibitory control, and phonological processing. However, issues of comorbidity with other disabilities such as reading often make it difficult to neatly diagnose developmental dyscalculia even in the presence of large cognitive batteries. Future research efforts to better identify and distinguish dyscalculia from other neurocognitive-based learning disabilities will be helpful in clarifying the nature of the deficits for other researchers and for practitioners working with students, and to advance the science of dyscalculia and mathematics learning disabilities. In addition to using different terminology, investigators will often use different criteria for including students in a study at the outset. Each of the studies in this special section takes a different approach in establishing inclusion criteria for the samples of low-performing or mathematics learning disabled students. Barnes and colleagues (this issue) set the cutoff point at the 25th percentile on the Test of Early Mathematics Achievement (using the Child Math Assessment as a predictor of TEMA performance). Fuchs et al. (this issue) adopted a similar approach across intervention studies using the 35th percentile on the math calculations subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test. Fien and Clarke (this issue) take the approach of recruiting schools and teachers into the study and then selecting the bottom 10-12 students from each classroom to participate in the study as an initial inclusion criterion. Researchers make methodological decisions based on a complicated web of factors that could include school-based constraints, power and design restrictions, and even implementation and feasibility factors. But such heterogeneity in the participant samples makes it difficult to generalize across studies about the nature of the phenomenon and effective intervention strategies. While certainly a challenge, more consistency across studies about which students are included for intervention would greatly enhance our understanding of the kinds of approaches and interventions that are likely to work for which students."}]
