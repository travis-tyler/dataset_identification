[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Recent work in doctoral STEM and engineering education has considered how graduate funding mechanism impacts skill development and career preparation, including job prospects (Kinoshita, Knight, Borrego, & Bortz, in press) and future career trajectory (Blume-Kohout & Adhikari, 2016;Denton et al., 2019). Skills developed during graduate funding assignments, such as learning laboratory techniques or how to conduct research, may influence qualifications for and interest in future job roles and career sectors. Different funding types may offer different experiences for STEM doctoral students (Nettles & Millett, 2006).The main sources of funding for doctoral students come through fellowships, research assistantship (RAs), or teaching assistantships (TAs) (Knight, Kinoshita, Choe, & Borrego, 2018;National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, 2017). While participating in a TA assignment can contribute to the socialization of engineering doctoral students for future faculty careers (Mena, Diefes-Dux, & Capobianco, 2013), TAs are generally viewed more negatively than other types of funding, in terms of completion, time-to-degree, and overall graduate education experience (Ampaw & Jaeger, 2011, 2012. Students also expressed a preference for RA and fellowship positions over TA assignments  Although engineering doctoral students may be funded through additional mechanisms, such as internships, employers, or personal funds, we consider fellowships, RA, and TA assignments in our study as the most common funding mechanisms, and those over which academics and policymakers have the most influence. Prior research in doctoral engineering education largely focuses on the impact of primary funding mechanism on graduate student outcomes, such as completion rates (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, 2017) and future career sector (Denton et al., 2019). However, doctoral students often have more than one type of funding throughout their graduate education. For example, an engineering doctoral student may primarily be funded through a TA during their 2 nd year, a fellowship in their 3 rd year, and an RA during their other years. While the student had three different types of funding, they would be considered primarily funded on an RA in most prior research. Limited research has addressed the reality that students will be primarily funded by different sources at different points during graduate school. We are interested in whether the sequencing of funding relates to degree completion or persistence in graduate school, since very few studies have considered multiple funding types per individual. Further, we are interested in determining if there is an optimal and equitable pathway for persistence and completion of the greatest number of doctoral students, given the constraints of limited funding or limited availability of the most desirable types of funding. Doctoral engineering completion rates remain relatively low. In fact, the completion rate for receiving an engineering PhD within 10 years is just 64% . However, the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) and Survey of Doctoral Recipients (SDR), two NSF-sponsored national survey instruments used in graduate education, contain respondents who successfully completed research-based doctoral degree programs. Individuals who left their degree programs prior to completion are not included in either dataset. Thus, the experiences of 36% of doctoral students may go unstudied. Although it is important to understand how funding mechanism and other factors contribute to successful doctoral degree completion, we must include those who leave as well, to begin to understand what must be changed in our institutional structures and expectations for graduate students. Women and Students of Color leave STEM doctoral programs at higher rates than male or White students (Sowell, Zhang, Bell, & Redd, 2008). Further examining factors contributing to persistence and completion is an important step to improve equity in doctoral engineering education. This additionally impacts who stays in academia and teaches undergraduate engineering courses, which has further implications for student learning and representation in the field. In general, single institution datasets (such as the one in our study) are less highly regarded than multi-institution datasets because the data and findings are typically less generalizable. Prior examples of good single institution studies of graduate students focused on doctoral student institutional choice (Bersola, Stolzenberg, Love, & Fosnacht, 2014) and retention and time-todegree completion (Nerad & Cerny, 1993). However, the level of detail regarding funding provided in our single institution dataset has potential to fill in some gaps regarding questions around engineering doctoral funding. For example, while the SED is administered to all graduates who receive a research-based doctoral degree (National Science Foundation, 2020), they only include successful doctoral recipients and consider primary and secondary funding mechanism in the dataset. Our single-institution dataset contains any funding held by students each year and provides context into year-to-year retention, which the SED does not. Thus, our purpose is to examine sequential funding of students at a single institution in order to gain a greater understanding of completion and persistence in engineering doctoral programs."}, {"section_title": "Research Question", "text": "How, if at all, does being funded through a TA, RA, or fellowship in a given year predict the 3-, 4-, and 5-year persistence rates and 4-, 5-, and 6-year completion rates of chemical engineering doctoral students?"}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "From data provided by the Graduate School at the institution, we ran logistic regression models on persistence and completion rates of chemical engineering doctoral students over a time period of 20 years."}, {"section_title": "Survey Instrument/Data Collection", "text": "We gained access to departmental data from 1992 to 2011 for all departments in the College of Engineering and College of Science at the institution.

Additionally, the data contained funding information for all doctoral students, including funding mechanism(s) and total dollar amount of funding by month for each funding mechanism. We consolidated the funding categories to Teaching Assistantship (TA), Research Assistantship (RA), Fellowship, and No University Funding. Assistant instructor (AI) positions were classified under TA, and any scholarships the students received were included under Fellowship. Any funding received externally from the institution was not included in the dataset. However, government agency funding, such as that through the National Science Foundation (NSF) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are distributed to students through the institution and would be included in the dataset. Therefore, students who received fellowship funding not distributed through the institution, international students with funding from their home governments, or students with any other external funding source would be categorized as No University Funding."}, {"section_title": "Research Setting", "text": "Our research took place at a research-intensive (R1), public, Predominantly White Institution (PWI) located in the United States. The College of Engineering is typically ranked within the top 25 engineering graduate programs in the country, and the chemical engineering department is also highly ranked (U.S. News & World Report, 2019). The percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to women in the department in 2018 was slightly below the national average of 29.5% for chemical engineering. In 2018, a lower percentage of doctoral students in the department were international students when compared to the national average of 56.3% for all engineering majors (American Society for Engineering Education, 2020; Roy, 2019)."}, {"section_title": "Participants and Setting", "text": "The department has a requirement for doctoral students to serve as TAs for two semesters during their doctoral study. The requirement has no specifications or recommended year for timing of teaching assistantships, including whether students should TA in consecutive semesters. This raises the question of whether there is an optimal time to complete a TA assignment during graduate school. The department is also known for having successful applicants to several external fellowship programs, particularly NSF's Graduate Research Fellowships Program. They often have difficulty finding volunteer opportunities for fellowship students to complete the TA requirements, which would not appear in the database as TA funding and seem as if they were exempt from completing the requirement. In general, the department is known for being wellfunded. The department uses half of its fellowship funds to award continuing fellowships to third and fourth-year students, including best paper and best TA awards. Due to the TA requirement and high rates of successful fellowship applicants, many students in the department have different funding types within a given semester, as well as have multiple types of funding over the course of their programs. Unlike other engineering programs at the institution, the chemical engineering department only accepts application for doctoral students. However, students are permitted to leave the program with a master's degree. Doctoral degree course requirements include six courses, with three required courses taken during the first semester. The other three courses may be taken at any point during doctoral study. Some doctoral students elect to receive an M.S. in chemical engineering along with their PhD. Earning both degrees requires students to take 10 total courses."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis", "text": "We calculated descriptive statistics, such as count and percentage data, for each funding type (TA, RA, Fellowship, and No University Funding) for all chemical engineering students who entered the program from 1992 to 2011. We considered seven-year completion rates in our models, since only 4% of participants remained in the program after seven years. We ran six step-wise logistic regression models predicting persistence in Years 3, 4, and 5 (Models 1 -6), since doctoral students who drop out without receiving a PhD in these years have invested significant time and energy towards their degree. Additionally, we ran six step-wise logistic regression models predicting completion in Years 4, 5, and 6 (Models 7 -12), which were the most common years of graduation for participants in our dataset. Predictors for both sets of logistic regression models included funding type in a specific year, such as TA 3 rd year or Fellowship 4 th year. Student funding levels varied widely due to varying pay rates, percentage appointments, and total hours appointed, which are only loosely standardized in this department. Regardless of the total amount of funding held by a participant, we considered them to have a specific type of funding if they had a non-zero dollar amount of that funding for a given year. For all models, \"No University Funding\" served as the funding type reference category. Participants were categorized as No University Funding if they had zero dollar amounts for all three other funding types (TA, RA, and Fellowship). Besides those in the No University Funding reference group, a single participant could have multiple types of funding in a given year. All data analysis was completed using R studio. The first outcome variable in our models is persistence in a certain year of study (Year 3 for Models 1 and 2, Year 4 for Models 3 and 4, and Year 5 for Models 5 and 6), coded as 1 if the participant remained registered in the program and as 0 if the participant dropped from the program during that year. Any participant who completed the program during that year was removed from the data set. Models 1, 3, and 5 contain only the TA funding mechanism as predictor variables, while Models 2, 4, and 6 contain RA, TA, and Fellowship funding types as predictor variables. The number of participants in each model is as follows: 631 (Models 1 & 2), 518 (Models 3 & 4), 266 (Model 5), and 245 (Model 6). The reference variable for type of funding mechanism is No University Funding for all six regression models. The second outcome variable in our models is program completion in a certain year of study (Year 4 for Models 7 and 8, Year 5 for Models 9 and 10, and Year 6 for Models 11 and 12), coded as 1 if the participant completed the program and as 0 if the participant remained registered in the program during that year. Any participants who left the program during that year were removed from the dataset. As in the persistence models, Models 7, 9, and 11 contain only the TA funding mechanism as predictor variables, while Models 8, 10, and 12 contain RA, TA, and Fellowship funding types as predictor variables. The number of participants in each model is as follows: 562 (Models 7 & 8), 479 (Model 9), 391 (Model 10), 235 (Model 11), and 225 (Model 12).

Nearly 87% of the participants who completed the program graduated in Years 4, 5, or 6. Almost 74% of participants who left the program did so in Years 1, 2, or 3, and 18% of participants who left did so during Years 4 or 5. Note: Percentages in a column can total more than 100% because a student could have multiple funding types in the same year. Table 1 includes count data for the number of chemical engineering doctoral students with each funding mechanism (TA, RA, Fellowship, and No University Funding) in a given year. Each year corresponds to a 12-month time period. For example, Year 2 refers to months 13-24 that a doctoral student was in the program. Since participants may have more than one type of funding during the year, the total number of students in each year will not be equivalent to the total of the four funding mechanism rows. Over 70% of participants held RA positions in Years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The number of participants with fellowships varied slightly by year, most frequently held in the first four years of study, particularly Years 1 (72%), 3 (65%) or 4 (67%). Participants had TA positions most often in the first three years of study, with over 40% of participants holding a TA position at some point for each of those three years. No University Funding was more common for participants during Years 5 (23%), 6 (17.4%) and 7 (41.8%).

With two exceptions in the models, having any type of funding support (RA, TA, or Fellowship) is better than having no university funding at all. In general, having a TA assignment earlier in the doctoral students' program of work, such as the 1 st through 3 rd year, positively predicts persistence compared to No University Funding. TA assignments are best completed within the first two years for persistence in the 4 th and 5 th years. Similarly, having an RA assignment or Fellowship during participants' 3 rd or 4 th year positively predicts persistence, particularly for persistence through that year. As indicated by the odds ratios in the 3 rd and 4 th year persistence models, RAs are associated with more desirable persistence and completion outcomes than fellowships, which are both associated with more desirable outcomes than TA assignments. However, for participants who persisted through five years of graduate study, having a fellowship during their 3 rd year was important for persistence. In the 4 th year completion model, RA in the 4 th year positively predicts graduation, while RA in the 5 th year positively predicts completion in the 6 th year model. Somewhat surprisingly, in the 5 th year completion model, fellowship in the 4 th year positively predicts graduation, while RA in the 5 th year negatively predicts completion. Having a TA in the 1 st year positively predicted completion within 5 years, while having a TA in the 5 th year negatively predicted degree completion. Limited research has focused on the sequencing of different funding types and impact on program persistence and completion in doctoral engineering education (or doctoral education in general). However, prior studies that highlight the benefits and drawbacks of certain funding mechanisms in STEM education may provide additional insight into the results from our study. For example, TA assignments are important for preparing doctoral students for future faculty roles and providing engineering departments with quality instructors (Connolly, Savoy, Lee, & Hill, 2016). TA roles may involve activities such as grading homework assignments and exams, supervising lab sections, teaching discussion sessions, or helping faculty with lectures (Nicklow, Marikunte, & Chevalier, 2007;Verleger & Velasquez, 2007). These activities are largely external to any research activities or dissertation work for students, potentially taking time and effort away from dissertation progress. This may explain why having a TA assignment in the first few years positively predicts persistence and completion, while having a TA assignment in the 5 th year negatively predicts completion. Since all students in this program are required to TA, those who TA in early years may have less research responsibility and more time to devote to associated TA duties without sacrificing any other tasks. However, as doctoral students gain research responsibility and feel pressure to make progress on dissertation work, having a TA could increase their workload unaligned with their projects and inhibit progress, delaying graduation. In contrast, having an RA assignment or fellowship may allow doctoral students to fully focus on research, as shown when RA and fellowship are positive predictors of persistence and completion. Students funded on both RAs and fellowships develop important research competencies and skills needed for doctoral work. Despite these similarities, several differences exist between RA and fellowship funding, which may contribute to the odds ratio differences seen in our models (i.e., RAs more desirable than fellowships). While RAs tend to be associated with specific projects or grants from external sources, such as NSF or sponsoring companies (Rossouw & Niemczyk, 2013), fellowships are often yearly stipends awarded without obligation to a specific research topic or project (Freeman, 2005). Fellowships may offer more flexibility on types of projects that doctoral students can work on, making them more open-ended than RA work. However, being fully funded on an RA, with project deadlines and deliverables, may make doctoral students more disciplined in their research. RA-funded students may also take less time to identify a dissertation topic. Feeling connected to a research advisor through RA projects may also contribute to doctoral student motivation and persistence. Although \"No University Funding\" was used as the label for our reference group, almost all doctoral students within the department receive full funding. Therefore, students in the No University Funding group most likely received external funding, such as through their home government or external fellowships not distributed through the institution. We do not have data on sources of external funding within the department, so we can only provide limited interpretations of why external funding is generally worse for retention and completion when compared to other funding types. It is likely that any external funding results in fewer responsibilities connected to the institution, limiting student integration within the department. For example, students who are funded by their home countries may not have the same deliverables required of RAs or fellowships, as they are fully funded outside of their advisor's research. This may lead to less available resources and guidance from advisors, disconnecting the students from the institution and leading to feelings of discouragement. While external funding needs to be further investigated before conclusions are drawn, our data suggests that simply having funding does not lead to equal completion and persistence rates. Support from within the department and engaged advisors may be key to completion and persistence, and students with external funding may lack these important supports more frequently than others."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion & Future Work", "text": "Although the results are not unexpected, it is important to use empirical evidence to support policy decisions related to allocation of graduate student funding. Conversations around graduate student funding often center on graduate labor conditions and the need for higher dollar amounts of funding across the board. While we believe this is an important issue that should be addressed, we are also realistic in understanding the existing financial constraints at institutions of higher education and the difficulty and slow-moving nature of systemic change. Our research shows that allocation of funding can be further optimized within the existing constraints, and certain types of sequenced funding are better than others for student outcomes. Departments, graduate schools, and institutions need to consider how they are currently distributing funds to engineering PhD students and how this could be positively or negatively impacting their retention and graduation rates. Study limitations include specifics to this department, such as a being a well-funded, highly regarded engineering program with TA requirements for doctoral students. The awarding of department fellowships to high-performing students in their 3 rd and 4 th year may be skewing the data related to fellowships. Future work includes expanding this analysis to other STEM departments to understand the generalizability of results beyond the discipline and institution studied, using this analysis approach as a guide. It is also important to begin to consider how equity considerations factor into graduate funding allocations, meaning what students are receiving what types of sequential funding and how that impacts persistence and completion for women and Students of Color."}]
