First, the report describes the demographic characteristics and enrollment patterns of low income students and compares them with other undergraduates. It then e;.arnines their financial need, the kinds and amounts of financial aid they received, and the relationship between financial aid and cost. Next, it describes two important sources of support other than financial aid: parental support and work. Finally, the report examines persistence and attainment among low income students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90. The report uses data primarily from the 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93), a survey designed to answer fundamental questions about financial aid and to detail undergraduates' education expenses, sources, and types of financial aid. The report also uses data from NPSAS:90 and the Beginning Postsecondary Student Longitudinal Study (BPS: 90/94), which followed a sample of students identified in NPSAS:90 as first-time beginning postsecondary students in the 1989-90 academic year. The estinlates in this report were produced using the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Data Analysis System (DAS), a software application that allows users to specify and generate tables from NPSAS and BPS data files. Each estimate produced in a table is accompanied by the standard error and weighted sample size on which the estimate was based. The DAS is available to anyone interested in further exploring the NPSAS or BPS (see appendix B for a more detailed discussion and directions for obtaining a copy). We hope that readers of this report will find it informative and useful.

Paying for undergraduate education has always been seen as primarily the family's responsitility to the extent they can afford to do so. Tapping their own resources, students and their families use current income, savings, and borrowing against assets. Students sometimes work while still in high school to earn money for college, and the majority work while enrolled in postsecondary education.' Parents may start saving for their children's education many years before the child enrolls. Sometimes they take an additional job or borrow against assets such as a house. Low income families rarely have substantial savings to draw upon or assets to borrow against, and are unlikely to have very much discretionary income after paying for housing, food, clothing, and other basic necessities. In short, without financial assistance, postsecondary education would be out of reach for most low income students. The federal government has established a broad range of student financial aid programs to provide low income students with the opportunity to participate in postsecondary education. Some of this aid has been in the form of grants, and some in the form of loans and work study. States and institutions do their part, too. Many states provide substantial funding for postsecondary institutions, allowing them to keep tuition Nell below the actual cost of educating a student, and some have their own student financial aid programs as well. Institutions and other organizations have also helped by providing large amounts of needbased aid. In 1992-93, the federal government 'warded $23.4 billion dollars in general aid to postsecondary students; states, $2.1 billion; and institutions and other organizations, $7.3 billion.' This report examines how low income students pay for their postsecondary education, focusing on the importance of financial aid. The report begins by describing the demographic and enrollment characteristics of low income undergraduates and by comparing their characteristics to those of other undergraduates. It then examines low income students' educational costs, financial need, and their use of financial aid and other sources of financial support. Finally, it compares the persistence and attainment of low income and other students. The primary source of data for the analysis was the 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93). These data are supplemented with data from two other postsecondary education surveys: NPSAS:90 for information not available from NPSAS:93 on students' reasons for choosing institutions; and the Beginning Postsecondary Students 'See Laura Horn, Undergraduates Who Work While Enrolled in Postsecondary Education: 1989-90 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1994), NCES 94-311, for a description of how much undergraduates work while enrolled. =The College Board, Washington Office, Trends in Student Aid: 1984to 1994(Washington, D.C.: 1994 Longitudinal Study (BPS:90/94) for information on persistence and attainment for NPSAS:90 students who began their postsecondary education in 1989-90.3 Definition of \"Low Income\" For this analysis, \"low income\" undergraduates are defined as students with a family income below 125 percent of the federally established poverty threshold for their family size.' For 1991, the poverty thresholds and 125 percent of these levels were as follows:5 "}, {"section_title": "23,234", "text": "This definition has several advantages. First, it is independent of who goes to college. In other words, the low income students in this analysis are poor relative to the general population, rather than just the lowest income students who enroll in postsecondary education. Second, the federal poverty levels are stated in terms of both income and family size, allowing for appropriate comparisons between single students and students in larger families. Third, the poverty levels are adjusted for inflation and updated annually, permitting meaningful comparisons over time. The decision to use 125 percent of the poverty threshold as the cutoff for this study was partly practical, reecting a desire not to go too far above the poverty level, but at the same time to get a large enough sample to be able to find differences among subgroups. It is worth noting that 125 percent is also a commonly used cutoff point for reporting on low income families (see the Statistical Abstract of the United States, for example). Overall, 20 percent of all undergraduates enrolled in 1992-93 were low income according to this definition (table 1). Low income students made up roughly similar proportions of the total student population at public less-than-4-year and 4-year institutions, and at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions (17 percent to 19 percent) (fLgure 1). Private, for-profit institutions, in contrast, had a much larger concentration of low income students (42 percent). However, relatively few students (only 8 percent of all undergraduates) enrolled in this type of institution (see table 3). Certain groups were particularly likely to be in the low income category, most notably minorities and single parents (table 1). In 1993-94, about one-third of black, non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and Native American undergraduates and more than half (57 percent) of single parent undergraduates were low income. In contrast, 17 percent of white, non-Hispanic undergraduates and 17 percent of undergraduates who were not single parents were low income."}, {"section_title": "Income and Dependency Status", "text": "Although the definition of low income used in this analysis has no connection to the financial aid system, it is important to understand that whether or not a student was categorized as low income was related to the student's dependency status for financial aid purposes. Whose income is counted in the calculation of the student's family income varies with dependency status. From a financial aid perspective, there are three quite distinct groups of undergraduates: 1) Dependent students (48 percent of all undergraduates) Undergraduates less than 24 years ol0 \"re considered dependent for financial aid purposes unless they meet one of th . criteria t,. independence described below, which relatively few do. The vast majority (87 percent) of undergraduates less than 24 years of age were considered financially dependent in 1992-93 (table 2). Under current financial aid policy, the parents of dependent students are expected to pay for their children's education to the extent they can afford to do so. Therefore, dependent students' eligibility for financial aid takes into account parents' incomes and other aspects of their financial circumstances whether or not the parents actually contribute. For this analysis, dependent students who came from 4-person families were defined as low income if their parents' income was less than $17,405. The level was lower if the family was smaller and higher if the family was larger. In 1992-93, 12 percent of all dependent undergraduates were from low income families (table 1). NOTE: Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding. Percentages for \"all students\" include students with missing income data. Therefore, the percentages for all students may be higher or lower than the percentages for low income and not low income students. For example, the percentage of all students less than 24 years old (55.1 percent) is greater than the percentages for both low income students (50.1 percent) and not low income students (54.5 percent). , 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93), Undergraduate Data Analysis System."}, {"section_title": "SOURCE: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics", "text": "2) Single independent students' (20 percent of all undergraduates) Undergraduates 24 years or older are considered financially independent of their parents for financial aid purposes, regardless of their parents' incomes and whether or not their parents provide them with any financial assistance. In 1992-93, about two-thirds of single independents were at least 24 years old and therefore were considered independent simply because of their age (table 2). For single independent students, \"family income\" includes only the student's income. Undergraduates less than 24 years old were considered financially independent of their parents if they were not claimed as a tax exemption by their parents for the 2 years before the beginning of the academic year for which they were applying for financial aid and had at least $4,000 in financial resources; if they were military veterans; if they were wards of the court; or if both parents were deceased and they had no legal guardian.' In 1992-93, only 6 percent of all undergraduates less than 24 years old met one of these criteria. About one-third (31 percent) of all single independents were defined as low income for this analysis (that is, they had incomes of less than $8,858) (table 1). Some of these students may have had low incomes temporarily because they were enrolled in postsecondary education and not working or only working a limited amount. Others may have had low incomes on a longer term basis t)ecause they had difficulty finding steady work or a wellpaying job (they might have been returning for further education to improve their employment prospects). Low income single independents may or may not have come from disadvantaged backgrounds; their parents' incomes were not considered in assessing their need for financial aid. 3) Independent students with dependents (32 percent of all undergraduates) Undergraduates with dependents of their own are considered financially independent of their parents regardless of their age. Spouses count as dependents except in the rare instance where a student is married and still claimed as a tax exemption by his or her parents; in such cases, the student would still be considered dependent. In 1992-93, 32 percent of all undergraduates and 8 percent of undergraduates under 24 years of age were independents with dependents (table 2). For purposes of determining eligibility for financial aid, a married independent student's family income includes the student's and his or her spouse's income. 'Single independent\" students are more precisely \"independents without dependents,\" and therefore could include students who are married but separated and therefore technically not \"single.\" However, the term \"single independents\" is used in this report because it is less cumbersome and easier to distinguish from \"independents with dependents.\" 'The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 changed the definition of independent, making it more difficult for students less than 24 years old to file financial aid applications as independents. Starting in 1993-94, it was no longer possible for students to apply for financial aid as independents on the grounds they were not claimed as tax exemptions for 2 years and could document resources of more than $4,000 per year. Twenty-six percent of all independents with dependents were in the low income category (table 1). This group includes a relatively large number of single parents (59 percent of low income independents with dependents were not married or were separated) (table 2). Also likely to be in the group of low income independents with dependents are married students with spouses who were also .tudents and married students with children whose spouses worked only part time or not at all. To summarize, figure 2 shows the distribution of the entire undergraduate population by income and dependency status in 1992-93. Almost half (48 percent) of all undergraduates were dependent. However, relatively few of them came from low income families. Larger proportions of single independents and independents with dependents were low income. Because spouses are considered dependents for financial aid purposes, many students in the \"independents with dependents\" category have a spouse who works. Thus, it is not surprising that a greater proportion of single independents, who have only their own incomes to rely upon, wou!d be in the low income category. "}, {"section_title": "Comparison With Other Students Demographic Characteristics", "text": "As a group, low income students were much more likely than other undergraduates to be minority (36 percent compared with 21 percent) (figure 3 and table 3).8 Within the low income student population, dependent students were more likely than either type of independent student to belong'to a minority group. Among dependent students, 20 percent were Hispanic; 19 percent were black, non-Hispanic; 8 percent were Asian/Pacqic Islander; and 1 percent were American Indian/Alaskan Native. Low income undergraduates also tended to have less well-educated parents than other students. More than one-half (54 percent) of low income undergraduates had parents with only a high school education or less, compared with 43 percent of other undergraduates (figure 4). Because of the close relationship between income and education, it is not surprising that depPndent students from low income families had parents with relatively low educational attainment (57 percent had only a high school education or less). Among low income students, single independents had the best educated parents: 45 percent had parents  8As shown in figure 3 and table 3, 64 percent of low income students and 79 percent of other students were white, non-Hispanic, leaving 36 percent and 21 percent, respectively, minority.  NOTE: Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding. Percentages for \"all students\" include students with missing income data. Therefore, the percentages for all students may be higher or lower than the percentages for both low income and not low income students. with a high school education or less, a proportion similar to that of undergraduates who were not low income. As indicated earlier, low income single independents may be poor because they are students, but they do not necessarily come from disadvadtaged backgrounds. Low income independents with dependents tended to have less well-educated parents than single independents (59 percent had parents with only a high school education) (table 3). They may have been more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds, but another possible explanation or contributing factor may be that low.income independents with dependents were more likely than low income single independents to be 30 years or older (table 2), increasing the likelihood that their parents belonged to a generation less likely to have attended college."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment Patterns", "text": "Low income undergraduates were about as likely qg other undergraduates to enroll in public 4-year institutions (29 percent and 31 percent, respectively) and private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions (13 percent and 15 percent, respectively) (figure 5 and table 3). However, low income students were much more likely than other students to enroll in private, forprofit institutions, and were somewhat less likely to attend public less-than-4-year institutions. Low income undergraduates were more likely than other undergraduate :. to enroll full time in their first term in 1992-93 and to enroll full time for only part of the year. This pattern reflects, in part, low income students' greater numbers at private, for-profit institutions, which tend to have shorter, full-time programs. However, greater full-time attendance may also reflect the fact that, for independent students, attending full time makes it more likely their income will be low because they have less time to work. Low income students differed from their non low income counterparts in their choice of degree program, with low income students being more likely to enroll in a certificate program and less likely to enroll in a bachelor's degree program. However, despite the differences in where they enrolled and their immediate academic goals, low income and other undergraduates had similar long-term academic goals, with similar proportions in each group aspiring eventually to associate's, bachelor's, and advanced degrees.  "}, {"section_title": "Considerations in Choosing an Institution", "text": "In 1989-90, 76 percent of low income undergraduates reported that the fact that an institution offered the course of study they wanted was a very important consideration in their choice of institution.9 They cited this factor far more frequently than any other (table  4). However, financial considerations were important as well. Forty-five percent of low income students reported that obtaining the financial aid they needed was a very important consideration (compared with only 20 percent of other students). Low income students were also more likely than other students to report that other factors that had financial implications (lower tuition and other expenses, a good reputation for placement, and being able to finish in a shorter time) were very impertant. Although students were not asked in NPSAS:93 why they chose the institution in which they enrolled, there is some evidence of efforts on the part of low income students to try to reduce costs. For example, low income students at 4-year institutions were more likely than other undergraduates (24 percent compared with 20 percent) to live with their parents or relatives. This can be an important strategy for reducing housing and, possibly, transportation costs (table 5). Based on tuition and fees paid by students who attended full time, full year, 1ow income undergraduates appear to be sensitive to tuition charges. Except at public less-than-J -year institutions, low income undergraduates enrolled full time, full year paid a lower average amount for tuition and fees than their counterparts who were not low income at the same type of institution (table 6). This suggests that low income students may be choosing lower cost rather than high-cost private institutions and less expensive public institutions over more expensive ones as a way of keeping down their educational costs.  4."}, {"section_title": "Financial Need Method for Assessing Financial Need", "text": "To assess a student's need for financial aid, a financial aid officer starts by establishing an appropriate budget that takes into account direct educational expenses and reasonable living expenses. Direct educational expenses include tuition, fees, books, and supplies. Living expenses include room and board if living on campus, or rent and food if living off campus; personal expenses; transportation; and any special items a student requires, such as child care or special equipment needed because of a handicapping condition. What the family is expected to pay is calculated using a formula that takes into account family income and assets, the size of the family, and the number of other family members enrolled in postsecondary education. This calculated amount becomes the \"expected family contribution\" (EFC) and is independent of where the student chooses to enroll. In other words, the EFC is the same regardless of whether the student chooses an institution with a tuition of $1,500 or $15,000. The student is eligible for the amount of financial aid needed to make up the difference between the EFC and the budget, although there is no guarantee that the financial aid funds will be available to meet the need fully. Over the years, the methodology used to calculate the EFC has changed many times as policymakers have attempted to achieve both simplicity and fairness and to ration limited funds. Each adjustment to the formula has changed who is eligible for financial aid and how much. The debate over whose income and assets should be included and how they should be treated continues. Some issues that still exist include the age of the student at which the parents' income should no longer count; how a noncustodial parent's or stepparent's income should be treated when parents are divorced; what assets shauld be sheltered; what percentage of their assets parents should be expected to contribute; and how much the student should be expected to earn.\") In 1992-93, there were minimum EFCs (although these have since been eliminated). The minimum EFC for dependent students was $700 for the first year and $900 afterwards; for single independent students, it was $1,200. There was no minimum EFC for independent students with dependents. Figures 6-8 show the relationship between the average budgets for full-time, full-year students at various types of institution and the average EFCs at each income level in 1992-93. The difference between the budgets and the EFCs was the average amount of financial aid for which students were eligible at each income level. On average, families with incomes under $50,000 would have been eligible for some financial aid to support a dependent full-time, full-year undergraduate at an average-cost postsecondary institution of any type in 1992-93 (figure 6). With higher incomes, families were eligible for financial aid only at the more costly institutions. Full-time, full-year single independent students with incomes under about $20,000 would have been eligible for some financial aid at an average-cost postsecondary institution of any type (figure 7). Independent students with dependents of their own had the lowest EFCs, on average, because they had no minimum EFC. With incomes under $50,000 they would have been eligible for financial aid to meet the average costs of attending any type of institution full time, full year (figure 8). The discussion of costs and financial aid that follows is limited to low income students who attended full time, full year because of the difficulty of making comparisons among students whose attendance patterns vary as widely as those in the group of students who attend part time and/or part year. Forty-four percent of low income dependent students attended full time, full year, as did 38 percent of low income single independents and 27 percent of independents with dependents (table 3). The discussion is also limited to undergraduates who attended only one institution, because of the need to have a consistent picture of aid and costs. One percent of all full-time, full-year undergraduates attended more than one institution during the 1992-93 academic year.\"   Family income (in thousands) NOTE: Too little financial aid-related information was available for students with family incomes of $100,000 or more to estimate an EFC reliably.

Among low income undergraduates enrolling full time, full year, dependent and single independent students had similar financial need, on average ($9,300 and $8,800, respectively). The average financial need of independent students with dependents was somewhat greater ($10,200). This reflects the fact that they had no minimum EFC and may also be related to the types of institutions they attended.

This was partly due to slightly larger Pell amounts, but also because they were considerably more likely than their counterparts in other types of institutions to receive Supplementary Education Opportunity Grants (SEOGs) (table 10))6 Participation in loan progra.ns varied considerably by type of institution. However, at each type of institution, almost all of the students with loans had federal loans, and most of these students had Stafford loans (tables 8, 9, and 11).

It should be noted that skidents' access to federal campus-based aid (SEOG, Perkins, and College Work-Study programs) varies from one institution to another for reasons other than student financial need. The allocation of campus-based aid to institutions has a historical basis. Not all institutions participate, and institutions have different amounts to distribute. Older institutions that have been participating for a long time have the largest amounts. State aid (which is primarily grant aid) was another important source of aid for low income students, with 34 percent of those who attended full time, full year receiving an average of $1,600 (table 9). State aid was less available to those at private, for-profit institutions than at other types of institutions (10 percent received state aid compared with one-third or more elsewhere). Many state programs do not provide awards to students in private, for-profit institutions. Institutional aid was an important source of aid for full-time, full-year low income students at private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions: 52 percent received institutional aid averaging $4,600 (table 9). Their counterparts at other types of institutions were much less likely to receive this type of aid. Public institutions usually have relatively little need-based aid to distribute. In many states, most need-based aid at pubtic institutions is awarded directly to students through state grant programs rather than through the institutions."}, {"section_title": "Relationship Between Financial Aid and Cost", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ratio of Financial Aid to Total Cost", "text": "On average, financial aid covered 42 percent of the student-reported cost of attending for low income undergraduates enrolling full time, full year in 1992-93 (table 12).17 Sixtyfive percent of their aid was in the form of grants, and 26 percent in the form of loans. The different ratios across institution types reflect in part differences in the cost of attending. Pell grants are normally awarded to financially needy students first, with other grants, loans, and work-study aid added where unmet need still exists. For example, the average ratio of loans to total aid was 11 percent at public less-than-4-year institutions, but 32 percent at public 4-year institutions, where average costs were higher (see table 7). Overall, the federal government was the source of most financial aid (77 percent, on average). State aid programs added another 10 percent, and institutional aid programs, 9 percent. Differences in these ratios across institution types reflect the availability of various sources of aid at different types of institutions. For example, the relative unavailability of state and institutional aid at private, for-profit institutions increased students' reliance on federal aid. On average, 93 percent of the aid to full-time, full-year low income students at private, for-profit institutions came from federal sources, compared with 65 percent to 81 percent at other types of institutions (figure 10). Institutional aid accounted for an average of 21 percent of all aid to students in private, not-for-profit 4-year institutions who received aid. However, institut onal sources were relatively unimportant in other types of institutions: 9 percent in public 4-year institutions and even less elsewhere."}, {"section_title": "Net Cost and Unmet Need", "text": "The net cost to the student is the amount left after subtracting the total amount of financial aid (grants, loans, and work study) from the total student-reported cost. In 1992-93, full-time, full-year low income undergraduates had an average net cost of $7,600, ranging from $6,500 at public 4-year to $9,700 at private, for-profit institutions (figure 11 and table 13). While financial aid does not equalize educational costs across types of institutions, it does have an impact on the relative costs of attending some types of institutions. For example, hile the average total cost of attending a public less-than-4-year institution was less than the average total cost of attending a public 4-year institution ($10,100 compared with $11,400, table 7), the average net cost was not less ($7,300 compared with $6,500, table 13).\u00b0T his includes students without aid. Because 99 percent of all full-time, full-year low income students had financial need and thus would have been eligible for financial aid, it seemed more appropriate to include all of them in the calculation of the ratios in this table, rather than to limit the calculation to just those who received aid. 1.9 -Sample size was too small for a reliable estimate."}, {"section_title": "NOTE:", "text": "The ratio \"total aid/student-reported cost\" was calculated for all students; the other ratios were calculated for aided students only. Financial aid reduced educational costs for full-time, full-year low income students. Nevertheless, a substantial gap remained between their average net cost of $7,600 and their average EFC of $1,600. Unmet need, for financial aid purposes, is what remains after subtracting financial aid and the EFC from the budget established by the institution (not student-reported costs). In 1992-93, 94 percent of all full-time, full-year low income students had unmet need (table  13). The overall average unmet need (including students with zero need) was $4,900, and ranged from $3,700 at public 4-year institutions to $8,100 at private, for-profit institutions.\" Independents with dependents had the greatest unmet need at each type of institution, reflecting their lower EFCs and partially reflecting the maximum award limits in grant and loan programs. In part, the unmet need also reflects an apparent reluctance of low income students to borrow. Despite their unmet need, full-time, full-year low income students did not always l'The average unmet need was somewhat lower than the gap between net costs and the EFC. This can be explained by the fact that unmet need is calculated with reference to the institutionally determined budget (which averaged $10,900, table 7), while net costs are calculated with reference to student-reported costs (which averaged $12,600). Figure 11Average total cost, net cost, and unmet need for low income undergraduates attending full time, full year, by type of institution: 1992-93 borrow as much as they could have through the Stafford loan program (table 14). A full 64 percent of those with $2,000 or more in unmet need did not take out a Stafford loan, and another 15 percent borrowed less than the maximum. Those with the lowest net costs and lowest unmet need (less than $1,000) were more likely than those with net costs or unmet need greater than $2,000 to have borrowed the maximum. This pattern is expected, because borrowing contributed to reducing their need and net cost.

In 1992-93, 50 percent of low income dependent undergraduates who attended full time, full year received money from their parents. Among those who did, the average amount was $2,800 (table 15). In contrast, 78 percent of the full-time, full-year dependent undergraduates who were not from low income families received money from their parents. They received an average of $5,600, about twice as much as their low income counterparts (table 16). Of particular interest is parental support to the low income dependent students who did not receive financial aid (although only 11 percent of full-time, full-year low income dependent undergraduates were in this position, table 8). The unaided students were much more likely than their aided counterparts to receive parental contributions (77 percent compared with 46 percent), and they received more, on average ($6,000 compared with $1,900) (table 15). This suggests that while the parents of low income dependent students without financial aid in 1992-93 had low incomes in 1991 (the reference year for determining income), they had other financial resources. For example, they may not have been low income on a long-term basis and may have been able to accumulate savings before 1991, or a noncustAial parent may have made a substantial contribution. Nine percent of low income dependent undergraduates attending full time, full year received loans from their parents, averaging $1,800 (table 15). A similar percentage (11 percent) of their non low income counterparts received loans from their parents (table  16), but the non low income students received more, on average ($3,100 compared with $1,800), reflecting their families' greater resources. Parents often make non-cash contributions to their students' support in addition to or in place of direct financial assistance. For example, students may live at home while enrolled or during the summer, allowing them to reduce their housing costs and save money from sumn. r jobs to cover educational expenses. Parents may offer a variety of other types of support, such as furniture, meals, clothing, or the use of a car, to trine only a few.

This is not surprising, because the students who were not low income would have had less need for paremal support. Low income independent students may or may not have low income parents. Whether or not their parents contribute is influenced by both their willingness to contribute and their financial ability to do so. Parental contributions to independents with dependents followed a similar pattern, with low income students also being more likely to receive assistance.

While one might expect low income independent students attending full time, full year to be less likely than their non low income counterparts to work (not working makes them more likely to have low incomes), it is not obvious why the same would be true for low income dependent students attending full time, full year. One possibility is that their family backgrounds give them less access to jobs.

In fact, among undergraduates enrolling in postsecondary education for the first time in 1989-90 who were seeking a deg ee or certificate, low income students were more likely than other students to have not attained and not be enrolled in 1994 (44 percent compared with 36 percent) (table 17). Limiting consideration to students seeking a bachelor's degree, the relationship was the same (although bachelor's degree seekers overall were less likely to be no longer enrolled): 30 percent of low income students had not completed their degree and were no longer enrolled, compared with 24 percent of other students (table 18).  If low income students were more likely than other students to have to interrupt their studies for financial reasons, this should be most evident among students seeking bachelor's degrees, because they take longer to complete. However, both groups were about equally likely to have interrupted their enrollment and returned whether they completed their studies or were still enrolled in 1994. Persistence is affected by a variety of factors other than income. This study's approach of controlling for group differences by crosstabulation has limitations with survey data: sample size limits the number of cells into which the data can be usefully subdivided, and there are complex interrelationships among variables that cannot be disentangled in tabular analyses. To overcome these limitations, linear models are frequently used to examine several sets of variables simultaneously. One such model, linear regression, is used here to estimate these effects (adjusted means).2' The regression model takes into account the effect of all variables in the model simultaneously and thus controls for interrelationships among variables that can influence tabular findings. By estimating the joint effect of all variables taken together, regression models can be used to test individual parameters while holding constant the influence of other variables. Of particular interest here is whether the pattern of greater likelihood of leaving without completing or reenrolling found among low income students is related to their low income status, or whether it is related to other characteristics associated with persistence that are more common among low income students. Table 19 shows the adjusted percentages of 1989-90 beginning postsecondary students seeking degrees who completed any degree by 1994 or were still enrolled, taldng into account other student characteristics. The unadjusted means are included for comparison. Low income was not a significant predictor of attaining any degree or being still enrolled in postsecondary education when other variables in the model were taken into consideration. Characteristics associated with a higher likelihood of attaining any degree or being still enrolled included being female, having parents with a bachelor's degree or higher (compared with high school or less), receiving parental contributions, ant having taken out a loan in at least one year.22 Characteristics associated with a lower likelihood of attaining any degree or being still enrolled were being black, non-Hispanic (compared with white, non-Hispanic), enrolling part time to start, and borrowing from parents.

The average budget for a full-time, full-year low income undergraduate in 1992-93 was $10,900. However, according to the methodologies for calculating financial need, the expected average EFC for low income students was only $1,600, leaving a large gap between educational costs and what low income families were expected to pay. To help provide low income students with the opportunity to enroll in postsecondary education, the federal and state governments, the institutions in which students enroll, and other organizations supply a substantial amount of financial aid to help low income students pay for their postsecondary education. In 1992-93, 88 percent of all low income undergraduates who attended full time, full year received some form of aid (grants, loans, or work study), averaging a total of $5,800 for those receiving aid. Financial aid covered an average of 42 percent of their total costs. For aided students, 65 percent of the aid was in the form of grants, on average, and 26 percent was in the form of loans. Despite this financial aid, full-time, full-year low income students, on average, were left with costs that exceeded their EFC. The average net cost for these students (the amount the student and his or her family had to pay aft..!T subtracting total financial aid from studentreported costs) was $7,600 (considerably higher than the average EFC of $1,600). Exactly how students cover these costs is unknown. However, the NPSAS data provide some information on parent contributions and work, two major sources of support. While low income students attending full time, full year were less likely than those who were not low income to receive parental contribui,ons (37 percent compared with 68 percent), those who did receive money from their parents received an average of $2,900. Full-time, full-year students worked an average of 22 hours per week while enrolled, whether or not they were low income. Those with low incomes who worked earned an average of $4,200 during the 1992-93 academic year (including the summer). According to these data, parental support and work do not appear to have been sufficient to cover low income students' net costs, on average, yet they still somehow managed to attend. How? One possibility is that students overestimated their costs. It is very difficult for most people to remember exactly what they have spent on living expenses during any given year, especially if they are not living on campus and receiving room and board bills. Another possibility is that students actually earned more than they reported. Many students pick up extra cash through short-term jobs (sometimes lasting only a day), and this income may not have been included.

The 1992-93 NPSAS survey sample, while representative and statistically accurate, was not a simple random sample. Instead, the survey sample was selected using a more complex three-step procedure with stratified samples and differential probabilities of selection at each level. First, postsecondary institutions were initially sebcted within geographical strata. Once institutions were organized by zip code and state, they were further stratified by control (i.e., public; private, not-for-profit; or private, for-profit) and offering (less-than-2year, 2-to 3-year, 4-year nondoctorate-granting, and 4-year doctorate-granting). Sampling rates for students enrolled at different institutions and levels (undergraduate or oth-r) varied. resulting in better data for policy purposes, but at a cost to statistical efficiency. For each student in the NPSAS sample, there were up to three sources of data. First, institution registration and financial aid records were extracted.

Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and non-sampling errors. Sampling errors occur because observations are made only on samples of students, not on entire populations. Non-sampling errors occur not only in sample surveys but also in complete censuses of entire populations. Non-sampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all students in all institutions in the sample (some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and imputing missing data."}, {"section_title": "Data Analysis System", "text": "The estimates presented in this report were produced using the NPSAS:93 Undergraduate Data Analysis System (DAS) and the BPS:90/94 DAS.

In addition to the table estimates, the DAS calculates proper standard errors24 and weighted 24The NPSAS sample is not a simple random sample and, therefore, simple random sample techniques for estimating sampling error cannot be applied to these data. The DAS takes into account the complexity of the sampling procedtaes and calculates standard errors appropriate for such samples. The method for computing sampling errors used by the DAS involves approximating the estimator by the linear terms of a Taylor series expansion. The procedure is typically referred to as the Taylor series method. sample sizes for these estimates. For example, table B. 1 presents the standard errors that correspond to table 8 in the text. If the number of valid cases is too small to produce an estimate, the DAS prints the message \"low-N\" instead of the estimate. In addition to tables, the DAS will also produce a correlation matrix of selected variables to be used for linear regression models. Also output with the correlation matrix are the design effects (DEFT) for all the variables identified in the matrix. Since statistical procedures generally compute regression coefficients based on simple random sample assumptions, the standard errors must be adjusted with the design effects to take into account the NPSAS stratified sampling method.

Each procedure is described below."}, {"section_title": "Dijferences Between Means", "text": "The descriptive comparisons were tested in this report using Student's t statistic. Differences between estimates are tested against the probability of a Type I error, or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the Student's t values for the differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing. Student's t values may be computed to test the difference between estimates with the following formula: where E, and E2 are the estimates to be compared and se, and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates were not independent (for example, when comparing the percentages across a 64 (1) percentage distribution), a covariance term was added to the denominator of the t-test formula. There are hazards in reporting statistical tests for each comparison. First, comparisons based on large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This can be misleading, since the magnitude of the t statistic is related not only to the observed differences in means or percentages but also to the number of students in the specific categories used for comparison. Hence, a small difference compared across a large number of students would produce a large t statistic. A second hazard in reporting statistical tests for each comparison occurs when making multiple comparisons among categories of an independent variable. For example, when making paired comparisons among different levels of income, the probability of a Type I error for these comparisons taken as a group is larger than the probability for a single comparison. When more than one difference between groups of related characteristics or \"families\" are tested for statistical significance, one must apply a standard that assures a level of significance for all of those comparisons taken together. Comparisons were made in this report only when p .05/k for a particular pairwise comparison, where that comparison was one of k tests within a family. This guarantees both that the individual comparison would have p .05 and that for k comparisons within a family of possible comparisons, the significance level for all the comparisons will sum to p < .05.25 For example, in a comparison of the percentages of males and females who enrolled in postsecondary education only one comparison is possible (males versus females). In this family, k= 1, and the comparison can be evaluated without adjusting the significance level. When students are divided into five racial-ethnic groups and all possible comparisons are made, then k= 10 and the significance level of each test must be p 5 .05/10, or p .005. The formula for c-1culating family size (k) is as follows: where j is the number of categories for the variable being tested. In the case of race-ethnicity, there are five racial-ethnic groups (American Indian, Asian/Pacific Islander, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, and white non-Hispanic), so substituting 5 for j in equation 2, k 5 x (5 1) 10 2 2sThe standard that p5.05/k for each comparison is more stringent than the criterion that the significance level of the comparisons should sum to p5.05.

For example, when examining the percentages of those who completed a degree, it is impossible to know to what extent the observed variation is due to low income status differences and to what extent it is due to differences in other factors related to income, such as type of institution attended, parents' education, and so on. However, if a table were produced showing income within, type of institution within parent's education within, for example, the cell sizes would be too small to identify the patterns. When the sample size becomes too small to support controls for another level of variation, one must use other methods to take such variation into account. To overcome this difficulty, multiple linear regression was used to obtain means that were adjusted for covariation among a list of control variables. Adjusted means for subgroups were obtained by regressing the dependent variable on a set of descriptive variables such as gender, race-ethnicity, parents' education, etc. Substituting ones or zeros for the subgroup characteristic(s) of interest and the mean proportions for the other variables results in an estimate of the adjusted proportion for the specified subgroup, holding all other variables constant. For example, consider a hypothetical case in which two variables, age and gender, are used to describe an outcome, Y (such as completing a degree). The variables age and gender are recoded into a dummy variable representing age and a dummy variable representing gender: The following regression equation is then estimated from the correlation matrix output from the DAS: To estimate the adjusted mean for any subgroup evaluated at the mean of all other variables, one substitutes the appropriate values for that subgroup's dummy variables (1 or 0) and the mean for the dummy variable(s) representing all other subgroups. For example, suppose we had a case where Y=was being described by age (A) and gender (G), coded as shown above, and the means for A and G are:"}]
