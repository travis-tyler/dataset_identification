Shallow water environments are vital to the coastal community, providing an enormous mix of ecological services. Managing coastal habitats for sustained ecosystem functioning, while accommodating increasing developmental pressures, has never been simple. The challenge is multiplied by the fact that the entire system is changing, driven by both human uses and climate change. Chesapeake Bay is extremely vulnerable to climate change as rates of relative sea level rise (SLR) are currently more than double the global mean and rising (~4.2mm/yr in Chesapeake vs. 1.7 mm/yr globally). As climate change continues, sea level rise rates are expected to increase and additional negative effects likely will include intensified coastal flood and storm events, increased shore erosion, inundation of wetlands and low-lying lands, and salt-water intrusion into groundwater. Climate change effects on coastal habitats and species will not occur in isolation, but within a socio-economic context. Land and shoreline development will likely affect the character and magnitude of climate impact, potentially exacerbating ecosystem integrity loss. Areas with shoreline and riparian development effectively prevent the migration of coastal habitats landward in response to climate changes."}, {"section_title": "In Virginia tidal waters", "text": "o Approximately 11.1% of shoreline has been hardened (793 km hardened/7134 km shoreline surveyed), and on average, 29 km of shoreline continue to be hardened each year. o Over one-quarter of riparian lands are currently developed (including commercial, residential, industrial and paved land use). The principal objective of this study was to develop a characterization of current shallow-water habitat components in Virginia tidal waters and predict climate driven changes to these habitats.

Preserving landscapes that allow for the transgression of the Bay's essential shallow-water habitats should be a high conservation priority. Loss or reduction in function of these habitats could significantly alter the character of Chesapeake Bay from a highly productive shallow-water estuary that provides crucial spawning and nursery habitat for numerous species to a deep open-water system.

They are intended to illustrate general regional trends in coastal habitat distribution and vulnerability to climate change. Once additional high resolution data become available, refinement of estimates and increased precision will become possible for future model iterations.

Shallow water environments are vital to the coastal community, providing an enormous mix of ecological services. Managing coastal habitats for sustained ecosystem functioning, while accommodating increasing developmental pressures, has never been simple. The challenge is multiplied by the fact that the entire system is changing, driven by both human uses and climate change. Effective management requires some understanding of not only current conditions, but also potential future conditions. The state of scientific understanding does not yet support precise forecasting, but there is a sufficient array of information to begin assessing potentials for change in some key components of the system. The principal objective of this study was to develop a characterization of current shallow-water habitat components in Virginia tidal waters and predict climate driven changes to these habitats. Forecasting potential future distributions of shallow water habitat parameters requires a wide mix of information. Virginia has reasonably well developed inventories of intertidal wetlands, submerged aquatic vegetation, riparian land uses, shoreline structures, topography and bathymetry, as well as water quality monitoring datasets. Combined with potential future climate scenarios developed for the mid-Atlantic region, this information can be used to assess potential changes in current distributions of key components of shallow tidal water habitat quality. A wide variety of data regarding the littoral and riparian areas along Virginia's estuarine shorelines were integrated under a GIS framework. Simple models were constructed that forecast the distribution of key coastal habitat parameters within the next 50 to 100 years including: shallow-water areas, tidal wetlands, submerged aquatic vegetation and estuarine beaches. Drivers for the forecast models include sea-level rise, temperature, salinity, and land development. The spatially-explicit analysis describes potential outcomes under current management practices and reasoned forecasts of future conditions. The purpose is to inform management and planning efforts by identifying areas at significant risk for changes to habitat components, and areas with significant potential to support critical habitat components in the future. This will enable managers to make proactive decisions that can mitigate impacts and preserve opportunities for sustained habitat services as the estuarine system evolves. From a practical perspective, understanding potential futures can inform targeting of limited management resources to areas at greatest risk and/or areas with the greatest probability for successful outcomes."}, {"section_title": "COASTAL HABITAT DEFINITIONS & STRESSORS", "text": "The nearshore environment is generally defined as the area encompassing the transition from subtidal marine habitats to associated upland systems ( Fig. 1). For this study, this area was inclusive of habitats from the estuarine riparian zone to the shallow subtidal waters (~2 m depth). Within this range strong interactions occur between the marine environment and upland habitats. For example, upland vegetation supports bank stability, captures nutrient run-off, shades the upper intertidal zone and adds terrestrial matter (e.g. woody debris for fish refuge) to the nearshore estuarine ecosystem. Nearshore habitats are highly vulnerable to change from anthropogenic and natural drivers in the system. In the Chesapeake Bay, significant coastal stressors include Since stressors are interactive, an examination of the potential combined effect of climate change and land development on nearshore habitats will enhance scientific understanding of system responses and the ability to manage for future conditions."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Habitats Evaluated", "text": "Within the shallow tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay important habitats for flora and fauna are supported including tidal wetlands, submerged aquatic vegetation, estuarine beaches and shallow water areas (defined below).

The modified version, while retaining the same coding, extends the boundary of some segments inland in order to include all coastal and riparian habitats (Fig. 2). Segments were primarily derived based on salinity regime, a fundamental physical factor influencing habitat and biological organization within an estuarine system.  "}, {"section_title": "Trends for each coastal habitat are presented for all tidal Virginia waters and by individual segment.", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "CLIMATE CHANGE AND SHORELINE HARDENING", "text": "Shoreline hardening and land development have had documented adverse effects on nearshore habitats and dependent species (e.g. Beauchamp et al. 1994;Jennings et al. 1999;Lerberg et al. 2000;DeLuca et al. 2004;Bilkovic et al. 2006;Seitz et al. 2006;Bilkovic and Roggero 2008). Climate change will exacerbate the issue by inciting increases in shoreline hardening for protection as sea level rises and storm activity intensifies. To more accurately anticipate changes to coastal habitats, upland and shoreline development was integrated with climate change stressors (e.g. sea level rise). The availability of shoreline inventories and remotely-sensed land use facilitated efforts to evaluate the combined effects of existing development with projected system changes. Shoreline and riparian characteristics were extracted from a comprehensive inventory of shoreline condition available for much of Virginia's tidal waters ( Fig. 3; http://ccrm.vims.edu/gis_data_maps/shoreline_inventories/index.html). The inventory protocol was specifically developed for Virginia and Maryland coastlines and included a spatially-explicit method for collecting, classifying, mapping, and reporting conditions along the shore. The inventory employed a continuous three-tiered shoreline assessment approach, dividing the shorezone into three regions 1) immediate riparian zone, evaluated for land use; 2) bank, evaluated for height, stability, cover and natural protection; and 3) shoreline, describing the presence of shoreline structures for shore protection and recreational purposes. Data collection was performed in the field from a small, shoal draft vessel, navigating at slow speeds parallel to the shoreline. To the extent possible, surveys took place on a rising tide, allowing the boat to be as close to shore as possible. A complete set of geographically referenced shoreline data was acquired using a pre-programmed data-dictionary in a handheld Trimble GPS GeoExplorer receiver that included a suite of characteristics describing riparian land use, bank condition, and shoreline features. GeoExplorers were accurate to within 10 cm of true position with extended observations and differential correction. Without post processing, these units can achieve accuracies of approximately 1 m. Both static and kinematic data collection was performed. Kinematic data were collected continuously along a pathway (in this case along the waterway) at a rate sufficient to compute a position anywhere along the course (i.e. one observation every five seconds). Land use, bank condition, and linear shoreline structures were collected using this technique. Static surveys used the GPS receiver to pin-point fixed locations, such as piers, based on the average of 6 static observations. GPS field data were converted to GIS spatial coverages which were corrected to reflect true shoreline geometry (for additional details see Berman et al. 2007). For a small portion of the modeled area shoreline inventory data were not available ( Fig. 3), in these instances land use data (Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP 2005)) were substituted within habitat models.  Overall, 27% of Virginia tidal riparian lands are developed (Fig. 5). Riparian development in the form of commercial, residential, industrial or paved land use exceeds 20% in the majority of examined Chesapeake Bay Segments. An ecological threshold of ~ 20% development (e.g. residential or commercial land use, impervious surface) has been associated with reduced biotic integrity in fish (Limburg and Schmidt 1990, Wang et al. 1997, Paul and Meyer 2001, Bilkovic and Roggero 2008, benthic (Bilkovic et al. 2006) "}, {"section_title": "SHORELINE HARDENING TRENDS", "text": "The majority of Virginia localities do not exhibit consistent temporal trends in shoreline hardening for erosion control. While variability may exist among years (e.g. high permit activity following a significant storm event), long-term trends illustrate anticipated futures of shoreline alteration. Based on long-term averages of Virginia shoreline permit application records (1988,(1993)(1994)(1995)(1996)(1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007), annual increases in shoreline hardening (bulkhead and riprap placement) were estimated for each Virginia tidal water locality ( Fig. 6; http://ccrm.vims.edu/perms/newpermits.html). On average, 29 km of shoreline are hardened each year in Virginia. Based on current average rates of shoreline hardening, approximately 9-18% of additional Virginia shoreline will be hardened 50 -100 years into the future (assuming no shifts in management practices and no accelerated activity due to sea level rise and storm events). Three localities (City of Hampton, Virginia Beach and Stafford County) exhibited declining shoreline hardening trends over the 14 year time frame. These localities are heavily developed and shoreline structure placement has likely slowed due to the unavailability of natural shorelines in association with residential land use to harden. For instance, comprehensive tidal shoreline inventories in Stafford County (Berman et al. 2006) indicated that 36% of the surveyed shoreline was hardened.

In the absence of high precision data to facilitate site-specific planning, modeling bestavailable data allows for the evaluation of projected trends across larger spatial scales. To accurately assess the future effect of sea level rise and climate change on ecosystems, a merged land/water elevation surface must be created that integrates disparate bathymetric and topographic data. These datasets are collected by different agencies, along varying time frames, and reported in different specifications (e.g. vertical datums). Thus, integration of these data requires a variety of approaches to ensure that the final product consists of the best available data converted to a common geospatial framework (e.g. same vertical and horizontal datum and coordinate system) (Gesch and Wilson 2002). In Virginia, high precision LIDAR (Light Detecting and Ranging) data are unavailable; therefore, existing topographic and bathymetric data were evaluated for spatial extent and resolution. The best-available data were then extracted for the development of an elevation surface with application in large-scale climate change analyses of shallow tidal Virginia waters."}, {"section_title": "BATHYMETRY", "text": "Bathymetric digital sounding data were extracted from the NOAA's National Ocean Service Hydrographic Database maintained by the National Geophysical Data Center. These data were in the form of soundings collected from the early 1900s to the present. Because these data were taken with different methods throughout history the resolution can be highly variable with soundings ranging from approximately 12 -60 meters apart in the tidal waters of Virginia, and gaps in coverage also exist ( Fig. 7). Bathymetric data are referenced to local tidal datums (e.g. MLW, MLLW); therefore, data must be converted to a standard vertical datum with a fixed benchmark to merge with topographic data. Data conversion between various tidal datums and a fixed datum coordinate system (e.g. NAVD88) can be accomplished with the VDatum tool developed jointly by NOAA's National Geodetic Survey (NGS), Office of Coast Survey (OCS), and Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) (http://vdatum.noaa.gov/). "}, {"section_title": "TOPOGRAPHY", "text": "Two topographic datasets are currently available that provide extensive coverage of the Commonwealth: 1) National Elevation Dataset (NED), which is the primary elevation product of the U.S. Geological Survey; and 2) Digital Terrain Model (DTM) from the Virginia Base Mapping Program (VBMP), managed by the Virginia Geographic Information Network (VGIN). The NED has the advantage of high horizontal resolution (1/3 arc-second (roughly 10 meter) horizontal resolution for the study area). However, the vertical resolution is relatively poor; although it is improving as higher quality data are added. Resolution is variable because of the variety of source data, but the USGS cites an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.44 meters (USGS, Vertical Accuracy of the National Elevation Dataset, URL: http://ned.usgs.gov/ Downloads/documents/NED_Accuracy.pdf). This resolution is likely inadequate for sub-meter sea level rise projections (Gesch et al 2009). The VBMP DTM data has variable horizontal resolution, with an average spacing between elevation sampling points of 9.4 m. Horizontal positional accuracy depends on the scale of the orthophotography (100, 200 or 400 scale) compiled to meet or exceed 2.4, 4.9 or 9.8 foot horizontal accuracy at 95% confidence level in accordance with National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA). However, vertical resolution is significantly better than the NED. Vertical resolution varies depending on the pixel resolution from RMSE of 0.5 -0.6 ft (0.15-0.18 m) to RMSE of 1.0 -1.2 ft (0.30-0.37m) (Virginia Geographic Information Network (VGIN); Metadata: http://gisdata.virginia.gov/Portal/). The DTM also contains 3D break lines and mass points to more accurately define abrupt changes in topography. Therefore, the VBMP provides the highest resolution terrain model available in Virginia.

To generate the seamless surface, bathymetric and topographic data were combined and interpolated into a raster using the \"Topo to Raster tool\" included in the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst. This tool is based on the ANUDEM program developed by Hutchinson (1989) that was explicitly designed for the creation of hydrologically correct digital elevation models. It is the only ArcGIS interpolator designed to work with 3D feature inputs using this method. To enhance processing speeds, the study area was divided into a large number of arbitrary segments for which surfaces were independently generated. The completed 3-D seamless topographic/bathymetric elevation surface covered the majority of Virginia tidal waters with some exceptions due to deficient data (e.g. digital soundings unavailable for the upper reaches of Chickahominy River) ( Fig.  8).

Areas without recent bathymetry are likely not accurately portrayed as erosion and sedimentation processes alter those soundings. Additionally, bathymetric data coverage varied significantly across Virginia waters with sparse or no digital sounding data coverage in many upstream reaches. Areas without the necessary digital sounding data required for GIS analyses had to be excluded. As more precise data become available within shallow water (e.g. LIDAR), habitats historically underestimated can be added to future projections. As such, habitat models were structured to elucidate trends across large spatial scales, not at the sitespecific level.

Relative sea level rise is the sum of global sea level rise plus localized vertical land movement. The high rates observed in the Chesapeake Bay are due to natural land subsidence caused by glacial isostatic adjustment (the postglacial collapse of a glacial forebulge from the last ice age) and tectonic uplift, as well as anthropogenic influences such as ground-water withdrawal that cause sediment compaction and further land subsidence. Expected negative effects of sea level rise include intensified coastal flood and storm events, increased shore erosion, inundation of wetlands and low-lying lands, and saltwater intrusion into groundwater (Pyke et al. 2008)."}, {"section_title": "MODELED SEA LEVEL RISE SCENARIOS", "text": "Two relative sea level rise scenarios (S1 and S2) were modeled and illustrated for the years 2050 and 2100.

Rising SLR threatens to outpace marshes ability to vertically accrete sediment and hardened shorelines prevent movement inland. Chesapeake Bay is highly developed with much of its population living on the coasts. Home-owners have traditionally used shoreline armoring techniques such as bulkhead and riprap to prevent erosion of their land. However, shoreline hardening reduces sediment available to marshes for vertical accretion and blocks their landward migration, so they will likely drown in place as SLR continues. The use of living shoreline techniques to protect shorelines from erosion which incorporate natural elements (e.g. marshes) is being promoted in the hopes that these habitats can be protected from SLR.

A uniformly applied increase of 1, 3 and 6\u00baC was modeled to illustrate potential shifts in suitable habitat for critical estuarine components (e.g. SAV) ( Fig. 11). For example, an elevation of average summertime temperatures by 3\u00baC will result in extensive reaches in the polyhaline exceeding 30\u00baC, which is the maximum temperature to ensure eelgrass survival. An elevation of 6\u00baC will result in dramatic temperature increases throughout the mainstem and tributaries that will extensively affect flora and fauna communities as habitat suitability is lost across much of the Bay. With these projected temperature increases, successful invasions by tropical species will increase as they can tolerate elevations in temperature and salinity and out-compete native species. Likewise, the relied upon cues for spawning and feeding will be altered as climate changes affecting population survival. For example, anadromous fish, such as American shad, rely on changes in water temperature in the spring to initiate spawning runs up tributaries. Recent research by Austin (2002) has indicated average spring water temperature, defined as when temperature first reaches 15\u00b0 C, is occurring 3 weeks earlier than in the past 50 years. Earlier spawning runs may result in a mismatch with the availability of necessary food items for young fish, which can lead to reductions or failures of year-classes."}, {"section_title": "Salinity Projections", "text": "Salinity variability and the unavailability of precise predictions of precipitation changes make it difficult to project salinity increases, particularly in the tributaries.

The new shallow water area (km 2 ) from MLW and \u2264 2 m depth was estimated for each Chesapeake Bay segment using 3D Analyst in ArcGIS. Land use data (CCAP 2005) were examined in relation to newly defined shifts in shallow water since land development which has the potential to prevent habitat migration. Using the Identity function which computes a geometric intersection of the input features (land use) and identity features (shallow water), area of development coincident with projected shallow water was calculated for each segment. The area of land development (CCAP categories: Developed -high, medium and low intensity and open space) that occurred within the projected shift in the shallow water habitat zone was then subtracted from projected shallow water areas. Based on current rates of shoreline and land development, the model likely overestimates future shallow-water habitat unless management practices are drastically altered.\nBeach vulnerability was evaluated based on the assumption that without an enduring sediment source the habitat becomes unsustainable under accelerated sea level rise. Current beach distribution was extracted from VIMS-CCRM Shoreline Inventories and VIMS-Shoreline Studies Program Surveys (Fig. 19). Merging these datasets provided the most comprehensive inventory of beaches within tidal Virginia waters. Each dataset while providing similar positional and size (length) estimates of beaches had different reporting protocols; therefore, criteria for vulnerability assessment varied depending on the source data available for a shoreline reach. When riparian data were available from Shoreline Inventories (VIMS-CCRM), criteria based on land development and bank conditions were applied. The beach dataset was unioned with riparian land use data from the Shoreline Inventory to query adjacent conditions.

Beaches considered low risk were coincident or adjacent to erosional banks (sediment source) and unmanaged/agricultural riparian lands (allow migration of beaches landward).

In the Chesapeake Bay, eelgrass is near the southern limit of its distribution on the east coast and summer temperature in excess of 30\u00b0C has led to dieback (Moore and Jarvis 2008). The most commonly observed species in mesohaline--tidal fresh waters are Ruppia maritima (widgeon grass), Vallisneria americana (wild celery), Hydrilla verticillata (hydrilla), Potamogeton perfoliatus (redhead grass), Stuckenia pectinata (P. pectinatus) (sago pondweed), Myriophyllum spicatum (Eurasian watermilfoil), and Ceratophyllum demersum (coontail). R. maritima is tolerant of a wide range of salinities and is often observed growing with eelgrass in high saline waters (Stevenson and Confer 1978, Orth et al. 1979, Orth and Moore 1981, 1983, Moore et al. 2000. Cumulative submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) distribution over 10 years (1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007). Annual survey data from the SAV Program at VIMS were merged to represent a composite of current potential SAV distribution. Due to SAV light requirements, anticipated decrease in water clarity from climate change, and known current SAV distribution, the SAV habitat zone was conservatively restricted to 0 -2 meters depth. While precise seagrass responses to sea level rise are uncertain, a 50 cm increase in water depth has been estimated to reduce light penetration to current seagrass beds by 50% which would have significant effects on seagrass growth (Short and Neckles 1999). Additional factors influencing the ability of SAV to migrate inland as existing suitable habitats are altered include substrate type, shore slope and development, tide range, and nutrient enrichment (Stevenson et al. 2002, Short andNeckles 1999). Loss of SAV habitat will have cascading effects on the entire Bay ecosystem as numerous species depend on these habitats for refuge and food, including the young of economically important fish and shellfish, such as blue crabs (Lipcius et al. 2005). Currently, seagrass beds have not been observed in 7 Segments: Middle York River (YRKMH), Lower Mattaponi River (MPNOH), Lower Pamunkey River (PMKOH), Upper Pocomoke River (POCOH), Middle Rappahannock River (RPPOH), Elizabeth River (ELIPH), and Laffayette River (LAFMH).\nThe potential for reduction of existing SAV beds due to sea level rise and temperature elevation illustrates the extent that present ecosystem will be affected. Individual Chesapeake Bay segments were depicted with a relative rise in sea level of 0.6 m by 2050 and 1.6 m by 2100. SAV beds in polyhaline (PH) segments are predominantly comprised of eelgrass, which have known susceptibility to elevated temperatures. Therefore, polyhaline segment illustrations depict projected loss of eelgrass from the combination of sea level rise and elevated temperature (1, 3 and 6\u00baC). Increases in summertime temperatures of 6\u00baC result in complete loss of eelgrass. Enhanced research is needed on the potential effects of the loss of seagrass bed ecosystems on Bay productivity, as well as the probability that alternate aquatic plant species may provide similar ecosystem functions.

The first model was developed to estimate potential tidal wetland habitat area (inclusive of vegetated and non-vegetated wetlands) in relation to sea level rise and land development.

Increased frequency and duration of high summertime temperatures, in excess of 30\u00b0C, has been associated with intensified eelgrass dieback (Moore and Jarvis 2008); therefore, 30\u00b0C was used as a critical threshold for eelgrass survival. Potential loss of eelgrass habitat was determined for predicted future environments based on a) Sea level rise (S1 and S2) Habitats with depths > 2m were considered unsuitable for eelgrass survival b) Increases in summer water temperature at three levels (1, 3 and 6\u00baC) Areas \u2265 30\u00baC resulted in eelgrass loss c) Combination of projected SLR and summer water temperature conditions Greater than 2m depth OR \u2265 30 \u00baC resulted in eelgrass loss For each future sea level rise scenario and time-step, the area between 0 and 2 m was extracted from the elevation surface and clipped with the composite SAV coverage to produce coverages of remaining SAV after sea level rise events. High water temperature areas (\u2265 30\u00baC) were extracted from the interpolated temperature projections (temperature increases by 1, 3 and 6\u00baC) which were converted from raster to polygons. In order to identify SAV habitat areas where the temperature will be \u2265 30\u00b0C, the composite coverage of existing SAV was combined (UNION function) with extracted projected areas of high temperature. The combined effect of sea level rise and temperature elevations was examined by the UNION of individual coverages of remaining SAV for each scenario (S1 and S2) and time-step, with extracted areas of high temperature (\u2265 30 \u00baC) for each posited level of temperature increase (1, 3 and 6\u00baC)."}, {"section_title": "2) Mixed SAV species -Mesohaline -Tidal Fresh Waters", "text": "Unlike high saline waters that are dominated by one or two species (i.e. Zostera marina and Ruppia maritima), a large number of species are present in brackish and fresh waters. Because habitat suitability requirements vary from species to species it is difficult to model potential future distributions of mixed-species SAV. However, the majority of the species in the Chesapeake Bay are limited to waters < 2m depth due to water clarity requirements for photosynthesis. Potential loss of SAV habitat in mesohaline -tidal fresh waters was determined for predicted future environments based on sea level rise (S1 and S2). Habitats with projected depths > 2m were considered unsuitable for SAV. For each future sea level rise scenario and time-step, the area between 0 and 2 m was extracted from the elevation surface and clipped with the composite SAV coverage to produce coverages of remaining SAV after sea level rise events. Because temperature requirements are currently unknown for many of the seagrass species, a maximum temperature could not be ascribed as a criterion. While additions and inland shifts in SAV communities cannot be precisely modeled at this time, estimates of the effects of sea level rise to existing SAV can be achieved (i.e. loss of suitable SAV habitat due to increases in water depths above the 2 m threshold).

Anticipated SAV loss due to sea level rise ranges from 13-76% for the two climate scenarios (S1 and S2) at 2050 and 2100 ( Table 5). The highest initial losses were estimated in tidal fresh systems (~ 28 and 40% loss by 2050 for S1 and S2, respectively). By 2100, oligohaline and tidal fresh were projected to experience similarly high SAV losses (~32 and 82% loss, for S1 and S2, respectively), and mesohaline SAV loss ranged from 17 to 72%. Because SAV species diversity increases as salinity decreases and species habitat requirements vary, there is a possibility that a given species in lower salinity environments may survive or even thrive in projected climate conditions.

The presence and structure of vegetation is primarily dictated by physical factors such as waterlogged soils, salinity, and exposure. Non-vegetated wetlands include sand and mud flats, which have varying productivity that is partially determined by the character of adjacent habitats. For example, adjacent marshes may provide organic material to mud flat microbial populations which are essential for nutrient cycling in the Bay. Tidal flats, which sustain high abundance of invertebrate prey, are critical foraging areas for migrating shorebirds. Loss of flats could result in habitat limitations for foraging birds leading to reduction in populations (Galbraith et al. 2002)."}, {"section_title": "1) Potential Tidal Wetland Habitat (vegetated & non-vegetated wetlands)", "text": "Potential tidal wetland habitat was defined as the area between MLW (mean low water) and the landward elevation at twice the tidal range (MLW to MHW). Existing and projected Potential tidal wetland habitat area (based on sea level rise scenarios) was estimated for each Chesapeake Bay segment using 3D Analyst in ArcGIS. Following a similar approach as shallow water habitat models, land use data (CCAP 2005) were examined in relation to newly defined shifts in tidal wetland habitat, since land development has the potential to prevent habitat migration. Using the GIS Identity function which computes a geometric intersection of the input features (land use) and identity features (tidal wetlands); area of development coincident with projected tidal wetland habitat was calculated for each segment. The area of land development (CCAP categories: Developed -high, medium and low intensity and open space) that occurred within the projected shift in the tidal wetland habitat zone was then subtracted from projected tidal wetland areas. Again, based on current rates of shoreline and land development, the model likely over-estimates future tidal wetland habitat unless management practices are drastically altered The habitat zone of tidal wetlands was initially modeled to extend from mean low water to an elevation above MLW equal to 1.5 times the mean tide range which simulates jurisdictional boundaries (Code of Virginia \u00a7 28.2-1300). However, upon examination of tidal marshes (TMI) distribution in relation to tidal datums derived from the digital elevation models (using both VBMP and LIDAR), it was observed that wetlands often extended well above that zone (Fig. 16). To accommodate a higher percentage of existing wetlands, the potential wetland habitat zone was extended from mean low water to double the tidal range. Notably, some wetlands still extend above this modeled zone, indicating that wetland habitat limitations should be reexamined especially in reference to jurisdictional boundaries. Figure 16. Guinea Marshes, Virginia. Distribution of existing tidal marsh in relation to estimated tidal wetlands habitat zone (1.5 X tidal range). Tidal marsh extends beyond the estimated habitat zone in some locations, indicating wetland jurisdictional boundaries may underestimate tidal wetland habitat. 2) Tidal Marsh Vulnerability (Vegetated Wetlands) Tidal marsh vulnerability from sea level rise was evaluated in relation to the landscape setting. Lands adjacent or coincident with each tidal marsh (n= 17,093) were examined for the presence of obstacles to landward transgression: 1) shoreline structures (riprap or bulkhead), 2) riparian development (residential, commercial, industrial, or paved), and/or 3) high bank height. Vegetated wetlands within a landscape setting that contains shoreline hardening, upland managed lands, or high bank height are more vulnerable to sea level rise due to their inability to migrate landward. Vegetated wetlands within a landscape setting that contains low bank height, unmanaged uplands and unaltered shoreline have the highest probability of surviving sea level rise through migration and accretion. o High risk marshes are those entirely adjacent to hardened shoreline, riparian land development (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial, paved) and/or banks > 5 ft in height. o Moderate risk marshes are those adjacent to mixed land use conditions (e.g. partial association with shoreline hardening or riparian development). o Low risk marshes are those entirely adjacent to natural lands, a shoreline without structures (riprap or bulkhead), and banks < 5ft Tidal marsh distribution and areal extent were extracted from the Tidal Marsh Inventory (TMI). The TMI database is a digital compilation of tidal marsh inventories conducted in individual Virginia counties produced by Virginia Institute of Marine Science from 1972 until 1988. Tidal wetlands data were collected through site visits to all tidal marshes in Virginia in conjunction with aerial photography for verification. Digitized marsh polygons are coded for marsh or community type, marsh number, and county location. Individual inventories can be viewed from the webpage http://ccrm.vims.edu/publications/tidal_marsh_inventories.html. Shoreline and riparian characteristics were determined with the VIMS-CCRM comprehensive inventory of shoreline condition (detailed on p. 5). For a small section of the modeled area, shoreline inventory data were not available (Fig. 3). These areas were evaluated based on land use data from the Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP 2005). Classification criteria were the proximity to and intensity of upland development (CCAP categories: Developed -high, medium and low intensity and open space) surrounding each tidal wetland. A 100 m buffer was delineated around each tidal marsh and marsh vulnerability was categorized based on land use within the buffer (excluding water) ( Table 7). Tidal Wetlands Model Limitations Tidal wetland sustainability during sea level rise is dependent on the ability of the wetland to vertically accrete and/or horizontally migrate. Vertically accretion, the accumulation of sediment and plant organic matter, equal to or in excess of sea level rise rates allows for the wetland to maintain its position in the landscape. However, vertical accretion rates vary depending on the geomorphic settings, tide and wave energy climates, sediment supply, as well as the plant community structure (Cahoon et al. 2009). Since, detailed vertical accretion rates are unknown for the entire study area, and anticipated sea level rise in this region dramatically exceeds historic rates, the assumption was made that wetlands were susceptible to loss (conversion to open water) unless horizontal migration was possible. The assessment of shifts in wetland distribution was intended to provide landscapescale estimates of wetland susceptibility to climate change. Model output can be used to determine areas at high risk to wetland habitat conversion, as well as potential opportunities for wetland preservation where upland conditions currently allow transgression. The exclusion of local influences such as current and future vertical accretion rates, sediment supply, and dominant plant species, reduces the reliability of site-specific predictions. Output from the two tidal wetland models (Potential Tidal Wetland Habitat and Tidal Marsh Vulnerability) cannot be directly compared due to limitations in the data utilized for the Potential Tidal Wetland Habitat areal estimates. The lack of definitive wetland zone boundaries (i.e. MLW to 1.5 X tidal range) and bathymetric data in upstream areas reduced the precision and areal coverage of projected estimates (e.g. headwater areas could not be modeled). The Tidal Marsh Vulnerability model assessed all marshes measured in the TMI survey, including upstream areas that could not be modeled for Potential Tidal Wetland Habitat. Therefore, in some segments the Potential Tidal Wetland Habitat area will appear to be less than the existing vegetated wetland area. Potential Tidal Wetland Habitat estimates are most reliable in mainstem and downstream areas with robust bathymetric data (Fig. 7).\nPotential tidal wetland habitat in Virginia waters were projected to experience overall declines by 12 -52% under the two SLR scenarios (Table 8). Decreases in habitat occurred in all salinity regimes with the exception of a few select segments (e.g. Mobjack Bay (MOBPH), Piankatank River (PIAMH)) in which increases in potential habitat were modeled where opportunities for wetland landward transgression may exist (Fig. 17, Table 9).

High risk indicates no/minimal opportunity to transgress landward in the face of SLR (Fig. 18, Table 10). Although 38% of existing marshes are moderately-highly vulnerable to SLR due to adjacent development, 62% of marshes may have opportunities for landward transgression. Preserving landscapes that allow for the transgression of the Bay's essential shallow-water habitats should be a high conservation priority.

Tidal freshwater marshes are comprised of plants that are intolerant of sustained saline waters. If average salinity increases, tidal freshwater marshes will likely convert to a brackish marsh community with the possibility of invasion by the aggressive non-native Phragmites australis. This could compromise the ecosystem functions of the marsh, as P. australis colonization has been documented to reduce plant diversity with yet uncertain ecological consequences (e.g. Chambers et al. 1999, Hershner andHavens 2008)."}, {"section_title": "VEGETATED TIDAL WETLANDS & SEA LEVEL RISE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Marsh vulnerability to sea level rise", "text": "Total Tidal Wetlands Evaluated = 510 km 2    (TMI, 1972(TMI, -1988 were evaluated within the study area.
