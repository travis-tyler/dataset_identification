[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The sea surface salinity (SSS) in the global subtropical gyres has been increasing at a rate of 0.01 to 0.03 on the practical salinity scale (PSS-78) per decade (Antonov et al., 2002;Curry et al., 2003;Boyer et al., 2005;Hosoda et al., 2009;Roemmich & Gilson, 2009), and the largest increase has been observed in the subtropical North Atlantic Ocean (Durack et al., 2012;Durack & Wijffels, 2010;Terray et al., 2012). Studies have suggested that the change of subtropical SSS might be a consequence of the increased evaporation-minus-precipitation (hereafter E-P) associated with the global warming (Durack et al., 2012;Durack & Wijffels, 2010;Grodsky et al., 2006;Lago et al., 2015;Skliris et al., 2014;Terray et al., 2012). Two theories have been proposed to explain the response of the global hydrological cycle to rising global temperatures. One theory hypothesizes that the global hydrological cycle intensifies under a global warming trend (Held & Soden, 2006;Zhou et al., 2011), thereby causing dry regions to become drier and wet regions to become wetter. The other theory is based on the observational findings of the poleward expansion of the Hadley Cell since 1979(McCabe et al., 2001Fyfe, 2003;Hudson et al., 2006;Hu & Fu, 2007;Hu et al., 2011). Consequently, the subtropical net evaporation zone has expanded, enhancing the poleward side of the E-P maxima (Scheff & Frierson, 2012;Siler et al., 2018) primarily in boreal winter (Scheff & Frierson, 2012). The North Atlantic Subtropical Underwater (STUW) is formed under the SSS maximum (hereafter SSS-max) by subduction (O'Connor et al., 2005;Schmitt & Blair, 2015), and the ventilation site is mainly located on the poleward side of the SSS-max in the North Atlantic Ocean (Yu et al., 2017). Yu et al. (2017) identified a poleward expansion of the annual mean SSS-max in the North Atlantic. During the analysis period of 1979-2012, the northern side of the SSS-max displaced northward by 1.2 \u00b1 0.36\u00b0, whereas the equatorward side of the SSS-max showed little change. Yu et al. (2017) found that the expansion shifted and expanded the ventilation zone of the STUW northward and northwestward, leading to a 35% increase in the annual-mean production of the STUW. Their analysis was focused on the annual-mean perspectives of the SSS-max shift and its effects on the STUW. Seasonal characteristics of the connection between SSS-max and the STUW in the context of the poleward expansion have yet to be examined but are important for gaining a full understanding of the oceanic response to an expanding subtropics. Thus, this study aims to provide a detailed analysis of the seasonal characteristics of the change of the STUW associated with the poleward shift of the North Atlantic SSSmax. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces a description of the data sets and methods used in the analysis. Section 3 examines the seasonal characteristics of the decadal expansion of the SSS-max and the associated changes in the STUW volume and thickness. Section 4 presents mechanisms responsible for the decadal changes of the STUW seasonality. A summary and conclusions are included in section 5."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "The main data set used in this analysis is the monthly objectively analyzed subsurface temperature and salinity data sets produced by Ishii et al. (2006). The Ishii data sets are compiled from the Centennial in situ Observation-Based Estimates of the SST, the World Ocean Database 2009, the Global Temperature-Salinity Profile Program, and Argo profiling float observations. The time series covers the period from 1945 to 2012 with a horizontal resolution of 1\u00b0\u00d7 1\u00b0and 24 levels in the vertical. The 34-year period from 1979 to 2012 is used in the study. The spatiotemporal coverage of the Ishii product is inhomogeneous because the number of SSS observations is sparse prior to 2002. To verify the seasonal characteristics of the poleward shift identified from the Ishii product, we resorted to two additional products. The first supplemental product is the monthly, 1\u00b0\u00d7 1\u00b0b inned SSS maps produced by L'Institut de recherche pour le d\u00e9veloppement (IRD) of the Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et Oceanographie Spatiale (LEGOS), Toulouse, France (Reverdin et al., 2007; http://www.legos.obs-mip.fr/observations/sss/datadelivery/products). The LEGOS SSS product covers the Atlantic, 95\u00b0W-20\u00b0E, 30\u00b0S-50\u00b0N, and is compiled from the surface salinity measurements made along commercial ship lanes during the period from 1970 to 2016. The Ishii product blended salinity observations from various sources but did not include the surface data in the Atlantic collected by IRD/LEGOS (Ishii et al., 2006). Therefore, the LEGOS SSS product in the Atlantic Ocean can serve as an independent verification of the Ishii product. The second supplemental product is the version 4 of the Met Office Hadley Centre EN (hereafter EN4) series of data sets of global quality-controlled ocean temperature and salinity profiles and monthly objective analysis (Good et al., 2013). The EN4 data set is gridded on 1\u00b0boxes, with the vertical interval ranging from 5.02 to 5,350.3m nonuniformly. The topmost layer in EN4 is used for deriving variables at the sea surface. Unlike the Ishii product that provides no data sampling information, EN4 includes two sets of products. One is the 1\u00b0\u00d7 1\u00b0gridded temperature and salinity monthly objective analysis with uncertainty estimates, and the other is the quality-controlled temperature and salinity profiles. The EN4 and Ishii products used similar data sources to cover the similar temporal period. The two EN4 products, the gridded and the profiles, are used to assess the potential impact of salinity sample density on the findings identified from the Ishii data sets."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "The STUW criteria are adopted from O'Connor et al. (2005). The water mass in the North Atlantic is defined by a salinity range of 36.7-37.1, a temperature range of 20.4-22.4\u00b0C, and a potential density range of 25.6-26.3 kg/m 3 . The annual mean subduction rate is calculated following the approach used in Yu et al. (2017): where h denotes the mixed layer depth, which is determined by the depth at which the potential density is 0.125 kg/m 3 larger than that at the sea surface (Monterey & Levitus, 1997). T represents 1 year, and T 1 and T 2 represent the times when effective detrainment starts and ends, respectively. The vertical and horizontal velocities at the bottom of the mixed layer are denoted by w b and u b , respectively, with w b being computed as follows: 10.1029/2018JC014508 Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans where the first term on the right hand denotes the Ekman pumping and the second term is the \u03b2 term. The Objectively Analyzed Air-Sea Fluxes for the Global Oceans (OAFlux) winds (Yu & Jin, 2014) are used to compute the Ekman pumping. The velocity in the \u03b2 term and u b are computed from the Ishii's salinity and temperature data. To estimate the monthly contribution to the annual subduction rate, equation 1is transformed as follows: where i denotes the month. If the ith month is within the effective detrainment period, then S i is nonzero; otherwise, S i is zero."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Observed Decadal Expansion of the SSS-max and Its Seasonal Characteristics", "text": "The SSS-max is defined as the water mass enclosed by the surface 36.3 isohaline contour. Two proxies are used to identify the expansion of the SSS-max: the meridional shift in the isohalines between the 1980s and the 2000s and the decadal difference in salinity between these two decades. The decadal expansion of the SSS-max defined by the two proxies is shown for the four seasons ( Figure 1): winter (January-February-March), spring (April-May-June), summer (July-August-September), and fall (October-November-December). The meridional mean position of the climatological SSS-max is located at approximately 25\u00b0N. Consistent with the annual-mean pattern reported in Yu et al. (2017), the sea surface isohalines on the poleward side (between 25\u00b0N and 45\u00b0N) of the SSS-max show a larger poleward movement than those on the equatorward side (between 15\u00b0N and 25\u00b0N) of the SSS-max. On seasonal timescales, the poleward expansion of the SSS-max occurs in all seasons, with a maximum in spring. A linear trend analysis is performed on four selected surface isohalines on the poleward side of the SSS-max ( Figure 1). The selected isohalines start from the SSS-max center at the 37.1 isohaline and decrease poleward at intervals of 0.4 PSS-78. The poleward shift peaks in spring, during which the 37.1 isohaline shifts northward by 0.21 \u00b1 0.12\u00b0latitude per decade, the 36.7 isohaline by 0.3 \u00b1 0.14\u00b0latitude per decade, the 36.3 isohaline by 0.547 \u00b1 0.221\u00b0latitude per decade, and the 35.9 isohaline by 0.665 \u00b1 0.362\u00b0latitude per decade. The poleward shift in spring is associated with a 0.15 increase in salinity on the poleward side of the SSS-max, which is the strongest salinification among all four seasons. In addition to the meridional expansion toward the north, the surface isohalines also expand toward the west. This westward expansion is evidenced clearly on the northern boundary of the 36.7 isohaline in winter and spring, during which the isohalines expand westward by as much as 1.47-2.94\u00b0per decade (Figure 1a). In the other two seasons, the degree of westward expansion weakens slightly to approximately 0.29-0.88\u00b0l ongitude per decade. The westward expansion enlarges the spatial extent of the SSS-max and causes an increase in the surface salinity in the west. However, a salinity increase in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream has been reported as a result of the intensification of the West Boundary Current (WBC; Yang et al., 2016). Given that the distance between the isohalines is narrow within the WBC, the effect of the WBC intensification on the areas outside of the western boundary is expected to be small. The two proxies used to delineate the expansion of the SSS-max ( Figure 1) are also applied to the zonal mean section, obtained from the averaging the salinity fields in the upper 300 m between 80\u00b0W and 0\u00b0W ( Figure 2), to identify key decadal changes in the subsurface subtropical North Atlantic. A poleward shift in a manner similar to those at the surface is observed ( Figure 2). Specifically, there is a clear shift for the subsurface isohalines located on the poleward side of the SSS-max core but barely any changes for the isohalines on the equatorward side of the SSS-max core. Seasonal variations in the degree of the expansion are also observed in the subsurface. Consistent with the seasonal changes of the surface isohalines, the subsurface 36.7-35.9 isohalines have greater northward displacements in winter and spring than in summer and fall. In addition, the subsurface salinification occurs poleward of 25\u00b0N, with a peak in salinity anomalies of 0.1 to 0.12 in spring."}, {"section_title": "Potential Impact of Data Sample Density", "text": "To assess potential impacts of data sampling on our findings, we extend the analysis to the two supplemental data sets, the LEGOS and EN4 salinity products.

The results obtained from the two data sets (Figures 3a and 3b) agree with the finding derived from the Ishii data set; that is, the SSS has decreased on the equatorward side of the SSS-max and increased on the poleward side. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the Ishii-based results that the maximum poleward shift occurred in spring (Figures 3c and 3d), although the magnitude of the shift varies. The consistency across the three sets of salinity product indicates that the poleward expansion of the North Atlantic SSS-max and its maximum intensity in spring are robust decadal features. It is worth noting that the patterns of SSS decadal difference anomalies are different among the three gridded SSS products (Figures 1 and 3). Magnitudes of the midlatitude SSS difference anomalies are generally higher in Ishii and EN4 than those in LEGOS. The objective mapping of LEGOS SSS analysis uses a Laplacian interpolation scheme, which minimizes the error on the mapped product. As a result, the LEGOS SSS produces a weaker amplitude (Reverdin et al., 2007). In addition, the number of underlying profiles in the LEGOS SSS is far more than those of the Ishii or EN4 during the 1980s, which could cause the discrepancy in the results. The products also differ in the spatial distribution of SSS anomalies. One reason for these differences could be the techniques used in objective mapping. The Ishii product has used a variational minimization technique (Derber & Rosati, 1989), while the EN4 product has applied an objective analysis to bin qualitycontrolled profiles into gridded boxes by using the analysis correction scheme (Lorenc et al., 1991). Using the EN4 salinity profiles, the spatial distribution of salinity sample density in the area of the SSS-max has been constructed (Figures 4a and 4b). The general increase in data density from the 1980s to the 2000s is observed (Figures 4c-4e), which is due to the availability of the Argo observations since the early 2000s. To further examine whether and how the identified poleward shift of the SSS-max can be affected by the change in data sample density, we have reconstructed the SSS fields for the period of 1980-2010 by using only the salinity profiles from the EN4 database that are not associated with the Argo program. The following procedures have been applied: removing profiles that differ from the seasonal cycle by more than 3 times the seasonal standard deviations and binning the profiles into 2\u00b0\u00d7 2\u00b0boxes with a search radius of 2\u00b0. The resulting decadal-mean SSS in the 1980s and 2000s and the differences between the two decades are shown in Figures 5a, 5c, 5e, and 5g.

The solid contours denote the isohalines averaged between 1980 and 1989, and the dashed contours denote the isohalines averaged between 2000 and 2009. The contour interval is 0.4. The units for the decadal salinity differences are PSS-78.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans isohalines located on the poleward side of the SSS-max are also shown ( Figures 5b, 5d, 5f, and 5h). The patterns of the SSS decadal difference anomalies associated with the poleward expansion of the SSS-max are consistent with those based on the Ishii product ( Figure 1) except that the magnitude of the latitudinal shift of the isohalines is weaker and the salinity anomalies are also weaker. It appears that the data sample density does not affect the finding of the poleward expansion of the SSS-max but does affect the quantification of the magnitude of the shift in the isohalines.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans and 40\u00b0W. In fall, the positive thickness anomalies shrink further toward the western boundary to the north of 25\u00b0N. The total sum of the STUW thickness anomalies in fall is smaller than that in both winter and spring. The seasonal variations of the decadal changes in the STUW thickness appear to be consistent with the seasonal variations of the changes in the STUW volume ( Figure 6e). Decadal changes in the STUW volume within latitudes 20\u00b0N-30\u00b0N are quantified. We have also tested other domains but found that the results are not sensitive to slight changes in the spatial range. The annual-mean STUW volume increased by 0.21 \u00b1 0.02 10 14 m 3 per decade (32 \u00b1 1%). The magnitude of the increase is not equal among the four seasons. The STUW volume increased by 0.26 \u00b1 0.02 10 14 m 3 per decade (41 \u00b1 1%) in winter, 0.31 \u00b1 0.02 10 14 m 3 per decade (48 \u00b1 1%) in spring, 0.18 \u00b1 0.02 10 14 m 3 per decade (27 \u00b1 1%) in summer, and 0.086 \u00b1 0.007 10 14 m 3 per decade (13 \u00b1 9%) in fall. The maximum increase occurred in spring, which is consistent with the timing of the largest poleward shift at the surface. The decadal increase in the STUW volume in winter is slightly less than that in spring. In summer and fall, the volume increases are only half of those in winter and spring. It is worth noting that the positive STUW volume anomalies derived from the EN4 data set also show similar results (figures not shown here). Thus, the seasonal characteristics of the decadal increase in the STUW volume derived from the Ishii dataset are consistent among different data sets. \nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans Figure 5.

The climatological subduction rates in January and February are small, and the sum of their linear trends contributes to less than 15% of the decadal increase. As a result, this section focuses mainly on the decadal changes in the subduction area/rate in March and April.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans negative anomalies are located on the equatorward side of the subduction area between 50\u00b0W and 25\u00b0W. Thus, the subduction rate shows a dipole pattern across 28\u00b0N, which is consistent with the dipole pattern of the STUW thickening between the two decades ( Figure 6a). Furthermore, the subduction rate decreases over 100 m/year to the southeast, which is also consistent with a decrease in the STUW thickness at the same location. The STUW thickness anomalies could be advected downstream (Suga et al., 2000). Due to the Sverdrup relationship, the streamlines below the mixed layer point toward the equator (Blanke et al., 2002). As a result, the negative anomalies of the STUW thickness induced by a decrease in the subduction rate could spread toward the equator (Figure 6a). In April, the subduction rate mainly shows a northwestward expansion (Figure 8d). The magnitudes of the positive subduction rate anomalies exceed 100 m/year to the north of 25\u00b0N and to the west of 30\u00b0W. On the equatorward side of the subduction area, the subduction rate decreases, although its magnitude is less than 80 m/year. The subduction rate primarily increases in April, which can explain the STUW thickening observed in spring to the north of 28\u00b0N. The observed decrease in the subduction rate to the south of 28\u00b0N in April is much smaller than that in March, which is also consistent with the smaller magnitude of the decrease in the STUW thickness therein. During summer and fall, the STUW thickness anomalies are similar to those in the subduction seasons. After subduction, the STUW could persist for 5-10 years (Blanke et al., 2002;Inui et al., 2002;Qu et al., 2013;Zhang et al., 2003). Therefore, the decadal changes in the STUW thickness to the south of 25\u00b0N (or the positive anomalies to the north of 28\u00b0N and to the west of 60\u00b0W) could be advected from upstream areas during the previous seasons. In conclusion, the consistency between seasonal variations of the decadal increase in the STUW volume/thickness and monthly patterns of the subduction rate imply that the main driver underlying the seasonal pattern of decadal changes in the STUW is subduction. Figure 9. Anomalies of the normalized subduction rate (black dots) and annual-mean AMO (magenta dots) and NAO (gray dots) indexes in the North Atlantic. The three corresponding lines are the 3-year running means of their time series. The subduction rate is averaged from March to April. The linear trend (per 10 years) and the 90% confidence level for the two indexes are listed. The two indexes are subtracted from their climatological values and then divided by their standard deviations. One standard deviation for the AMO index is 0.18, and that for the NAO index is 0.39. Figure 10. Schematic diagram illustrating the increase in the STUW volume led by the expansion of the SSS-max.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans Finally, this study finds that the larger expansion of the SSS-max in early spring than in winter leads to a larger expansion in the subduction area in April than in March, and changes in the subduction area are equivalent to changes in the subduction rate. Therefore, the subduction rate shows a maximum increase in April. The decadal increases in the subduction rate may be related to the AMO instead of the NAO. However, the linkage between the decadal changes in the AMO indexes and subduction rate still need to be investigated. The lateral induction (the first two terms in equation 3) contributes to a 90-96% increase in the total subduction rate during March and April. In contrast, vertical pumping (the last term in equation 3) contributes only 4-7% to the subduction rate increase over the 1979-2012 period. Thus, lateral induction controls the subduction rate changes (figures not shown here). According to equation 3, changes in lateral induction are determined by variations in the mixed layer depth, which could be related to wind anomalies (Qu et al., 2016) or buoyancy flux anomalies. In further research, we will seek to identify the exact processes that cause the decadal increase in the subduction rate."}, {"section_title": "Observed Decadal Changes in the STUW Properties", "text": "The STUW is formed under the subtropical SSS-max by subduction. There are substantial changes in the North Atlantic STUW in the past decades when the SSS-max has expanded poleward. The patterns of the decadal changes in the STUW thickness are constructed for four seasons (Figures 6a-6d). Among the four seasons, the largest changes in STUW thickness occur in winter and spring, with the largest increase in STUW thickness located mainly to the north of 20-25\u00b0N. The STUW expands both northward and westward, as denoted by black dots in Figures 6a and 6b. The westward intrusion into the Sargasso Sea leads to increases in STUW thickness of at least 10 m. In winter, the decadal anomalies of the STUW thickness show two bands of anomalies with opposite signs between 20\u00b0N and 30\u00b0N. The thickness of the STUW increases by~20 m between 28\u00b0N and 30\u00b0N but decreases by 10-20 m between 20\u00b0N and 28\u00b0N. This pattern is a clear indication of the poleward shift in the isohalines (Figures 1 and 2). More positive STUW thickness anomalies are observed in spring than in winter. Positive STUW thickness anomalies exceed 20 m near the western boundary current and to the north of 25\u00b0N between 60\u00b0W and 10\u00b0W, whereas negative STUW thickness anomalies are confined to the south of 25\u00b0N. In general, the STUW thickness shows a stronger increase in spring than in winter. Greater increases in STUW thickness occur near the western boundary, and prominent decreases in STUW thickness occur near the eastern boundary. The reason for these phenomena is discussed in the next section. The magnitudes of decadal changes in the STUW thickness in summer and fall are less than those in the first two seasons.

The calculation of the subduction area is as follows: particles released from the bottom of the mixed layer within the SSS-max region are traced along the isopycnals for 1 year from the time it is subducted. If the water particle is submerged below the mixed layer after 1 year, the release point of the water particle is recorded as subduction area (Yu et al., 2017). The time series of subduction area (Figures 7a and 7b) are subtracted from their monthly means and then normalized by their standard deviations. The subduction areas during March and April show a significant upward trend, with rates of (7.57 \u00b1 4.81) 10 10 m 2 per decade and (9.24 \u00b1 3.92) 10 10 m 2 per decade, separately (Figures 7a and 7b).

The poleward side of the subduction area shifts toward the north (at a rate of 0.59 \u00b1 0.29\u00b0p er decade northward; magenta plus signs in Figure 7c) between 50\u00b0W and 20\u00b0W, whereas the equatorward side of the subduction area shows no changes between the 1980s and 2000s. The subduction area exhibits a much larger expansion in April than in March. During the 1980s, the subduction area mainly resides to the southeast of the subtropical gyre (the black plus signs in Figure 7d), whereas during the 2000s, the subduction area expands from 30\u00b0W to 70\u00b0W (the magenta plus signs in Figure 7d). The larger expansion of the subduction area in April is consistent with the larger expansion of the isohalines (Figure 1d) because the SSS-max confines the outcropping area of the STUW. The larger SSS-max expansion in early spring (April) results in a larger expansion in the subduction area."}, {"section_title": "Increase in the Subduction Rate", "text": "The time series of the subduction rate during March and April are subtracted from their monthly means and then normalized by their standard deviations (Figures 8a and 8b). The time series of the subduction area (Figures7a and 7b) and rate (Figures 8a and 8b) are nearly identical in March and April. The results confirm that the decadal changes in the subduction rate are controlled by the decadal changes in the subduction area, where the latter is associated with the decadal expansion of the SSS-max."}, {"section_title": "The Time Series", "text": "The subduction rate during March or April shows an upward trend (Figures 8a and 8b). The linear trend of the subduction rate in March is 1.24 \u00b1 0.50 Sv per decade, whereas the linear trend in April is 1.73 \u00b1 0.61 Sv per decade. Although the climatological subduction rate in March (7.8 Sv) over the analysis record is 50% larger than that in April (4.8 Sv), the long-term trend during March is 40% smaller than that during April. Thus, the decadal increases in the subduction rate strongly depend on processes in early spring over the period of 1979-2012. The subduction rate in April has been doubled during the analysis record and contributed an increase of over 50% to its annual-mean value. It is worth noting that lateral induction contributes a 90-96% increase in the total subduction rate during March and April. In contrast, vertical pumping contributes only 4-7% of the subduction rate increase over the 1979-2012 period. Thus, lateral induction controls subduction rate changes and its monthly component (figures not shown here). The monthly subduction rate (Figures 8a and 8b) anomalies are used here to explain the seasonal variations of the decadal increase in the STUW volume (Figure 6e). The subduction rate anomalies are positive in March and April. Therefore, the STUW volume also increases to the greatest extent during winter and 10.1029/2018JC014508 Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans spring. Moreover, the largest increases in the subduction rate during April are consistent with the largest increases in the STUW volume during spring. Since subduction does not occur during summer and fall, the STUW volume anomalies, which are preserved after stratification (Stommel, 1979), originate in winter and spring. Half of the anomalous STUW volume present during summer and fall is accumulated during winter and spring, whereas the other half might be advected away or dissipated (Blanke et al., 2002;Laurian et al., 2006;Qu et al., 2013). Laurian et al. (2006Laurian et al. ( , 2009) used an analytical model and an ocean general circulation model to describe the dissipation of surface anomalies after production, and they found that nearly 34% of the surface anomalies could be kept at the subsurface after 6 years, which supports the theory of anomaly preservation after formation.  2000-2009, and the solid (1980-1989) and broken (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009) black lines represent the spatial distributions of the isohalines (36.7 and 37.1)."}, {"section_title": "The Spatial Pattern", "text": "To fully understand the relationship between the seasonal variations of the STUW expansion and the monthly subduction increases, the spatial changes in the subduction rate (Figures 8c and 8d) and those in the STUW thickness (Figures 6a and 6b) are compared. The spatial patterns of the decadal changes in the STUW thickness in March and April are similar to those in winter and spring, respectively. Therefore, the subduction rates in March and April can be used to interpret the seasonal characteristics of the decadal changes in STUW thickness. The spatial pattern of decadal changes in the subduction rate in March shows a poleward shift (Figure 8c). Positive subduction rate anomalies occur on the northern and western sides of the subduction area, and  [1980][1981][1982][1983][1984][1985][1986][1987][1988][1989] and broken (2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009) black lines represent the spatial distributions of the isohalines (36.7 and 37.1).

Air-sea flux changes can be tracked using air-sea decadal or multidecadal oscillation indexes. Previous studies proposed that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO; Barnston & Livezey, 1987;Chen & van den Dool, 2003) could modulate the production rate of the STUW in the North Atlantic on an interannual timescale (O'Connor et al., 2005;Qu et al., 2016). The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO; Enfield et al., 2001;Schlesinger & Ramankutty, 1994) is reported to have played a role in the decadal changes in the STUW O 2 (Montes et al., 2016), which may be associated with decadal changes in the STUW production. Furthermore, the AMO is positively correlated with the decadal changes in the SSS within the North Atlantic subtropical gyre (Friedman et al., 2017). Thus, decadal changes in both indexes linked to the changes in the atmospheric forcings could indicate decadal changes in the STUW production. Here, we discuss how the subduction rate of the STUW changes in accordance with changes in the NAO or the AMO from 1979 to 2012. The NAO and AMO indexes are averaged annually, and the subduction rate is averaged from March to April. The subduction rate shows a consecutive increase from 1979 to 2000 ( Figure 9), and it has maintained a relatively high magnitude since 2000. The AMO (Figure 9) index shows an upward trend, which is similar to the subduction rate trend: an increase from 1979 to 1998 and a consistent relatively high magnitude after 1999. The NAO index (Figure 9) shows the opposite pattern, with a positive NAO occurring before 1995 and a negative NAO occurring after 1996. The linear trends and 90% confidence levels of the NAO/AMO indexes are listed in Figure 9. Both the subduction rate and the AMO index show significant positive linear trends from 1979 to 2012. However, the NAO index shows a significant negative linear trend. The AMO index is not consistent with the subduction rate on an interannual scale; however, at a lower frequency, that is, a decadal scale, the two are consistent. We calculate the correlations between the two indexes and the subduction rate separately. The AMO and the subduction rate are positively correlated, whereas the NAO index is nonsignificant and negatively correlated with the subduction rate. Recent studies have shown that the NAO might not regulate the decadal change in the subtropical gyre (Barrier et al., 2013), which could explain why the correlation between the subduction rate and the NAO index is not significant. In conclusion, the AMO index shows greater coherency with the subduction rate than with the NAO index. Figure 10 summarizes the main mechanism underlying the processes that associate the spatial changes in the SSS-max with the production of the STUW. The SSS-max displays poleward expansion, which leads to an increase in the subduction area and rate. The subduction rate increase then drives an increase in the STUW volume. The expansion of the SSS-max, which primarily occurs during spring, leads to an increase in the annual-mean subduction rate in early spring (April). Thus, this expansion leads to the largest increases in the STUW volumes and thicknesses occurring in spring among the four seasons. The SSS-max in the North Atlantic shows the largest expansion to the north in spring and by 0.43 \u00b1 0.21\u00b0p er decade over the study period. The poleward expansion of the zonal mean subsurface isohalines (or salinification) on the poleward side of the SSS-max also primarily occurs during spring. The subsurface salinification during the analysis record is linked to STUW expansion. The annual-mean STUW volume increased by 0.21 \u00b1 0.02 10 14 m 3 over the study period. Among the four seasons, the STUW volume shows the largest increase (0.31 \u00b1 0.02 10 14 m 3 per decade, 48 \u00b1 1%) in spring. Moreover, the STUW thickness on the poleward side of the SSS-max also shows the largest increases of 10-20 m in spring among all four seasons. The seasonal variations of the decadal STUW volume/thickness increase can be explained by subduction. The annual subduction rate increased by 0.29 \u00b1 0.07 Sv per decade. The decadal increase in the subduction rate varies between months. The greatest contribution to the decadal increase in the annual-mean subduction rate of 1.73 \u00b1 0.61 Sv per decade occurs in April, which leads to a maximum subducted volume in spring. Furthermore, the spatial pattern of STUW thickening during spring is consistent with the increased subduction rate in April. Thus, the monthly subduction rate can explain the seasonal variations of the decadal STUW expansion."}]
