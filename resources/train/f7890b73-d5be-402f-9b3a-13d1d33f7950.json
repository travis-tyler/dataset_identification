[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "A novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, was identified as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (Gorbalenya et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Travel-associated cases of coronavirus disease 2019 were reported outside of China as early as January 13, 2020, and the virus has subsequently spread to nearly all nations (World Health Organization, 2020a ). The first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States was a travel-associated case from Washington state on January 19, 2020 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a) . The majority of early COVID-19 cases in the United States were (1) associated with travel to a ''high-risk'' country or (2) close contacts of previously identified cases according to the testing criteria adopted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b) . In response to the risk of more travel-associated cases, the United States placed travel restrictions on multiple regions with SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including China on January 31, Iran on February 29, and Europe on March 11 (Taylor, 2020) . However, community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the United States in late February, when a California resident contracted the virus despite meeting neither testing criterium (Moon et al., 2020) .\nFrom March 1-19, 2020, the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the United States rapidly increased from 74 to 13,677, and the virus was detected in all 50 states (Dong et al., 2020) . It was recently estimated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States is likely in the tens of thousands (Perkins et al., 2020) , suggesting substantial undetected infections and spread within the country. We hypothesized that, with the growing number of COVID-19 cases in the United States and the large volume of domestic travel, new United States outbreaks are now more likely to result from interstate rather than international spread.\nBecause of its proximity to several high-volume airports, southern Connecticut is a suitable location in which to test this hypothesis. By sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from local cases and comparing their relatedness to virus genome sequences from other locations, we used ''genomic epidemiology'' (Grubaugh et al., 2019a) to identify the likely sources of SARS-CoV-2 in Connecticut. We supplemented our viral genomic analysis with airline travel data from major airports in southern New England to estimate the risk of domestic and international importation therein. Our data suggest that the risk of domestic importation of SARS-CoV-2 into this region now far outweighs that of international introductions regardless of federal travel restrictions and provide evidence for coast-to-coast SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States."}, {"section_title": "Phylogenetic Clustering of Connecticut SARS-CoV-2 Genomes Demonstrates Interstate Spread", "text": "To delineate the roles of domestic and international virus spread in the emergence of new United States COVID-19 outbreaks, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses collected from cases identified in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that the outbreak in Connecticut was caused by multiple virus introductions and that most of these viruses were related to those sequenced from other states rather than international locations ( Figure 1 ).\nWe sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from nine of the first COVID-19 cases reported in Connecticut, with sample collection dating from March 6-14, 2020 (Data S1). These individuals are residents of eight different cities in Connecticut. According to the Connecticut State Department of Public Health, none of the cases were associated with international travel. Using our amplicon sequencing approach, ''PrimalSeq'' (Grubaugh et al., 2019b; Quick et al., 2017) , with the portable Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION platform, we generated the first SARS-CoV-2 genome approximately 14 h after receiving the sample (CT-Yale-006), demonstrating our ability to perform near-real-time clinical sequencing and bioinformatics. Our complete workflow included RNA extraction, PCR testing, validation of PCR results, library preparation, sequencing, and live base calling and read mapping. We shared the genomes of these viruses publicly as we generated them (GISAID EPI_ISL_416416-416424). We combined our genomes with other publicly available sequences for a final dataset of 168 SARS-CoV-2 genomes ( Figure 1 ; Data S2). The dataset can be visualized on our ''community'' Nextstrain page (https://nextstrain.org/community/ grubaughlab/CT-SARS-CoV-2/paper1).\nWe built phylogenetic trees using a maximum likelihood reconstruction approach, and we used shared nucleotide substitutions to assess clade support ( Figure 1 ; Data S3). Our first nine SARS-CoV-2 genomes clustered into three distinct phylogenetic clades, indicating multiple independent virus introductions into Connecticut. Our SARS-CoV-2 genome CT-Yale-001 clusters closely with other viruses sequenced from Asia (China), whereas the close genetic relatedness of genomes from Europe and Washington state in the clade that contains CT-Yale-006 makes it difficult to track the origins of this virus ( Figure 1A ). Regardless, neither the CT-Yale-001 nor the CT-Yale-006 COVID-19 cases were travel-associated, which indicates that these patients were part of domestic transmission chains that stemmed from undetected introductions. The other seven SARS-CoV-2 genomes clustered with a large, primarily United States clade, within which the majority of genomes were sequenced from cases in Washington state ( Figure 1B ). Because of a paucity of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from other regions within the United States, we could not determine the exact domestic origin of these viruses in Connecticut. We also cannot yet determine whether the higher number of substitutions observed in CT-Yale-007 and CT-Yale-008 ( Figure 1B ) compared with the other Connecticut virus genomes within this clade was the result of multiple introductions or of significant undersampling. However, given that seven of our nine Connecticut SARS-CoV-2 genomes fell within this clade versus the many other international clades, these were most likely the result of a common domestic source(s) rather than repeated international introductions. Importantly, our data indicate that, by early to mid-March, there had already been interstate spread during the early COVID-19 epidemic in the United States."}, {"section_title": "Travel and Epidemiological Patterns Reveal Significant Domestic Importation Risk", "text": "Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the COVID-19 outbreak in Connecticut was driven, in part, by domestic virus introductions. To compare the roles of interstate and international SARS-CoV-2 spread in the United States, we used airline travel data and the epidemiological dynamics in regions where travel routes originated to evaluate importation risk. We found that, because of the large volume of daily domestic air passengers, the dominant ll A B Figure 1 . The COVID-19 Outbreak in Connecticut Is Phylogenetically Linked to SARS-CoV-2 from Washington (A) We constructed a maximum-likelihood tree using 168 global SARS-CoV-2 protein coding sequences, including 9 sequences from COVID-19 patients identified in Connecticut from March 6-14, 2020. The total number of nucleotide differences from the root of the tree quantifies evolution since the putative SARS-CoV-2 ancestor. We included clade-defining nucleotide substitutions to directly show the evidence supporting phylogenetic clustering. The number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes used in this phylogenetic tree from each location is shown in parentheses. (B) We enlarged the United States clade consisting primarily of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Washington state and Connecticut. The map shows the location and number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes that cluster within this clade.

The genomic data can be visualized and interacted with at https://nextstrain.org/community/grubaughlab/CT-SARS-CoV-2/paper1. importation risk into the Connecticut region switched from international to domestic by early to mid-March ( Figure 2 ).\nWe first estimated daily passenger volumes arriving in the region from the five countries (China, Italy, Iran, Spain, and Germany) and out-of-region states (Washington, California, Florida, Illinois, and Louisiana) that have reported the most COVID-19 cases to date (Figures 2A-2D ). By March 18, the five countries comprised 78% of reported non-United States cases, whereas the five states comprised 48% of reported domestic cases outside of Connecticut and New York. To this end, we collected passenger volumes arriving in three major airports in southern New England: Bradley International Airport (BDL; Hartford, Connecticut), General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport (BOS; Boston, Massachusetts), and John F. Kennedy (B) We selected three international airports in the region that are commonly used by Connecticut residents: Hartford (BDL), Boston (BOS), and New York (JFK). We used data from January to March 2019 to estimate relative differences in daily air passenger volumes from the selected origins to the airport destinations. These daily estimates were then combined by either international or domestic travel. (C and D) The cumulative number of daily COVID-19 cases were divided by 100,000 population to calculate normalized disease prevalence for each international location (China, Italy, Iran, Spain, and Germany) (C). The cumulative number of daily COVID-19 cases were divided by 100,000 population to calculate normalized disease prevalence for each international location (Washington, California, Florida, Illinois, and Louisiana) (D). (E) We calculated importation risk by modeling the number of daily prevalent COVID-19 cases in each potential importation source and then estimating the number of infected travelers using the daily air travel volume from each location. The data, criteria, and analyses used to create this figure can be found in Data S3. ll International Airport (JFK; New York, New York; Figure 2B ). Because travel data for 2020 are not yet available, we calculated the total passenger volume from each origin and destination pair between January and March 2019, and estimated the number of daily passengers. We found that the daily domestic passenger volumes were $100 times greater than international in Hartford, $10 times greater in Boston, and $4 times greater in New York in our dataset ( Figure 2B ).\nBy combining daily passenger volumes ( Figure 2B ) with COVID-19 prevalence at the travel route origin (Figures 2C and 2D) and accounting for differences in reporting rates, we found that the domestic and international SARS-CoV-2 importation risk started to increase dramatically at the beginning of March 2020 ( Figure 2E ). Without accounting for the effects of international travel restrictions, our estimated domestic importation risk from the selected five states surpassed the international importation risk by March 10. Using previous assumptions around travel restrictions (Chinazzi et al., 2020) , we also modeled two scenarios where federal travel restrictions reduced passenger volume by 40% and by 90% from the restricted countries ( Figure 2E ). Because of the overall low prevalence of COVID-19 in China, we did not find any significant effects of travel restrictions from China that were enacted on February 1 (Data S3). Also, we did not find significant changes to the importation risk following travel restrictions from Iran on March 1, likely because of the relatively small number of passengers arriving from that country (Data S3). Although we did find a dramatic decrease in international importation risk following the restrictions on travel from Europe (March 13), this decrease occurred after our estimates of domestic travel importation risk had already surpassed that of international importation ( Figure 2E ). The dramatic rises in domestic and international importation risk preceded the state-wide COVID-19 outbreak in Connecticut ( Figure 2E ), and the recent increase in risk of domestic importation may give rise to new outbreaks in the region."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The combined results of our genomic epidemiology and travel pattern analyses suggest that domestic spread recently became a significant source of new SARS-CoV-2 infections in the United States. We find strong evidence that outbreaks on the East Coast (Connecticut) are linked to outbreaks on the West Coast (Washington), demonstrating that trans-continental spread has already occurred. As of March 25, there are more than 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced from around the world, including more than 350 from the United States (https:// nextstrain.org/ncov); however, most of the latter were obtained from a small number of states. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact origins of the viral introductions into Connecticut. Recent domestic travel history of the nine reported cases was not available, but it is unlikely that all of the infections originated in Washington state. Furthermore, because of low genetic diversity between these early sequences from Connecticut and Washington, we cannot yet quantify the rate at which the virus may be spreading between the United States coasts or whether an introduction from a common source is responsible for phylo-genetic grouping. There are likely other large, multi-state phylogenetic SARS-CoV-2 clades that exist in the United States. As testing capacity increases and more viral genome sequences become available from new locations, more granular reconstructions of virus spread throughout the United States will be possible (Grubaugh et al., 2019a) . Specifically, elucidating the phylogenetic relationship of viral genomes collected in Connecticut to those collected in neighboring states, especially states with a high burden of disease, like New York, will improve our understanding of critical interstate dynamics.\nOur estimates of domestic importation risk are likely conservative despite some important limitations of our air travel analysis. Because we do not have access to current airline data, we could not exactly quantify the effect of government restrictions on international travel. In addition, even without explicit government restrictions, general social distancing and work-fromhome guidelines are reducing all airline travel. By using airline data available from 2019, we did not account for these decreases in our international or domestic travel patterns. Although such variations may lower our domestic risk estimates, we also did not account for the large volumes of regional automobile and rail travel, especially along the corridor that connects Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington D.C. to Connecticut. We do not believe that Connecticut is more closely connected to its neighbors than states in other regions of the country. Therefore, our risk estimates indicate that this interconnectedness will perpetuate the domestic spread of SARS-CoV-2 and that domestic spread will likely become the primary source of new infections in the United States.\nWe argue that, although simplistic, our model demonstrates the urgent need to focus control efforts in the United States on preventing further domestic virus spread. As this epidemic progresses, domestic introductions of the virus could undermine control efforts in areas that have successfully mitigated local transmission. In China, local outbreak dynamics were highly correlated with travel between Wuhan and the outbreak dynamics therein during the early months of the epidemic . Similarly, if interstate introductions are not curtailed in the United States with improved surveillance measures, more robust diagnostic capabilities, and proper clinical care, quelling local transmission within states will be a Sisyphean task. We therefore propose that a unified effort to detect and prevent new COVID-19 cases will be essential for mitigating the risk of future domestic outbreaks. This effort must ensure that states have sufficient personal protective equipment, sample collection materials, and testing reagents because these supplies enable effective surveillance. Finally, state-and local-level policymakers must recognize that the health and well-being of their constituents are contingent on that of the nation. If spread between states is now occurring, as our results indicate, then the United States will struggle to control COVID-19 in the absence of a unified surveillance strategy."}, {"section_title": "STAR+METHODS", "text": "Detailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following: "}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "The authors of this study would like to acknowledge S.

Samples were processed by CT value to reduce the likelihood of contamination from high titer samples to low titer samples. Barcoding, adaptor ligation, and sequencing was performed on samples with CT values between 25-35 (low titer group) prior to samples with CT values below 25 (high titer group) (Data S1). Two samples, Yale-006 and Yale-007, were diluted 1:100 in nuclease-free water prior to cDNA synthesis.

See Data S2 for a list of sequences and acknowledgments to the originating and submitting labs. No data that was only released on GISAID was used without consent from the authors (see Acknowledgments). We aligned consensus genomes using the augur toolkit version 6.4.2 (Hadfield et al., 2018) . Specifically, we aligned sequences using mafft (Katoh et al., 2002) , masked sites at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the alignment as well as a small number of sites that likely vary due to assembly artifacts (see https://github.com/nextstrain/ncov), and reconstructed a phylogeny using IQ-Tree (Nguyen et al., 2015) . These trees are further processed using augur and treetime to add ancestral reconstructions . The tree is rooted on the ancestor of the two genomes ''Wuhan-Hu-1/2019'' and ''Wuhan/WH01/2019.'' Sequences in this sample differ from the root by 10 or fewer nucleotide substitutions. Bootstrap values are not a meaningful measure of branch support in this case. Here, many of the branches are supported by one substitution, which would correspond to a bootstrap support of 0.63. For a branch supported by two substitutions the bootstrap support value would correspondingly be 0.86. Given this approximate one-to-one mapping between bootstrap values and the number of substitutions, we directly show mutations supporting the major splits in the tree as it is more informative. The substitutions defining these clades are compatible with the tree topology and are not homoplastic. The probability that all clade defining substitutions arose multiple times independently in a manner compatible with the tree topology is vanishingly small. For example, with a rate of 2 nucleotide substitutions per month in a genome of length approximately 29'000 bases, the probability of this happening for any pair of six sister clades within a 2 month time frame is < 0.01.

To account for passenger reductions following U.S. government alerts and restrictions (Taylor, 2020) , we modeled two scenarios: a 40% reduction in passenger volume and a 90% reduction in passenger volume.

We assumed that countries or states with similar testing criteria policies captured similar proportions of true infections. Using the respective testing criteria, we categorized countries or states as having narrow, moderate, or broad testing levels. We then assigned reporting rates to each testing level by using the mean and 95% confidence interval of the reporting rate estimated by Nishiura et al. (2020) : 0.092 (95% CI = 0.05-0.20). The reporting rate for the broadest testing level, r = 0.20, also corresponded to the reporting rate in Mainland China (Chinazzi et al., 2020) . We thus assigned Iran, Florida, Washington, and Illinois to a ''narrow'' testing level (r = 0.05); Spain, Italy, and Louisiana to a ''moderate'' testing level (r=0.092); and China, Germany, and California to a ''broad'' testing level (r = 0.20; Data S2, ''testing-criteria'').\nTo estimate the number of prevalent infectious individuals on day t (P t ), we multiplied the number of incident infections up to day t by the probability that an individual who became infectious on day i was still infectious on day t:\nWhere g(t-i) is the cumulative distribution function of the infectious period.
