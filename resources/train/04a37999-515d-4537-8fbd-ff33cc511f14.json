[{"section_title": "Why this study?", "text": "Child development research on the importance of early experiences for later life outcomes has underscored the need for effective early childhood education (Heckman, 2008;Rouse, Brooks-Gunn, & McLanahan, 2005). With the aim of providing high-quality education, many kindergarten programs use assessments at the time of entry to understand what students know and can do. When such assessments are well-planned, appropriately designed, and implemented with fidelity, they can inform teaching and program improve ment, and contribute to better student outcomes (Snow & Van Hemel, 2008). As the number of states that require districts to administer kindergarten entry assessments grows (Stedron & Berger, 2010), state and district administrators are interested in how their peers around the country use these assessments (Center on Enhancing Early Learning Outcomes, 2014; Early Childhood Education Research Alliance, 2012). Given this interest, state administrators participating in the Regional Educational Laboratory Northeast & Islands Early Childhood Education Research Alliance requested this study for information as they imple mented plans for statewide assessments. Best practice guidelines for early childhood education assert the value of using data to guide instruction al practice in general (Bredekamp & Copple, 2009;Hamilton et al., 2009), yet there is limited empiri cal research linking the use of kindergarten entry assessment data with student learning outcomes. This study seeks to contribute to the limited literature on the relationship between use of kindergarten entry assessments and student early learning outcomes. Because the study draws on observational data, it cannot establish a causal link between use of kindergarten entry assessments and student outcomes. Instead, the analyses are intended to identify relationships that might be explored further with other datasets using a more rigorous experimental design. In addition, the study aims to provide important information to decisionmakers in the field about the landscape of the use of kindergarten entry assessments, based on a nationally representative sample of U.S. public schools."}, {"section_title": "What the study found", "text": "For the first and second research questions, descriptive analyses illustrated the characteristics of public schools that reported using kindergarten entry assessments, overall and for specific purposes. For the third research question, regression analyses examined the relationships between use of kindergarten entry assess ments and student early learning assessment scores in reading and math. Seventy-three percent of public schools reported using kindergarten entry assessments The finding that 73 percent of schools in the study sample use kindergarten entry assessments corroborates the widespread implementation of kindergarten entry assessment policies reported in state administrator surveys (Shepard, Taylor, & Kagan, 1996;Stedron & Berger, 2010). However, by 2010/11, the proportion of public schools using kindergarten entry assessments had not increased much from the 69 percent reported in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (Prakash, West, & Denton, 2003). Use of kindergarten entry assessments was not correlated with school characteristics Schools using kindergarten entry assessments had characteristics similar to those of schools that did not. No statistically significant differences in overall use of the assessments were found based on urban or rural location, percentage of students eligible for the federal school lunch program, school enrollment size, the cutoff age for kindergarten, the percentage of students who are racial/ethnic minority students, and whether the school offered full-day kindergarten."}, {"section_title": "Box 1. Research questions and sample", "text": "Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11 (National Center for Education Statistics, 2011a), this study addressed three research questions: \u2022 What percentage of public schools offering kindergarten classes administer a kindergarten entry assess ment to children, and how does the percentage vary by school characteristics? \u2022 How are kindergarten entry assessments used in education decisionmaking at public schools, and how does the practice vary by school characteristics? \u2022 Is the use of kindergarten entry assessments-overall and for specific purposes-correlated with student assessment scores in early reading and math in spring of the kindergarten year? The study used data collected from 640 public schools (including public charter schools) nationwide that reported on their use of kindergarten entry assessments, and 9,370 kindergarten students attending those schools. School administrators were asked whether their schools used kindergarten entry assessments for any of six specific purposes (National Center for Education Statistics, 2011b): \u2022 \"To determine eligibility for enrollment when a child is below the cutoff age for kindergarten.\" \u2022 \"To determine children's class placements.\" \u2022 \"To identify children who may need additional testing (for example, for a learning problem).\" \u2022 \"To help teachers individualize instruction.\" \u2022 \"To support a recommendation that a child delay entry for an additional year.\" \u2022 \"Other uses.\" Because the survey instrument did not define these terms, administrators may have interpreted them in dif ferent ways. The dataset does not provide further information about the types of kindergarten entry assessment instruments, implementation methods, how results were applied, or elaboration on what \"other\" uses includ ed. The survey did not ask about other forms of assessment that a school might use with kindergarten stu dents, such as ongoing progress monitoring. Also, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11, data analyzed here were collected before the Common Core State Standards that cover kindergarten were adopted and before many states developed assessment systems with funding from Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge grants starting in 2011. In addition to descriptive statistics, regression analyses were used to analyze the relationship between kin dergarten entry assessment use and scores on early learning assessments in reading and math administered to all students as part of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11, after the analysis controlled for student and school characteristics. Individualizing instruction was the most commonly reported purpose among public schools that used kindergarten entry assessments (93 percent), and 80 percent used the assessments for multiple purposes Almost all public schools that administered kindergarten entry assessments reported using them to indi vidualize instruction (93 percent). Identifying students who needed additional testing was the second most commonly selected purpose (65 percent). Users of kindergarten entry assessments also said that they used them for one or more purposes related to enrollment: to determine class placement (41 percent), to advise parents about delayed entry (24 percent), and to determine eligibility for students whose age fell below the cutoff (16 percent; figure 1). Most public schools used kindergarten entry assessments for multiple purposes (figure 2). Eighty percent of schools using the assessments reported more than one purpose: 61 percent said that they used assessments for two or three purposes, and 19 percent said that they used assessments for four to six purposes. Users of kindergarten entry assessments combined the most common purpose-individualizing instruction-with Percent Note: n = 470.

None of the reported purposes of kindergarten entry assessments was correlated with student early learning assessment scores in reading or math in spring of the kindergarten year After the analysis controlled for student characteristics such as race/ethnicity and family socioeconomic status and school characteristics such as enrollment size and urban or rural location, use of kindergarten entry assessments overall was not correlated with students' spring early learning scores in either reading or math on an assessment administered as part of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11. Furthermore, none of the six specific purposes of the entry assessments was correlated with these student outcomes. The absence of a relationship between use of kindergarten entry assessments -overall and for specific purposes-and student outcomes was found across students and public schools with different characteristics. Schools reporting no use of kindergarten entry assessments may nevertheless use other forms of assessment during the kindergarten year; information about student assessments admin istered later in the school year was not collected."}, {"section_title": "Implications of the study findings", "text": "The findings from this study indicate that nearly three-quarters of public schools use kindergarten entry assessments. The study gives administrators a high-level view of how their peers across the country report using the assessments. However, several questions remain for further research regarding the validity and quality of kindergarten entry assessments and the contexts in which the assessments are used. Individualizing instruction remains the most frequently cited purpose of kindergarten entry assessments This study confirms individualizing instruction as the most commonly stated purpose of kindergarten entry assessment, as previously reported by states and schools (Prakash et al., 2003;Stedron & Berger, 2010). Although actual practices within schools may vary, at a minimum these findings signal to early childhood education administrators that most schools are pursuing the goal of assessment-informed instruction at the start of the kindergarten year. A future study could examine the guidance and training that schools give teachers for using kindergarten entry assessment results, how teaching practices change in response to assessment data, and how these practices relate to student outcomes. Schools may need guidance on appropriate uses of kindergarten entry assessments that do not result in denying entry to eligible children Delaying kindergarten entry for eligible children has been linked to negative effects for their learning (Bassok & Reardon, 2013), and the Race to the Top-Early Learning Challenge grant application cautions against using kindergarten entry assessments to prevent children's entry into kindergarten (U.S. Depart ment of Education, 2011). This study found that 24 percent of schools reported using kindergarten entry assessments to support a recommendation that a child delay entry for an additional year. Although the specific practices at these schools are unknown, when states and districts develop policies for using kinder garten entry assessments, they may consider educating schools about appropriate uses of assessment results during the enrollment process. Schools may need guidance on selecting and using appropriate instruments for different purposes as part of the kindergarten entry assessment process Among public schools that used kindergarten entry assessments, the majority (80 percent) indicated that they did so for two or more purposes. Because school administrators who were surveyed as part of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11, were limited to selecting among six purposes with no explicit definitions or additional detail for each purpose, it is not possible to ascertain how schools in the study actually used kindergarten entry assessments in their classrooms. Given that most schools are attempting to meet multiple objectives through their use of kindergarten entry assessments, dis trict and state administrators may consider providing guidelines and training to ensure the appropriate use of assessment instruments. Future research drawing on more specific teacher and school data could investi gate which assessment instruments schools use, which domains they assess, and what policies differentiate the use of separate instruments for distinct purposes. Future research could examine variation in the fidelity and quality of kindergarten entry assessment implementation In theory the impact of kindergarten entry assessments on student achievement depends on several com ponents working together successfully. The assessment must provide valid, reliable information about the student's strengths and weaknesses; it must be administered correctly; teachers must interpret the results accurately; teachers must continue to monitor student progress throughout the year to track the rapid, often nonlinear development typical of young children; and teachers must respond to the results of entry and subsequent assessments with appropriate, effective instruction and interventions. Given that imple mentation data are not included in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-11, future studies could gather information about the fidelity and quality of kindergarten entry assessment administration, interpretation, and use of data. Further information about the presence or absence of a comprehensive assessment system in each state would provide important context for results According to best practice guidelines in the field, kindergarten entry assessments work best as part of a comprehensive system that includes clearly articulated standards, measures of specific content areas within those standards, practices that respond to assessment findings, and monitoring of progress on achieving the standards (Center on Enhancing Early Learning Outcomes, 2014; Snow & Van Hemel, 2008). Further analysis could use more recent data, collected since the Common Core State Standards and new assess ments were implemented, to examine the extent to which schools align kindergarten entry assessments with state learning standards and to what degree a more comprehensive system of articulated standards, assessments, and practices facilitates effective use of these assessments. Because many states have poli cies dictating the instrumentation and purposes of kindergarten entry assessments, research drawing on a sample that is representative at the state level (unlike the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergar ten Class of 2010-11) could inform these questions.
