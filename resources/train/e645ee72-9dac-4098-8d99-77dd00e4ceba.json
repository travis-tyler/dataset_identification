[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Aim To investigate the possible relation between serum vitamin D levels and arterial structural and functional properties in older men and women. Findings Serum vitamin D levels are associated with carotid IMT and carotid stiffness. No assciation was found with brachial artery measurements. Message The associations between serum vitamin D levels and arterial parameters seems to be driven by the type of artery; only elastic arteries show this association.\nBackground and aims This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and carotid and brachial artery distensibility in patients older than 55 years, referred to the outpatient clinic of the department of internal medicine and geriatric medicine of the Erasmus Medical Center, in Rotterdam. Methods and results From April to July 2006 we consecutively enrolled 49 elder patients (21 men and 28 women, mean age 78 \u00b1 8 years) without a cardiovascular event within 6 weeks before the visit. Carotid and brachial artery distensibility coefficients and serum 25(OH)D levels (mean 50 \u00b1 28.8 nmol/L) were assessed. Multivariate analysis (with linear regression model) was performed to investigate the relation between these parameters: carotid artery distensibility coefficient was associated with serum 25(OH)D levels (\u03b2 = 0.112; 95% CI 0.053 0.172; p = 0.001). Moreover, a negative association was also observed between carotid artery distensibility coefficient and mean arterial pressure (\u03b2 = \u22120.279; 95% CI, \u22120.339 \u22120.159; p = 0.0001). On the contrary, brachial artery distensibility has shown no association with 25(OH)D levels, being negatively linked to LDL-cholesterol levels and heart rate. An association was also observed between serum 25(OH)D level and carotid artery intima-media thickness. Conclusion Our results revealed that serum 25(OH)D levels of older men and women were associated with both structural and functional properties of the carotid artery. No association was found with the brachial artery distensibility."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Vitamin D, a seco-steroid hormone, is mostly known to control skeletal patho/physiology, regulating calcium and phosphorus and bone remodelling. It is obtained through cutaneous synthesis resulting from sun exposure and through oral intake. It is metabolized first to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH-D), then to the hormonal form 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH) 2 D). Analogs of 1,25(OH) 2 D are being developed to target specific diseases with minimal side effects [1] .\n25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) is considered to be the best indicator of vitamin D status in those with normal kidney function and reflects the level of circulating substrate. According to international literature, normal values of vitamin D is in a range from 30 to 40 ng/mL (75-100 nmol/L).\nMore recently, vitamin D deficiency has been considered as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and overall mortality in the general population.\nAlthough the relationship between the traditional role of vitamin D in bone and calcium metabolism has been extensively studied, the mechanisms by which vitamin D deficiency confers vascular risk remain uncertain.\nRecent publications, but only a small number of studies, suggest that vitamin D deficiency is also associated with and increased risk of aortic stiffness [2] . Previously, we found that central and peripheral arteries can be affected differently in regards to structural and functional properties [3] . In addition, if vascular stiffening (i.e., a decrease in vascular distensibility) is associated with vitamin D status and if there is a difference between various vascular regions is still unclear.\nThe aim of the present study is to evaluate whether mean serum vitamin D levels are associated with structural and functional arterial properties in a cohort of older persons."}, {"section_title": "Individuals and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "From April to July 2006 we consecutively enrolled 49 patients (21 men and 28 women, mean age 78 \u00b1 8 years), referred to the outpatient clinic of the Department of Internal Medicine and Geriatric Medicine, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam.\nPatients aged 55 years and older were included and those with any cardiovascular event within 6 weeks before the visit were excluded from the study.\nAll individuals gave their informed consent before the study began.

No association of vitamin D status with brachial distensibility was observed. The results from this cross-sectional study suggest that serum vitamin D levels could affect vascular structural and functional properties and that various vascular territories could be affected differently.\nThere is accumulating evidence that vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Large population based studies have previously shown an association between poor vitamin D status and an increased risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular related mortality, and have also suggested that vitamin D could be important in the prevention of vascular calcification [5] ; a meta-analysis of 12 prospective studies underlined an increased 33% change for CHD in patients with the lowest quartile of vitamin D levels [6] .\nArterial stiffness increases with age and is a predictor of morbidity and mortality [7] . Well established risk factors for arterial stiffening are hypertension, diabetes mellitus, inflammation [8] , dyslipidemia [9] .\nHowever, a role for vitamin D in the process of arterial stiffening has also been suggested [10] ; its deficiency has been associated with activation of the proinflammatory mechanism, promoting atherogenesis [11] .\nSeveral studies reported on the association between serum 25(OH)D levels and arterial stiffness. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, a prospective study of normative aging, vitamin D status was inversely associated with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) in a cohort of 1228 healthy volunteers with a mean age of 70 years [12] . ) reported an association between vitamin D status and aortic pulse wave velocity [13] . The exact role of vitamin D in cardiovascular health and specifically the role in arterial stiffening is thought to be multifactorial. Both animal and human studies have shown that vitamin D metabolites are a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) [14] . The RAAS is involved in maintenance of blood pressure, electrolyte homeostasis and control of intravascular volume. Large prospective studies have shown an association between low vitamin D levels and increased activity of RAAS which may result in hypertension and increased water intake and sodium absorption [14] . Furthermore, vitamin D metabolites are thought to directly alter myocyte contractility and proliferation [15] . Effects of vitamin D have also been reported on endothelial function, regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and on insulin and glucose handling [16] . It has previously been reported that vascular stiffening can differ between various vascular regions. In a study by Ruitenbeek et al. [17] age and blood pressure influenced functional properties of the elastic central arteries but not the muscular peripheral arteries. Based on the results of the present study, it can also be hypothesized that central and peripheral arteries are affected differently by vitamin D deficiency in regard to their functional and structural properties as associations are observed with carotid distensibility and IMT, while no association is observed with brachial distensibility.\nThe present study has some limitations. First, given the relatively small number of participants generalizability is limited. Second, the cross-sectional design limits conclusions on the causal relationship between vascular characteristics and vitamin D levels. Third, no information was available on the use of lipid lowers medication.\nIn conclusion, in a group of older men and women from the outpatient clinic, mean serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with both structural and functional properties of the carotid artery. We found no association between mean serum 25(OH)D levels and brachial artery distensibility."}, {"section_title": "Compliance with ethical standards", "text": "Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\nEthical approval All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.
