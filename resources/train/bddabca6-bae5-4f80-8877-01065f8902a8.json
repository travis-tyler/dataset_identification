The recent fast-growing development of technology, information and telecommunication ruled by mathematics development. Furthermore, mathematic plays a vital role in various science disciplines and advancing the human thought power. Therefore, all students should get chances and necessary supports to learn the essential mathematics through deepening and understanding (NCTM, 2000, p.5) .\nAttachment III of Ministerial Regulation No. 58/2014 mentions that mathematic should be provided to all students to equip them with logical, analytical, systematic, critical, innovative and creative thinking abilities, including cooperation ability. Such competences needed to enable students to master the ability of obtaining, managing and utilising information for a better life in the constantly changes, uncertainties, and highly-competitiveness situations. During the mathematic learning implementation, it is expected that the students are able to sense its advantage (Kemdikbud, 2014a) . Mathematical competence or ability is a part of life competence that should be owned by student particularly in reasoning, communication and daily problem solving development. Individual needs to master mathematic in certain levels. Such an individual mastery is not a mathematical competency as a science, but as a matter of mathematical literacy needed to understand the universe as well as to be succeed in his or her life and endeavour.\nConsidering such importance, therefore, mathematical competence and understanding is every student's need, including those with special needs student. The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) in the Prin-ciple and Standards for School Mathematics highlighted the importance of equal opportunity and support to be provided to all students, including to those students with special needs in achieving the substantial understanding from the importance of mathematic. NCTM further contends that one of school mathematical principles is an equity. It emphasises that mathematic education needs to provide an opportunity and solid support to all students, without distinguishing the individual characteristics, backgrounds, or physical limits experienced by student. Therefore, school and education system shall accommodate the special needs of some students to promote access and achievement for all students (NCTM, 2015, p.5, p.11, p.12, p.13) .\nIn line with the NCTM standards and principles, the Indonesia Law No. 20/2003 on the National Education System, Chapter IV Article 5 (1) states that every citizen have an equal right to earn a quality education. The state support on the quality education rights to all students also implicitly mandated by Chapter V Article 12 of Law 20/2003 that states that all students at all level have a right to earn education services based on his or her talent, interest and competence (Republik Indonesia, 2003) . Thus, education services provided by schools including the mathematic teachers shall pay attention on the student characteristics including the special needs of some students. It aims to ensure that special need students do not experience learning difficulties comparing to other students.\nSpecial needs-student has a wider spectrum and definition. Blackhurst & Berdine (1981, p.9) , Kirk & Gallagher (1989, p.5) , Hallahan & Kauffman (Mangunsong, 2014, p.3) , and Heward (2013, p.7) categorise special-needs student as a differentiated-student from students in general in one or more following areas: (1) mental retardation, (2) learning disability or attention disorder, (3) emotional or behavioural disturbances, (4) physical barriers, (5) communication barriers, (6) autism, (7) traumatic brain injury, (8) hearing barriers, (9) vision barriers or (10) special gifts or talents.\nBesides above categorisations, Van de Walle, Karp & Bay-William (2014, p.101) added the cultural differences, language differences, and unmotivated or need to build resilience as categories of special-needs student.\nIn line with such categorisation, Ministerial of Education and Culture Regulation No. 157/2014 groups special-needs students into two categories: students with learning disabilities and gifted or talented students. The difficulties level in student learning process participation can be caused by characteristic, physical, emotional, mental, intellectual and/or social disorders (Kemdikbud, 2014b) . Considering the wide coverage of special-needs student, this study focused on special-needs students with learning disability category and gifted or talented students in a regular classroom. More specifically, in mathematics, learning difficulties and talent that become a focus of this study are mathematical learning disability and mathematically gifted.\nMathematical learning disability student is a student with special difficulties with perceptual and cognitive processing (Van de Walle, Karp & Bay-William, 2014, p.104) , experienceing difficulties in a mathematical calculation (Hallahan & Kauffman in Mangunsong, 2014, p.203) , demonstrating cognitive and behavioural characteristics that prevent the mathematical performance, and is characterised by the lack of systematic approach in problem solving (Montague & Jitendra, 2012, p.483-484) . Meanwhile, mathematically gifted is a student with high thinking performance and mathematical understanding; manipulating symbolic materials faster and effectively (Blackhurst & Berdine, 1981, p.470) ; making connections (Rotigel & Fello in Van de Walle, Karp & Bay-William, 2014, p.115 ); solving problems with various resolution strategies (Clark; Davis, Rimm, & Siegle; Maker; Piirto in Heward, 2013, p.459) ; ability in utilising the visualisation; have a spatial conceptualisation; have strong ability in generalisation, abstraction, analysis and synthesis (Krutetskii in Grinstein & Lipsey, 2001, p.284) .\nTo be more successful in schools, mathematical learning disability and mathematically gifted students need a systematic instruction program designed to consider the individual needs. The individual approach does not mean that every student has to be individually explained or attend in a small group, but students obtain daily instruction based on their respective needs (Mercer & Mercer, 1985, p.5) . Instruction designed based on the individual needs is known as differentiated instruction. Lack of teacher's understanding on different characteristics and needs of every students might cause the lessons do not optimally achieve its expected goal. Special needs-student's emphasis (mathematical learning disability and mathematically gifted) in this study focuses on special characteristic of students that need teacher's attention to enable every student's needs facilitated in learning. It is to enable all students do not experience obstacles due to such special characteristics during learning process.\nBased on the researcher's observation to date, the majority of schools provide the same treatment and classical to all students regardless below or above average in which students actually have different needs. The next problems are then: (1) below average students whose learning speed is below average will always be left behind in participating the lessons, and (2) above average students will be bored since they need to adjust with the other students whose learning speed is on average or below average. It is in line with what has been contended by Bender (2011, p.60) in which learning that do not consider the varied students' competencies will lead students with high competencies, including gifted students, will be bored and students with lower competencies, including learning disabilities, will be left behind since do not acquire the required basic skills. So far the categorisation of student competencies is based on grade of minimum completion criteria or Kriteria Ketuntasan Minimal (KKM). It can be regarded as a teacher's good effort to respect students' heterogeneity in the classrooms made it possible the designed lessons can accommodate such diversities. However, the researcher has not found any learning set developed by teachers that deliberates student's characteristics including those KKM-oriented category.\nCategorisation of students based on KKM orientation will facilitate teachers in recognising the students' competencies based on merely academic achievement. The KKM oriented categorisation, however, is more result-oriented and ignore the process through. So that the student's special-characteristics that have to be main focus of consideration frequently missed from the attention. During the learning process, the lack of information about the student's special characteristics cause teacher found difficulties in determining which students that need support (scaffolding) and which students that need challenge (challenging).\nIn a learning process, teacher is required to be able to use learning media and other lesson resources that are relevant to students' characteristics and the teaching subjects to achieve the determined learning goals. As an effort to achieve the learning goals, student's worksheet (LKS) can serve as a learning media and resource. However, based on discussion with mathematic teachers in a school located in Garut Regency of Indonesia showed that there are only few teachers who develop student's worksheet (LKS) that meets with the special-needs students. Generally, the student's worksheet is utilised to be applied to all students without considering the special needs of students.\nFrom a psychological aspect, one of student characteristics that teacher needs to pay attention with is interest. Interest is believed to contribute to a student's success in understanding mathematics. According to Nunnally (Gable, 1986, p.8) interest is a preference to certain work activities. Students with high interests tend to actively participate in the learning process. In contrary, students with lower interests tend to withdraw from active learning participation, that may produces boring or less enjoy the attended learning classes. The teacher's ability to identify the interest of every individual students will be a critical foundation to determine how such interests managed and projected to encourage the achievement of an optimal learning goal.\nBased on field observations, students' interest towards learning mathematics is still relatively low. It is characterized by a lack of students' attention in participating the mathematics learning. During the learning, some students were talking with a friend, some others are indifferent and ignore the given assignment, less-actively involved in group discussions and some students feel bored with the mathematics learning because of found it less-important to be studied.\nIn addition to interest, the reality on the ground shows that student's mathematical achievements are still not in line with expectations. Final Report Determinants of Learning Outcomes Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, TIMSS 2011 (Balitbang Kemendikbud, 2012 mentions that the average score of student's mathematics achievement in Indonesia in 1999 Indonesia in , 2003 Indonesia in and 2007 were 403, 411 and 405 respectively. Meanwhile, the Research Department of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Indonesia (Kemendikbud) (2012, P.50) states that the average score of student's mathematics achievement in Indonesia in 2011 was 400.97. From the average score achievement obtained in 2011, we can see that it is three points lower compared to 1999, eleven points lower compared to 2003, and five points lower compared to 2007. Thus, from the four periods above, 2011 is the lowest achievement compared to the three previous periods. Shall the data rating to be applied, the TIMSS study findings put Indonesia into position 34 th of the 45 surveyed countries. Meanwhile, the TIMSS study findings in 2012 Indonesia was ranked 38 th out of 63 countries that delegate their students in the test. This indicates that the achievement of Indonesian students in math is decreased (Kartika, 2013) .\nThe reports of junior high school national examination of academic year 2014/2015 in Garut Regency shows that the level of student's absorption capacity on mathematics is still low. Examination subject about geometry flat sides that are part of the subject of junior high school's math for the second semester of VIII grade is one competence categories tested in the national examination. On the ability to understand the nature and elements of geometry and apply them in problem solving, the students' absorption capacity for Garut Regency in National Exams academic year 2014/2015 is 50.59%. This percentage is still lower than the absorption capacity of the province (51.12%) and national absorption capacity (51.37%). State Junior High School (SMPN) 1 Cisurupan, one of junior high schools in Garut Regency, SMPN 1 Cisurupan, one of the junior high schools in Garut Regency, to the report of the national exams in academic year 2014/2015 showed absorption capacity of 46.48% on the ability to understand the nature and elements of geometry and apply them in problem solving. In other words, student achievement in mathematics is still not in line with expectations.\nBased on the above explanation, the researcher motivates to develop the mathematical learning set for the second semester of grade VIII of junior high school's students with special needs (mathematically learning disability and mathematically gifted) oriented to the interests and learning achievements in order to obtain a valid, practical and effective learning set."}, {"section_title": "METHOD", "text": "This study is a research and development study in the field of education.

At this stage, the problem analysis is conducted till mathematical learning set for second semester of Grade VIII of Junior High School students with special-needs category mathematical learning disability and mathematically gifted is required. Based on discussions with several math teachers it found that some teachers still apply a classical method to all students regardless below average, average or above average in which actually they have different needs. In other word, the learning implementation has not considered the specificneeds of students that may different one to another. Moreover, in delivering the learning contents the teacher still relay on a lecture method with a reason to adjust the limited time availability with the bulks of lesson materials to be delivered. With such lecture method, the learning is mostly centralized on teachers and, on the other side, students just accept what is being delivered by the teacher. In addition to such a condition, based on the teachers' observation in the classroom, some students are less interested in the subject during the math teaching by teachers. Some of them are less enthusiastic about mathematic, even some others frequently found talking with friends or doing other things while the teaching process such as writing or drawing something that do not correspond to the lesson. Such a condition indicates that the mathematics learning in the classroom is less attractive. This development research uses differentiated instruction learning approach. It is an alternative approach that can be implemented in order to accommodate the students' special needs differentiations.\nIn addition to the problem analysis as described above, at the define stage an analysis was also conducted to students that includes the characteristics of special-needs students with category mathematical learning disability and mathematically gifted.\nSpecial-needs students in this study were identified through the identification tests of students with special needs developed by the researcher through referring to the characteristics of mathematical learning disability students and mathematically gifted students. All students of grade VIII of SMPN 1 Cisurupan administered a students' special needs identification test. The results of the identification test were analyzed based on the pre-determined criteria. The final results of the test was compared with the results of identification by the teacher through students' track record forms during attending the accomplished mathematic learning. Both identification methods are needed to identify students with special-needs category and non-special needs category. In the specialneeds category, the students' identification also identify students with mathematical learning disability (MLD) and mathematically gifted (MG) categories.\nThe result of student identification showed that of the nine (9) parallel classes of grade VIII found special-needs students with mathematical learning disability (MLD) of 5%-15% in every classes, and mathematically gifted (MG) of 2.8% in 3 out of 9 classes. Product trials conducted in classes with special needs students in mathematical learning disabilities and mathematically gifted categories, which is Class VIII I SMPN 1 Cisurupan Garut. 4 out of 35 students of Class VIII I found with mathematical learning disability (MLD) and one student with mathematically gifted (MG). Therefore, the developed learning set strived to facilitate the special needs of students in the regular class dominated by non-special needs students (regular learning class).\nAnalyses on material to be delivered (conceptual analysis), development of competence achievement's indicator, and development of the mathematical learning objectives for of the second semester of grade VIII of Junior High School were also conducted in defining stage."}, {"section_title": "Design Stage", "text": "The next step is a design stage. It is conducted by creating product designs in accordance with the analysis results of the defining stage. At this stage, the appraisal instruments that will be used to evaluate the learning set is developed, which namely include: validity, practicality, and effectiveness. The validity of the learning set measured through the validation sheet of learning set. The practicality of learning set measured through teachers' appraisal sheets, students' appraisal sheet and learning implementation observation sheet. While the effectiveness of the learning set measured through appraisal instruments on the learning interest and achievement.\nA media selection was also done at this stage to determine the most appropriate media being used in mathematics learning material delivery. The media selection process is based on the competences achievement indicators, materials, and student characteristics. Based on activity analyzes at the define stage, the selected media to present the learning contents are lesson plan (RPP) with differentiated instruction approach and student's worksheet (LKS) which are divided into three categories according to the characteristics of the identified special-needs students.\nThe next step is the selection of learning tools format. Based on preliminary-final analysis at the define stage, the developed RPP uses the differentiated instruction approach. In this approach, learning activities focused on the individual activities prior to the group's activities. Individual activities aimed at facilitating the students to achieve the required conditions to conduct group activities. The individual activities were facilitated by student's worksheet (LKS) that developed based on the characteristics of the identified students. It is expected that the group activities can facilitate the students to work together, exchange experiences and information, as well as improve the communication skills.\nBased on the student analysis, the student's worksheet (LKS) was developed in three categories, namely: (1) LKS P1 code for students with mathematical learning disability (MLD); (2) LKS P2 code for non-special needs students; and (3) LKS P3 code for mathematically gifted (MG). Meanwhile, based on the conceptual analysis, the worksheet on Geometry Flat Sides was provided for 8 student's worksheets (LKS) for 8 times class meetings.\nThe differences of characteristics of the developed worksheet briefly presented in the Table 11 as followings.
