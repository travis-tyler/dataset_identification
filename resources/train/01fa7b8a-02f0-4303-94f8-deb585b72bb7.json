The most common challenge in univariate or multivariate meta-analysis is estimating heterogeneity parameters in non-negative domains under the random-effects model assumption. In this context, two new multivariate estimation methods are demonstrated; first, by extending the Sidik and Jonkman (2005) univariate estimates to a multivariate setting, and second, by considering an iterative version of the Sidik and Jonkman method, namely, a Hybrid method developed in Wouhib (2013).

In particular, it can describe the association between the estimates of effects in order to make predictions about the true effects of a new study and provide estimates with better statistical properties than univariate due to the borrowing of strength that it enables (Jackson et al. 2011 ). There are two scenarios that would warrant consideration of a multivariate approach in meta-analysis. First, technically equivalent outcomes may not be considered as a single entity because of differences in study design, aims or definitions. Second, because outcomes may be strongly related among themselves, an evaluation of the agent should 'borrow strength' not only across studies, as in traditional meta-analysis models, but also across outcomes. The rationale to synthesizing coefficients of several independent regressions could be a multivariate meta-analysis problem. Becker and Wu (2007) stated in their paper that the synthesis of regression slopes has received increased attention in recent years, and can be handled in multivariate meta-analysis as long as the regression variables are measured in a similar way across independent studies. This paper begins with a discussion of the multivariate random-effects model and its practical merit that has become more prevalent in meta-analyses in recent years. The validity of the estimators and their adequacy or inadequacy is assessed by discussing the most recent methods of estimating a matrix of heterogeneity parameters in a random-effects setting, which includes the multivariate version of the DerSimonian and Laird (DL) method proposed by Jackson et al. (2009) and Chen et al. (2012) . Also two new methods are proposed, namely, a multivariate extension of the Sidik and Jonkman (SJ) estimator and its iterative version called the Hybrid estimator (Wouhib, 2013) . In addition to the theoretical justification, the general approach in measuring the effectiveness of a new method is examined by comparing it to the estimated mean effect sizes and associated covariance matrices offered by other methods using simulation. Details of the SJ method along with the hybrid method, will be discussed by presenting a generalized least squares (GLS) approach with remarks on the challenges and limitations in synthesizing effect sizes in multivariate modeling.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the estimation of a matrix of heterogeneity parameters based on extending the DL method for a random-effects multivariate meta-analysis. Details of the two methods presented by Jackson et al. (2009) and Chen et al. (2012) , with their respective issues and limitations, are discussed here. The newly proposed methods, namely, the multivariate extension of the SJ method and the Hybrid method, are also introduced and explained in this section.

(2009) , requires a pairwise estimation of the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the heterogeneity matrix separately. Hence, the method handles any multivariate model as a collection of several interdependent bivariate models in the estimation procedures. It treats a p-dimensional matrix as a collection of p C 2 possible combinations of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices and builds its way up to the p-dimensional covariance matrix of p(p + 1)/2 elements. To estimate the 2 \u00d7 2 heterogeneity parameter matrix, the method considers a subset bivariate random-effects model with three elements of heterogeneity parameters. Hence, in the Jackson et al. (2009) method, there is no statistical methodology in place to estimate a p \u00d7 p matrix of heterogeneity parameters beyond the 2 \u00d7 2 entries at a given time. This estimator, which referred to as DLJ, is criticized by Chen et al. (2012) for failing to produce a valid matrix estimate. Chen et al. (2012) , however, also acknowledge that neither theirs nor Jackson's method would provide an estimator of the between-study covariance matrix that is always positive semi-definite, especially when heterogeneity is low. In Jackson's method, the computation of an estimate for each pairwise entry (i.e., a separate 2\u00d72 diagonal and off-diagonal elements) of the T matrix is accomplished by examining an appropriate bivariate model until exhausting all p-dimensional variables to estimate a p \u00d7 p matrix of heterogeneity parameters. However, the procedure in estimating the diagonal elements of the matrix is quite similar to the DL method of estimating a univariate heterogeneity parameter. Jackson et al. (2009) regards the DLJ method as an extended version of the univariate DL estimator in estimating T DLJ from 2 \u00d7 2 Q-matrix.\nThe Q-matrix for all u and v such that, 1 \u2264 u < v \u2264 p is,\nWhere,\u03b2\n13)\n14)\nThe expectation of Q uv is given by\nand for\nThe estimators for heterogeneity parameters,\u03c4 uu ,\u03c4 vv and\u03c4 uv =\u03c4 vu can be obtained by matching moments in equation (2.17), (2.18) and (2.19) respectively. Once a pairwise estimation procedure as described above is implemented, then the matrix, T DLJ , is formed as a collection of the pairwise estimates. Then the overall mean effect size, \u03b2 , is estimated b\u0177\nwhere\nThe other DL extension method of estimating a multivariate heterogeneity parameter matrix is presented by Chen et al. (2012) . Unlike the DLJ, this method, which is called DLC was initiated by extending the univariate DL estimation procedure in matrix form, and they estimated the heterogeneity parameters simultaneously. The estimation procedures are explained in the following steps: Let\nand\nwhere\na stack of p \u00d7 p identity matrices, and\u03b2 F is an estimator for a fixed-effects model, and\nThen, E(A) = \u03a6T, for T is the heterogeneity parameter matrix of size p \u00d7 p. Finally, to maintain its symmetric property, the DLC estimator matrix is re-written as:\nThe authors of the DLC method stressed that their method provides similar results as the Jackson's DLJ method and conducted simulations to support their claim. In both extended multivariate DL methods, a remedy was proposed if the diagonals of T DLJ and T DLC turned out to be negative. The remedy truncates the matrices to make them positive semidefinite. Although the newly made positive semi-definite matrices are acknowledged to be biased, it is difficult to draw similarities with truncating negative heterogeneity parameters in univariate models.\nIn their recent paper, Jackson, et al. (2013) "}, {"section_title": "The Sidik Jonkman(SJ) & the Hybrid Methods of Estimating Heterogeneity", "text": "Parameters The SJ multivariate method for estimating the heterogeneity parameter matrix emulates the SJ method of estimating the heterogeneity parameter under a univariate meta-analysis model. In the univariate meta-analysis, the fundamental difference of the SJ method from others is the assumption of \u03c4 2 > 0.

Clearly, the estimatorT is unbiased if the parameter Q i is known and fixed for all values of i = 1, 2, ...k. Unfortunately,T is a function of Q i which is not known and has to be estimated from the data. In other words, since the matrix T is component of Q i for the study i, a reasonable initial estimate of T is needed to estimate Q i . In the case of univariate meta-analysis, Sidik and Jonkman (2005) , suggested an the average of the sums of the squares of the effect sizes to be an initial value for the heterogeneity parameter.\nIn the multivariate case, let the initial matrix for estimating T be\nan arithmetic mean vector of the effect sizes. Then, as in the univariate meta-analysis, the initial matrix for Q i can be estimated as\nUsing Q 0 i , the initial value for \u03b2 can be estimated a\u015d\nThen, the SJ estimator of multivariate heterogeneity parameter matrix i\u015d\nOnce the heterogeneity parameter matrix is estimated, the overall effect size vector, \u03b2 can be estimated as\nThe SJ estimator is a general heterogeneity variance estimator that can be applied to any randomeffects model regardless of its dimension. In a univariate case, Sidik and Jonkman (2005) stated that the estimator does not share a shortcoming of other estimators because it always yields a nonnegative estimate. Moreover, it is derived from the weighted residual sum of squares in the framework of a linear regression model without covariates, where the weight is formulated in terms of the ratio of the study-specific variance to the heterogeneity variance. The SJ multivariate heterogeneity variance parameter matrix estimator is an extension of the univariate SJ method and should have the same properties as its univariate counterpart. Hence, under minimal heterogeneity, T SJ , has a tendency of overestimating the true matrix of heterogeneity parameters. As a consequence, exploring an alternative method in estimating the heterogeneity parameter matrix, which is based on the SJ method and that addresses the over-estimation concern, is important. The new estimator, which is called the Hybrid method, maintains all the desired properties of the SJ method and performs much better in the area where the SJ method reveals some concerns, especially when heterogeneity is minimal. Like SJ, the Hybrid method also assumes the heterogeneity true matrix to be positive definite matrix. This method is called the Hybrid method because the SJ estimator initiates an iterative procedure to estimate the heterogeneity parameters in a form of matrix. For the Hybrid method, first, a convergence criterion to stop the iteration has to be established and the SJ estimators,T SJ and\u03b2 SJ are used as initial estimates in the first iteration. Then the second round of iteration takes place usingT SJ and\u03b2 SJ in equation (2.47) to estimate the second round heterogeneity parameter matrix estimator,T 2 . Subsequently, the second round effect size vector,\u03b2 2 is estimated by usingT 2 . The iteration procedure continues until the specified convergence criterion is met. If the criterion is met at the j th iteration, thenT j is designated asT Hyb , the Hybrid estimator of the heterogeneity parameter matrix. Similarly, the estimated overall effect size at the j th iteration,\u03b2 j =\u03b2 Hyb is the Hybrid estimator for any dimensional multivariate random-effects meta-analysis.\n3. An illustrative Examples"}, {"section_title": "Example I", "text": "From the recent paper of Jackson, et al. (2013), a real study of hypertension treatment is taken as the first illustrative example. The example involves 10 studies that assess the effectiveness of hypertension treatment for lowering blood pressure. Each study provides complete data on two treatment effects, the difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the treatment and control groups, where these differences are adjusted for the participants' baseline blood pressures. A bigger reduction in blood pressure is a desirable outcome, so negative estimates indicate that the treatment is beneficial. The within-study correlations are known, so that the within-study covariance matrices are also known, and the data are shown in the following table below. In the Table 1 , SBP and DBP are the treatment effects on the systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively. The within-study standard error corresponding to each estimate, SE SBP and SE DBP , along with the study-level correlations denoted by \u03c1 are also given.\nResults from the multivariate meta-analysis using the Jackson, et al. Table 2 . The betweenstudy correlation estimates are also presented in this table.\nIn the presence of substantial heterogeneity, Sidik and Jonkman (2007) showed that the DerSimonian and Laird method tends to underestimate the population heterogeneity parameter. In their univariate simulation study, they showed that the underestimation exacerbates as heterogeneity increases. Both DLJ and DLC methods seem to underestimate the heterogeneity parameter matrix in example I. As a result of the underestimation, the off-diagonal parameter, T 0,1 , has much smaller estimates for both DLJ and DLC methods, implying small correlation between SBP and DBP for the treatment effect across studies. However, the underestimated heterogeneity parameters do not seem to have much influence on the estimated effect sizes."}, {"section_title": "Example II", "text": "Here the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009 (HSLS:09), cited by Chen et al. (2012) on a three dimensional multivariate meta-analysis of random-effects model is revisited to estimate heterogeneity parameter matrices of 3 \u00d7 3 dimension. HSLS:09 is a nationally representative, longitudinal study of more than 21,000 ninth graders in 944 schools who were be followed through their secondary and postsecondary years. In the within-study level analyses, the interest was to know whether sex, socioeconomic status and sex by socio-economic status interaction are predictive of the mathematics standardized theta score. Regression was performed for each of the eight race groups and the regression coefficients were estimated. Once the summary results were available, the second stage of the analysis was to estimate a vector of the overall effect sizes and heterogeneity parameter matrix. The estimated regression coefficients and associated covariance matrix for each of the eight race groups in Table  1 are taken from Chen et al. (2012) . The value b i1 is the regression coefficient for sex, b i2 is the regression coefficient for socioeconomic status score and b i3 is the regression coefficient for sex by socio-economic status score interaction for race group i. By applying the extended DL multivariate methods for estimating the between-study covariance matrix as described by Jackson Similar to the DLJ, the estimator by Chen, et al. (2012) ,T DLC also has negative diagonal elements and need to be a positive semi-definite matrix applying the proposed remedy. As the original DCL, the estimated matrix is modified by using the remedy to get rid of the negative diagonal elements in the matrix. The newly transformed matrix is calledT DLCT Furthermore, when the Hybrid method is applied, convergence was slow and the iteration was longer than usual. That could be due to the ill-conditioned nature of the true heterogeneity parameter matrix or due to a very small heterogeneity in the data. Perhaps, it could be also the main reason for the estimated singular matrices in both the Jackson et al. The instability of the true heterogeneity parameter matrix slowed the iteration for convergence and as a consequence, the Hybrid method attained the maximum number of iterations set by a stopping rule. The stopping rule for estimating the heterogeneity parameter matrix is set to be, either a very small difference between matrices of successive iterations or a reasonable number of maximum iterations, whichever comes first. Because of this rear scenario, the estimated Hybrid heterogeneity parameter matrix is not as well conditioned and has a positive determinant that is close to zero. BothT SJ andT Hyb produce matrices with quadratic forms and they are positive definite. Despite the similarities in estimated effect sizes, the estimated heterogeneity parameter matrices are quite different from method to method in the above example. Although each method expected to produce different results, the outcome in this example exacerbated by the true heterogeneity parameter matrix of the data. The results are consistent with univariate cases as close to zero heterogeneity parameter slows the convergence process of the Hybrid method and produces negative estimates for other methods including the DerSimonian and Laird method (Wouhib, 2013 )."}, {"section_title": "Simulation Studies", "text": "After estimating the heterogeneity parameters in the example, a simulation study was performed by choosing appropriate population parameters. The simulation is based on three dimensional multivariate data populated with study numbers, k = 10 with unequal sample sizes, n i = 12, 13, ..., 17 for i = 1, 2, ..., 10 and 1, 000 replications. In the simulation, T, a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix of heterogeneity parameters and \u03b2 , a three-dimensional zero vector, were used as true population covariance and mean respectively. The within-study covariance matrices were populated similar to Jackson et al. (2009) as stated in section 5.1 for 3-dimensional analysis. The vector for the population effect size is set to be zero since it has no major impact on the heterogeneity parameter matrix estimation procedures. The between-study heterogeneity parameter matrix and the effect size vector of the population in the simulation are The estimated matrix using the SJ method for heterogeneity parameters, the estimated vector for effect sizes, and associated covariance matrix are stated as follows: In this simulation, the heterogeneity parameter matrix, which was taken from the Hybrid method estimate of Example II is not stable with a determinant very close to zero. As explained earlier, this is mainly due the nature of the data used in the example or the condition of the true heterogeneity parameter matrix itself. Because of that, the simulation produced (not shown) negative definite matrices in more than 74 % and 67 % cases of the DLJ and DLC methods respectively, when estimating the true heterogeneity parameter matrix. Hence, the negative definite matrices from these methods were transformed to non-negative definite form using the remedy proposed by Jackson, et al. (2009) and Chen, et al. (2012) . Obviously, the estimates are biased and the remedy in correcting the matrices may affect estimates of the population heterogeneity parameter matrix for these methods and consequently, the estimated effect sizes are also affected. Perhaps, the DLJ and DLC methods are unable to work properly where the true population heterogeneity parameter matrix is close to homogeneity as seen in this simulation. Nevertheless, in multiple other sets of simulations [24] , where the population heterogeneity parameter matrix was selected to be stable and substantial, the DLJ and the DLC methods estimated the heterogeneity parameters with a very small proportion of negative definite matrices with the tendency of overestimation (Example I). In the case of substantial heterogeneity, still the SJ and the Hybrid methods have shown much better results in estimating both the population heterogeneity parameter matrix as shown in the first example. We should also notice that both the SJ and the Hybrid methods do not need correction remedies and the estimates for the heterogeneity parameter matrix are always positive definite."}, {"section_title": "Discussion and Conclusion", "text": "From the simulation, both the SJ and the Hybrid estimators of the of the heterogeneity parameter matrix performed better than the Chen et al. (2012) method in terms of proximity to the true heterogeneity matrix and in producing always non-negative definite matrices. Moreover, the simulation showed that the Hybrid estimator does better than the SJ estimator for both diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the heterogeneity parameter matrix. Although our simulation does not include Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) methods, in a close to homogeneity cases, these methods are likely to produce estimates with negative definite matrix, similar to the DL methods. Truncating a negative definite matrix by means of the spectral decomposition not only changes the negative definite matrix into positive semi-definite form of nonzero diagonal element, but it also changes the off-diagonal elements of the matrix. This can lead to a meaningless interpretation of the elements of the truncated matrix. Moreover, unlike the widely used truncation in the univariate meta-analysis, the application of spectral decomposition may has unintended consequences in multivariate meta-analysis when transforming a negative definite heterogeneity matrix to a nonnegative form. As we have seen in the second example, estimating the between-study correlation coefficients could be misleading when estimated heterogeneity parameter matrices of DLJ and DLC are used after transformation.\nThe SJ and the Hybrid methods have important features in estimating matrices of heterogeneity parameters. The estimated matrices are always positive definite, and no need for matrix truncation or spectral decomposition. Similar to a one-way random-effects meta-analysis, the newly proposed methods are viable alternatives and perhaps the only option when other methods fail to properly estimate a matrix of heterogeneity parameters for a multivariate random-effects model (Wouhib, 2013) . The SJ and the Hybrid methods perform nicely with any multidimensional meta-analysis whether heterogeneity is substantial or minimal. Among these two methods, the simulation showed that the Hybrid method does much better in estimating the true heterogeneity parameter matrix in terms of closeness to the true parameters of the between-study covariance matrix. Although the Hybrid method is iterative; Wouhib (2013) has shown that it usually converges faster than other iterative methods including ML and REML."}]
