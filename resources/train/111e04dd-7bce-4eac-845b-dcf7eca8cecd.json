We performed a large, genome-wide association study (GWAS) of two previously validated metrics of cognitive resilience quantified using a latent variable modeling approach and representing betterthan-predicted cognitive performance for a given level of neuropathology. Data were harmonized across 5,108 participants from a clinical trial of AD and three longitudinal cohort studies of cognitive aging. All analyses were run across all participants and repeated restricting the sample to individuals with normal cognition to identify variants at the earliest stages of disease.

Clinically, it presents with progressive cognitive impairment. Yet, due to the long prodromal period of AD and unknown biological factors, not everyone with AD neuropathology presents with cognitive impairment. In fact, among cognitively normal volunteers agreeing to autopsy at the time of death, 70% have varying degrees of AD pathology (Sonnen et al., 2011) , and 30% have sufficient neuropathology in their brain to meet neuropathological criteria for AD (i.e., \"Asymptomatic AD\") (Rahimi and Kovacs, 2014) . Identifying the molecular factors that underlie the resilience observed in asymptomatic AD may provide novel therapeutic targets for clinical intervention and provide additional insight into the genetic architecture of AD.\nWhile there has been some prior discovery work using genomic data Yu et al., 2018) , previous work characterizing the genetic contributors to asymptomatic AD has primarily focused on candidate genes (Monsell et al., 2013; Monsell et al., 2017; Franzmeier et al., 2019) due to the lack of sufficient sample size to complete full genome-wide analyses. A major barrier in moving analyses forward has been the categorical definitions of asymptomatic AD that drastically reduce the number of participants available for analysis. In the last decade, residual approaches to quantifying continuous metrics of \"resilience\" have emerged as potential endophenotypes for genetic analyses (Yu et al., 2015; White et al., 2017; Boyle et al., 2019) . The basic approach is to deconvolve cognitive scores into components that are explained and unexplained by proxy or direct measures of neuropathology (Reed et al., Genetic Markers of Resilience 6 2010) . These residual approaches model better-than and worse-than predicted cognitive performance to represent higher vs. lower resilience (Yu et al., 2015; Boyle et al., 2019) . Recently, our group has extended these residual approaches to quantify and validate continuous metrics of \"cognitive resilience\" (representing better-than-predicted cognitive performance given an individual's burden of AD neuropathology) and \"brain resilience\" (representing better-than-predicted brain volumes given an individual's burden of AD neuropathology) (Hohman et al., 2016b) . These continuous metrics are strong predictors of future cognitive decline and cognitive impairment (Hohman et al., 2016b) . The goal of the present analysis was to evaluate genetic predictors of cognitive resilience across the genome.\nA few genome-wide analyses have been completed that focus on resilience in asymptomatic AD, although with limited sample sizes (Hohman et al., 2014a; Hohman et al., 2014b; Hohman et al., 2016a; White et al., 2017) . Recently, approximately 3,000 samples with both whole-genome genetic data and in vivo brain measures of amyloid burden from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic AD (A4) clinical trial were made publicly available, providing an unmatched resource for exploring the genetics of resilience to AD. We performed the largest (N=5,108) genome-wide association study (GWAS) of cognitive resilience in AD by leveraging harmonized resilience metrics across the cross-sectional A4 study and three longitudinal cohort studies of AD.\nValidation of identified genomic candidates was completed using gene expression data from post mortem brain tissue and genotype data from large-scale case/control datasets of AD. Importantly, we also performed comprehensive genetic correlation and pathway analyses to provide critical information about the fundamental biological pathways that may protect the brain from the downstream consequences of AD neuropathology.

Additional novel correlations included two neuropsychiatric conditions, whereby increased genetic risk of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) was correlated with higher levels of resilience (p=7.9x10 -4 ) while increased genetic risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was associated with lower levels of resilience (p=4.7x10 -6 ).\nInterestingly, older age at first birth was associated with higher levels of resilience (p=1.1x10 -8 ).

As expected, we observed strong genetic correlations with educational attainment, cognitive performance, and a number of education-related traits. It is also interesting that we observed some hormone and smoking related traits, although both may be confounded by educational attainment making interpretation challenging. In the case of the smoking traits, genetic risk for smoking and a younger age of initiating smoking was associated with lower levels of resilience, consistent with epidemiological associations between smoking and dementia (Tyas et al., 2003; Peters et al., 2008) . In the case of hormone-related phenotypes, an older age of first birth, last birth, and menopause (nominal association in GNOVA and UK Biobank) was correlated with higher resilience scores. Similar associations at the phenotypic level have been reported previously, with an older age at menopause correlated with protection from cognitive decline (Robert N. McLay et al., 2003; Ryan et al., 2009; Ryan et al., 2014) . Interestingly, we and others have published extensively on sex differences in the downstream consequences of neuropathology (Buckley et al., 2018; Deming et al., 2018; Hohman et al., 2018; Dumitrescu et al., 2019a; Dumitrescu et al., 2019b) . The present results suggest that hormone changes in older adulthood may contribute to susceptibility to cognitive decline, but more work is needed to disentangle the potential contribution of educational attainment on these observed genetic correlations.\nIn addition, we observed notable genetic correlations with neuropsychiatric phenotypes including ADHD and OCD. Interestingly, genetic risk for OCD was associated with higher resilience scores, while genetic risk for ADHD was associated with lower resilience. Although there is some literature suggesting a potential link between ADHD and dementia, it is challenging because of the symptomatic overlap of the two conditions in adulthood (Callahan et al., 2017) . Even less work has characterized the association between OCD and dementia, but the limited literatures suggests OCD is a risk factor for dementia (Dondu et al., 2015) . Thus, it is quite interesting that we observe a positive genetic correlation between OCD and resilience here, suggesting a potential protective role. Past work has highlighted a strong negative genetic correlation between OCD and metabolic phenotypes including body mass index, hip circumference, smoking, triglycerides, and insulin levels (Dondu et al., 2015) . OCD and ADHD also show a similar opposing genetic correlation with educational attainment, so it may be that the genetic correlation between these psychiatric conditions and resilience is secondary to metabolic or educational attainment phenotypes, but it is an area ripe for future investigation."}, {"section_title": "Variants near ATP8B1 are Associated with Resilience", "text": "Our top variant level association was observed on Chromosome 18 in relation to the Combined Resilience score that pools information from residual and proxy measures of reserve. The cluster of SNPs associated with Combined Resilience localized just upstream of ATP8B1, and the top SNP was robustly associated with Genetic Markers of Resilience 20 methylation at a site also just upstream of ATP8B1. Interestingly, prefrontal cortex methylation at this site was strongly associated with Combined Resilience scores in the ROS/MAP dataset, particularly among rs2571244 minor allele carriers, further implicating methylation as a potential biological driver at this locus. ATP8B1 is a protein coding gene that encodes an aminophospholipid translocase that is critical for maintaining bile acid homeostasis in the liver (Bull et al., 1998) . For that reason, we also performed post-hoc analyses using recently quantified metabolomic measures of 15 bile acids from serum samples in ADNI and observed that the variant was nominally associated with five bile acids, including TCA, GLCA, GCA, TDCA, and TCDCA (p<0.05; see Supplementary Table 16 ). Moreover, we observed significant associations between GLCA and TDCA on Combined Resilience, whereby higher levels of these bile acids were associated with lower levels of resilience ( Supplementary   Table 17 ). Bile acids have emerged as a potential biological contributor to AD, with recent work reporting differential abundance in AD cases compared to controls in both blood and brain , and other work reporting associations with biomarkers of AD neuropathology . Notably, both GLCA and TDCA were reported to have robust associations with hippocampal atrophy and glucose hypometabolism. The present findings therefore suggest genetic variation that predisposes some individuals towards a more detrimental bile acid state may also increase susceptibility to cognitive decline. The exact causal pathway of such bile acid effects is difficult to infer. Notably, the methylation QTL that we observed for rs2571244 was in prefrontal cortex, suggesting effects could be through brain, but there is a pressing need to better understand the gut-liver-brain axis and determine whether associations with cognitive aging and dementia are driven by metabolic processes in liver, gut, brain, or all three tissues."}, {"section_title": "Pathway Analyses Highlight Metabolism", "text": "While variant-level results implicate the metabolic processes in the liver, enrichment results highlight the related branched chain amino acid (BCAA) and dehydrogenase molecular pathways. Although the role of BCAAs in AD onset and progression is unclear, several studies have supported a connection. A previous GWAS study showed that SNPs associated with increased isoleucine plasma levels were also associated with AD (Larsson and Markus, 2017) . However, metabolomic studies have shown that increased serum concentration of BCAAs are associated with decreased AD risk (Tynkkynen et al., 2018) . Particularly, increased serum valine was associated with decreased rates of cerebral atrophy and cognitive decline (Toledo et al., 2017) . Deficits in brain BCAA metabolism have been proposed to contribute to the onset and progression of AD in mice, and increased circulating BCAAs have been hypothesized to increase neuronal mTOR signaling, leading to hyperphosphorylated tau pathology .\nSeveral components of dehydrogenase pathways have been implicated to play a role in dysfunctional oxidative stress handling in AD (Martins et al., 1986) . Inhibition of alpha-ketoglutarate, pyruvate, and alcohol dehydrogenases by amyloid beta is thought to contribute to mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction associated with AD (Casley et al., 2002; Yan and Stern, 2005) .
