Hence, TWH programs must include health protection and health promotion program components, which together include several modifiable risk factors that have been linked to increased sickness absenteeism, increased presenteeism, and reductions in preventable health care costs. [6] [7] [8] Nevertheless, these findings are based on studies of large employers that include many if not all of these program components, but which also organize their employee health programs to ensure integration of health protection and health promotion programs. Although available evidence makes clear that integration of employee health programs is important, the methodology for defining and measuring integration is still developing and is not the focus of this study. 9, 10 To fully describe employer adoption of TWH would require assessment of both ETHM program components and measures of program organization and integration. The goal of this 2012 survey of a sample of Iowa employers was to translate the ETHM into a 12-item questionnaire suitable for use for a statewide survey of employers of all sizes, and to provide estimates of the ETHM model component adoption among these employers."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": "A total of 107,940 eligible employers were identified from the Iowa Dun & Bradstreet database for employers with two or more employees (2012). Organizations were stratified by the number of employees (2 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 49, 50 to 249, 250 to 999, and 1000 or more), using proprietary randomization software developed by Data Point Research under contract with DPLB. A stratified random sample of 5606 employers was selected for the 2012 survey. Data were collected from a total of 1206 organizations through Web-based questionnaires and with telephone follow-up.\nThe ETHM questionnaire is an elaboration of eight previous DPLB Health and Wellness Initiatives modules included in Iowa Employer Benefit surveys of more than 7400 employers. Items used in previous surveys included medical information (Web site, newsletter, etc), blood pressure/cholesterol screening, chronic disease management, smoking cessation/weight control wellness programs, health risk assessment, and health club discount or other incentives. The HWCE provided collaboration on the design of the previous questionnaire and contracted with DPLB to administer the current ETHM questionnaire, which used the same format and many of the same items included in previous DPLB surveys (see Table 1 for the full questionnaire). Survey data included employment sector, organization size, rural or urban location as defined by United States Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum Codes, 11 insurance coverage, and health and wellness module responses. All analyses were conducted at the HWCE using SAS, version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). Table 2 . Seven employers did not fall within any of these Standard Industrial Classification codes and were eliminated from further analysis. As is evident within all employment sectors, this sample provides employee distributions that are predominantly small, nearly a third employing 9 or fewer employees and nearly three quarters employing fewer than 50 employees. The largest employment sectors are services, retail trade, and manufacturing, which together constituted two thirds of the sample.\nMore than half of the organizations participating in this survey are located in rural counties, which include 55% of companies with 9 or fewer employees (Table 3) , while organizations employing at least 250 employees are located primarily in urban counties. Only 51% of the smallest organizations offer health insurance, while organizations employing at least 50 employees reported nearly universal health care coverage (96%). Organizations employing at least 250 employees were frequently self-insured, while organizations employing less than 50 employees (of those which offer health insurance) offered fully insured policies more than 85% of the time.\nThe prevalence of organizations offering ETHM program components are summarized in Table 1 . The most frequent response (89%) was provision of workers' compensation insurance, required by law for most Iowa employers. Nearly 47% of employers reported having an occupational safety and health program, an essential element of TWH programs. Other program elements were much less prevalent, led by programs on health or medical information, behavioral health, wellness, having a health risk assessment, and health advocacy. Employers collectively indicated that they intended to increase offering all ETHM program components The distribution of program participation by company size found only organizations employing nine or fewer employees to have less than 90% workers' compensation insurance coverage (Table 4) . Only a third of 2-to 9-employee organizations reported having occupational health and safety programs, a prevalence that increased to nearly 80% among organization employing 1000 or more employees. Similar progressions in prevalence by organization size were observed for all other ETHM program components."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Development of the ETHM questionnaire, based on a model described by the IOM, 1 provides a framework to describe and quantify employer participation in providing individual components of this model. As Iowa begins to implement the prevention provisions of Patient Protection and Accountable Care Act, this questionnaire will provide a TWH tool to assess statewide progress as employers provide the building blocks for a TWH approach to safer and healthier workplaces Very few population-based data are available for small employers, especially for companies employing two to nine employees; yet 90% of workplaces are of this size in Iowa and many other more rural states. As has been documented by all previous Iowa Employer Benefit Studies, these smaller employers are usually not able to offer health insurance, so the modest number of small employers offering health and wellness program components is not surprising. The ETHM questionnaire contained several Health and Wellness Initiative questions included in previous DPLB surveys, and the annual survey-to-annual survey results on these large samples of Iowa employers are remarkably consistent-in general, finding increasing participation with time. Consistent with previous results, employers intend, for all ETHM program elements, to extend their offerings in the coming year.\nThis survey estimates only employer participation in offering the 12 ETHM program components, but did not seek to measure integration of these employee health programs. Nevertheless, several of these program components are essential for measurement of modifiable risk factors known to be important predictors of preventable health care costs, sickness absenteeism, and presenteeism. [6] [7] [8] Among large employers participating in the cited studies, risk has been found to decrease because employees actively engage in more complete prevention programs, the most successful of which include individual coaching to optimize individual employee behavior 8 Exactly how even large employers organize and administer their integrated employee health programs, while known to be important and advocated by the IOM, is less clear. 1 The first organizational priority recommended by the IOM was transformational leadership, which has recently been shown to have a positive effect on employee wellbeing. 12 Development of valid and reliable methods to assess organizational measures of integrated employee health programs continues to be an important research priority. 9 Another research priority necessary to fully realize the benefits of TWH programs is go beyond measurement of risk factors to base program impact on measures of employee well-being, absenteeism, and presenteeism."}, {"section_title": "LIMITATIONS", "text": "The generalizability of the results of this study is limited by the response rate of this survey. Nevertheless, this health and wellness survey is a further iteration of eight previous annual surveys of large, random samples of predominantly small Iowa employers for which there is an acceptable margin of error of 2.9%. For the six items common to the previous DPLB survey module and ETHM questionnaire, the year-to-year results are remarkably consistent, suggesting this instrument is providing reliable and valid results for these items. The study has a number of strengths, including assessment of a large random statewide sample of predominantly small Iowa employers for which little research is available, and population-based employer estimates of adoption of components of an IOM-endorsed ETHM model."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "This statewide survey of health and wellness program activities provides useful estimates from a random statewide sample of employers. This is important because it provides unique data about small employers, the employment segment that faces the greatest challenge in both providing employees with health insurance and health and wellness benefits. These data build on previous annual DPLB surveys and provide a benchmark for future adoption of TWH program components in Iowa. As the United States shifts to a more health-based model of health care, this survey instrument may be useful for other population-based assessments of employer participation in building employee health programs."}]
