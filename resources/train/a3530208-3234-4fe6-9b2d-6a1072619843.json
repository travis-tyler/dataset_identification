[{"section_title": "", "text": "First, I would like to acknowledge members of the laboratory where I undertook this ethnography. I am indebted to their willingness to allow a stranger, no less a person from the social sciences, to enter into their world; something they thought most unusual. I am forever grateful for their time and tutorials as I learned about their laboratory lives and the scientific work they carry out. They all work under tremendous pressure that appears to be endemic to academic, basic science biomedical research. Their intellect and good will cannot be measured by citations alone. Second, without the intellectual guidance and personal mentorship of my advisor, Hannah Landecker, I am not sure I would be writing this at all. I am so thankful to have found a person that makes me feel at home among those who embrace and traverse multiple intellectual terrains, taking us beyond the usual confines of ordinary disciplinary science into new areas of exploration. She is also an extraordinary human being who makes the journey accessible and enjoyable. This dissertation is a tribute to her generosity over the years. Along this journey, I have also benefited from the insights of professors at different stages of my time in the doctoral program. In chronological order, I am grateful to C.K. Lee Control and Prevention, 2009). They tested samples for chemicals, or its metabolite (small molecules produced when body tissues chemically alter the original compound it is exposed to) to measure the presence of these 200+ chemicals. Their findings indicate that there is \"widespread exposure to some commonly used industrial chemicals\" such as fire retardants, bisphenol-A (BPA) used in food packaging, and polymers used in the manufacture of non-stick cookware, clothing, and many other products (p. 3). In another nationally representative sample, public health researchers studied the presence of multiple chemical exposures in children. They concluded that \"the percentage of children with detectable 1 Numerous authors have argued that causal and associative links drawn between obesity and poor health outcomes are problematic. George Bray, an early American obesity researcher, thought obesity and metabolic disturbance posed a chicken or egg problem, which still perplexes scientists today. In the 1960s, he and others wondered, \"Does the obesity produce insulin resistance, or does insulin resistance precede obesity and play a role in its development? Are other hormonal and endocrine changes that we measure a result of being obese, or do they contribute to the onset of the obesity?\" (2015, pp. 11-12) The difficulties of undoing the Gordian knot in obesity research remain. While important to discussions about stigma and medicalization of fat, this dissertation is not a study of scientific controversy or claims made around the science of obesity in and of itself. For important work that contests claims between body size, fat composition, weight, measurements like body mass index, and health and illness, see Campos (2004), Guthman (2011), and Saguy (2013). concentrations of an individual chemical ranged from 25 to 100%; the average was 93%, and 29 of 36 [chemical analytes] were detected in more than 90% of children\" (Hendryx & Luo, 2017, p. 5336). Together, these data suggest that we are all environmentally constituted by chemical exposures; some of which are known to be harmful. Fire retardants, BPA, and polymers, for instance, are widely believed to affect metabolism and reproduction because of their impact on hormone sensitive organs, including adipose (fat) tissue, skeletal muscle, the liver, pancreas, hypothalamus, and reproductive organs (McAllister et al., 2009). As a result, obesity researchers have begun to consider the physiological functioning of social nature. Observers of both health trends-rates of obesity and chemical exposure-suggest that the two are linked (Gr\u00fcn & Blumberg, 2009a;Gore et al., 2015;Holtcamp, 2012;Landecker, 2011;Janesick & Blumberg, 2011Guthman, 2012). In contrast to thinking solely about obesity as a result of an imbalance of energy expenditure (too many calories, too little exercise), researchers in disparate but overlapping scientific disciplines believe that the two phenomena are related in what might be called an environmental turn in obesity studies. In short, the chemical environment is making us fat and metabolically sick. Concepts such as the \"obesogen\" (Gr\u00fcn & Blumberg, 2009b) and the \"exposome\" (Wild, 2005(Wild, , 2012, both of which emphasize environmental determinants of health, now appear in journals such as Nature, Environmental Health Perspectives, and Obstetrics and Gynecology. In 2011, grants issued by the National Institute of Environmental Health Science added obesity as a new health endpoint in studies that associate early-life exposure with later-life disease and the \"propagation of non-communicable disease across the lifespan\" (Haugen, Schug, Collman, & Heindel, 2014). Today, it is more widely acknowledged across seemingly disparate biomedical fields (e.g., cancer, neurology, reproductive health) and in site-specific sites and practices (e.g., clinical, laboratory, public health) that \"the\" environment is a key factor in understanding contemporary biology and illnesses associated with 21 st century life. For example, Siroux, Agier, and Slama in their 2016 review of the exposome concept noted that the \"number of citations of 'exposome' in PubMed has increased over recent years; from six in 2005 to 150 in 2010 and > 1600 in 2015,\" marking a shift in attention to the neglected half of gene-environment studies (p. studies, such as this, could be described as illustrations of the physiological functioning of social nature in which environmental exposures delivered at different times and in different ways throughout the life course (even beginning with the germ line and therefore before conception) are found to affect biological processes. According to Felix Gr\u00fcn and Bruce Blumberg (2009), exposure to BPA may in fact predispose people to weight gain \"despite normal diet and exercise\" (p. 1128). In an article on the plurality of obesity across species, Yann Klimentidis et al. (2011) found that domestic and feral animals living in industrial environments alongside humans have grown fatter over the past few decades. This same study also found that laboratory animals, despite living their entire lives in highly regulated institutional settings, are also getting heavier. Even babies seem to be affected. According to Ogden, Carroll, Kit, & Flegal (2012), the heavy weight prevalence for infants from birth to six months of age also has risen since the 1970s, but no one is suggesting that newborns are lazy couch potatoes. 2 At the heart of environmental studies of obesity lies the question of how exactly, at the molecular level, chemicals enter the body and disrupt physiological systems. Disruptions, it is thought, lead to multiple physiological alterations that include adipogenesis (development of fat cells from stem cells), lipogenesis (formation of fatty acids that affects triglycerides, which are key constituents of fat cells), and appetite-satiety pathways (among sets of neurons) located in a small region of the hypothalamus. The environmental turn in obesity also argues that timing of nutritional and chemical exposure matters for long-term health. Research from epidemiology, endocrinology, and perinatology shows that exposure during uterine and neonatal life, in particular, affects offspring's health into adulthood; essentially programming children for ill health in later life (Hales & Barker, 1992;Barker, 1998;Nathanielsz, 1999;Gluckman, Hanson, Cooper, & Thornburg, 2008). The theory of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (Developmental Origins) argues that epigenetic mechanisms (modifications of genetic expression without changing genetic sequence) caused by environmental insults during fetal and neonatal life can permanently alter organs. As applied to obesity and metabolic syndrome, Developmental Origins predicts that nutritional and chemical exposure in utero acts epigenetically, leading to an increase and dysfunction of fat mass, glucose intolerance, enhanced appetite, and other obese phenotypes. 2 There is no recommended definition of obesity for children less than two. Excess weight is measured by the CDC as \"weight for recumbent length at or above the 95th percentile\" on sexspecific, weight for recumbent length growth charts. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4770258/. In 2000, the CDC revised the 1977 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Growth Charts for infants, young children and adolescents in use since then. See https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_11/sr11_246.pdf It is because of these profound shifts in the environmental problematizing of obesity through a maternal-fetal framework that I designed an ethnographic study focused on a laboratory site I call University Laboratory (Lab). The Lab is a basic science research laboratory that uses animal models to experimentally study the effects of a maternal high-fat diet and maternal BPA on the health of rodent offspring. I follow the \"ontological politics\" of how \"bodies are shaped, and lives are pushed and pulled into one shape or another\" within the environmental epigenetics of obesity through maternal-fetal medicine (Mol, 2002, p. viii). At the intersection of obesity, gender, and the environment, researchers at the Lab enumerate the social facets of physiological functioning; opening new avenues of causal explanation as to how and why obesity and metabolic syndrome occurs, and how it may persist across generations. Work at the Lab, therefore, provides a \"window on the ways that environmentally defined subjects are constituted through biomedical knowledge and politics\" around the problematic of obesity (Olson, 2010, p. 171). For sociologists, studying the embodiment of presumptively harmful environmental exposure and its unequal distribution is important for numerous reasons, including a refined understanding of how new patterns of stratified health emerge and reproduce modes of social stratification (Landecker & Panofsky, 2013). For both life and social scientists, a focus on \"milieu\" (Olson, 2010) in the postgenomic era is a focus not on life per se, but on geneenvironment interactions as the relevant place of power-laden interventions. As a result of this scientific-medical paradigm, the logic and practice of environmental epigenetics and Developmental Origins create a new round of politics of reproduction, but one that is thoroughly environmental (Ginsburg & Rapp, 1991). Environmental epigenetics shifts what is perceptible across bodies in space (multiple environs) and time (multiple lifespans) and, therefore, what can be medically managed. Pregnancy and lactation are central sites of investigation at the Lab and they are also proposed sites of medical intervention for humans. As I will show, pregnancy has explicitly become an anticipatory site of medical intervention among Developmental Origins researchers. Such a \"regime of perceptibility\" in obesity research refigures both definitions and relations between bodies, the environment, and the life course (Murphy, 2006, p. 24). New forms of surveillance emerge and are expressed through the language of epigenetic risk and the governance of life through maternal responsibility. What is at stake in this model is not an isolated biomedical subject, but rather the \"vital technical aspects of milieus\" that constitute our very being (Olson, 2010, pp. 180-181). Our bodies are altered by everyday exposures. What begins as an ambient source of exposure becomes internalized; affecting fetal development through the maternal-fetal interface and creating, in essence, an intergenerational and environmental model of health 3 (Wells, 2010;Landecker & Panofsky, 2013). According to one obesity researcher: If this [developmental programming] is true, it's hugely important because it means that if we get pregnancy right, we have the opportunity to get that person's later life health in good shape and, conversely, if it goes wrong, that person is destined for later life illhealth. (Anonymous, personal communication, March, 2015) To  influences the kinds of research questions PIs pursue, but those carrying out the experimental research today are very likely technical staff and students, approximately half of whom are recent immigrants. This means, therefore, that not only is funding precarity built into the doing of science itself but so is political precarity of foreign scientists who are dependent on visas for their livelihood. In this sense, the work of producing laboratory knowledge is characterized by attributes historically associated with so-called women's work, namely insecurity, low pay, and low status (Oksala, 2016). Therefore, in addition to showing how the Lab produces environmental models of obesity, and therefore medical models of environmental subjecthood, I argue that investigators and technicians in the Lab are differently bounded by larger political-economic forces that are relatively invisible and that this affects how laboratory science is produced. Precarity in grantbased funding and immigration status affects one's occupational positioning within the Lab and, I will argue, the content and course of knowledge production. For temporary technicians, in particular, there is a drive to produce positive findings in keeping with \"normal science\" (Kuhn, 2012), while for career technicians there is a drive to assist PIs in pushing existing \"experimental systems\" (Rheinberger, 1997)  What I have found is that various forms of labor braid together at my research site, and, based on data collected by various national agencies on biomedicine funding and the biomedical workforce, my findings are not idiosyncratic. Therefore, this dissertation is a case study of how the political economy of laboratory fact making, in the context of the obesity crisis, shapes new obesity knowledge (Ragin & Becker, 1992). Structural forces shape what technicians and investigators learn to care for and about (i.e., specific tissues and specific regulatory systems that regulate appetite) in terms of creating new knowledge. First, technicians at the Lab engage in anticipatory caretaking practices, a form of labor that is shaped by whether one is a temporary technician or a career technician. Technicians differently perform the embodied labor necessary to \"having a feeling for the organism\" in the production of laboratory facts (Keller, 1983). I use the notion of anticipatory caretaking practices to characterize the persistent sense of anxiety among technicians and investigators in terms of grant renewals, publications, and precarity in visa status. Caretaking, I argue, has situated meaning that varies by one's social location in the Lab's division of labor (M\u00fcller & Kenney, 2014). In particular, career technicians learn to care for the Lab's experimental systems (Rheinberger, 1997) in such a way that they are able to explore novel explanatory models of obesity while temporary technicians, on the other hand, are compelled to re-produce \"normal science\" (Kuhn, 2012). Second, as a result of experimental practices, I also argue that the biological labor of animal bodies is made to perform differently and, as a result, is a source of economic and reputational value for the Lab in what Donna Haraway (2008) refers to as a \"biomedical mode of reproduction.\" Third, I find that PIs labor in offices reproducing their livelihood and the Lab itself through anticipatory caretaking practices at the level of inscription (writing) practices. PIs work at an arm's length from experimental practice; raising questions anew about what constitutes the vocation of \"scientist\" and who gets to claim that identity when it is technicians who generate raw data. In summary, a confluence of disparate factors-the national problematic of obesity, a concomitant growth in data on environmental exposure, a highly competitive and precarious 13 grant-based funding landscape, and the reliance on a low-cost yet politically entangled workforce that consists of recent immigrant scientists-coalesce in the Lab to create specific kinds of laboratory facts about obesity. That is why this dissertation examines 'who' produces the 'what' of obesity knowledge in the process of producing an environmental politics of obesity and metabolic syndrome through the framework of Developmental Origins and epigenetics. The intersection of contemporary laboratory life with the obesity epidemic helps reveal less visible forms of labor that are necessary to basic science research. It helps reveal who is in the biomedical workforce as part of the larger scientific-medical pipeline and how, I have found, this has epistemic effects on what kinds of empirical questions are asked and, therefore, what knowledge is put out into the world. The process of creating new laboratory knowledge, then, involves multiple moving parts. I borrow a concept from anatomy to illustrate their interdependence. A 'point of articulation' connects two or more bones that allows motion, and these points of articulation that link together various aspects of laboratory labor include: a) anticipatory caretaking practices by technicians as they both create and extend the Lab's existing experimental systems (Rheinberger, 1997) that is discussed in chapter 2; b) the labor of biomass, i.e., animal models, necessary to constructing environmental subjecthood through the creation of valuable data (presented in chapter 3); and c) the anticipatory writing practices of PIs, which are necessary to advance novel theories of maternal/fetal disease transmission in a larger political economy of research funding (discussed in chapter 4). In a turn toward the environmental problematizing of obesity, I argue that these forms of labor link the strategic relations of scientific work in a 21 st century laboratory to wider social practices and values about health and disease (Landecker, 2007). 14 In the pages that follow, I first detail current definitions of obesity and its prevalence across demographic groups. I also document early models of biological determinism in obesity research and incorporate more contemporary challenges that support an environmental science of obesity through the lens of epigenetics and Developmental Origins programming. I then situate this study in an interdisciplinary theoretical framework that builds on laboratory studies, sociology of work, gender, and medical sociology. Within each discipline, I place an emphasis on anticipatory caretaking practices because they affect the final work product that contributes to the obesity knowledge market. In doing so, I highlight what has been described as the \"back room\" of science, which to me seems very much like the front room (Barley & Bechky, 1994). Lastly, I describe my methodological approach in the study and conclude with an overview of the dissertation chapters."}, {"section_title": "Obesity and Developmental Origins of Health and Disease", "text": "The scientific and cultural context of my dissertation research is the so-called obesity epidemic (Saguy, 2013). According to the CDC, obesity is measured in reference to body mass index (BMI), which is \"calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters\" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015, para. 2). 5 Based on these measurements, roughly one-third of American adults are obese, and approximately seventeen percent of children between two and nineteen years old are classified obese (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2016). An estimated ten percent of children aged two to five are considered obese and, while obesity is not defined for children less than two, pediatric growth charts exist to track weight relative to recumbent length (Ogden et al., 2014;Ogden et al., 2015). Obesity rates also vary across categories defined by income, gender, race, ethnicity, education, and geographical location. In general, those with lower levels of education and income are more inclined to be obese or overweight relative to those with higher levels of education and income. In terms of race and ethnicity adjusted for age, non-Hispanic African Americans and Hispanics have the highest rates of obesity followed by non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic Asians. Whereas no sex difference in prevalence was found among youth in the 2015 National Center for Health Statistics Data Brief, the prevalence for adult women is higher than men (National Center for Health Statistics, 2016). Obesity is of such centrality to biomedical research because of the epidemiological links that are drawn between BMI or waist circumference and a wide rage of health outcomes. Obese women are at greater risk for irregular menstrual cycles, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and therefore infertility (Jungheim, Travieso, & Hopeman, 2013). Overall, between 1980 and obesity rates rose, and doubled among adults aged twenty and over, leveling off since approximately 2010 (Ogden, Carroll, & Curtin, 2006). Although prevalence rates for children tripled from 1980-2002, they have remained stable from 2003-2014 (Ogden et al., 2016). In spite of a recent leveling off of trends, the historical rise over the past several decades has meant childhood rates remain a priority for public health officials. The conventional understanding of obesity is an excess of calories relative to energy expenditure. The CDC, however, recognizes there are multifactorial causes of adult and childhood obesity and the key contributors are categorized as either behavior or genetics. \"Behaviors can include dietary patterns, physical activity, inactivity, medication use, and other exposures. Additional contributing factors in our society include the food and physical activity environment, education and skills, and food marketing in promotion\" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017, para. 1). Excess fat matters because \"it is associated with poorer mental health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and the leading causes of death in the U.S. and worldwide, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer\" (para. 2). Early challenges to conventional wisdom on obesity. Early obesity researchers suspected a deterministic role for genes and hormones in adipogenesis. 6 This history is important for sketching out the current landscape because in 1949, for example, researchers at The Jackson Laboratory observed \"some very plump\" mice among a stock of littermates (Ingalls, Dickie, & Snell, 1950, p. 318). After breeding offspring of heterozygote mice (individuals that have two different alleles of a particular gene who can therefore reproduce genetic variability in pups), the ratio of fat to lean mice suggested to researchers that a genetic mutation caused some of the offspring to be fat. At another East Coast laboratory, the wife-husband team of Lois and Theodore Zucker (1961) identified a new fatty mutation in a stock of laboratory rats in 1961. 7 Like the earlier mice discovery, Zuckers' fatty rats appeared \"spontaneously,\" and the researchers theorized that an \"obviously deranged lipid metabolism\" had caused the obesity (p. 275, 277). They also stated \"they were genetically obese rats that inherited their obesity as an autosomal recessive trait. Weak willpower was clearly not the reason why these rats were fat-it was something in their genes\" (Bray, 2015, p. 10-11). Dr. Edwin B. Astwood (a prominent clinician, researcher, and friend of the Zuckers) was so intrigued by these findings, which suggested a \"deranged 6 Adipose means fat. Adipogenesis is the study of fat cell differentiation, specifically how preadipocytes (uncommitted cells) become adipocytes (committed cells that store fat). This is important to know because deleterious changes in hormones, for example, can commit preadipoctye cells to become adipocytes; therefore, increasing one's fat cells. High-fat food and stress, social factors, can become embodied and, therefore, affect cell differentiation; a process in which the social becomes biological. metabolism,\" that he gave his 1962 Presidential Address to the Endocrine Society on the topic. On the Heritage of Corpulence, he argued, When obesity has arisen in animals as a consequence of inbreeding or from chance mutation, something about the mode of inheritance can be deduced, but in man the [wrong-headed] conviction of the 'primacy of gluttony' has discouraged genetic investigation, and our information is scant indeed. (p. 338) Dr. Astwood wondered: Why are scientists content to ascribe height and other phenotypes to inheritance but not obesity? As if to further convince his audience of the biological basis of obesity, he recalled a historical account of doctor-patient medical interaction from 1825 in which the patient describes his misery: Sir I have followed your prescription as if my life depended on it, and I have ascertained that during this month I have lost some three pounds, or a little more. But in order to reach this result, I have been obliged to do such violence to all my tastes and all my habits-in a word, I have suffered so much-that while giving you my best thanks for your kind directions, I renounce any advantages from them and throw myself for the future entirely into the hands of Providence! (as cited in Astwood, 1962, p. 341) Dr. Astwood not only encouraged genetic investigation, he also proposed the novel idea at the time that obesity does not result from a lack of will-power but rather it results from the consequence of \"inherited [metabolic] defects [in enzymes]; [and, he concluded] if this be so and we like food, we might as well eat up and be happy\" (p. 337). People who are fat are born fat, he and others argued, and \"nothing much can be done about it\" (p. 337). Early examples such as this contradicted the personal blame theory of obesity and nurtured a more biologically deterministic approach to obesity studies. In the mid-1990s, Jeffrey Friedman, a researcher at The Rockefeller University in New York, discovered that mice missing a gene (due to a genetic mutation) become fat in its absence. He named this gene, ob, and stated that it normally produces a protein (leptin) that signals the brain to know when fat cells are satisfied. In its absence, the biochemical receptor of that message is not created, and hunger is not inhibited (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, 2008). Of particular significance to the topic of this dissertation is the intersection of research on metabolic disorders and the rise of a new lifespan model for thinking about chronic adult disease. So while American researchers were stumbling upon mutant fatty rodents, and eventually identifying aspects of biologically determined obesity and diabetes, a British epidemiologist named David Barker was rummaging birth records across the South of England and Wales based on a suspicion that babies with low birth weights were associated with poor cardiovascular health in adulthood and early mortality rates; creating in effect a lifespan model of obesity. During his tenure at the Medical Research Center Environmental Epidemiology Unit in the 1980s, Barker observed that county maps of the United Kingdom in the 1910s and 1920s showed strong geographical correlations between place and weight of birth and cardiovascular mortalities. Later, in 1986, Barker and Osmond argued that death rates and chronic conditions like ischemic heart disease (heart problems caused by narrow heart arteries) were associated with \"poor nutrition in early life\" because it \"increases susceptibility to the effects of an affluent [high fat] diet\" (p.1077). In 1995, at the same time Friedman had identified the ob and db genes, Barker was the first to formally articulate the \"fetal origins hypothesis.\" His original model \"states that fetal under-nutrition in middle to late gestation\u2026 leads to disproportionate fetal growth [catch up growth that leads to heavier weights and] programmes later coronary heart disease\" (1995, p. 171). Barker's findings led to \"the initially controversial but now widely accepted idea that common chronic illnesses such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes result not always from bad genes and an unhealthy lifestyle, but from poor intrauterine and early postnatal health\" (The Guardian, 2013, para.1). As with earlier findings among American researchers on the genetics of obesity, the Barker Hypothesis, as it was initially called, similarly challenged conventional wisdom about causes of obesity. Rather than disparaging people for bad habits, Barker hypothesized that a mother's poor nutritional environment programs fetal tissues and organs in such a way that offspring are destined to have deleterious long-term health effects, including increased adiposity, insulin resistance, and the risk of cardiovascular disease. The key therefore to creating healthier people is to ensure good nutrition for women, particularly those of reproductive age and women in lower socio-economic groups who tended to have smaller babies for gestational age. Early calls for nutritional intervention based on epidemiological findings continue to be found today amongst experimental researchers, including those at the Lab. Food is both exposure and an explicit source of intervention on women (Landecker, 2011). Contemporary moves toward a developmental model of obesity. The cultural and scientific popularity of obesity today is such that the New York Times ran a series on the Science of Fat in the summer of 2016. In one article, science writer Gina Kolata contextualized obesity research in a popular reality television show, the Biggest Loser. 8 Based on the idea that the contestant who loses the most amount of weight on the show wins the competition, Kolata interviewed contestants to see how they were faring nearly six years after having participated on the show. While initial weight loss was truly impressive, what was newsworthy was the fact that so many individuals not only gained back their original weight but had gained even more weight back in spite of continued exercise and calorie restriction. One winning contestant declared, \"I won't be victim to this. It's the hand I've been dealt\" (Kolata, 2016, para. 8). Like the patient from 1825 quoted above in Dr. Astwood's account of the biological basis of obesity, contestants on the Biggest Loser acknowledge that \"it's the hand\" they have been dealt, and they are subject to the mercy of \"Providence.\" The Providence, or bad luck in all of this, appears to be metabolism and leptin's role in regulating sense of fullness or hunger, as Jeffrey Friedman had earlier shown. Fothergill et al. (2016) studied the Biggest Loser's participants and found that, after significant weight loss, contestants had a lower resting metabolism that was slower relative to someone of equal weight who had not dieted. This, in turn, required contestants to exercise more and eat fewer calories just to maintain their new weight relative to someone who had not dieted. Kevin Hall, an NIH researcher and coauthor of the study mentioned above, also found that leptin levels dropped significantly such that the contestants had an increased urge to eat, supporting accounts of how people who diet disproportionality suffer cravings for food. Contestants of the Biggest Loser appear to be \"working against their own biology\" (Kolata, 2016, para. 15). The scientific popularity of obesity draws in researchers from a variety of fields (perinatologists, geneticists, epidemiologists, endocrinologists, physiologists) using different methods and datasets (natural and laboratory experiments, retrospective and prospective studies). In order to build on Barker's early work and to hew in like-minded researchers into a more organized field, scholars convened at a global congress and created an academic society known today as the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (Developmental Origins) in 2003. While obesity or metabolic conditions are not the only adult conditions captured under the umbrella of Developmental Origins, they have played a central part in its conceptualization. Underlying the current paradigm is an evolutionary approach to understand chronic, noncontagious diseases like obesity and Type-2 diabetes. Researchers in this paradigm study developmental (timing of exposure) effects, programming effects, and the question of persistence across generations. 9 As is the case in the laboratory I did fieldwork in, beyond studying \"immediate homeostatic responses\" to uterine life, researchers today seek to understand how \"the developing organism may make predictive adaptive response of no immediate advantage but with long-term consequences\" across lifespans (Gluckman & Hanson, 2004, p. 311). Developmental Origins seeks to understand the \"persistence of such mechanisms [biological processes] in humans who now live in very different environments from those within which they evolved\" (p. 311). For example, the \"thrifty phenotype\" hypothesis proposed by Hales and Barker (1992) posits that under-or malnutrition in utero causes the fetus and young infant to be nutritionally thrifty, which confers an advantage if the child grows up in similarly constrained nutritional environment. 10 If, however, the thrifty fetus lives in a world of caloric abundance, she is no longer optimally adapted to the environment because of changes in glucose-insulin metabolism established during fetal life. According to Hales and Barker (2001), \"these changes include reduced capacity for 9 Although horrific famines were inflicted by on millions of Europeans and Russians during World War Two, detailed record keeping by the Dutch during the \"Winter Famine\" has been particularly relevant to the conceptual growth of fetal programming over the twentieth century. Data from the famine demonstrated the negative effects of a poor maternal nutrition environment (not to mention stress) on miscarriages, birth weights, and adult illnesses of those who survived (Buklijas, 2013). Following the war, British researchers conducted experimental work on animals that mimicked food shortages experienced during the war. Their findings generated the idea of \"sensitive\" or \"critical windows\" of development, underscoring the idea of genetic malleability in contrast to the determinism of early 20 th century genetics (Burger, Drummond, Sandstead,& Netherlands,1948;McCance & Widdowson, 1974;Ravelli, Stein, & Susser, 1976)."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "insulin secretion and insulin resistance which, combined with effects of obesity, ageing and physical inactivity, are the most important factors in determining type 2 diabetes\" (p. 5). As disease patterns associated with industrialization and urbanization have shifted over the course of the 20 th century from contagions to chronic illnesses like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, Developmental Origins reflects a historically specific reading of the biosocial landscape in health and disease (Nash, 2006). Developmental Origins thus demonstrates what environmental historians might call an interpretation of a \"biosocial landscape\" of health and illness (Nash, 2006). More recently, the thrifty phenotype hypothesis has been supplemented by a hypothesis that allows for more flexibility in the developmental model of disease: the \"predictive adaptive response\" (Bateson, Gluckman, & Hanson, 2014), which was suggested as a resolution to some contradictory findings in early fetal origins research. An adaptive response conceptually allows for multiple developmental pathways. Specifically, the traditional concerns of the effects that malnutrition or stress in fetal life have over adult health are still mismatched in an obesogenic environment. However, the second pathway of \"maternal obesity, gestational diabetes, and infant overfeeding\" can be \"interpreted as novel exposures\" that still induce \"long-term effects through alternative mechanisms including the adipogenic [fat making] effect of fetal hyperinsulinemia [excess insulin relative to glucose, a symptom of type-2 diabetes]\" (Gluckman, Buklijas, & Hanson, 2016, p. 7). Obesity researcher Dr. Kevin Hall offers a metaphor of the body that is helpful to understand a proposed adaptive response to obesity. He analogizes the body to a flex-fuel engine: The human body is like a 'flex-fuel' car engine: you can throw in diesel one day, regular gas the next day, ethanol the day after\u2026But the body is even more complex, because there is no fuel tank-we are built out of fuel, with each cell a miniature engine constantly turning over its components and all functioning surprisingly well despite enormous variations in diet. (National Institutes of Health,n.d,para. 8) Dr. Hall's metaphor illustrates an early limitation of the Barker Hypothesis, namely that flexibility or plasticity of the body and disease were yet to be incorporated into fetal origins of disease. Hall's imagery of cells working as a \"miniature engine\" suggests both that cells are conceptualized as technologies and that the food we eat is fuel for our technological selves (National Institutes of Health, n.d, para. 8;Landecker, 2011 With the mapping of the human genome at the dawn of the 21 st century and failure of population level genetic explanations to interpret variations in disease, epigenetics offered a framework for Developmental Origins researchers to study mechanisms of change at the molecular level. Epigenetics, first defined by Conrad Waddington in 1942, is presently defined as \"the study of changes in gene function that are mitotically and/or meiotically heritable and that do not entail a change in DNA sequence\" (Wu & Morris 2001, p.1103. Waddington argued that \"preformation and epigenesis [two views of embryonic development at the time] could be complementary, with preformation representing the static nature of the gene and epigenesis representing the dynamic nature of gene expression\" (as cited in Deans & Maggert, 2015, p. 887-889). In 2012, Waddington suggested that \"between genotype and phenotype, and connecting them to each other, there lies a whole complex of developmental processes\" which he termed the \"epigenotype\" (Waddington, 2012, p. 10). From a Developmental Origins perspective, epigenetics helps explain long-term effects of DNA methylation and histone modification resulting from early life exposures to environmental sources of nutrition, stress, pollution, pharmaceuticals, and chemical toxins on adult health outcomes. Sciences like that of Developmental Origins and epigenetics resonate with contemporary anxieties around the increase in obesity as well as renewed interests in environmental and heritable determinants of health. In early 2015, for instance, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's (NASEM) Roundtable on Environmental Health Sciences, Research, and Medicine held a workshop to explore the role that chemical exposure might play in the development of obesity. Committee sessions were organized around the \"life span, possible biological pathways and environmental influences, [including the] effects of food additives and antibiotics\u2026on \"increased of weight gain, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and aspects of metabolic syndrome in animal models and human studies\" (NASEM, 2015, p. 139). A post-industrial chemical climate points to the concept of an obesogenic environment from which no one is particularly immune. The concept of \"obesogen\" refers to \"chemicals that inappropriately alter lipid homeostasis to promote adipogenesis and lipid accumulation\" (Grun & Blumberg, 2009, p. 1128. In non-medical terms, obesogens are \"dietary, pharmaceutical, and industrial compounds that may alter metabolic processes and predispose some people to gain weight,\" and also high blood pressure and excess cholesterol (Holtcamp, 2012, A63). Much attention is given to bisphenol-A (BPA) because it is the most abundantly produced chemical in the U.S., at around 15 billion pounds per year as of 2013 (vom Saal & Welshons, 2014). It is also an example of an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) that interferes with hormone action. As researchers study obesity through the lens of obesogens, they explicitly create a formal link between bodies and environments, tracing \"a 'return' of environment and milieu to the center of biomedical theory and research\" (Olson, 2010, p. 172-173). It is within the sciences of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease and epigenetics that I explore how laboratory facts about obesity are produced through imbricated forms of labor specific to contemporary lab life. As described above, the production of new obesity knowledge relies on several forms of labor, or points of articulation, in daily laboratory life. These sources of labor include technicians' anticipatory caretaking practices at the wet bench, the biological labor of biomass in the production of an environmental subject in obesity research, and principal investigators' anticipatory caretaking practices which are circumscribed by the NIH's call for research applications. Because the model of Developmental Origins is situated in theories of causation during uterine life, transformations to the scientific understanding of fetal and maternal life pose unique implications for the renewed surveillance of maternal-fetal exchange. Consequently, Developmental Origins science produces not only new knowledge about obesity but also an environmental biopolitics of reproduction and a medical subject that is environmentally constituted (Ginsburg & Rapp, 1991;Waldby & Cooper, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Framework -The Environmental Biopolitics of Reproduction and Medical Subjecthood", "text": "Feminist technoscience studies is \"a relentlessly transdisciplinary field of research\" that demonstrates ways in which gender \"is entangled in natural, medical, and technical sciences\" (Asberg & Lykka, p. 299). 11 As with science and technology studies (STS) more generally, basic science research is seen \"as entangled in societal interests\u2026as [are] the technological practices and interventions to which it may give rise\" (p. 299). This literature intersects gender and science and is useful to this project in two ways. First, in my fieldwork site, women perform the majority of labor; a fact that is historically and contextually shaped by the connection of Developmental Origins to the field of obstetrics and gynecology, and developmental studies in general. Additionally, this perspective is useful to understand how laboratory work itself is gendered. Laboratory labor performed by technicians (both career and temporary) working in the wet lab is characterized by political and economic precarity, low-pay, low status, and therefore vulnerability; all of which are attributes typically found in so-called women's work (Oksala, 2016). My ethnographic work was designed and analyzed around the following principles: First, I draw on work in the STS tradition around laboratory fact making with a particular focus on how labor itself is conceptualized, i.e., what constitutes labor in the early 21 st century. Whereas previous scholars have clearly delineated social forces involved in the making of facts, few have studied different kinds of labor that go into the social production of experimental laboratory facts. This matters for a broad range of questions around who counts as a scientist, the politics of authorship and, particularly in my study, how the landscape of financial and political precarity enters into experimental designs to shape what is known about obesity in the Developmental Origins framework. Second, building on studies of biopolitics and (bio-)medicalization in social theory and medical sociology, I show how \"life itself\" (Rose, 2006)  From each literature, I highlight key \"sensitizing concepts\" and methodological orientations that help inform the dissertation because they provide an initial way of \"seeing, organizing, and understanding experience\" at my research sites (Blumer, 1954, p. 7;Charmaz, 2003, p. 259). My dissertation builds on these literatures to argue that material and conceptual biomedical labor specific to Developmental Origins and epigenetics produce new biomedical subjecthood at the intersections of body and environment."}, {"section_title": "STS: Laboratory labor and scientists in action. In their seminal study Laboratory", "text": "Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts, Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar (1979) rejected common notions that the work of doing science was somehow outside of human influence and that 'what's really out there' simply waits to be discovered through valid intellectual and empirical design. Rather, they approached the work of doing science as one might approach any workplace, affording no special status to scientists or science. Because of their refusal to accept received wisdom about scientists or science, they were able to demonstrate \"how decisions about the credibility of knowledge claims and methods involve a mix of social and technical factors\" (Hess, 2001, p. 234-235). Texts, technologies, and animals, for example, all contribute to the circulation and production of laboratory facts alongside their human counterparts. These \"actants\" work together in myriad ways to ultimately produce literary inscriptions that may (or may not) become stabilized as facts through \"trials of strength,\"i.e., the resistance and endurance of a finding in relation to competing hypotheses that can, over time, come to be settled as 'fact' (Latour, 1987, p. 84-89;Callon, 1986;Bennett, 2010). Latour and Woolgar adopted a position of \"anthropological strangeness\" in their ethnographic observations of \"routine work\" at a neuroendocrinology laboratory (1979, p. 27). By focusing on processes of transcription (the work of inscription machines and translation), they traced the so-called facticity stages of a molecule's life as it travels from a state of fiction to non-fiction, or fact, within a knowledge network (p. 107-108). Scientific papers, texts typically deemed most free of human influence, are the most social. For example, Michael Lynch (1985) observed a neuroscience lab, capitalizing on unusual findings and disagreements to demonstrate the role of interactional processes on the accomplishment of scientific sense making. In their work on colloid chemistry, Michael Zenzen and Sal Restivo (1982) argued that anomalies or \"contingencies (social and otherwise) do not simply affect the course of scientific work\u2026rather they are an integral part of that work\" (p. 448-465). Contingencies in the colloid lab, for example, include the researchers' specific background knowledge, the type of equipment available, the degree of funding as abundance or scarcity, social organization of the lab, and the degree of respect among researchers. Variations in these contingencies \"form an interlocking structure\" that is \"inseparable\" from \"'the research itself'\" (p. 465). Such ethnographic accounting of laboratory fact making led to a growth in science studies that emphasized how social forces are at work in the lab without having to appeal to or take sides in epistemological arguments about 'what is really out there'. Science is a cultural practice these authors argued, and literature in this tradition is characterized by\u2026 the way in which concerns with evidence and consistency were interwoven with situationally contingent events, local decision-making processes, negotiation among a core set of actors in a controversy, the interpretive flexibility of evidence, additions and deletions of rhetorical markers (modalities) to knowledge claims, and other social or nontechnical factors that shape the outcome of what comes to be constituted accepted knowledge and methods in a field. (Hess, 2001, p. 234) While at my fieldsite, I used these ideas of how local, social, and \"nontechnical factors\" like political and economic precarity shape experimental questions and therefore \"subject natural conditions [e.g., animal physiology] to a \"'social overhaul'\" that leads to particular epistemic outcomes for obesity knowledge (Knorr-Cetina, 1999, p. 28-29). Such a focus illustrates, in part, what Hannah Landecker (2016) shows in her analysis of how one experimental animal, the agouti mouse, shifted from a model organism of coat color for geneticists to a model organism of adiposity for epigeneticists (and others) because of rising interests in metabolic disorders (p. 92). Epistemic effects were derived from a new situation: although plump agouti mice had existed, it was not until researchers became interested in obesity that the mouse became fat and a model for human disease. In a related example, Nicole Nelson (2013) has shown how anxiety researchers working with a mice model construct, or scaffold, facticity about human disease by \"reconfiguring the evidence\" to support (or inhibit) claims about a particular human disorder (p.3). Again, new epistemic effects are born out of the work of doing science. Experimental methods, which are often presumed to be immune to outside forces of human interaction, are anything but that. By moving ethnographically into the realms of scientific work, ethnographers of science throw into question perceptions and enactments of methods, rationale, and ultimately scientific epistemology. Similarly, I approach science as a practice at a site where scientists grapple with understandings as to how cells, tissues, and organs can be permanently programmed in very early life to produce specific adult phenotypes. Like Latour and Woolgar's study of molecule TRF at the Salk Institute, I am interested in \"how, where, and why\" Developmental Origins facts are created and \"how [their] endurance obtains 'in situ'\" through scientists' practices (1979, p. 127). Additionally, I consider the larger effects of economic and political precarity on the Lab's division of labor and how this affects the course and content of knowledge production. Although Latour and Woolgar describe the laboratory workforce as consisting of doctors or scientists who occupy one space in the lab and technicians and secretaries who occupy another, little attention is paid to the everyday work of technicians. Throughout their study, which includes attention to the microprocessing of facts, macro controversies and settlements in scientific fields as well as cycles of credibility, the focus is almost exclusively on doctors. For this reason, Laboratory Life reflects a \"studying up\" of how facts are made (Nader, 1972). While \"everybody is made to give a hand\" in a working lab, if we want to understand how \"reality\" is the consequence of debate rather than its cause in Developmental Origins of obesity, we ought to follow the minutiae of debates, the everyday handling and tinkering of technicians, and the way their own positioning in the field enters into experimental questions (Latour, 1987, p. 182). In this dissertation, rather than asking how the mouse physiology translates into an inscription on paper and how doctors build trials of strength, I detail how the technicians' work of actually handling the animal translates into the finished knowledge product. My question, therefore, intervenes in an earlier moment in the process of translating and inscribing and necessarily focuses on the forms of labor technicians employ at the bench. Unlike the neuroendocrinology lab of Laboratory Life, scientists at the Lab are not physically present alongside the technicians, and are today quite removed from the everyday work of basic science research. Principal investigators may be better understood as managers, authors, and salesmen; a point Latour and Woolgar acknowledge in a description of their lab's \"group structure,\" but which has become heightened to the extent that today investigators are largely removed from the production of raw data (1979, pp. 221-223). Laboratory labor is a key element of this dissertation. I deploy Latour's (1987) rules and methods in Science in Action as a sensitizing orientation to detail forms of labor in a contemporary biomedical laboratory. Latour writes that to understand technoscience (\"all elements tied to the scientific contents\"), all actants and resources need accounting for (p. 174). By studying the \"activity of making science,\" then we can make the precarious \"recruitment drive\" visible (p. 174). What I add to this picture has emerged since Latour wrote these classic works: I detail the role of a precarious workforce-an imported, highly skilled technical workforce-who produces virtually all the raw data on which principal investigators depend. write for publication (more stringent definitions of intellectual integrity for publications vs. grant applications, grant-writing cycles, and choice in journals). That is, not only are facts produced for a market in obesity research, but the Lab also reproduces that very market and, in doing so, creates a particular maternal-fetal \"regime of perceptibility\" (Murphy, 2006) in the production of environmental biomedical subjecthood. In order to be competitive, lab researchers must argue the novelty and feasibility of their work while also claiming its translational potential for human subjects in terms of clinical and/or pharmacological interventions. These claims of scientific promise and interventions around obesity help shape and give rise to the possibilities of new biomedical realities. Indeed, Latour (1983) argued that \"[m]icrobiology laboratories are one of the few places where the very 12 Soft-money is money that scientists have to be apply for, as with grants, and is usually offered in 1-5 year commitments. At University Lab, the PIs live and die by grants. Recently, a junior PI was asked to withhold her findings and name from grant applications because it was feared any association with her would jeopardize the \"group's\" chance of success. In other words, she was asked to forestall progress in her own career for the sake of the group's financial wellbeing. Without soft-money funding, this lab cannot even claim office or space to carry out its research. The hard realities of soft-money funding at the Lab appears to be typical of the precariousness of laboratory work across the country (see Barinaga, 2000). composition of the social context has been metamorphosed,\" and it is precisely where biomedicine gains its legitimacy and, therefore, power to govern (p. 158). Biopolitics. Because governance and disease are at the heart of my analysis, I must also briefly touch on the scholarly literature around biopolitics and (bio-)medicalization. Critical inquiry into relations between the biological and the social has run the course of the twentiethcentury, but it was the philosopher and historian Michel Foucault's (1978) analysis of power that provides, through the concept of \"biopolitics,\" ways to analyze emergent relations between the body, polity, and the modern state. Foucault (2003) argued that governance in a modern state is indirect since people follow norms of self-regulation. The modern state invokes its right \"to make live\" or to foster life via the health of the population (p. 241). Having co-evolved with neoliberal forms of social regulation with an emphasis on individual responsibility, biopolitics, according to what Thomas Lemke (a scholar of Foucault) said in an interview, reveals itself \"when [a] population emerges as an object for politics, as something that can be transformed, that can be optimised, on which one can intervene, [and] which can be used to achieve certain ends\" in varying ways (Baele, 2008, para. 10). According to the anthropologist Paul Rabinow and the sociologist Nikolas Rose (2006), biopolitics extends further to encompass \"all [of] the specific strategies and contestations over problematizations of collective human vitality, morbidity and mortality\" (pp.196-197). Rose (2007) and Lemke (2011) agree with that point of view. It is in the laboratory where health is problematized and strategies of intervention on the population are most acutely realized. Sarah Franklin (2006) argues that, The extent to which biomedical knowledge, biotechniques and biology 'itself' reshape each other, and co-evolve, may never before have been made so explicit as today, through the redesign of the biological in the context of bioscience, biomedicine and biotechnology. The rebuilding of 'life itself' in the laboratory is redefining the future of the environment, food, wealth and health and is consequently crucial to definitions of progress, social justice and power. (p. 168) In the framework of biopolitics, the management of \"life itself\" rests on self-regulation, knowledge of risk, and medical intervention (Rose, 2006). For example, in her gene-environment study of lead regulation, scientific work, and children's exposure, Sara Shostak (2013) demonstrates the cultural logic of self-regulation institutionalized within commerce, science, and regulatory agencies. She concludes that these logics constitute a biopolitical regime of scientific knowledge and political regulation. In the case of spina bifida, Salim Al-Gailani (2014) argues that \"political concern\" with the disorder in the United Kingdom in the 1970s \"stimulated\" medical research into the efficacy of folic acid (p. 286). Terming this historical outcome as a \"politics of risk reduction,\" Al-Gailiani argues that the clinical rationale for folic acid supplementation shifted in the post WWII years from concern with women's risk for anemia and problems of poverty and malnutrition to preventative, self-administered measures taken to protect the unborn fetus from birth defects. Likewise, maternal nutrition in David Barker's (1995) initial fetal origins research was proposed to help the growing fetus in particular, not the mother.  (Lapp\u00e9, 2014(Lapp\u00e9, , 2016. For example, a typical representation of \"effective\" temporal interventions in Developmental Origins research indicates the need for early intervention in order to positively impact later-life health. New scientific models of inheritance and medical models of intervention as shown above problematize the classic analytics of medicalization and biomedicalization, to which I now turn to below. Biomedicalization. Self-regulation and individual responsibility are central elements of biomedicalization; a framework Clarke, Shim, Mamo, Fosket, and Fishman (2003) proposed as successor to theories of medicalization which were first articulated by Irving Zola (1972Zola ( , 1991 as well as Peter Conrad and Joseph Schneider (1992). In a more recent iteration of biomedicalization, Clarke, Mamo, Fishman, and Shim (2010) argue that theories of medicalization focus on processes that exert \"control over\" social phenomena that had once lay outside the scope of medicine's domain, like premenstrual syndrome or alcoholism (p. 2). Through a process of medicalization, human conditions or behaviors defined as troublesome are transformed into medical illness, which are then subject to clinical intervention and regulation. Building on this perspective and to account for late 20 th century changes in \"technoscientific\" practices around the management of life, Clarke et al.(2010) define biomedicalization practices as \"transformations of\" the very same types of phenomena, including \"diseases, illnesses, injuries, and bodily malfunctions\" (p. 2). Whereas medicalization emphasizes an overt control of a condition or state of being defined as pathological, biomedicalization views medical science and biotechnologies as \"hidden instruments of social control so that a rational and selfdisciplining governance permeates society at various levels\" (Riska, 2010, p. 155 (M\u00fcller-Wille & Rheinberger, 2012). Today, we live in an era of scientific articulation about the relevance of \"maternal impressions\" for the future health of unborn children; ideas perhaps not as intensely pursued since the eighteenth century (Paul, 2010, p. 145). \"[E]veryone [remains] directly and vitally interested\" today in the objects of knowledge produced through the lens of postgenomic sciences; that interest is distinctly situated in maternal and fetal bodies in the context of environmental obesity research (Latour, 1987, p. 172). The anthropologists Faye Ginsburg and Rayna Rapp (1991) contend that a politics of reproduction entails the examination of \"multiple levels on which reproductive practices, policies, and politics so often depend\" (p. 313). Building on their concept, I detail throughout this dissertation how a gender politics inheres in Developmental Origins and epigenetics; how it stems from scientific discourse and practices of Developmental Origins experimental work at the local level and rises up through national and global policies found in American and international obesity and endocrine medical professions as well as in US public health and environmental agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. These levels of analyses reveal the \"many ways that power is both structured and enacted in everyday activities\" through the creation of an environmental subjecthood for reproductive women (Ginsburg & Rapp, 1991, p. 312). In her later work on the impact of amniocentesis on expectant women, Rapp (1999) studied the work of a laboratory to understand how diagnostic fact is produced. , cannot be bracketed out from life itself\" (Olson, 2010, p. 171). And as with space biomedicine, obesity and environmental exposures are \"dually problematized\" in Developmental Origins and epigenetics (p.171). Not only are women fundamentally environmental, rather than biological, the logic of postgenomic science suggests that we are all environmental. Finally, Olson's move provokes a reconsideration of Michel Foucault's (1978Foucault's ( , 1997 concept of biopolitics and Nikolas Rose's later extension of \"how modern forms of normality, health, and sickness come about as power and knowledge are invested in the basic processes of 'life itself'\" (Olson, 2010, p. 171). Olson's conceptual refinement \"ecobiopolitics\" is defined as follows: \"truth claims based on knowledge of milieu processes, power relations that take milieus as their object, and the modes of subjecthood and subjectification that designate subjects as milieu elements\" (p. 181). She indicates that a focus on \"milieu\" reflects a postgenomic era in which the focus is not on life per se but on \"milieu as the site of power-laden interventions\" (p. priorities, and, perhaps optimistically, the possibility for better environmental regulation (Ginsburg & Rapp, 1991;Canguilhem, 2001;Landecker, 2007Landecker, , 2010."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "This project received IRB approval in January, 2015, IRB#15-000006. I was also approved through the Lab's home institution to act as a Non-Compensated Employee beginning January 2015 through 2016. In order to investigate how and under what conditions environmental obesity facts are produced in a \"costly ghastly\" laboratory (Latour, 1992), I follow the methodological orientation of \"anthropological strangeness\" (i.e., a na\u00efve observer) of Latour and Woolgar's Laboratory Life as well as George Marcus' (1995) principles of multi-sited ethnography and the principles of grounded theory (described below) to develop the ideas of an environmental biopolitics of reproduction and environmental, medical subjecthood de novo. Objects of study are informed by different modes or techniques that allow us to follow association or connection among multiple actants across time and space (Marcus, 1995). In particular, I draw on Marcus' framework of following people and things (including animals) involved in the work of producing laboratory facts about obesity. He describes a multi-sited ethnography as, designed around chains, paths, threads, conjunctions, or juxtapositions of locations in which the ethnographer establishes some form of literal, physical presence, with an explicit, posited logic of association or connection among sites that in fact defines the argument of the ethnography. (Marcus, 1995, p. 105) I disaggregate these chains, or points of articulation as I have described above, into chapters. In chapter 2, I analyze the work done by technicians in the production of raw data for scientific claims about the environmental and developmental causes of obesity. In chapter 3, I follow the biological labor of model animals made to function differently in the creation of human futures defined by environmental exposures, and in chapter 4, I track the larger effects of a political economy of research funding for PIs on the production of translational obesity knowledge and the constitution of a contemporary basic science workforce at the Lab. I also follow the \"metaphor\" in that epigenetics represents a mode of thought about genetic flexibility or plasticity which complements the concept of precarity discussed earlier in this chapter (Marcus, 1995, p. 108). Like the notion of flexibility, precarity similarly entails malleability but it hinges on uncertainty and questions of risk, and this seems to me to be an underlying essence of both the science followed here as well as those who practice it. Precarity inheres in the material work of the lab in regard to funding as well as its biomedical workforce. As an ethnographer, I play the role of \"anthropological stranger\" and follow people, things, and metaphors while adhering to the complementary orientation of grounded theory with its emphasis on an inductive approach to collecting data and developing concepts de novo (Strauss, 1987;Glaser & Strauss, 1967;Strauss & Corbin, 1994). Building on the tenets of symbolic interactionism, grounded theory places importance on inductively understanding how social processes are organized and objects given meaning (Tavory & Timmermans, 2009, p. 256). The role of the ethnographer is to gather and generate data from the field, portraying the world in situ as lived and understood by its members (Blumer, 1986;Becker 1998 (Landecker, 2007, p. 222-224). Standpoint and positionality. The immersion process at the Lab was a welcome one from first contact. In response to my inquiry and an initial meeting, the head principal investigator generously welcomed me to meet his colleagues and staff members. Some technicians working at the bench and one junior investigator were suspicious and wondered what was so interesting about their work. While there was some initial caution on their part, after a few visits our rapport became friendly and inviting. For example, I was invited out for coffee chats and to observe for myself the culturing of cells as they appear under magnification. These are but two examples of how I was allowed into informants' worlds. As my research progressed, I spent the majority of my time at the wet bench with women who have also received tertiary degrees. Except for the most senior principal investigator who was also a clinician with professorial and editorial roles, the other investigators and technicians all happened to be women who had all immigrated, except one, to the United States to work as laboratory scientists or to become medical doctors. As observers in fieldwork we are always \"on our own side,\" i.e., biased by our own interests, and, as a consequence, relations of domination \"render our knowledge partial\" (Burawoy, 1998, p. 23;Haraway, 1988 Data collection. My sources of data collection were participant observation, interviews, and textual analyses of scientific papers and popular press media. The vast majority of my fieldwork was spent at the Lab. As Marcus (1995) notes, a \"strategically situated (single-site) ethnography\" may \"not move around literally but may nonetheless embed itself in a multi-sited context\" because \"what goes on within a particular locale in which research is conducted is often calibrated with its implication for what goes on in another related locale or locales\" (p. 110). The Lab itself was multi-sited in the meaning Marcus ascribes to it. For example, there were more than four physical spaces in which Lab members work on a day-to-day basis, and their work was always directed outward toward happenings in other locales. I followed the \"circulation of cultural meanings, objects, and identities in diffuse time [and] space\" as they relate to the Developmental Origins, epigenetics and the work of doing technoscience (Marcus, 1998, p. 79). In addition to fieldwork, I gathered data from structured and unstructured interviews with  addressed by PIs so that they could clarify what it was they were studying and why, or to explain how it helped to move concepts forward or to explore new areas of interest. The wet lab was situated in a neighboring building adjacent to PIs' offices. I spent two or three days a week in the wet lab shadowing technicians as they organized, studied, prepared for, carried out and analyzed experimental results. I shadowed four main groups of people in the wet lab and animal room: those in charge of fat tissues, those responsible for brain and stem cell experiments, the bisphenol-A model, and, lastly, the animal care-taker who was also responsible for the sacrifices (killings) and performing phenotype work like measuring weight, blood pressure, glucose levels, and other indicators of metabolic health. There was often cross talk in the Lab so I asked follow-up questions about how the work went on days I was absent or when I needed clarification. I was frequently shown data on computer software and developed films to \"see\" results of testing and experimentation that the technicians obtained. As conferences are part of academic life, the making of science, and therefore part of the Lab's circulation, I attended conferences as they arose over the year. I attended local conferences at a nearby university, including, in 2012, \"Plastic Bodies: Biopolitical Implications of the New Environmental Epigenetics,\" as well professional scientific talks such as the annual Society for Drawing on the orientations and tools provided by these three articulations of doing ethnography, I collected, transcribed, and coded all personal communication based on observations, interviews, and textual analyses into electronic form, and considered the ways in which people and things were made to work. By following people and things and considering the conditions by which things happened, the concepts of anticipatory care-work, precarity, maternal burden, and environmental subjecthood emerged out of the data. Consequently, they formed the conceptual apparatus of the dissertation: technicians, economic and political precarity, and the epistemic effects of one's status as a career or temporary technician on knowledge production (chapter 2); biomass at work in the production of environmental subjecthood (chapter 3); and the political and economic climate of scientific funding and its iterative effects for PIs on the production of maternal-environmental obesity knowledge (chapter 4)."}, {"section_title": "Overview of the Dissertation", "text": "In chapter 2, I follow technicians who work at the Lab to produce new knowledge about the epigenetics of pregnancy and the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome in experimental animal models. While the material labor of producing facts is central to this chapter, I was surprised to find people other than PIs circulating at the bench. This raises a question about the economy of bench life. I found that highly trained immigrant scientists work as so-called technicians and that these observations reveal a unique kind of scientific pipeline that consists of immigrant scientists who hold doctorate and medical degrees. These technicians either work as career technicians or as temporary technicians in this Lab, and elsewhere, while studying for US medical board exams. Because of their different temporal orientations in the Lab, I argue that they develop different caretaking practices with respect to the Lab's experimental systems. This, in turn, affects the course and content of laboratory fact making. In chapter 3, I trace the labor of biomass, i.e., animals and their constituent parts. By focusing on biomass, I explore what it means to be environmentally constituted in an extreme context of creating molecular based, epigenetic findings of obesity and metabolic syndrome. A focus on nutritional and chemical exposures and their effects on phenotypic outcomes allow us to see the ways in which environmental forces are biologized in the framework of Developmental Origins. This, in turn, lets us ask how obesity research, in particular Developmental Origins, shifts what the medicalization of fat or body shape and size means in an epigenetic era. How does medical surveillance work when individual patients stand before doctors as the consequences of evolution rather than consequences of their lifestyles? What are the changing conditions of medicalization as the explanations of causation shift with epigenetics, as social things become seen as biologically causative in ways that they were not before, when the mode of proof rests on triangulation between epidemiology and laboratory work? In answering these questions, I propose the idea of a new environmental biomedical subjecthood that implicates gene-environment interaction studies in general. In chapter 4, I focus on principal investigators, and the political economy of basic science obesity research. In it, I follow the national public health metaphor that defines obesity as a national biomedical security threat. Highly prized grants from the National Institutes of Health in particular increasingly demand molecular explanations of obesity with translational potential for human health. I argue that precarity of funding shapes the biomedical workforce as much as it shapes research agendas. Lab work is organized temporally where daily work is oriented toward grant money already received and for which findings must be produced while simultaneously oriented toward the next round of grants and their deadlines. A precarious and intensely competitive funding landscape has multiple effects on the production of obesity knowledge. As a result, I am interested in how the problematic of obesity itself, and the effects of funding, shape how and by whom knowledge production works in an experimental animal laboratory."}, {"section_title": "51", "text": "Finally, in the conclusion, I review the main arguments of each chapter and the study's limitations and contributions to literature across the fields of sociology, anthropology, science, and technology studies with a particular bent toward feminist studies in technoscience literature on science and the bodies. By ethnographically following people, things, and metaphors, I found that the work of Developmental Origins and epigenetics of obesity produces new conceptual and material relationships in maternal-fetal health. A new environmental biomedical subject emerges out these sciences where, in the light of inheritance, obesity is differently medicalized as maternal-fetal and, because they change the very perimeters of where the condition is said to be, theories of medicalization and biomedicalization should similarly shift to accommodate new causal theories and intergenerational models of disease transmission in a post-genomic era."}, {"section_title": "Laboratory Technicians and Anticipatory Caretaking Practices", "text": "My last but most important slide is my acknowledgment slide. Clearly, I am just a spokesperson for a whole lab of very talented students and post-docs whose hard work and enthusiasm give me all the data I've got to share with you today. Anonymous, personal communication, SRI conference, 2015. To ignore the technician's contribution is\u2026to act as if scientific knowing begins only after scientists have come on stage and to perpetuate the sort of cultural myth that modern sociologists of science wish to transcend. Stephen R. Barley and Beth A. Bechky, 1994, p. 86. In the spring of 2015, I attended the annual Society for Reproductive Investigation Conference in San Francisco, California. After each presentation, I noted that speakers graciously acknowledged the work of many others who, according to one principal investigator (PI), produced \"all the data\" necessary for her talk. As I sat in the darkened conference hall and reflected on photographs of lab personnel from one presentation to the next, I wondered why the division of laboratory labor is organized today such that PIs are \"just a spokesperson\" on behalf of others' labor (the main focus of chapter 4). This initial observation provoked additional questions about the organization of laboratory labor at University Lab (Lab) regarding how PIs' dependence on technicians affects the course and content of knowledge production, as well as the reproduction of the Lab itself in the knowledge market for environmental models of obesity and metabolic syndrome. In this chapter, I foreground the work of technicians, those individuals \"whose hard work and enthusiasm\" produce \"all the data\" necessary to help run a laboratory. I do so for three reasons. First, my observations of the Lab's division of labor are not idiosyncratic. They mirror the National Institutes of Health's (NIH, 2012) description of a typical, academic, biomedical lab: [It] consists of a PI and one or a small number of permanent technical staff, with the majority of the research, carried out by trainees\u2026Today these scientists bring stability to many labs and provide important functions as part of institutional core facilities, but have a wide variety of titles and employment conditions. (NIH, 2012, p. 10) Further, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2015) hasfound that that \"the availability of research funding drives not only the specific research questions investigated, but also the scientific workforce available to carry out that research\" (p. 35). Ethnographic and national data suggest that contemporary laboratory life is organized by a division of labor in which permanent technical staff and itinerant student technicians, who have a wide variety of titles and employment conditions, are the primary producers of raw empirical data in the early 21 st century. My second reason for focusing on technicians is because they represent a global \"reserve army\" of highly educated scientists (Engels, 1845). Foreign talent fills the contemporary, biomedical lab. Immigrant scientists at my research site and elsewhere help backfill the absence of PIs at the bench. According to a 2005 report by the National Research Council about opportunities and challenges to foster the independence of young investigators in the life sciences, \"more than half of the biomedical postdoctoral researchers in this country hold non-U.S. citizenship. It is difficult to consider the U.S. biomedical research enterprise without acknowledging the critical role played by scientists from outside the U.S\" (p. 6; NIH, 2012). While I do not focus on post-doctorates, the division of labor at the Lab similarly relies on an international, scientifically trained workforce. Relative to post-doctorates, however, far less is known about \"staff scientists,\" in particular those who are immigrant scientists and labor alongside native student trainees at the empirical interface of conceptual and material work (Barley & Bechky, 1994, p. 98). Based on NIH (2102) estimates, the number of staff scientists in academia has grown from approximately 4,000 in 1993 to 8,500 in 2008. In recognition of staff scientists' contributions to biomedical research, the NIH has called for its own \"study sections to be receptive to grant applications that include staff scientists and urges institutions to creation position categories that reflect the value and stature of these researchers\" (2012, p. 39). Third, in spite of technicians' advanced degrees, the precarity of grants and federal immigration laws suggests that, even for the most economically productive members of society, a new normal defined by political and economic precarity characterizes much of contemporary laboratory life (Standing, 2014). Indeed, the general conditions of technicians' employment are reflective of broader trends in post-industrial globalization, which are \"historically present in female work-precariousness, flexibility, mobility, fragmentary nature, low status, and low pay\" (Oksala, 2016, p. 281). In contrast to some immigrant laborers who have little formal education, (e.g., women who labor in nail salons), academic laboratory technicians hold tertiary degrees. Nonetheless, they experience similar effects as their counterparts in other service sector jobs in terms of employment and immigration precarity (Kang, 2010). I will show how these forms of precarity impact the types of experimental questions posed by technicians in concert with PIs. In this chapter, I work to restore visibility of technicians. I build on the works of historian of science Steven Shapin (1989) and labor sociologists Stephen Barley and Julian Orr (1997) as well as Stephen Barley and Beth Bechky (1994), who studied the role of technicians in science. I argue that the social organization of the Lab itself has epistemic effects on what comes to be known about obesity and metabolic syndrome because precarity (economic and political) is built into the Lab's division of labor and its experimental systems. Specifically, technicians' work conditions affect their caretaking practices around the Lab's experimental systems because \"care for the Lab's experimental systems\" varies by technicians' position within the Lab as either a career technician or a temporary one, creating, in effect, a division of caretaking labor (Rheinberger, 1997, p. S246). Although caretaking has been previously identified as a critical element of technicians' labor, my findings suggest that caretaking entails multiple valences that are specific to one's occupational position at this Lab (Barley & Bechky, 1994;Barley & Orr, 1997). Academic lab technicians are not a homogenous occupational group. At the Lab, they circulate along very different career trajectories and anticipations which structure their caretaking practices, either as a career or temporary technician. To describe these practices, I adopt the phrase of anticipatory caretaking practices to show how career anticipation structures technicians' \"way of actively orienting oneself temporally\" to care for the Lab's experimental studies (Adams, Murphy, & Clarke, 2009, p. 247;Fortun & Fortun, 2005). My central argument in this chapter has two elements. First, technical staff, who have a variety of job titles, are the primary producers of laboratory facts, and they are living very specific forms of life. This particular observation reflects national data collected on the composition of the biomedical workforce today. The second part of my argument is that technicians' different employment timelines and aspirations impact the Lab's experimental systems and, therefore, the production of different types of knowledge. Immigration status (on either an educational J-1 or an employee H-1B visa) intersects with professional ambitions; shaping. In short, I argue that different laboratory facts, in part, emerge depending on career status. For example, career technicians help establish experimental systems in which to pose fundamental (i.e., basic science) questions that can, in turn, reshape the trajectory of those systems. Temporary technicians, on the other hand, use the Lab's existing experimental systems to create small slices of facts that help proliferate \"normal science,\" i.e., working within a relatively settled explanatory framework (Kuhn, 2012). The key difference between these two activities amounts to 'finding the question' and establishing new experimental systems, on the one hand, and 'finding the answer' within established experimental systems on the other (Landecker, personal communication). As a result, what each subset of technicians learns to anticipate needing to care for, in turn, shapes knowledge production in obesity and metabolic studies. To make this argument, I build on previous science studies as I consider the structural effects on how knowledge is produced and by whom. In the pages that follow, I first provide a theoretical framework for studying technicians who labor in the \"backrooms of science\" to produce new obesity knowledge (Barley & Bechky, 1994). Second, I use ethnographic and interview data to provide Lab technicians' biographical backgrounds, career anticipations, and trajectories within the Lab. Third, I utilize examples from the maternal-obesity and maternal-bisphenol A (BPA) experimental systems to demonstrate how the work of anticipatory caretaking practices shapes laboratory fact making. In doing so, I illustrate variation in technicians' modes of anticipatory caretaking, depending on whether one is a career or temporary technician."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Framework: Anticipation as Affective Labor", "text": "Although early accounts of \"laboratory life\" generally eschewed the work of technicians, notable contributions exist in intersecting bodies of literature. For example, historian of science Steve Shapin (1989) argues that, because cultural ideas of \"work and authority\" in Western societies devalue manual labor and since laboratory technicians are viewed as providing manual labor, they have been overlooked in studies of scientific practices. Greater prestige, autonomy, and authority are bestowed on those with higher social class and status; i.e., those who are said to possess \"truly reflective and rational philosophical knowledgeability\" (p. 561). In this cultural framework that has persisted for many centuries, scientific activity is viewed \"predominantly as 57 thought rather than as work,\" i.e., using head rather than the hand (Shapin, 1989, p. 561). Additionally, because servants work in exchange for a wage (unlike gentlemen of science), they were also made politically invisible. In the 17 th century, to work for a wage was to forgo a man's birthright as a free Englishman, which meant that servants were bounded economically and politically to their masters. As a consequence, laboratory servants were made doubly invisible in science and the political climate and that view has somewhat survived through today. In the 21 st century, parallels exist for basic science laboratory technicians. As it happened to Sir Robert Boyle's 17 th century servants, the historical significance of one's birthright today plays out in the context of immigration policies in the US via the J-1 educational visa and the coveted H-1B professional visa, which are designated for individuals with advanced degrees. At the Lab, the work of producing new scientific knowledge is predicated on the availability of a relatively low-cost yet highly skilled pool of individuals who work (sometimes as volunteers) under very precarious financial and political conditions. While their contributions are increasingly acknowledged by PIs (as in the ubiquitous \"acknowledgment slide\"), academic technicians remain an economically and politically vulnerable workforce today as they were in the 17 th century. Although some technicians today have gained visibility as co-authors on scientific papers as part of the reproducibility of labs and PIs, they are a largely unexamined in social science accounts of science. Sociologists Stephen Barley and Beth Bechky (1994) argue a two-fold reason for this: early sociological accounts of science and medicine were primarily concerned with institutional analyses, and, in spite of a subsequent turn toward scientific practices, ethnographic lab researchers emphasized epistemic questions about how knowledge itself is situated by its sociohistorical contexts (Latour & Woolgar, 1979;Lynch, 1985;Traweek, 1988;Haraway, 1988;Shapin, 1989;Barley & Bechky, 1994;Whalley & Barley, 1997;Russell, Tansey, & Lear, 2000;Tansey, 2008;Iliffe, 2008;Wylie, 2017). As a result, social scientists trained their analytical focus on authors who had social and economic capital (i.e., authority) and, in so doing, perpetuated the historical invisibility of technicians who nonetheless constitute part of a laboratory's social life and who perform work, and indeed invest in theirs and the lab's capital, on behalf of investigators. In contemporary studies that do incorporate the role and contributions of technicians, they are often manual workers who have comparatively little education and are therefore seen as mere hands in processes of fact making. Or, they are technicians who work in a non-academic, i.e., clinical, hospital, or industrial setting. For example, science studies scholars Lynch, Cole, McNally, & Jordan (2008) found that lower-level technicians in a forensic lab perform \"highly routinized work\" in which \"thought and creative variation [were kept] to a minimum\" (pp. 89-90). Even in their classic treatment of laboratory life, Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar (1979) footnoted the existence of technicians while nonetheless noting that \"[t]heir importance in the production of facts is usually underestimated\" (p. 232). But, in basic science labs today, technicians are not merely \"hand\" help or even \"super-techs\" that can be easily exchanged or circulated on the market (Latour & Woolgar, 1979, p. 223). They must possess, as Rayna Rapp (1999) has argued in her analysis of the interpretive work technicians perform in chromosomal diagnoses, both formal and contextual knowledge. Academic technicians must work with hand, head, and heart in order to help produce new knowledge (Rose, 1983). Further, they cannot simply \"lend their skill to an investigator, in exchange for a secure position and some nonmaterial satisfactions\" because of their precarity as recent immigrants and the larger funding landscape in basic science (Latour & Woolgar, 1979, p. 223). Career technicians reminded me continuously that, without grants, there is no funding, no security, and no job. But, as well, no visa. According to labor sociologists Barley and Bechky (1994), technicians in academic laboratories perform two central roles: translation, which occurs at the \"empirical interface\" between \"material and symbolic realms,\" and caretaking, which involves the maintenance of \"machines, organisms, and other physical systems\" (1994, p. 90;Whalley & Barley, 1997). What these examples illustrate is that brokering new laboratory knowledge occurs through translation and caretaking practices, both of which entail the use of formal and contextual knowledge by technicians. Expanding this discussion on caretaking practices, I contend that learning to have a \"feeling for\" an organism at my research site reflects something akin to visceral affinity, an affective state complementary to but different from Barley and Bechky's invocation of \"having a feeling for\" as simple familiarity or tactile skills (p. 100). Therefore, in the process of learning to care for the Lab's experimental systems, I argue that technicians' work resembles aspects of affective labor, a mode of immaterial labor that emphasizes the role of caring work in the embodied processes of scientific knowledge production (Hardt, 1999;Hardt & Negri, 2000). How is affective labor defined? According to Michael Hardt (1999), affective labor refers to caring work \"immersed in the corporeal, the somatic\" which, among other things, produces biopower (p. 96). Moreover, he writes that affective labor has become a dominant way to extract value from workers in post-industrial work environments (p. 97). Hardt argues that, in addition to the labors of knowledge, information, and communication in the production of scientific knowledge, affect \"play[s] a foundational role in the production process\" (1999, p. 93). Drawing on this definition of affective labor, I argue that forms of laboratory labor include not only theory and technical practice as emphasized by Barley and Bechky (1994) above, but also the embodied labor of care work where 'caretaking' is defined as much more than the daily maintenance of laboratory subjects. Affective labor is shown, for example, in sociologist Carrie Friese's (2013) analysis of a translational laboratory that employs animal models as representatives of human bodies and conditions. Friese argues that the \"unseen element of care plays a constitutive role in the organization and setup of an experimental system\" affecting \"both the biology of the mouse or rat as well as the scientific understanding of that biology\" (p. 131). The affective dimension of care not only informs how experiments are or should be carried out but also that the outcomes of care (new knowledge) have epistemological value in that they shape our understanding about what we claim to know. This is congruent with Rose (1983), Puig de la Bellacasa (2011), Lapp\u00e9 2014, Fortun & Fortun (2005), and Oksala (2016). In her work on autism research, Martine Lapp\u00e9 (2014) demonstrates how care becomes implemented in research study designs with the effect of shaping how knowledge about autism is produced and acted on by stakeholders, including parents and scientists. The ethnographer of science Natasha Myers (2008), in her work about the bodily engagement and attachment of molecular biologists to their 'objects,' also \"shows the crucial affective labour and care involved in 'giving life' to a molecular model\" (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2011, p. 98.). Ethnographic illustrations of affective care labor in science, such as the ones mentioned, reflect an extension of Evelyn Fox Keller's (1983) earlier concept of what it means to have a \"feeling for\" the objects on which a scientist intervenes. What scientists learn to care for and about in the laboratory often reflects larger social concerns about what human ailments matter the most which, in turn, shapes the conduct and course of scientific investigation. This logic suggests a \"double significance of care\" at play (Puig de Bellacasa, 2011, p. 90). What people care about in terms of health (namely obesity and diabetes in this instance) funds specific research topics and designs. This impacts what scientists study, and indeed mold their entire careers to. An added element to this dynamic is that economic and political precarity also influence matters of care. Care for the Lab's experimental systems depends on technicians' occupational status as career or temporary technician, which is intimately connected to their immigration status and thus livelihood. In summary, I borrow this concept of anticipation as one dimension of affective labor and apply it to technicians. Technicians anticipate their own career trajectories and therefore mold their caretaking practices in relation to them. This, in turn, affects how they actively orient themselves to fostering the technical conditions of laboratory life in order to produce facts. In sum, anticipation, through the organization of work as modes of anticipatory caretaking, has epistemic effects for what we come to know about obesity and metabolic syndrome. What facts make it to the light of day outside the Lab itself, depends as much on funding for hot topics as it does a low-cost and vulnerable workforce of 'technicians'."}, {"section_title": "62", "text": "Now that I have described the theoretical framework that shapes the notion of anticipatory caretaking practices, I first turn to an overview of technicians' background, their training, and career trajectories in the Lab. Once I have illustrated their social positioning in the Lab, I then draw on ethnographic examples to show how anticipatory caretaking practices vary by social location in the Lab and how this affects the production of new obesity knowledge."}, {"section_title": "Technicians at University Lab", "text": "The Lab's division of labor not only mirrors the NIH's characterization of a typical laboratory given above but also dovetails with Rayna Rapp's (1999) observations that \"laboratories are staffed by an international circulation of highly skilled scientific workers,\" and that their work is often perceived as \"women's work\" (p. 199). By \"women's work,\" I mean to suggest that the labor itself is gendered, i.e., it is marked by \"precariousness, flexibility, mobility, fragmentary nature, low status, and low pay\" all of which are qualities \"historically present in female work\" (Oksala, 2016, p. 281;Standing, 2011). In many ways, the Lab's labor organization and technicians' work practices reflect a metaphor drawn long ago by physiologist Claude Bernard (1865) in which he described a physiology laboratory as a \"ghastly kitchen,\" where science resembles a messy kitchen rather than a highly-organized experimental endeavor, a metaphor that Bruno Latour (1992) would later articulate as the \"costly ghastly kitchen\" (p. 300). And yet today, it is not science 'great men' who are 'cooking' down in the laboratory, but rather an amalgamation of science technicians who, precisely because of their economic and political vulnerability as immigrants, bring \"stability\" to the Lab in the course of producing new facts about environmental determinants of obesity and metabolic health (NIH, 2012, p. 10). Technicians at the Lab 'cooked' in several locations across the larger campus. First, the main laboratory area consisted of two 'wet' rooms filled with an array of machines, tools, bottles, flasks, and other items used in the course of everyday work. Second, adjacent to the wet lab, there was a shared computer room with computer stations for four people, but never enough space to occupy everyone on a full day at the Lab. Within this office, technicians strategically combed through scientific papers, investigated protocols, annotated lab notebooks, stored and prepared images and drawings, and utilized software programs to document, interpret, plan, and troubleshoot results. Third, a short walk away from these rooms was the Lab's procedure room. A space, shared with other institute's employees, where animals were sacrificed and early steps of experimentation, like whole animal fixation (perfusion fixation), were performed. Fourth, in another common room, the Lab stored tissue samples in refrigerators and freezers for future use, and lastly technicians shared a common darkroom to expose films that had been treated according to particular visualization techniques. This was a place where \"Did it work?\" was a familiar question because, once films had been developed, technicians eagerly read out a series of smudges that they interpreted as a sign that their earlier experimental work was a success, i.e., a positive result. The organization of empirical work at the Lab typically began with weekly meetings, which provided a time and space for Drs. Harris and Moore to meet with most, if not all, of the technicians to review events over the preceding week and to map out plans for the upcoming one. Lab meetings were held in Dr. Moore's office in a building located adjacent to the laboratory. She led the weekly meetings and her questions to the team were often organized by technician because each one was responsible for specific biomass in a specific experimental system. The overall pace of experimental work was dictated by a need for data for use in imminent grants, conference presentations, and publications. As I was once informed, \"you are always getting data for either grants or publications,\" and \"it takes a long time to get a good story\" (anonymous, personal communication, February 2, 2015). Career technicians. In this section, I provide biographical data and career trajectories for the Lab's three career technicians: Eleanor, Olivia, and Carrie. Eleanor, the most senior and entrusted technician, primarily worked with adipose (fat) tissue and cells in the maternal obesity model. 13 She was also called upon to teach less experienced technicians in techniques, to troubleshoot problems as they occurred in myriad circumstances, and to help establish a new experimental model around programmed appetite pathways in the hypothalamic region of the embryonic mouse brain (discussed in chapter 4). I was told that the Lab \"would be doomed\" without Eleanor's contributions (personal communication, January 4, 2016). Dr. Moore told me that \"to find someone of Eleanor's caliber and passion, at her level, would be difficult.\" Dr. Moore could suggest a protocol for Eleanor to follow on a particular study and, although Eleanor \"has [previously] nailed down the techniques,\" she usually had to navigate unforeseen circumstances in everyday experimental work. Once, for example, in the midst of a protocol disagreement between Eleanor and Olivia, a junior investigator whispered to me that Eleanor has a \"strong personality\" as a way to explain why she seemed so impassioned, but that situation also revealed to me how they each care for particular details of a protocol. Both technicians were pressed continuously with uncertainties and, as a result, they oriented their caretaking practices towards whatever end each one deemed best for the task at hand. In fact, the degree of their personal investments in the Lab's success could be measured by the timing, pitch, and tone of their voices during disagreements with one another. If they did not care, they would not argue about the best way to handle either anomalies or even give suggestions about what particulars of biomatter may be relevant to their investigations. I also found that having a \"strong personality\" in general must have served both career technicians well since the work sometimes entailed long and erratic hours, constant learning, problem-solving, and supervision of others (including me) for which they received relatively low pay, in the range of 50k per year. Eleanor suggests that this type of job is so stressful that many people eschew basic science research altogether and opt for more stable careers in biomedicine."}, {"section_title": "She explained to me:", "text": "Look around. Why are there no young people here? Students [undergrads and graduates] won't stay here. They won't take this kind of job. They just get experience, a recommendation, and then go on to another thing like medical school because the salary is too low, and it is stressful. If you don't have a grant, you don't have a job. Nobody can guarantee you get a grant all the time. After a pause, she added, \"Look how many Chinese are here. They are all foreign here, and they come because this job is easy [for obtaining] a green card, and no other American wants to do this job, especially now. My son wouldn't.\" Although Eleanor received a medical degree in her home country where she also worked as a professor before immigrating to the United States, she had worked as a technician for several labs during her nearly two decades at the Lab's home institution, University Biomedical Park (Bio Park). She was a permanent resident. Eleanor had spent approximately the last ten years with Drs. Harris and Moore. Because she was the most trusted and experienced technician who anticipated continuing her career with these PIs, Eleanor's positioning within the Lab structured her daily anticipatory caretaking practices. As she planned a work schedule to be done in any upcoming week, Eleanor routinely asked the PIs, \"okay, what kind of data do you need for that grant renewal?\""}, {"section_title": "66", "text": "Working in anticipation of their future needs, she cultivated and optimized environmental in vitro and ex vivo conditions for primary adipose cells, explored epigenetic mechanisms associated with adipose development and function, and mapped out new experimental terrain for the PIs by \"searching for the unknown\" in daily cell culture techniques. Outside of the Lab itself, she read scientific papers to help keep her informed but also to consider new experimental directions with fat cells such as how to get white fat cells to act more like brown fat cells (to burn fat rather than store it). Lastly, she helped discipline data, particularly with Western Blotting (a technique and tool that makes protein expression visible to the eye), which is often one of the final techniques done to \"see whether or not her experiment worked.\" Although precarity, flexibility, and low pay were the reality of her work, Eleanor chose this path and, as I asked why, she said, I really like my job. That is why I stay for my whole career. I graduated from medical school, but I don't like to deal with patients. I like research. [The] clinic is boring: same patients, same problems, same questions. It is very, very boring. With research, I keep learning, keep doing, keep reading. It is very interesting. When I asked \"in what ways?\", she said that \"In one type of lab, you only do one type of experiment and then pass it on to the boss, but here, at this Lab, it is another experience, where one project might need a lot of experiments\" (personal communication, February 6, 2015). Again pointing to the impact of grant precarity on employment, Eleanor remarked that when she started working at Bio Park in 1997, the NIH had more funding to give, a fact reflected in the NIH's data and which is often repeated in the Lab. She correctly noted that, in the late 1990s, approximately thirty percent of applications were funded, but today it is around ten percent or less, and \"that is really hard,\" she said (personal communication, January, 2015). Consequently, unlike clinical technicians who typically work at a hospital or medical office and enjoy the prospect of regularized employment, academic technicians like Eleanor are permanently dependent on PIs' grants for their own employment. Olivia, the newest career technician, transferred from another major university research center doing stem cell research. She also held an advanced degree and, like Eleanor, she was an international scientist-technician. In a description of her experience as a foreign scientist, she told me, \"You can work for a PI for 10-15 years on a visa, make very little pay ($26-45k), especially in academia versus the private sector. By the time you get your green card, you're old, and there is an age ceiling.\" Feeling \"captive\" by immigration policies, she added, Even when you first get the visa, employers take advantage of the system and treat the first year of employment as a trial phase. When switching jobs, the visa rules won't even allow like a month break so one can take a longer vacation. Labs here at Bio Park are very immigrant based. Look at the local universities, and you will find the same thing. Olivia's reflections on the conditions of her employment echoed not only what Eleanor had separately described to me, but also confirmed Dr. Harris' appraisal of technicians' precarious positioning within the contemporary biomedical workforce. In an interview, he remarked that, while being \"technical staff\" is a good path into the United States and, for some, the medical profession, it is hard on career technicians in academia because they \"get to a certain salary level, then [if] that lab closes\u2026they can't get hired at that same level\" (personal communication, December, 2015). To underscore this point, Dr. Harris reflected on his family and added that none of his children or their friends wants to \"be a Ph.D. in the sciences\u2026 it is not a very common field to pick. And maybe because it is not that secure, particularly as you get into academic stuff\" (personal communication, December, 2015). From his and others' perspectives in the Lab, those at the laboratory bench today tend to be drawn from outside countries and, although there is a potential path toward residency, it does not come without costs. In the course of her work, Olivia had learned to care for and about both mouse physiology and how neuronal pathways form during embryogenesis within the maternal-obesity experimental system. As she learned to care for the hypothalamus, and specifically a region within it referred to as the arcuate nucleus (an appetite regulating region of the brain), she found that working with stem cells that have not yet differentiated into mature, or fated, primary cells makes them \"far more tricky\" than mature adipocytes. Nevertheless, she derived and cultivated neuronal stem cells from the hypothalamus taken from mouse pups one or two days old, learning how to handle dime-size brain tissue. Cells were then derived from brain tissue, specifically the arcuate nucleus, and Olivia cultured them to the point she determined that they were \"pure\" of surrounding tissue, \"healthy,\" and in sufficient number to experiment with via transfection techniques (used to study and control gene expression). Like Eleanor, Olivia also explored obesity pathways through multiple experimental interventions and study design to figure how to best collect and cultivate 'appetite' and 'satiety' neurons in order to test theories of enhanced programmed appetite. Lastly, Carrie, the 'animal tech,' managed the Lab's experimental animal models. Like the other career technicians, she held an advanced degree, but Carrie was the only Americanborn personnel other than the most senior PI, Dr. Harris. Carrie was responsible for the care of mice and rats in multiple senses: purchasing them from particular breeders, attending to their husbandry, safety, housing and other physical milieu such as lighting and temperature, exercise, medical care, and, of course, overseeing their nutritional milieu. Finally, she \"sacrificed\" animals as fresh samples were needed for experimental work and also when animals began to take on \"old person problems\" and were deemed not valuable to future studies. More than any other technician, her anticipatory caretaking was molded to the temporal lives of animals in terms of routine maintenance, reproduction, and experimental interventions. Before Eleanor and Olivia could go \"on a fishing trip\" with tissues and cells, Carrie collected data on animals' phenotypes in a quiet room set apart from the laboratory. She routinely measured animal weight, food and water intake, blood pressure, performs body DEXA scans (a noninvasive measurement of fat distribution in the body), conducted glucose tolerance tests, and collected data on animals' plasma to capture changes in cytokine levels. These baseline measurements were critical for PIs who \"need the measurements so [that] we know what we are doing\" (personal communication, February, 2015). The \"molecular stuff,\" I was told, \"all starts with the phenotypes [because they] tell us which direction to go\" so that they can hypothesize what is \"driving\" molecular mechanisms that increase fat cells or appetite in exposed animals (personal communication, February, 2015). And because phenotypes represent intersection effects of an organism's genotype and its environments, Carrie was often confronted with anticipatory caretaking and troubleshooting specific to the whole organism in relation to environmental regulation of their biology. The results of her practices, therefore, helped the Lab shape and characterized a molecular \"story\" about regulatory changes in multiple organs, tissues, cells, and pathways that influence appetite and satiety. In sum, because of financial and political precarity, career technicians mold their careers to the Lab's experimental systems, which they help establish and maintain as a result of their anticipatory caretaking practices. The main aspects of anticipatory caretaking practices include cultivation, exploration, and discipline in order to help refine or push existing experimental systems in new directions. Carrie cultivated the livelihood of animals in the vivarium while the other career techs, Eleanor and Olivia, fostered environmental conditions of cell culture and in vitro studies with gene expression. Together, they \"search around the unknown for direction,\" mapping out new experimental terrains on behalf of PIs, and discipline findings that result from a sustained \"absorption in, even identification with\" their material subjects (Keller, 1983, p. xxii). With a gaze on environmental causes of obesity and metabolic syndrome, anticipatory caretaking reflected ways in which career technicians embodied the Lab's hypotheses, helping to provide an organized sequence to the Lab's staggered studies around grant cycles and the reproductive lives of experimental animal models. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges (2015), IMGs are part of a trend in which one out of four doctors in the US today is a foreign medical graduate. 14 Under the Trump administration, however, this has become more complex and precarious for immigrant scientists, especially for those from countries designated as \"State Sponsors of Terrorism.\" Maryam and Veronica, both of who were from one of those countries, agreed to work for approximately two years at the Lab while also completing all three testing steps of the US Medical Licensing Examination. In order for Maryam and Veronica to be competitive in future residency programs, they must acquire excellent referrals from American doctors in addition to having at least one publication. Despite the hard work involved, they considered their position in the Lab as a form of \"privilege\" that enabled them to become a licensed physician with longterm American residency not only for themselves but also their young children (personal communication, June, 2015). Their contribution to the Lab's translational profile within the developmental programming field of obesity reflected a \"mutual extraction\" between PIs and temporary technicians because, in caring for PIs, temporary technicians also engaged in their own anticipatory professionalization practices (Lapp\u00e9, 2014, p. 305;Shapin, 1989). IMG's anticipated becoming medical practitioners in the United States and, because their anticipations exceeded the limits of the Lab itself, they developed anticipatory caretaking practices more closely aligned with reproducing \"normal science\" through the Lab's experimental systems and, outside the Lab, reproducing its capital via conference presentations. As part of their anticipatory care practices for the Lab's experimental systems, IMGs had to \"get results.\" By results, they explicitly meant \"positive\" results because, in their words, reviewers and readers wanted a \"happy ending;\" that is, they wanted \"results correlated with each other\" across publications (personal communication, May, 2015). Maryam described their experimental work as like \"making a story,\" and as with \"directing a film, there are a lot of scenes, [and sometimes] actors don't always play well together, and people want a happy ending\" (personal communication, May, 2015). To that end, the anticipatory need to create positive results for future audiences structured emergent experimental questions in one of the Lab's maternal-BPA model. One day at the bench, for example, Maryam was encouraged to \"get that muscle done!\" in anticipation of an upcoming conference she needed to participate in. In this example, technicians examined the programmed effects of BPA exposure in utero on offspring' fat tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle-effects that they were not planning on studying in any imminent sense. But because they needed \"positive results\" in anticipation of what was in fact an imminent conference, they learned to care for fat tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle rather than another biological object. 15 Ironically, these temporary technicians acknowledged that \"socially\" it would be great to find that the effects of BPA do not persist in the model, and that \"the scare of BPA may not be so great after all,\" but they anticipate and even hope to find that the deleterious effects of BPA persist because that is tantamount to a positive result (personal communication, July, 2015). The demand to produce \"happy endings\" that correlated with other findings in an existing experimental system amounts to caring for particular organs and epigenetic pathways in animal models of obesity and metabolic dysfunction and the course of doing science was paced by technicians' own timelines within the Lab. In spite of recognizing the social good of negative results in the case of BPA, the professional pressures on temporary technicians to get positive results for publication, and to circulate those findings at conferences, encouraged anticipatory caretaking practices that not only enhanced their professionalization but also increased PIs' reputation in the field, and more broadly reproduced the problematic of obesity in the field of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease. Although investigators and technicians in the Lab described their work in passionate terms, it would be an overstatement to say that intellectual interests determine research agendas. Investigators recognize that what matters for funding is a combination of factors from \"hot topics\" as well as the skills of their technical staff because it will be they who produce \"all the data\" on which everyone's career depends. It is no surprise, then, that Drs. Harris and Moore took into consideration what their \"lab [is] good at doing\" as they contemplated study designs (personal communication, December, 2015). Such a practical reality of basic science research at the Lab reflects national trends cited above whereby funding affects both the type of scientific questions that are likely to be supported as well as the makeup of the biomedical workforce."}, {"section_title": "Anticipatory Caretaking Practices", "text": "Having explained the Lab's division of caretaking labor as well as the distinction between career and temporary technicians, I shift my focus below to highlight anticipatory caretaking labor in greater detail. I draw on examples from the care of animals in the vivarium and procedure room, and the in vitro work done in the \"maternal-obesity\" (career technicians) and \"maternal-BPA\" (temporary technicians) experimental systems. Anticipatory \"care of the data\" operates at many levels, including for animals, tissues, cells, genes, and proteins (Fortun & Fortun, 2005). It also operates at the broader level of concept renewal, which is necessary to the reproduction of the Lab in the field of epigenetic and developmental programming models of obesity. Career technicians: Cultivating life's \"technical conditions\" while \"searching the unknown\" for a \"good story.\" Labs are extreme environments where optimizing the technical conditions necessary for fostering health (and illness) in animal life involves complex processes. 16 To illustrate the work of anticipatory caretaking among career technicians, I highlight three technical and physical environments: animal housing in the vivarium, animal handling in the procedure room for in vivo studies and sacrifices, and biomass handling at the wet bench for in vitro studies with tissues, cells, and proteins. In each of these environments, the physical milieu, including the effects of handling, presents a tremendous source for potential experimental variability and, because of that, they are closely monitored (Balcombe, 2006). They also involve different sources and types of stress. An ethnographic focus on stress is useful for two reasons. First, an awareness of stress and its physiological effects on biomass \"relocate[s] the human subject within that [laboratory] environment, making the researcher integral to, controller of, and obligated to, the laboratory animals' well-being\" (Kirk, 2014, p. 258-259). In other words, the reality of environmental stress for animals (and their parts) due to their living conditions requires management by human interlocutors. This often unspoken intervention on stress by technicians is an element of care that affects animal physiology. Second, relatedly, this observation conveniently emphasizes the role of an animal technician as an important element in the \"relational, epistemological, and ontological interdependence of the knowing human and the animal object of (or means to) knowledge\" (Kirk, 2014, p. 258-259). Third, animal stress from handling and housing conditions has been shown to alter animal metabolism and negatively impact reproduction all of which are of vital empirical importance to this specific Lab (Ghosal, et al., 2015;Kamakura, Kovalainen, Lepp\u00e4luoto, Herzig, & M\u00e4kel\u00e4, 2016). Consequently, how technicians handle animals and biomass, while managing the physical aspects of the vivarium and the wet lab, is critical for cultivating life, creating new protocols, and making novel interventions. Their anticipatory care practices are not just reactive to laboratory animals and their parts, or the physical conditions of experimental work. They illustrate the active, interdependent ways that technicians orient themselves to the optimization of life's technical conditions in the laboratory (Adams et al., 2009). The prime considerations for rodent housing include types of cages, temperature, humidity, air quality and ventilation, sound and vibration, a constant 12-hour light/dark light cycle, food and water provided ad libitum, enrichment toys, and bedding. While Carrie, the animal technician, did not make purchasing decisions, she was attentive to variation and changes within each cage and the vivarium as a whole, adapting her practices to help ensure the wellbeing of animals, which in turn affects experimental outcomes. The macro and microenvironments were, in fact, an area of care that Carrie closely monitored on a daily basis. Mouse and rat cages vary, but gone are the days of wooden cages, galvanized metal and wire, and stainless steel. Today, enclosures are made of plastic with variation in specific chemicals used to manufacture them, e.g., polycarbonate, polysulfone, and polypropylene. Many, such as polycarbonate cages, leach bisphenol-A into laboratory animals and, therefore, the Lab uses BPA-free (but still plastic) cages in its maternal-BPA study with rats. To further help control for estrogenic effects on rats, the Lab used estrogen-free bedding, water bottles, and stoppers because microenvironments of the housing can produce estrogenic effects on the animals. (Thigpen et al., 2013) Despite these accommodations, it is entirely possible that other chemicals such as bisphenol-S can still leach, and this is discussed in Lab meetings as a potential confounding problem in their BPA studies. Compared to control rats, for instance, current BPA rats showed no enhanced appetite or weight gain, which perplexed PIs and technicians. In fact, the control animals showed elevated levels of BPA in their blood serum. Temperature and humidity are particularly important variables to control and maintain. Ideally, rodents are housed in a \"thermoneutral zone\" so as not to alter their metabolic pathways. This includes the potential for heat production if animals get too cold, or evaporation (sweat) if they get too hot. Even though the thermostat is on a controlled setting, the number of animals in a cage affects the micro-climate of each individual cage because bodies regulate thermogenesis differently depending on the group size in each cage. The cozier it is, the warmer they will be. Cages also have weight restrictions, which presents a dilemma for group and individual housing. If a rat weighed 500 grams or more (a very fat rat), Carrie would move it to single housing but, if she had two females that each weighed 250 grams, she would keep the two together in the smaller BPA-free cages because \"they like to be together.\" Otherwise, she noted that they \"probably get stressed,\" and \"some will not eat,\" creating an ethical and experimental dilemma for her. Carrie attempted to anticipate potential housing problems by daily keeping track of variables like temperature and humidity across cages and the vivarium. Carrie acknowledged the constraints around body weight, social thermogenesis, and animal sociality as she attempted to mitigate environmental stressors by tending to the animals' social nature. This dynamic underscored a perpetual tension between ethical and experimental demands that shaped her active orientation to the animals. Because mice and rats have ultrasonic hearing, they are also particularly sensitive to sound and vibration. Except for one occasion when we realized that our talking was disturbing her ability to take measurements of blood pressure, Carrie kept noises to a minimum when she handled the mice and rats. As for other housing conditions, although the 12-hour light/dark cycle was automatically regulated, Carrie performed most of her work during the day when these animals would prefer to sleep; presumably disrupting their natural circadian rhythms. Rodents are known to be active in the day (especially if the lights are on), but they are most active during evening hours when they prefer to play, eat, and reproduce. She also ensured animal cages were maintained with access to food and water ad libitum, which is a species-specific preference. While rodents once had red plastic toys to chew on, they now have paper towel rolls to play with. The red toys are common for rodent housing but, due to concerns with plasticizers, the Lab switched them out. In addition to Carrie's anticipation of housing effects on mice and rats, she also was attuned to her handling practices. Her practices around touching, both invasively and noninvasively, closely reflect an active orientation toward the animals. One non-invasive but very time consuming and mundane task is to keep track of new litters by number, sex, and diet. Carrie did this by marking pup tails with different colors of sharpie markers. However, as she noted, moms continually licked the color off of her pups' tails, and so Carrie had to reapply color every day, including on weekends, to help ensure she could track each pup's identity. How exactly this particular activity and exposure may affect dams and pups is unknown. For pups who mature to three weeks of age, Carrie then used ear punctures (which to an untrained eye looks as if a bite was taken out of an ear) to keep track of the animals as they matured to adults. Carrie also administered injections, such as glucose tolerance tests, and this was particularly challenging with large rats. Rather than using a typical product called DecapiCones (a tapered tube of plastic) that traps the animal inside a conical tube, she cuffed the rat by its neck and then wrapped the animal in a towel in a \"football\" hold position. Carrie noted that the plastic of DecapiCones can slide around the animal's body and, because the needles are only 5/8 of an inch, it is difficult to give the full dose of glucose. From Carrie's perspective, she anticipated how a rat, particularly a large one, might react to how she handled them and adjusted her practices accordingly. Her caretaking practices presumably help calm the animal while also administering treatment according to the protocol. For non-invasive, mundane, and yet critical practices, such as tracking pups with sharpies and handling larger animals in soft towels to administer injections, Carrie actively oriented herself both to the animals' needs but also, in the end, to the experimental apparatus itself, which she hoped to optimize for the sake of \"clean\" data. Another example of invasive touch is the practice of \"sacrifice,\" which I limit here to decapitation. Carrie anesthetized rats according to protocols set forth by the Animal Care and Use Committee (as well as others). She checked pain sensory by squeezing the rats' tail for a response. Once the animal had been prepped with alcohol like a shower spray, she used large scissors rather than a typical \"rat guillotine\" to decapitate their heads. In spite of the fact that scissors were hard on her hand, she found they were more precise than the guillotine. Rats, she said, \"don't have a neck like you and me, one that is distinguishable. So it is hard to tell where the back of the skull is sometimes, especially when they are fat, so you might accidentally cut into their brain\" (personal communication, April 8, 2015). Once animals were decapitated, she moves quickly to dissection because \"how we collect tissue is very important\" to preserve its integrity. Carrie explained: We need the tissue as fresh as possible, so I remove it once a rat is decapitated. It is in minutes that things degrade. And it depends on the tissue, too, because whatever enzymes or proteins we are looking for can degrade very quickly, so as soon as I take the tissues out, I put them on liquid nitrogen for freezing at -80F, and some of the tissues I also fix in paraffin for sectioning and staining later. Carrie cut through the rat's skin and skull, scooping out the brain with a spatula, laying it flat on a tray set on top of liquid nitrogen. This freezes the brain so that it \"keeps shape so we can identify the proper regions later.\" Once she removed the brain, Carrie then dissected the remainder of the body, removing organs and tissues. Using a narrow tool, Carrie peeled brown fat from between the shoulder area and white fat from the legs. For a large rat, this process took approximately forty minutes, and for newborn pups, it was approximately ten minutes. Organs and tissues were then placed in a buffer to keep them \"alive\" until they could be fixed or stained. At this stage, career technicians \"search for things\" in biomass that might prove fruitful for future experimental questions. While Carrie took steps to minimize stress, the details of her caretaking practices were not documented in the Lab's publications. This mirrors results found from a 2018 meta-analysis in the journal obesity reviews on the behavioral and physiological effects of housing on animal appetite and fat mass. According to that analysis, \"housing conditions are rarely considered as possible moderators of reported outcomes\" in obesity research (Schipper, Harvey, van der Beek, & van Dijk, 2018, p. 1). Science papers do include data on how animals are housed (e.g., type of cage, number per cage, sex of grouping, and weights), but what is missing, according to this report, is a discussion of how stress from housing and handling can affect a lab's results. For example, a typical entry in a methods section includes information on the model organism, type of cage, bedding, enrichment toy(s), source of food and water, and type of access to them. And, depending on the study, housing information might also include the number of animals housed in a group, their sex, and data on time and duration of isolation, if relevant. The Lab included certain details like how housing group size changes with body weight and when siblings in a litter were studied and needed to be isolated, but other than these descriptive details, which are indeed given in theirs and others science papers (there is nothing idiosyncratic or unique to the Lab in this regard), the possible physiological and psychological effects of the animals' housing environment and handling techniques were nevertheless only tracked in the Lab's internal record keeping documents. Perhaps, partly because of this, definitions of the optimal technical conditions for laboratory animals, organs, tissues, and cells vary by laboratory and by technician. No wonder, then, that I was repeatedly reminded, \"there is no protocol out there waiting for you. You have to create [protocols for each study and each experiment within the larger study]\" (personal communication, February 26, 2015). Even in other labs studying similar epigenetic and programming effects of maternal-HF and maternal-BPA on offspring, no one appears to do it quite the same way. I was informed that 90% of published papers are \"rubbish\" since they cannot be replicated. I was also told that not every bit of minutiae is included in papers' method sections, such as handling and the micro details of vivarium housing conditions. In addition to in vivo studies, the Lab performed in vitro studies that, ideally, were meant to support them, and which detailed the role of molecular mechanisms in enhancing or diminishing obese phenotypes. Eleanor explained that\u2026 [We] use the in vivo studies because they are close to humans, but [it is] limited by a lot. [You] can't make conditions the same. Animals have different attitudes. Some are more or less active, so you want to control all the conditions. You hope to support the in vivo study with the in vitro results. For Eleanor, sorting out the technical conditions of cell culture practices represented one way that anticipatory caretaking occurred in her work with tissue and cells derived from mice in the maternal-obesity studies. Eleanor specifically studied white and brown fat tissue, including adipogenesis (how white and brown fat cells are formed), thermogenesis, and the role of mitochondria in both types of cells. This was done to grasp functional differences in fat and glucose storage and expenditure between both types of cells. In gene knock-out experiments, Eleanor attempted to suppress or amplify specific proteins that are thought to be integral to adipogenesis, including the role of epigenetic transcription factor DNMT3a in the proliferation of preadipoctyes (stem cells) and their differentiation into fated white and brown fat cells (i.e., adipogenesis). But, as she said, there is \"no protocol out there waiting for you,\" and to \"get\u2026the optimal conditions,\" and she learned to anticipate and care for experimental conditions that embody the Lab's evolving hypotheses. By doing what appears to be controlled tinkering, she helped establish new experimental systems. One morning, as I sat in the laboratory watching Eleanor, I noticed the intense care she took to physically handle brown adipose cells as she delicately transferred them from one platform to the next, so as to not disturb them in the culture plates. Occasionally, wanting no interruptions, she would politely say, \"Sshh, no talking now,\" which was also often later followed up with a gentle smile, inviting me to observe cells under a microscope. During this 82 observation, Eleanor was in the midst of staining primary, brown fat cells derived from mouse sacrifices recently performed. Her goal was to help explain how thermogenesis in brown fat cells is impacted by fatty acid synthesis, storage, and metabolism; processes that complemented Carrie's in vivo studies with mice and rats. 17 On that particular day, Eleanor was testing the technical conditions of her cell culture to see if the cells had \"eaten\" the palmitate she fed them earlier in the week. Once they had been fed, Eleanor stained them with Oil Red O (ORO); a dye that is commonly used for visualizing triglycerides and lipids under microscope. With ORO, fat cells turn red, and the cell's nucleus turns blue. In short, it is a histological (tissue) visualization of fat cells. With this method, Eleanor checked for confluency (the proliferation and number of cells in a medium), and any possible contamination. The images were depicted on a computer screen and would \"tell\" Eleanor whether or not her cells were \"happy.\" As Eleanor peered down a microscope's lens studying these cells, she simultaneously raised a finger, pointing to a computer screen nearby that projects a fluorescent image of the cells onto it. Looking at the screen, I saw a constellation of red spots punctuated by blue nebulae. With a nod, Eleanor turned back to me to say they looked \"beautiful,\" and that Dr. Moore would be very happy with her results. Reflecting on this, she explained that [this is] \"why I like my job, and why I will stay for my whole career.\" In a brief moment that nonetheless seemed to capture her well-earned pride, Eleanor further reflected: Cells are just like your baby. Your cells are growing. You don't just respond. You want to see how they respond, e.g., to alcohol, to glucose, or fatty acids. You want to see their reaction. Do they survive? You have to know if your cell is happy or not. How to tell? Based on your experience. Every cell is different. There are a lot of signs to tell you if happy or not. First of all, the medium. Look at it. If it is dirty, the bottom of dish is foggy, a lot of other stuff, the cell won't be happy. We don't want a dirty bath. If there is floating stuff in medium, that is not happy. If the medium color changes, it is not good. If I have cells in the incubator, first thing I check are the cells. If I have to do an experiment, I have to check the cells. Before you leave, you check. Even if it is a holiday, you check. If it is the weekend, you might check once a day. Fortunately, I live very close. Eleanor's view that animal cells have become her babies reflects a common refrain among laboratory technicians. If any experiment is to work, cells and their milieu must be intimately understood and handled. It is her anticipatory caretaking through learning to read the \"signs\" (and anticipating possible signs of distress) that she is able to nurture cells, getting them to multiply and differentiate depending on the empirical question of interest. In other work with adipose tissue, Eleanor pharmacologically altered the message a protein received from the gene's messenger RNA by introducing a chemical that should silence the epigenetic transcription factor DNMT3A 18 . This process is known as transfection and is a technique that opens up pores in a cell's membrane so that its cytoplasm can take up the material introduced into it. The Lab had previously found that DNMT3a was suppressed in their maternal-food restriction model relative to the controls, so they were then exploring early suppression in their maternal-high fat experimental system. But, as with other experimental interventions, Eleanor modified her caretaking practices in anticipation of how a particular type of cell responded to her interventions. As I watched her transfect cells, she told me that she had to \"try different conditions.\" That day, she told me that it was \"not the real experiment.\" By this, Eleanor meant that she 18 \"DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha is particularly important for establishing DNA methylation patterns during development before birth. The enzyme also functions in early cells that can give rise to more mature cell types. In early blood cells, called hematopoietic stem cells, the methylation patterns established by DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha promote maturation (differentiation) into different blood cell types\" (National Institutes of Health, 2017b, para. 2). created multiple cell culture conditions-the cells' physical milieu-in order to figure out what worked best. Introducing a chemical into cell culture medium has to be \"sneaky.\" Cells have to think the chemical carrier (transfection reagent) is food so, like a Trojan horse, it can sneak in. Eleanor elaborated on this process by saying, The silencing -if it is successful or not depends on the cell density. Too much or too little, and it won't work. Very healthy cells are needed, so you need the ability to assess the density; you can't just follow the protocol. The protocol may tell you how many cells, but, no, that is not enough. You have to base on your experience because everybody's cell sizes are different. If a cell is big or small, the cell density is different, so then you have to seed the cells. Also, the silencing RNA-is it good? Every company says, 'my silencing RNA is good', that it can guarantee you will make silent. But no, you don't know. So, then, what carrier do you use? Every company says 'mine is good'. They say 'my carrier is non-toxic', but if it is non-toxic, it is not a good carrier. All these three together-the right cell numbers, a good silencing RNA, and a good carrier-they tell you whether the cell happy or not. For example, my cells might like the carrier, but Olivia's cells might refuse it. That is why we have testing all the time, how many cells, silencing RNA, and what and how much carrier to use. Lastly, siRNA and carrier ratioyou have to test it. It is very complex. After explaining this to me, she informed me that her work that day was testing cell numbers, siRNA, the carrier, and the ratio of carrier to cells needed to silence the protein without killing it. For each of the twelve wells in the culture plate she used for this initial testing phase, Eleanor created a different physical environment. Each well had a different technical condition meant to optimize the cell's health. \"So I hope at least one well will work,\" she said so that she could use that wells' \"condition to do my real experiment.\" After 48-72 hours, Eleanor checked the cells by staining them, collecting protein from inside them, and running a Western Blot to see which well (physical milieu) she created had silenced DNMT3a. Following this, Eleanor used the \"well with the right condition\" from her initial testing phase \"to do the real experiment.\" She commented that \"sometimes testing works, but the experiment doesn't. That's frustrating. It gives you a headache because you have to go back, and start over.\" Eleanor's anticipatory caretaking practices epitomize the argument here that technicians do not work in reaction to what is before them. They anticipate. Eleanor, and other career technicians, strategically plan and negotiate how and when to interact with the biological world. Each develops a \"feeling for the organism\" and, as they interact with the material world, it is necessarily transformed by their very interactions. On an intuitive plane, the process of caring for cells that once belonged to an entirely different organism became for Eleanor her cells, her \"babies.\" Thus, like an attentive parent who identifies with an organism, she learned how to optimally care for them, including how to feed, change, passage, and cultivate them. In this particular example, whether or not the cells ate palmitate was tantamount to decide if her cells were healthy and happy. Failing in any of this, her cells would not only die, but experiments would collapse, papers would not be published, and lab doors would eventually close. \"No funding, no job,\" she reminded me. Temporary technicians: Searching quickly for \"some\" positive story. Temporary technicians had two major roles in the Lab. First, they supported the career technicians and, therefore PIs, at the bench and, second, they helped represent the Lab in conference presentations with scientific posters they had co-authored. International Medical Graduates (IMGs) and the Medical Fellows need to fulfill their own medical school residency obligations that require them to generate scientific abstracts for conferences and, hopefully, produce at least one publication. For IMGs in particular, they need three abstracts (conference posters) during their brief tenure in the Lab while they also study for the US medical licensing exams. A revolving question at the bench and, in concert with PIs, is \"if the data is good, this can be your abstract for next year.\" In contrast to career technicians who have different long-term stakes in the Lab's continued success, these technicians simply need to \"get some story to tell.\" And these stories are inherently different than those cultivated by career technicians. Temporary technicians' studies were descriptive; they did not study causal epigenetic mechanisms like, for example, DNA methylation in gene knock out mice. Under their work conditions, I was told that \"you don't get to do groundbreaking research. It is incremental, bits of research that are very descriptive. It is not cause and effect. You cannot aspire [to publish in] Science because the work is not revolutionary or major.\" But, at the same, \"it also doesn't have to be,\" they said. In their words, then, \"a mid-level journal is okay.\" What these technicians needed to show was some modicum of evidence that they contributed to basic science research in order to graduate. While this is a rational approach to their work in the Lab, it nonetheless shapes the larger scene of obesity and metabolic syndrome studies and there is an epistemic effect, if minor, in the proliferation of \"normal science\" (Kuhn, 2012). The temporal positioning of their time in the Lab literally shapes the course, content, and trajectory of anticipatory caretaking in a more conservative direction (compared to career technicians) in obesity and metabolic studies. During one summer, for example, I observed temporary technicians as they built on the Lab's existing maternal-BPA experimental system to create their own trimmed down experimental models. Building on the Lab's previous work, the IMGs (Maryam and Veronica) and Medical Fellow (Julia) examined glucose and insulin signaling in the liver and skeletal muscle of rats. As a result, they studied biology and physiology while learning to handle tissues and cells for which they had little experience. Carrie sacrificed rats at day one of life, 21 days of life (at time of weaning and end of direct BPA exposure), and again at 10 months (adulthood) so that the temporary technicians could examine effects at different life stages. Empirical questions included whether or not deleterious health effects were present at day one and day 21 but, more importantly, whether any effects persist beyond birth and weaning and whether effects might vary by sex. In order to quickly get \"some story,\" then, temporary technicians focused on the hypothesized effects of BPA exposure on glucose and insulin signaling in the adult liver and skeletal muscle because, like fat tissue, they are relevant to metabolic health. 19 The liver plays a central role in controlling glucose production (a vital source of energy) and the regulation of insulin secretion. Likewise, skeletal muscle is an important organ for glucose homeostasis. According to Batista et al. (2012), even short-term treatment of male rats with low doses of BPA \"slows down whole body energy metabolism and disrupts insulin signaling in peripheral tissues\" like skeletal muscle (p. 1). In translational research terms, this data helps address risk of diabetes and insulin resistance due to BPA exposure. Because they need a relatively quick and, therefore safe study, Maryam, Veronica, and Julie explored the possible effects of early BPA exposure on male and female rats, but with an emphasis on timing at weaning and adulthood. Over the course of a few months, Maryam, Veronica, and Julia were indeed able to get \"positive results.\" They concluded that maternal-fetal BPA exposure has sex and tissue specific effects on adult rats. For example, adult males had impaired glucose tolerance and higher insulin secretion. This finding is also reflected in the scientific literature, but at present the underlying mechanisms that produce sex-specific outcomes are unknown (see footnote 7). Lab technicians, and others, theorize that the sex difference may be explained by BPA's interactions with estrogen receptors and estrogen-signaling pathways (Shanle & Xu, 2011). At the time of weaning, the main site of disruption in insulin signaling was the liver, but in adulthood it was the skeletal muscle. Glucose transporters such as \"GLUT\" proteins were disrupted at both weaning and adulthood, and they reflected general principles of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease. Based on their \"positive findings,\" each of the temporary technicians authored conference posters and subsequently published their work with PIs. For temporary technicians, in particular, the subject of authorship carries a different valence than it does for career technicians. While career technicians are often named third or fourth author, there is an understanding that authorship goes first to the PIs because career technicians work in exchange for a wage. For temporary technicians who are not paid, their compensation is in the form of shared first and second authorship. On occasion, this arrangement raises questions among technicians about \"who\" counts as a scientist and how, therefore, they are publically recognized. At a minimum, technicians at this Lab were the primary producers of data, whether that data was defined as \"raw\" or not. It is evident \"their hard work and enthusiasm,\" went into caring for the Lab's experimental systems, as well as each other as they co-produced laboratory knowledge together. In a contemporary lab such as my research site, there is no clear distinction between PIs and technicians in terms of intellectual labor, but there is a clear distinction about forms of anticipatory caretaking of the data that is itself shaped by one's temporal positioning in the Lab."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "As I have argued in this chapter, biomedical research in the Lab, and at academic, basic science labs across the country, is dependent on a class of highly educated scientific workers who are vulnerable to a precarious funding landscape as well as political shifts in immigration status. The ethnographic data on \"technicians\" in the Lab reflect larger trends in the biomedical workforce as documented by the National Institutes of Health, the National Research Council, and the National Academies of Science. Based on national-level, biomedical workforce data, \"it is difficult to consider the U.S. biomedical research enterprise without acknowledging the critical role played by scientists from outside the U.S.\" (NRC, 2005, p. 6). Yet these same national committees also acknowledge that we know very little about non-citizens who help constitute our biomedical workforce and how this might shape the overall pace and course of scientific endeavors. My observations suggest that technicians' political and economic vulnerability translates into occupational stability for the PIs. While all technicians (and PIs) in the Lab experience economic precarity because of grant-based funding, there is variation in caretaking practices that depends on their occupational status as either a career or temporary technician. In addition to the scientific knowledge technicians bring to the Lab, I have argued that they develop what I call anticipatory caretaking practices in the course of doing experimental science. All technicians \"search around the unknown for direction,\" but in ways that are subject to their own temporal positioning in the Lab. Having a \"feeling for\" something is contingent on one's own positioning as either a career or temporary technician. Academic career technicians are much more likely to push conceptual and material interventions in new ways as a form of taking care of the Lab's experimental systems. Temporary technicians, however, are more inclined to pursue conservative research topics within established paradigms because they need quick, positive results that will reinforce their own professional development timelines, performing what Thomas Kuhn (2012) referred to as \"normal science.\" For both, the knock-on effects of anticipatory care practices shape the finished knowledge product. It is not that negative results are uninteresting for the Lab (because they do raise additional empirical questions), or that they are somehow perceived as a poor reflection on the Lab's reputation or its citations. Rather, it is 90 the fact that the pressure to produce positive results is built into the systems of science-based immigration and medical professionalization, which non-citizen \"technicians\" are subject to. I have found that technicians are not only producing \"all the data\" for PIs, they are doing so within larger structural forms of power that enter into and shape experimental systems to begin with. It is impossible for me to say exactly what the impact of these forms of precarity are on the overall production of scientific knowledge in obesity and metabolic studies, but I have observed that the overall production of findings in the Lab, and especially the production of positive findings, are profoundly and intimately connected not just to technicians' economic livelihood but to citizenship itself.\nIn this chapter, I have argued that academic PIs in basic science work under particular \"conditions of possibility\" unique to this era of funding (Shapin, 2008, p. 229). PIs are obliged to do more communication work than experimental work. Their anticipatory caretaking labor practices are therefore at the level of inscription, not inscribing. Because of their dependence on external support, the pace of their work is largely dictated by grant-funding cycles. Established PIs, while under pressure to secure their own funds, have more intellectual freedom to pursue research questions than their subordinates. Faced with competition for scarce tenure-track academic positions, and in light of uncertainty in grant-based funding, younger investigators in particular face a singularly embattled plight as they try over many years to gain independence. A dichotomy exists for these new investigators where they must build on existing systems in a laboratory, but in order to secure their own funding they have to show senior or first authorship on papers. Yet, senior PIs also need senior authorship for their grants. This creates a tense situation where senior PIs must make sacrifices in order to help young investigators establish themselves. Established PIs, while under mounting pressure to secure their own funds as well, have more intellectual freedom to pursue research questions than their subordinates. Nevertheless, for both dependent and established PIs, a precarious funding terrain affects knowledge production. \"What's hot\" is what is funded, and this reality not only reinscribes the medicalization of popular concerns, such as obesity and diabetes, but also siphons off money that theoretically could be spent on other empirical questions; affecting the overall scope of basic science research. We can never know which questions go unasked in a laboratory. What I have observed is that certain aspects of a very complex biological field are made legible because the national mood is fixated on obesity as an imminent health threat to the nation's security in terms of medical costs and labor force productivity. While I am not an expert in the Lab's field of study and have not offered a critique of the science from within, I have mapped out a \"regime of perceptibility\" (Murphy, 2006) in which certain biological things rise to significance in the Lab. The ARC, for example, illustrates how the NIH's interest in addiction intersects with a medical problem to induce a course of action in the Lab, e.g., to study how neurons can be programmed and possibly reprogrammed to have the 'right' ratio of satiety to hunger neurons. We see, then, that by making certain biological things legible, while others remain boxed, definitions and relations between bodies and the environment shift in their meaning and significance."}, {"section_title": "91", "text": "Chapter 3"}, {"section_title": "Biological Labor and the Biomedical Production of Environmental Subjecthood", "text": "Even when we are asleep, our bodies are performing biological labor in our circulatory system, respiratory system, even at the cellular and molecular levels of metabolism and gene expression\u2026A body that never stops laboring is also a biology defined by production, a species being defined by its own particular type of labor. Eugene Thacker, 2005, p. 117. Vitality can now be decomposed, stabilized, frozen, banked, stored, commoditized, accumulated, exchanged, traded across time, space, across organs and species, across diverse contexts and enterprises in the service of both health and wealth. Nikolas Rose, 2007, p. 3, my emphasis. In this chapter, I draw on my observations at University Lab (Lab) to argue that epigenetics and Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (Developmental Origins) of obesity offer a \"window on the ways that environmentally defined [biomedical] subjects are constituted\" (Olson, 2010, p.171). In making this claim, I build on Hannah Landecker's (2007 argument that \"altering any kind of biology\u2026is to alter what it is to be biological\" (2007, p. 223-235). Specifically, \"to be biological\" at the Lab is to be fat, to eat fat, to store fat, and to reproduce fat offspring because of uterine and neonatal exposure to either a high-fat diet or the ubiquitous chemical bisphenol-A (BPA) (p. 235). In short, the Lab experimentally studies the social nature of physiological functioning, i.e., how chemical and nutritional exposures change biology and physiology in animal models of human health. Their work reflects the larger concern raised by environmental obesity researchers who argue that we live in an \"obesogenic\" (Gr\u00fcn & Blumberg, 2006) landscape specific to the \"Anthropocene\" era (Crutzen & Stoermer, 2000). Hence my assertion here, and in chapter 1, that we are witnessing an environmental turn in obesity and metabolism studies. How, then, does the Lab investigate the physiological functioning of social nature? How do mice and rat models of human health become environmentally constituted by the altered nutritional and chemical landscapes of the Lab's \"experimental systems\" (Rheinberger, 1993, p. 444 focus on the cellular and molecular work done with animal cells and tissues. These elements evidence the broader claim that there are new forms of \"what it means to be biological\" in an age of anthropogenic obesity (Landecker, 2007, p. 223-235). As a result, I argue, the Lab produces environmental, biomedical subjecthood and the epigenetically at-risk individual (Waldby, 2002;Rose, 2000). In addition to showing how the Lab produces environmental, biomedical subjecthood, I further argue that animals and their disaggregated bodies are part of the production process in which laboratory facts are made. I therefore argue that to \"be biological\" at the Lab not only entails a reorganization of animal biology and physiology in environmental terms, but it also means that animal subjects (biomass) physically labor alongside the \"fluid properties of human and nonhuman agents in powerful interactions and productions\" in the build-up of scientific knowledge and capital (Landecker, 2007, p. 223-235;Rapp, 2000, p. 211;Bourdieu, 2004). This argument builds on questions of what it means to labor in an era in which scientific capital (Bourdieu, 1998(Bourdieu, , 2004 accumulation often depends on the molecular appropriation and extraction of use and exchange value from non-humans (Marx, 1867). In short, I argue that \"innovation value\" (Cooper & Waldby, 2004, p. 3) derives as much from the labor of animal biomass as it does humans enrolled in clinical trials. Model animals, no less than humans, are mined for novel disease patterns that investigators use to create valuable scientific data. The labor of animal \"vitality\" (Rose, 2007, p. 3) is harnessed to produce use and exchange value for the obesity market, and to reproduce symbolic (reputational) and economic (grant) capital for the Lab's investigators (Bourdieu, 2013). The fact that it is non-humans who are enrolled in a labor relation to scientific capital makes no difference in the material outcome: valuable data for the obesity market is extracted from their biological labor in the laboratory. Therefore, in addition to showing how the Lab's produces environmental subjecthood, I also argue that animal biomass (as living elements of experimental systems) is itself entrained to be productive of scientific data within a very specific economic framework informed by a national health crisis. To illustrate these points, I organize this chapter as follows: First, I draw a broad picture of the Lab's Developmental Origins systems used to study adiposity and appetite. Second, I explain two experimental systems, maternal high-fat and maternal-BPA, in greater detail. "}, {"section_title": "Developmental Origins Models of Appetite and Adiposity", "text": "Broadly speaking, the Lab employs multiple developmental \"experimental systems\" to study two primary outcomes: appetite regulation and the development and function of adipose tissue (Rheinberger, 1997). The systems vary by treatment source: a high-fat \"Western\" diet or BPA, the timing of exposures, developmental and metabolic pathways associated with appetite and adiposity, and proteins believed to modify gene expression and, ultimately, the downstream function of cells, tissues, and organs. In the Lab's nutrition-based experimental systems, a maternal obesity/high-fat diet model was used to elucidate mechanisms that program the hypothalamic appetite pathway in a rodent model of human health. This model is also used to identify mechanisms that govern adipogenesis (the process of cell differentiation in which preadipoctyes become adipocytes, i.e., mature fat cells) and lipogenesis (the process of fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis). Further, two models of food restriction were explored to study the effects of a calorie-restricted diet (via the thrifty phenotype hypothesis of fast growth catch-up for low birth weight pups) on the same two outcomes. 20 Interestingly, the Lab also began to study the possibility of re-programming a balance of neurons in the hypothalamic appetite pathway by changing nutrition conditions in infancy. 21 The Lab's work in the \"appetite remodeling\" experimental system is explored in detail in chapter 4. In the maternal bisphenol-A systems, appetite and adiposity are both studied because it is Animals are studied at different times throughout their life-course (e.g., fetal, neonatal, at weaning, adult, and during pregnancy) and at different scales (e.g., in vivo and in vitro studies). Technicians perform in vivo studies during pregnancy, the lactation and weaning periods of newborn pups, adult life, and the offspring of (previously) exposed adult mice and rats to explore Carrie, [the animal technician], monitors the animals, and what we start with are phenotypes like body fat measurements taken through DEXA scans, glucose tolerance, and blood pressure. We call these the phenotype of the animal. In a very practical sense, then, stages of empirical investigation are shaped by findings that result from inductive and deductive reasoning. Beginning with the most descriptive detail provided at the level of whole animals (in vivo studies), the Lab delves into the particularities of molecular mechanisms in adipogenesis, lipogenesis, and altered glucose states. In the course of these studies, the productive and reproductive labor of biomass contributes value to the obesity market as raw material, or data, that is transformed ultimately into scientific capital. This data, in turn, is advocated as a necessary contributor to the global fight against obesity and metabolic syndrome. Indeed, a reading of the literature on the environmental epigenetics of pregnancy shows that authors begin and conclude their publication with a translational call to apply their data toward better and earlier preventative and therapeutic approaches to metabolic disorders. Now that I have drawn a broad picture of the Lab's experimental systems, I go into further ethnographic detail in the pages below. I elaborate on the maternal obesity model on programmed adiposity. Using two examples from this system, I will show how the Lab's practices with gene silencing, on the one hand, and the transdifferentiation (functional conversion) of white fat cells into the behavior of brown fat, on the other, reveal how the vitality of biomass is harnessed in the name of human health and therefore made to biologically labor differently in order to become environmentally constituted subjects. In the second experimental system, the maternal BPA system for programmed adiposity, I will to show how environmental subjecthood is produced through the lens of chemical exposure. For both experimental systems, the biology and physiology of animals is quite literally caused to function differently (i.e., to become fat) as a result of exposures. In both systems, biomass is differently and environmentally constituted."}, {"section_title": "Experimental system #1 -Maternal high-fat diet and programmed adiposity. The", "text": "Lab used a classic strain of laboratory rats called Sprague Dawley\u00ae, which were purchased from Charles River Laboratories, a long-standing breeder. The Sprague Dawley\u00ae rat, created in 1925, is a widely used animal model in biomedical research in particular for in utero studies of reproductive toxicity and nutrition because of its similar metabolic pathways to humans. Due to the rat's scientific popularity, a British research firm goes so far as to describe it as the \"workhorse of reproductive endocrinology\" (Rothrock, 2017). Another breeder of the Sprague Dawley\u00ae rat highlights-in its technical data-that in addition to color (white) and physiological parameters, females are \"good breeders\" with \"strong maternal instinct\" (Janvier Labs, 2018). This may or may not mean dams (mothers) are less likely to commit infanticide than other strains of rats. The average life expectancy of a Sprague Dawley\u00ae is three years, but one breeder characterizes the \"economic reproductive ability\" of both males and females as only six-to-nine months (Taconic, n.d.). Reproduction can occur as early as week six, and gestation lasts 21-23 days. A typical litter consists of eleven pups. They tolerate high-fat diets, and they have similar hemochorial placentation (fetus establishes its own circulatory system) as humans. Importantly, rats are nocturnal and therefore only mate (and prefer to eat) when the lights are off. In a humorous recollection of how her initial set-up of a rat colony was failing, Dr. Moore said that she and others were confounded by the fact that their rats were not reproducing. A security guard who walked the rounds at night inquired as to why no one turned off the lights in the animal room when leaving for the night. Apparently, no one at the lab had realized the lighting cycle had been tripped. Lastly, epigenetic tools (e.g., microarrays, gene knock-down assays, and antibodies that are used for tissue specific gene profiling to measure protein expression) are widely available for mice in particular. In a dedicated animal housing room (vivarium) located a building away from the PIs' office, there were several hundred ventilated cages nested on top of one another, from floor to average adult height, containing over one hundred animals, both rats and mice, individually housed. Within this large space, Carrie, the animal technician, monitored the air temperature, humidity, sounds, 12-hour light/dark cycles, and \"environmental stimuli\" (simple toys) for the animals in order to support their physical wellbeing and to reduce environmental stressors as much as one can in an extremely artificial milieu. For example, the fact that Carrie conducted her work during the day, with the lights on, disturbs their natural, nocturnal circadian rhythms and, therefore, she created the data (blood pressure in particular) out of the labor of a sleepy rat, at least to some degree. In addition to routine maintenance and measurements, Carrie tended to animal feeding and reproductive labor, which is highly orchestrated in an experimental laboratory. Regarding animal feeding, the Lab used, from an array of possible diets that vary by composition (sugar, fatty acids, carbohydrates, protein) and percentages of individual ingredients, a control diet containing 10% fat (control) and an experimental high-fat 60% (HF) diet purchased from a wellknown external vendor of obesity diets. The HF \"food\" is a pink pellet that resembles a tube of lip balm and is so greasy it has to be shipped on dry ice to prevent melting. An HF diet begins with rats before and during gestation. They are provided water and fed ad libitum, i.e., without restriction, and are assigned to either the control or HF diet for eight weeks before pregnancy. Within this experimental system, pregnant rats will eventually be sorted into four exposure groups that are circumscribed by the timing of pregnancy and lactation. The four exposure groups, then, are control (pregnancy)/control (lactation), HF/HF, HF/control, and control/HF. The biological and physiological effects of \"food as exposure\" on animals are shown in the molecular and cellular work described below (Landecker, 2011, p. 169). The experimental point of switching diets during lactation is to address questions around the plasticity of epigenetics that exist in tension with the determinism of programming; questions like: Once harmful exposure has been removed (i.e., pups are switched to the HF/control diet), how does the animal's metabolic profile change, if at all, as a result of an improved nutritional environment? What happens in subsequent generations is also materially explored to understand better whether or not epigenetic marks persist in the germline (which will develop into eggs and sperm) in the absence of harmful exposure during pregnancy and lactation. In other words, do the effects of what \"grandma\" ate persist into the third generation? To this end, rats are further bred to study the transgenerational effects, if any, of control and HF diets on long-term metabolic health. Questions like these involve the biological labor of mother and her offspring. Carrie collected multiple data points used to characterize the animals' phenotypes; the first stage of \"getting a handle on what is going on.\" On a daily basis, she measured individual weight and food intake, and at postnatal weeks three and twenty-four, she performed an in vivo DEXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) scan to record body composition of lean and fat tissue mass. She also measured blood pressure using a tail cuff and performed an anesthetized tail bleed procedure to draw blood for glucose tolerance tests. Although it may seem these are straightforward measurements, they are in fact time-consuming. During a day of observation with Carrie, it took more than three hours to obtain blood pressure for a handful of animals. The size and disposition of the animal (some are more physically active than others even though Sprague Dawley's\u00ae are noted for their docility) affect the ease or difficulty of obtaining measurements, and so does environmental stress. For example, although we sat in a quiet room adjacent to the vivarium, we noted that our talking and the fact that it was during their sleep cycle were likely stressing the animals, which complicated Carrie's task and affected the measurements she took. In more invasive and terminal procedures, she also collected plasma to measure levels of insulin, corticoid steroids, triglycerides, and leptin from several animals at three weeks of age and again at week twenty-four. To collect a relatively larger sample of blood (techniques yield varying amounts), one male and one female of each litter were additionally \"deeply anesthetized\" in a terminal procedure called cardiac puncture. After this, animals were dissected, and Carrie removed tissues and organs so that Eleanor and Olivia could begin the molecular and cellular work of analyzing fat cells, proteins, hormones, and metabolites extracted from the animal's biomass. Sacrifices are made at various stages of life, from embryos to adulthood. Embryos (and therefore their mothers) are sacrificed on a specific gestational day in order to halt a so-called critical window of development and to collect tissue, organs, and derive cells from them. At the other end of the life course, adults are sacrificed to study possible long-term programming effects on their health. Brains, brown and white fat tissue, skeletal tissue, liver, and other metabolic organs are scooped and stripped from animal's body according to research protocols. Immediately following dissection, the tissue is kept alive by either fixing or freezing it according to specific research needs. Cells can then later be derived from various tissues in order to measure protein expression, i.e., epigenetic expression of a gene. In each of these steps, the type (control versus high-fat diet) of environmental exposure Epigenetics is the addition of information (text) on top of an underlying sequence of letters or base pairs called (for short) A, C, G, and T that make up the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) of a gene. Signals from the environment such as maternal nutrition activate proteins called transcription factors, which themselves are encoded by genes. According to the historian and philosopher of science Evelyn Fox Keller (2015), \"today's genome, the postgenome\" is more of a regulatory device for the production of specific proteins than a collection of genes that deterministically form traits (p. 25;Keller, 2014 (Richardson, 2015, p. 29). Neither the environment nor biology are imagined in binary terms within the logic of epigenetics and yet, precisely in order to do research, PIs must formalize differences between the two. During an early morning meeting at the Lab, I sat with investigators and technicians as they mapped out possible directions to take with a transcription factor called HES-1 22 , a protein involved with cell proliferation and differentiation of preadipoctyes into mature adipocytes. Epigenetics is a controlled selective way to show how gene silencing might contribute to the phenotype of fat storage. While the technician Eleanor explained some initial results with genesilencing work, an investigator elaborated on their intentions 23 : We've said they [animal tissue] store more fat than the controls, but what is driving that? We find in stem cells [MSCs] that they produce more fat cells\u2026there is an increased proliferation of them. One of the factors is called transcription factor HES-1, so in order to prove that it is HES-1 driving the increase, we are going to suppress the gene's expression. That experiment is called siRNA or silencing the gene. If you silence the gene, then we should see no proliferation. To prove that this is the relevant factor, one way to prove it is to knock down the gene, or you overexpress it or use pharmacological modulators that either activate or suppress it. This is the stage where we are trying to prove that HES-1 is the one. (Personal communication, February 2, 2015) HES-1 might indeed be an essential factor in adipogenesis. For example, according to Ross, Rao, and Kadesch\"s 2004 study, \"Hes-1 has two roles in adipogenesis: one promotes adipogenesis, possibly through the down-regulation of inhibitory proteins\u2026and the other inhibits adipogenesis at a step prior to the induction [of the 'master regulators' of adipogenesis] C/EBP and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\" (p. 3505;Farmer, 2007). This is an important contribution because it provides a possible explanation, \"at a step prior\" to differentiation, as to how MSCs proliferate and become pre-adipocytes. Understanding the commitment phase of MSCs to preadipoctyes, then, illustrates a novel and burgeoning area of adipocyte biology and reflects the particular work done with transcriptional gene silencing at the Lab, as shown in the passage above. In order to practice gene silencing, adipose tissue is extracted from laboratory animals (from both control and experimental groups) at different life stages between early age and adulthood. Even though fresh biomass is considered trickier to handle by technicians, it is preferable to buying, for example, a well-known preadipoctye commercial cell line such as 3T3- In another example of how the Lab's modulate animal biology, the PIs and technicians attempted to get white fat cells to 'act like' brown cells function (Cedikova et al., 2016). White fat tissue stores fat while brown fat burns fat through thermogenesis (the production of heat and burning of calories). Because of this functional difference between white and brown adipose tissue, brown fat is routinely regarded as 'better' because it burns rather than stores fat. This type of experimental practices at this Lab and in others is sometimes referred to as the 'beige-ing of adipose tissue. One experimental possibility is to increase the number of mitochondria (cytoplasmic organelles inside cells that are involved with metabolic pathways and adipocyte differentiation) in white fat cells because mitochondria itself it is thought to be a critical fat burning property in brown adipose tissue. In this vein, investigators discuss whether or not \"we can convert properties\" of white adipose tissue to be more like brown adipose tissue (personal communication, January 26, 2015). According to a PI, the white adipose tissue would still \"be\" white adipose tissue under these conditions, but it would newly possess \"pseudo-brown characteristics\" by burning off more energy through extra mitochondria. In this example of browning or beige-ing fat, we find that not only the material conditions of biological possibility are altered, but biology is itself understood as something akin to a chemical technology that can be destabilized and reconstituted into a new biological form: beige fat. If this form of altered biology ever succeeded here or elsewhere, the Lab considers it would be hugely profitable for the medical market. In both of the examples above-gene-silencing HES-1 in order to curb adipogenesis, and the molecular attempts at browning white adipose tissue by pushing white fat cells toward an increase in cellular mitochondria-the Lab transformed biology via experimental means. In order to mimic human obesity within the maternal-fetal model of Developmental Origins and epigenetics, animals were exposed to a maternal high-fat diet, programming them for obese phenotypes. Subsequently, the Lab performed molecular and cellular work, studying transcription factors that regulate the cascading effects of exposure on developmental pathways. Early developmental pathways and their transcriptional regulators become subject to the \"molecular gaze\" of epigenetics and Developmental Origins models of health and disease. These processes reflect Rayna Rapp's observations (1999, p.192) that the \"natural\" and the \"social\" are entangled in laboratory practices. She also wrote: Laboratories do not accommodate objects like human chromosomes in their natural forms; they are not bound by their locations in the wombs of pregnant women or their natural chronology\u2026When viewed through the lens of the laboratory, the 'chromosomes' produced by cell culture are not natural objects but cultural ones\u2026they become knowable only through the myriad sociotechnical interventions which enable and produce them as objects of scientific investigation. In this sense, 'tissue culture' has a doubled meaning: It is at once a technique for growing cells, and an enrollment of biological material for making human meanings. (p. 213) As with chromosomes in Rapp's study of amniocentesis, biological matter (tissues, organs, cells) is extracted, decontextualized, and disrupted from the temporal rhythms of a previously embodied life. Unlike Rapp's study, though, the work done at the Lab was for the larger knowledge market and was therefore part of the circulation of scientific capital, raising additional questions about capital accumulation and labor in biomedical modes of production (Haraway, 2008). The Lab's practices with gene silencing and the transdifferentiation (functional conversion) of white fat cells into the behavior of brown fat reveal how the vitality of biomass is harnessed in the name of human health and made to labor in the material construction of an environmentally constituted subject. Experimental system #2 -Maternal-BPA and programmed adiposity. The Lab's work with the maternal-BPA similarly demonstrates how animal labor is harnessed to produce \"innovation value\" (Waldby & Cooper, 2004, p. 3) In this context, the harmful exposure is As it was shown in the high-fat diet experimental system, the age of exposure to BPA is particularly relevant because it is during very early life that organs and physiological systems develop. Unfortunately, according to data from the National Health and Nutritional Health Survey, BPA has been detected in maternal serum, breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluid, and fetal serum (Woodruff, Zota, & Schwartz, 2011). Intrauterine programming is said to occur from environmental chemicals such as BPA that enter into the intrauterine environment, which, in turn, impacts postnatal outcomes in metabolism, endocrine systems, cardiovascular system, reproduction, and behavior (for example, appetite). As a result, the field of endocrine disruption describes early exposure and effects of EDCs and obesogens on biology and physiology as the \"developmental basis of adult disease\" (Diamanti-Kandarakis et al., 2009). In the Lab's maternal BPA experimental systems, researchers examined altered cell number of adipocytes, modified adipocyte tissue function (tissue inflammation), modified gene expression, and the effects of BPA on re-setting the hormonal axes (between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands) in offspring. One hypothesis, similar to that of the maternal high-fat diet system, is that maternal exposure to BPA during pregnancy and lactation increases offspring adiposity and adipose tissue inflammation (a response to overnutrition that triggers inflammation which induces insulin resistance). If fat cells are more sensitive glucocorticoids (which BPA binds to), then fat cells may divide more quickly and may, therefore, contribute to the BPA animals becoming fatter (Emanuela et al., 2012). A second related hypothesis is that maternal exposure to BPA during pregnancy and lactation is also associated with metabolic abnormalities such as glucose intolerance in the offspring. Once again using a rat model organism, the Lab mated males and females at nine weeks of age, and then exposed pregnant females to either the control group (BPA-free drinking water) or the experimental group (BPA is added to the water supply). After lactation, the pups were weaned and both groups of offspring were given BPA-free water supply. Both male and female pups were measured using DEXA (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), a non-invasive tool that produces data on body composition, including total mass, fat mass versus lean mass, and percentage of the overall body. Pups were measured at three weeks of age and again at six months. Once these measurements were gathered, the animals were sacrificed to study transcription factors associated with adipogenesis. Some of the transcription factors were the same as in the maternal high-fat model (because they are crucial to adipogenesis) and included PPARy2 and C/EBP. In a concurrent study, additional rats were sacrificed at different time points, from one-day-old to three weeks of age to test protein expression in vitro. In this manner, the Lab grappled with the timing and effects of exposure, and also its absence, to assess whether or not effects persist over the offspring's lifetime. Lastly, technicians used the Western Blotting technique to measure protein expression in a target gene by transcription factors. The Lab produced both negative and positive results in the maternal-BPA experimental system. Once, at weaning (3 weeks of age), there was no difference in basal plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, or cholesterol for either male or female offspring. Additionally, there appeared to be no effect of BPA on maternal weight or food intake (appetite) during pregnancy and lactation. They did find, however, that BPA offspring had increased body fat mass at three weeks of age, resulting perhaps from enhanced adipogenesis and adipose tissue inflammation. As for metabolic abnormalities, females only showed an increase in triglycerides and altered fatty acid metabolism both of which are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Male BPA offspring, on the other hand, showed altered glucose tolerance and insulin signaling relative to females. BPA appears to have sex-specific effects on offspring. Finally, both males and females had increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion at six months of age. In sum, depending on sex, BPA offspring showed altered biological and physiological processes involved with a proliferation of fat cells. Whether the amount of fat tissue itself or the function of it matters most, is up for debate. A wrinkle in these studies is the fact that control animals themselves had detectable levels of BPA in their plasma. This points to the degree to which even animals bred in highly controlled environments are already environmentally constituted by harmful exposure; something that is not a small problem for experimenters since \"getting measured is not a trivial issue\" (personal communication, May, 10, 2015). One PI informed me that \"people get worried about the results\" because there is no \"standardized method of measuring BPA\" (personal communication, May, 10, 2015). Nonetheless, the Lab attempted to minimize troubles by using BPA-free cages, glass water bottles, tinkering with the experimental dose of BPA, and even monitoring the rubber nubs on water stoppers to make sure rats were not nibbling on them. Still, as their results indicated, it is impossible to avoid exposure even in so-called control animals. To summarize, when biomedical investigators, such as those at my research site, intervene on nonhuman biological actants, they do so from the position that fat cells are \"living technologies\" that can be harnessed, modified, and upgraded through the right diet and pharmaceuticals if only mechanisms that lead to increased adiposity are found (Landecker, 2007). For Landecker, understanding the history and practices of cell tissue culture provides an example of \"how humans have come to regard and interact with living matter through the framework of life as technology\" (p. 2). In her example, \"techniques of plasticity and temporality\" associated with biotechnology \"changes what it is to be biological\" (p. 233). By extension, in a maternal-fetal model of health and disease, the underlying \"plasticity and temporality\" of epigenetic and Developmental Origins logic points to how the environment changes what it means to be biological. Whether one defines the environment as internal (the womb) or external (food, BPA), the central biomedical site of \"power-laden interventions\" in these scientific models is in a gene-environment interaction between mother, fetus, and the broader nutritional and chemical landscape (Olson, 2010, p. 181). In both of the Lab's experimental systems, I have shown that \"what it is to be biological\" at the Lab is to be environmentally constituted by diet and chemical exposure (Landecker, 2007(Landecker, , 2011. As a result, I have argued that animals are made to live life differently and their bodies are made to labor in particular ways as a direct consequence of nutritional and chemical exposure during \"critical windows\" of development (Burggren & Mueller, 2015, p. 91). Capital is a defining theoretical construct in sociology. In science and technology studies, scholars have redefined core capital-related concepts such as \"use-\" and \"exchange-value\" to analyze vast shifts in the material conditions of capital accumulation specific to biotechnology and biomedicine in the 21 st century (Marx, 1867). The \"conjuncture of economic action and contemporary biotechnology\" that characterizes the late 20 th and early 21 st century has been summarized by Stefan Helmreich (2008) as follows: Scholarship in the social and cultural study of biology has suggested that in the age of biotechnology, when the substances and promises of biological materials, particularly stem cells and genomes, are increasingly inserted into projects of product-making and profit-seeking, we are witnessing the rise of a novel kind of capital: biocapital. (p. 464) In accordance with this revision of capital accumulation, science studies scholars today trace historical shifts in how the \"appropriation of living nature\" and the (re-)production of capital occurs at the molecular level (Helmreich, 2008, p. 463;Waldby, 2000Waldby, , 2002Waldby & Mitchell, 2006;Ritvo, 1995;Franklin & Lock, 2003;Rajan, 2006;Thompson, 2005). Further, Helmreich argues that a focus on biocapital also \"fixes attention on the dynamics of labour and commoditization that characterize the making and marketing of such entities as industrial and pharmaceutical byproducts\" (Helmreich, 2008, p. 464). Aside from a few notable exceptions, however, the question of what constitutes labor continues to revolve around humans and human biological matter in a binary that remains structured by Karl Marx's 19 th -century theories of surplus labor and capital accumulation. On first consideration, it seems impossible to argue that nonhumans \"labor\" because they cannot sell their labor power; a central proposition in Marx's theory of labor (1867) and what, for him, amounted to a key condition of what makes man, \"man\" (see also Herzig & Subramaniam, 2017). But, as Donna Haraway (2008) has argued, \"the commodities of interest to those who live within the regime of Lively Capital [biotechnology, for example] cannot be understood within the categories of the natural and social that Marx\u2026was finally unable to do under the goad of human exceptionalism\" (Haraway, 2008, p. 46). In this vein, the philosopher of science Eugene Thacker (2005) has reimagined Marx's \"species being\" and Michel Foucault's (1978Foucault's ( , 1979 notion of \"biopolitics.\" Thacker argues that the \"biotech industry appropriates the species being at the molecular, genetic, and informatics levels, and doing so, it refashions human biological life activity or labor power as a form of nonhuman production\" (p. 40). The traditional activity of selling and buying of labor power exists differently in a biotechnological mode of production. There is a \"continual transformation of biological value and medical value into economic value, a continual refashioning of the [molecular] species being as at once biological and economic, as a form of 'biomaterial labor'\" (p. 47). For Thacker, therefore, \"labor power is cellular, enzymatic, and genetic\" in markets that are organized by the imperative to produce surplus value for scientific capital (p. 45; Bourdieu, 2004, p. 27). \"Paradoxically,\" he writes, \"in the biotech industry, what is valued is not human labor, but the specific labor power or life activity of cells, molecules, and genes\" (p. 40). In a second example of renewed thinking about lively labor, Catherine Waldby (2000) argues that stem cells and tissues for transplant markets become a source of \"biovalue,\" which is defined by \"the generative and transformative productivity of living entities [that] can be instrumentalized along lines which make them useful for human projects\" (p. 33; Waldby & Mitchel, 2006). Additionally, \"clinical labor\" occurs at the \"suborganismic level of the body\" in, for example, human clinical trials and tissue and organ donation (Cooper & Waldby, 2014, p. 12). This form of labor, argues Melinda Cooper and Catherine Waldby (2014), \"consists precisely in the endurance or risk and exposure to nonpredictable experimental effects that may be actively harmful, rather than therapeutic\" for the participants (p. 8). Under these conditions, clinical trial participants are enrolled in a \"process of valorization of a particular bioeconomic sector\" in which their 'services' constitute a labor relation with capital \"through either the production of experimental data or the transfer of tissue\" (Cooper & Waldby, 2014, p. 1, 7;Waldby, 2000;Franklin & Lock, 2003;Petryna, 2009). Building on these recent works, I argue that in a biomedical mode of production where \"innovation value\" amounts to the production of scientific data which is then converted into other forms of capital, the broader question of what constitutes labor emerges for nonhumans too (Cooper & Waldby, 2004, p. 3). I argue that \"fostering life\" historically, and most often, centers first on harnessing the generative and value-producing capacities of nonhuman biological actants in the name of human health in accordance to Foucault (1978). Animal biomass provides a \"living material base for contemporary life science\" that is itself the infrastructure for modeling human health and disease (Helmreich, 2008, p. 463;Landecker, 2007, p. 2). The \"appropriation of living nature,\" therefore, occurs through animal bodies at the Lab as much as it occurs through human labor at the Lab or human labor in experimental trials. Although there is no immediate market profitability for the embodied work products of animals and their constitutive elements at my specific research site, the \"enrolled population\" of experimental animals for basic science research is nevertheless a \"form a resource that can be data mined\" for disease patterns in much the same way as a business can \"mine the everyday world of consumption patterns\" (Mitchell, 2010, p. 8). Rather than selling scientific data on the obesity market as commercial labs do, data-the conversion of blood and flesh into alpha and numeric symbols-is exchanged and converted into other forms of capital that include economic (grant funding) and symbolic (reputational) capital in the scientific field (Bourdieu, 1986). Further, even though Cooper and Waldby's (2014) characterization of \"clinical labor\" is based on humans and their biological matter, the emphasis placed on the \"valorization\" of capital through the production of goods (whether in the form of data or biological commodities) fits with the question provoked by my findings, as well as Donna Haraway's (2008) question as to whether \"human labor power turns out to be only part of the story of lively capital\" (Haraway, 2008, p. 46). I therefore extend Catherine Waldby's (2002) concept of \"biovalue\" defined by the \"yield of vitality produced by the biotechnical reformulation of living processes\" to include the labor of biomass at the Lab (Waldby, 2002, p. 310). Following Cooper & Waldby (2014), I argue that the same production of \"surplus fragmentary vitality\" is similarly situated in nonhuman biological matter. The Lab derives \"biovalue\" from the reformulated vitality of rodent bodies (Waldby, 2000(Waldby, , 2002. Animals are made to live and labor in specific ways to create value for human health (use value) and knowledge for the obesity market (exchange value in the form of data that can be traded on to increase economic or symbolic capital) in as a consequence of in vivo experiments when they are alive, and in vitro experimentation in which elements of dead bodies are made to labor productively and reproductively in artificial cell cultures. After all, I argue that a \"yield of vitality produced by the biotechnical reformulation of living processes\" occurs not only through humans and human biological matter, but nonhumans and their biological matter too (Waldby, 2002, p. 310). In sum, biological matter possesses its own generative capacity, i.e., its own capacity to labor and therefore co-produce new data while reproducing scientific and economic capital in the obesity market. And, animals' bodies perform \"biological labor\" differently as a result of environmental exposures (Thacker, 2005, p. 117). The outcome of their biological labor, in turn, is translated into \"inscription devices\" by technicians and PIs. That is, PIs appropriate congealed labor in the form of scientific data. Subsequently, new knowledge is circulated in the obesity market as data; a form of \"scientific capital\" that reproduces the Lab via publications, grants and grant renewals, conference presentations, editorial work, and other professional activities (Latour & Woolgar, 1979, p. 51;Bourdieu, 2004, p. 27). In response to the 'national threat' of obesity and metabolic syndrome, animals are not only made to live and labor under extreme environmental conditions in the process of constructing environmental, biomedical subjecthood, but they are also conditioned to be productive of environmental data that is itself structured by a large precarious funding landscape and the NIH's focus on particular 'hot topics' in obesity research. My ethnographic findings pointed to the argument presented above that nonhuman bodies and their labor counts too, specifically as a form of lively labor in a regime of \"lively capital\" (Haraway, 2008, p. 46). I also found that shifts in disease etiology (source and timing of exposure) within the epigenetic and Developmental Origins frameworks challenge what it means to be (bio-)medicalize obesity (or health problems in general) in an environmental framework. For instance, how does one medicalize an interaction effect between environment sources (ubiquitous chemicals or diet) and a medical subject (particularly reproductive women)? Also, how does one medicalize an interaction effect like this when, in some instances, the subject (the embryo, the fetus, the child) is not even yet a subject (as in the instance of pre-conception medicalization)? If \"[b]iotechnologial change effectively produces new material conditions of possibility\" for \"relations between bodies, bodily fragments, human identities and social systems,\" then, how does one medicalize a post-industrial, chemical milieu that produces an environmentally contingent and epigenetically at-risk individual (Waldby, 2002, p. 308;Rose, 2000, p. 487)? Drawing on Wild's (2005Wild's ( , 2012 concept of the \"exposome,\" are we witnessing an era of exposomic medicalization? Further, what are the implications of exposomic medicalization for the emergence of new forms of health inequality organized along social class, race, and ethnic dimensions? (Brown, 1995;Bell & Ebisu, 2012;Landecker & Panofsky, 2013;Almond & Curie, 2011). The focus on maternal environments, or more precisely what goes on during pregnancy, points to the distinctly gendered nature of Developmental Origins and epigenetic studies. Because the language of 'programming' suffuses much of the Developmental Origins literature, it is important to highlight the gender-specific and normative behaviors at stake in these models. Getting the conditions of pregnancy 'right' falls, once more, onto prospective and expectant mothers. In the course of aiming to produce healthier babies, we find a politics of risk reduction, and a new \"regime of perceptibility\" attuned to the maternal body as pathological environment (Murphy, 2006;Lapp\u00e9, 2016;Lock, 2013;Richardson, 2015Richardson, , 2017. This potentiality, which is not granted, creates the possibility for new modes of biomedical surveillance, intervention, and patient subjecthood for both mothers and their offspring. Under the theoretical framework of the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease, women are expressly charged with the epigenetic governance of their own bodies for the anticipated (and uncertain) sake of theirs and their children's children. But even as large babies replace small babies as a primary concern for some pediatric/neonatal researchers, environmental exposures -particularly to everyday household goods-are unwitting and cannot therefore be personally managed; producing a paradox for those interested in programming models of exposed inheritance. Moms cannot shop their way to safety. As ecologies are \"inescapable\", perhaps the same is true for an environmental politics of reproduction in which exposure resembles something akin to generations of nesting dolls, from which the immediate and sedimented effects of having lived life cannot be escaped (Nash, 2006;Ginsburg & Rapp, 1991). For some social science observers of epigenetics, the gendered specificity of  (Richardson, 2017, p. 44). The nutrition researcher Jonathan Wells (2009) employs the concept of \"the metabolic ghetto\" to argue that there is an unequal distribution of health for women and that, therefore, \"maternal capital\" influences health outcomes for offspring (p. 11). In general, the conceptual and material work being done through multiple research designs (e.g., clinical, epidemiological, basic science) has shifted how we understand obesity in relation to environments, and the effects of early life exposure on developing bodies and future states of health. There appears to be some consensus among those in social studies and history and those in biomedical research, that the social environment shapes us in profound and perhaps persistent ways, and that the reconstituted biology being built today is formed by an industrially constructed chemical environment specific to the mid-20 th and early 21 st century. From cancer to neurological disorders, obesity and diabetes, cardiovascular health, sexual development dysfunction, and infertility, scientists from many corners of biomedical research formulate these environmentally inflected illnesses as medical and economic burdens of the 21 st century."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion: The Production of Environmental Biomedical Subjecthood", "text": "In this chapter, I have argued that basic science research at the Lab, which is representative of other environmental obesity work in labs around the world, is involved in producing an environmental model of health and illness in relation to obesity and metabolic syndrome. This research is accomplished in part through the labor of laboratory animals and their constituent parts. As a result of a molecular gaze on genes, proteins, and the maternal- epigenetic changes and mutations, as well as the complex chemistry resulting from the biochemical reactions that sustain our lives\u2026is not a challenge restricted to those interested in the environment, it is a critical question to all interested in biology\" (Miller & Jones, 2013, p. 2). To be biological also means to be profitable for the obesity knowledge market, reifying the political economy of obesity and assuring the position of obesity and metabolism research at the forefront of funding agencies' priorities. Biomass produces value in the form of health data for the obesity market generally and an increase in \"scientific capital\" in the form of grant capital for investigators specifically. The central public health aim (use-value) is to apply new knowledge about the epigenetics of pregnancy to interventions that optimize human fetal growth, which may, in turn, produce a more metabolically fit population. Exchange value is realized through the transformation of biological processes into scientific data, but it is also evident in the accrual of reputational-symbolic and economic capital for principal investigators via grants, professional speaking invitations, NIH study panel participation, and editorial work. Accordingly, animal vitality labors \"in the service of both health and wealth\" (Rose, 2007, p. 3)."}, {"section_title": "124", "text": "What are the social and medical implications of programmed obesity and metabolic syndrome? Developmental Origins and the epigenetics of pregnancy are not individualized models of the genetics of obesity but, instead, environmental and intergenerational models of biological and physiological dysfunction. Using the concept of \"exposome\" (Wild, 2005(Wild, , 2012 In chapter 2, we saw the effects of funding precarity on University Lab's (Lab) technical workforce and how their positioning within the Lab's division of labor affects modes of anticipatory caretaking practices. In this chapter, I focus on principal investigators (PIs) to illustrate how a \"frightening\" landscape in obesity research funding affects investigators, their career paths, and, how, as a result, \"experimental systems\" are influenced by the experiences of financial precarity in academic basic science research (personal communication, March 16, 2015;Rheinberger, 1993). I found the cyclical nature of funding serves as a kind of metronome for the PIs, orienting the scope and rhythm of their work in pace with the demands of grant making institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In this chapter, I am interested in the effects of grant-based funding imperatives on PIs at the Lab, and how this produces epistemic effects for obesity knowledge. The political and economic circumstances under which basic scientists produce new laboratory knowledge raise questions about the specificity of what new obesity knowledge is produced, by whom, and how, overall, this affects research agendas and ultimately the kinds of knowledge produced. Within this context, I ask two interrelated questions. First, how and in what ways does funding precarity shape the Lab's \"experimental systems\" as it addresses the nation's concern with obesity as identified and supported by the NIH's research funding priorities (Rheinberger, 1993)? Second, what does it mean to live the \"scientific life\" (Shapin, 2008) today in basic science research; what are the effects of funding precarity on investigators \"forms of life\" (i.e., no life is self-contained and can be understood apart from external influences) as scientists (Wittgenstein, 1953)? In order to answer these questions, I first provide data gathered from several federal agencies and professional organizations that connect national trends in funding precarity in the biomedical workforce with the lived experiences of PIs at my research site. My findings complement data, gathered at the national level by multiple agencies, on the effects of precarity on basic science research in biomedicine. The effects of political and economic precarity felt and lived at the Lab are not idiosyncratic. Second, I introduce the Lab's PIs, describing their typical work practices; all of which are firmly situated outside experimental spaces. They are compelled to work differently, i.e., their 'forms of life' as a scientist are structured by contemporary configurations of scientific support. Within this section I provide bibliographic detail for each of the PIs to trace out the evolution of research ideas and practices in relation to the intense funding pressures they face and how this intersects with different career stages. Third, I describe the context of obesity funding at the Lab and the research institute's expectations for its PIs to illustrate how this bears on their research agendas and professional lives. Newer investigators have significantly less economic and symbolic capital relative to established investigators (Bourdieu, 1986). The ability to trade on either of these forms of capital influences the degree to which one leans toward more conservative empirical questions, or towards greater novelty (Foster, Rzhetsky, & Evans, 2015). Lastly, I trace the effects of funding sources on their experimental systems. The practical problems of the nation as defined and funneled through funding agencies like the NIH drive the Lab's hypotheses. As a consequence of the precarious landscape in basic science research, I detail the emergence of a new experimental 'brain model' of obesity at the Lab. The brain model is itself an evolutionary consequence of funding pressures on the Lab's experimental systems; having evolved out of a programming model of fetal thirst with female mammals to the programming of fetal adiposity via adipogenic pathways (altered physiology of fat cells), to the programming of fetal adiposity via hypothalamic pathways (altered physiology of neuronal cells). In the new brain model of obesity, senior PIs consider the possibility that a calorie restricted nutrition environment for newborn mice might remodel a region of the hypothalamus that regulates eating behaviors and, therefore, reverses deleterious effects of maternal obesity on the exposed offspring. In this new but tentative model of obesity, the causes of appetite and satiety are reimagined through specific neurons working differently in the brain as a consequence of changes in the timing of food exposure. By tinkering with the timing of food-as-exposure, obesity and its corollaries -namely appetite and satiety-are given a lifespan through the lens of the developmental origins of disease (Landecker, 2011;Lapp\u00e9 & Landecker, 2015). A remodeling model of appetite and obesity positions the PIs to argue for medical intervention during neonatal life that, theoretically, can undo programming effects from fetal life. In sum, I argue that the Lab's \"experimental systems\" are bound to national health priorities and the precarity of grant funding in obesity studies. As a result, PI's \"forms of life\" reveal, when put in historical perspective, a particular \"form of [scientific] life\" that entails working at a distance from the living things about which they hypothesize, occupational precarity, 128 and anticipatory writing practices specific to the Lab's division of caretaking labor."}, {"section_title": "Situating the Funding Landscape of Biomedical Basic Science Research in Academia", "text": "Financial support has always been a concern for scientific practitioners. Among 17 th and 18 th century natural philosophers, it was a relatively simple affair: people (men usually) generally relied on family inheritance or received money from someone they knew, and patrons of the arts and sciences, including individuals and organizations such as churches, supported those they wanted to (Shapin, 1989). According to the historian of science Steve Shapin, American scientists in the early in the 20 th century were suspicious of federal money, believing that it would lead to control over their work. During this timeframe, roughly \"[b]etween 1900 and 1940, the primary sources of financing for medical research were private\" and included foundations, university endowments, pharmaceutical companies, life insurance companies, medical associations, and \"voluntary health agencies\" such as National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (Shapin, 1982, pp. 338-347). By the mid-20 th century, the federal government, as a consequence of war, \"drove the fastest expansion of higher education in American history (if not the world)\" with regard to funding for research and the build-up of technical infrastructure to carry out that research (Kaiser, 2011, p. 31;Shapin 2008). Within this context of war, the NIH Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group (2012) describes the initial intent of federal funding for medical research as follows: Originally the conduct of federally-funded research at universities and other extramural institutions was based on an understanding that institutions would provide the bulk of facilities and salaries to the researchers and the NIH would provide the majority of funds for conducting research. Over the past decades, this distinction has become increasingly blurred, with NIH providing an increasing proportion of faculty salary support and the institutions covering a larger percentage of research costs. This is especially true during the start-up period, which has become significantly longer as young investigators struggle to receive their first R01 grants. The growth of 'soft money' positions in academic medical schools, in which investigators are required to raise 100% of their salaries and research funds, has contributed to the negative views of a career in biomedical science, and has had the additional consequence of encouraging institutions to expand their physical space [financial leveraging that becomes troublesome when the NIH budget plateaus or contracts] without making additional long term commitments to faculty. (p."}, {"section_title": "11)", "text": "At the center of this chapter, then, is an argument about how academic labor in basic biomedical science, and the experimental laboratory knowledge it produces, are shaped by a precarious and temporal landscape of soft money grants on which PIs increasingly depend. Basic science investigators -those who study the fundamentals of phenomena-whether they are affiliated with universities, research institutes, or medical schools, are increasingly dependent on extramural support, i.e., soft money, via grants to pay for their salaries, the salaries of support staff, and their laboratory's infrastructure. Soft-money positions are not only increasing in academia, but the grants themselves have also become more uncertain particularly in highly competitive spaces like obesity research. For example, \"[o]ver the last decade, with budget deficits and cutbacks, funding levels at many government agencies have dropped to around 10 percent or fewer of [grant] applications. Yet pressure on faculty to continue supporting themselves remains relentless\u2026\" (Stein, 2007, p. 2). While soft-money is a financial boon to universities who can recover faculty and technical staff salary costs and expenses from federal grants, working and living the scientific life as a PI in a soft-money position, however, is filled with precarity and anxiety. \" 'Second-class citizen' is how researchers on soft-money, who have to raise their salaries from grants, describe their position. It can be fraught with financial insecurity, disrespect, and poor facilities,\" according to the molecular biologist and journalist Marcia Barinaga (2000). Given an awareness of these challenges, the Advisory Committee to the NIH Director for Extramural Research proposed the creation of the Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group (mentioned above) in 2011 to develop \"a model for sustainable and diverse U.S. biomedical research workforce\" (National Institutes of Health, 2012, p. 7). 24 According to a survey of the Working Group's own committee, members were most concerned with funding, specifically with \"uncertainty and lack of funding, distribution of funding, restricted paylines, success rates, and excessive competition\" in light of an over-supply of biomedical PhDs relative to the availability of traditional tenure-track jobs (p. 49). Having found that \"[t]he proportion of PhDs that move into tenured or tenure-track faculty positions has declined from ~34 percent in 1993 to ~26 percent today,\" the Group recommended policy shifts to help \"offer opportunities for students to explore a variety of options while in graduate school without adding to the length of training\" (p. 7-8) 25 . From 1993From -2006 [As] the percentage of tenure or tenure-track positions decreased steadily\u2026colleges and universities chose to increase their staff by increasing the number of non-tenure-track positions. These positions often are dependent on obtaining outside funding (mainly from the NIH) to cover 100% of salary. (p. 25) According to data provided by the NIH's Extramural Research section, the number of principal investigators, including contact and multiple principal investigators on a research project, has risen from approximately 15,000 in 1980 to slightly more than 27,000 in 2014, the high of which was roughly 32,000 in 2012. 26 Across federal agencies and professional organizations -including the National Science Foundation's Survey of Doctorate Recipients, the National Center for Education Statistics in 24 See also https://biomedicalresearchworkforce.nih.gov/index.htm 25 Within this report, in bold lettering, the Working Group recommends that the \"NIH should require institutions that receive NIH funding to participate in programs that collect such data\" (p. 40). This would be helpful to academic labor market research, including this chapter. The report layouts the shortcomings of \"comprehensive data regarding biomedical researchers.\" (pp. 42-44) 131 collaboration with the Department of Education, the American Association of University Professors, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, academic labor market researchers have found a marked increase in \"contingent\" faculty in academia since 1975, including a rise in both nontenure-track faculty and part-time faculty; many of whom would be grant-dependent. 27 Likewise, among basic science faculty researchers at medical schools, the Association of American Medical Colleges' management researchers Mandy Liu and William Mallon (2004) have found a growth in non-tenure track appointments, identifying shifts in \"the external environment surrounding the basic sciences\" that have led \"institutional leaders and policymakers to reexamine basic science faculty appointment policies\" in the direction of greater flexibility for the employer (p. 206). Further, they write, [T]he biomedical research enterprise is no longer a genteel academic pursuit but an underdeveloped strategic market opportunity. Biomedical research is considered a vast potential driver of economic development, entrepreneurial opportunities, and increased income streams\u2026As a result of increased extramural funding and changing institutional priorities, basic science faculty are under greater pressure to spend more time on research, win more extramural support, and recover higher percentages of their salaries. (p. 2, emphasis added) In response to these professional funding realities, Donald Stein (2007), a professor and member of an advisory council to one of the NIH, writes of the \"concern that so many biomedical scientists have to follow the money rather than their passions and interests, or even the logic of their research trajectory.\" \"What does it mean,\" he asks, \"to have a large population of researchers 27 See Barinaga, 2999Barinaga, , pp. 2024Barinaga, -2028Benderly, 2010;Kalleberg, 2009; and the following webpages: https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/Faculty_Trends_0.pdf; https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2015/article/stem-crisis-or-stem-surplus-yes-and-yes.htm; https://nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctoratework/; https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/Academic%20Labor%20Force%20Trends%201975-2015.pdf; http://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=2004&issue=03000& article=00003&type=fulltext; https://www.aaup.org/sites/default/files/files/AAUP-InstrStaff2011-April2014.pdf 132 who are not connected to the intellectual life of the community\" because they sit outside the functions and professional duties of their tenure-track colleagues? (p. 3). According to Ron Hira, assistant professor of public policy at Rochester Institute of Technology, \" 'Almost no one in Washington' recognizes the 'glut' of scientists, nor the damage that lack of opportunity is doing to the incentives that formerly attracted so many of America's most gifted young people to seek scientific and engineering careers\" (as cited in Benderly, 2010, para. 15). At the core of these conversations among PIs and academic labor market experts is the concern for a destabilized academic market in biomedical basic science that creates disincentives for new generations of scientists and further affected is the pace and content of scientific discovery. In addition to the overall precarity of biomedical research funding in terms of budget and competitiveness in obesity research, an analysis of grants awarded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) for Developmental Origins research shows a change over time  in what exposures garner the most funding opportunities, the specific health (disease) endpoints of interests, and what counts as significant timing of exposure during the lifespan (Haugen et al., 2014). So, not only is the funding landscape precarious, but research calls for particular exposures on specific developmental trajectories within a certain time-frame further shape what kinds of knowledge about the environmental determinants of health are produced. My findings complement data collected by multiple national agencies as to the constitution of and challenges for the biomedical workforce. National data indicate that academic PIs in basic biomedical sciences are increasingly beholden to short-term grants rather than longterm tenure-track faculty commitments to universities and medical schools. The growth of softmoney positions in academia generates precarious work conditions and worker insecurity. As a result, the pressure of soft-money funding affects \"a scientist's choice of research problem,\" which itself also varies in accordance to what the grant agencies are interested in funding. The NIH, for example, defines what \"disease burdens\" exist and are worthy of being funded, nudging PIs to shape their careers around \"hot topics\" that are presumed to be more fundable (National Institutes of Health, 2017c). To help investigators navigate this terrain, the NIH even offers a matchmaking service so that applicants can take into account its Funding Opportunities Announcement as they strategize potential research plans that they hope will be funded. In conjunction with the argument above that precarious funding pressure and the availability of funding for national \"diseases burdens\" shape research designs, I also argue that there is a temporal dimension to this outcome. One's career position in basic science bears on choice of research questions. Early stage and new investigators, who are not yet independent, compete with established investigators for large grants such as the R01, but they can also choose from a selection of smaller grants with shorter time commitments because, in the words of one new investigator at my research site, \"no one will give you money without a proven track record\" (personal communication, February 25, 2015). In relation to new and established investigators, Michael Lauer, the Deputy Director of the NIH's Extramural Research, has provided data on funding trends from 1995 to 2015 according to career stage. In general, \"Early Stage Investigators,\" those with less than ten years since their terminal degree, and \"New Investigators,\" those beyond ten years since receiving their terminal degree, \"do not have many active awards\" (Lauer, 2017, para. 6). Further, this data indicates that established investigators, those who have received competing R01 and equivalent awards, \"may have an easier time staying in the system. Established Investigators not only make up a greater proportion of awardees, they also secure, to an even greater extent, a larger proportion of competing award dollars\" (para. 8). Additionally, \"the current reliance [by the NIH] on preliminary results further discourages branching out into high-risk, high-reward areas\" for early career investigators who utilize K99/R00 grants that are designed specifically for new investigators (National Research Council, 2005, para. 10). On the other hand, senior PIs have accumulated credibility, or symbolic capital, in the knowledge market (as well as greater economic capital) and are therefore less constrained in their research questions. They can pursue riskier, or more novel, conceptual projects via R01 grants, the NIH \"gold-standard,\" because they can trade on accumulated symbolic capital typically documented by frequency of publications in their grant applications (Bourdieu, 1975(Bourdieu, , 2004. However, Nobel Laureate Roger Kornberg argues that, for both new and senior investigators alike, \"[i]f the work you propose to do isn't virtually certain of success, then it won't be funded\" (Lee, 2007, para. 5). In sum, dependence on external grants (soft money) that is organized by the NIH in accordance with specific disease burdens helps define what questions can be asked. Additionally, one's career position (and therefore symbolic and economic capital) largely shapes the types of grants one can apply for. Thus, PIs -early and senior-are differently constrained in their research choices. Given the precarious context in which PIs increasingly carry out their work, I take the position in this chapter that internal details of the individual investigator, her or his stage of career, and the institutional context in which PIs work cannot be cleaved off from the external pressures of soft-money funding and the specificity of funding for national health priorities when decisions about research questions and experimental designs are made."}, {"section_title": "Principals and Precarity at the Lab", "text": "Based on my own reading of the literature and my initial \"anthropological strangeness\" prior to entering the Lab, I was surprised to find that PIs did not work at the bench (Latour & Woolgar, 1979). Their primary workspaces were offices located in a separate building, a short walk away from the sociotechnical sites of knowledge production. The most senior PI, Dr. Harris, was a tenured MD-PhD, but Dr. Moore, the one who run the Lab's daily affairs, had a more precarious assistant professor position with the Institute and was reliant on extramural support for her funding in spite of her status in the field. According to Fran\u00e7ois Jacob, winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine for discovering how genes are regulated, experimental systems are \"machines for making the future\" and \"everything depends on this choice\" (Jacob, 1988, p. 9). At my site, however, experimental and therefore human futures are not open. Hypothesizing at the Lab was somewhat inverted; meaning that for PIs, the certainty of financial precarity and the intensity of competition for obesity funding had produced a climate that distanced them from everyday scientific practice in the wet lab; a reality echoed at labs across the country. It is in external spaces, from medical libraries to private meeting rooms, online exchanges and large professional conferences, that PIs help shape new knowledge about the Developmental Origins of obesity and metabolic syndrome. This way of doing science stands in contrast to the more purist notion of science that Rheinberger (1992) presents in which scientists follow results wherever they go. PIs today cannot. They are constrained by funding priorities, and the precarity of soft-money funding. In the words of Dr. Moore, \"in a way, we kind of sell our research in terms of putting it out there at meetings, conferences, in papers\u2026so that people [can then] say, well, that is rubbish, or that is cool\u2026[in order to help you see] what sells, what will get you funding\" (personal communication, January 14, 2016). PIs work through the empirical data, but do it at the level of inscription, not inscribing raw data (Latour & Woolgar, 1979). That work is for technicians who have been trained and earned the trust of PIs who, in their early years, performed the embodied work of inscribing data. As we saw in chapter 2, technicians produce the raw date on which PIs depend, and this finding also complements nationally based data. It also raises questions at my research site, and in national data, about what it means to be a scientist today. though \"dehydration is a big factor in the developing world, the outcome of the consequences of programmed appetite versus programmed fluid status is probably [that] appetite is far more important [than thirst].\" He understood that obesity was gaining prominence as a scientific object worthy of care and attention (Fortun & Fortun, 2005) and that it was more likely to be supported by the NIH and other national agencies such as the American Diabetes Association than the more relatively marginal medical problems of too little or too much amniotic fluid However, in spite of his growing recognition, Dr. Harris still needed persuading. Despite his own early work on maternal-fetal health and the overall growth of so-called \"fetal origins\" research during the early 2000s, Dr. Harris \"dismissed\" epidemiological findings in particular (the area of most growth). From his perspective, they were \"nonsense\" because David \"Barker was all human data, [and there is] lots of potential for confounding issues\" in correlational studies (personal communication, December, 9, 2015). It was not until Dr. Harris visited a colleague's lab in Europe, where an experimental diabetic rat model was being tested for maternal-environmental effects on the dams' offspring, that he began to shift his own perspective. As Dr. Harris recounted his experiences to me, he said that the maternal-fetal animal food models \"were no social cues [from parents],\" and that, for him, the results were \"fascinating\" because the experimental animals indeed got fat because their mothers were obese while they were in utero. If you water-restrict the mothers, you also nutrient restrict. If water is not there, they reduce food intake\u2026[and so] it became a model of nutrient restriction, [which] set me apart from my PhD work on diabetes. Obesity was a problem so I said, 'Okay, if the mother is undernourished, and you have low birth weight, do you have increased susceptibility to obesity? (Personal communication, 2016) In order to craft a competitive grant application with the NIH, Dr. Moore built on Dr. Harris' previous experimental systems, as well as her own studies, to propose a new experimental system that would suggest some novelty while fitting neatly in with the NIH's health priorities around obesity. It is in this way, perhaps, that we find experimental systems come to \"have a life of their own\" (Rheinberger, 1993, p. 444). What began at the Lab as a maternal-fetal water restriction model of a relatively rare but extremely dangerous pregnancy condition became a maternal-fetal nutrition restriction model of a costly, widespread, and yet contested epidemic around fat, which was comparatively better funded. Experimental systems are shaped by the funding landscape. To provide another example of \"living and dying by grants,\" Dr. Harris told me that he and Dr. Moore were recently approached by the NIH to inquire about their (the PIs) possible interest in programming models of addiction (personal communication, December 9, 2015). Addiction, like obesity, has entered the national dialogue in terms of an \"epidemic,\" particularly from prescription opioids (Kolodny et al., 2015). \"They have a funding interest,\" he said, and \"they are just trying to get interest going, [which] is sort of their job\" (December 9, 2015). In response to the query, Dr. Harris explained to me how an opportunity that the NIH initiated might be transformed into a new experimental system: They asked about programming and addiction and we had explored that a couple of years ago so I took another look at that and said Oh, should we do programming and addiction, and what would it take? So I went back to the old data that we have on undernutrition and effects on the reward pathway in the brain, and then [reviewed] some recent studies that we are doing with a group in Colombia, South America on undernutrition and food preference, which is also the reward pathway. And I went to the literature and said, 'Gee, can I put this together mechanistically? How would I do that?' (Personal communication, December 9, 2015) In turning to the literature to help him \"get this topic down,\" he elaborated on the process by adding: I just started saying, \"How do I do this?\" And [I] ended up stumbling on to some evidence that an enzyme, SIRT, which is an energy sensor that is also a factor that works epigenetically [and] is associated with changes in the dopamine and opioid receptorspotentially--in the reward pathway. It turns out that we've looked at that same factor, SIRT, in the appetite center, and so suddenly it starts to gel. Here is what we found, here is the pathway, right, and [now] this can be the model. We can make a case that it is probably reduced throughout the brain or increased. Other papers have shown that it acts to affect the reward pathway, and so we can [study whether] undernutrition in utero may be associated with an increase potential for addiction as an offspring. We have a little bit of data on food preferences which is sort of an addiction like property, and we collaborated with this guy from Cincinnati as well as Colombia, and we can put together a story, so let's do that. As a matter of fact, there are papers here [points to his briefcase] to try to put that together. So it is looking at an opportunity and saying can you go with the flow? (Personal communication, December 9, 2015) \"Going with the flow\" means reproducing basic science knowledge markets while extending one's existing experimental systems, and it is how investigators survive in this precarious climate. Working in the literature is as important as working in the laboratory properly, but PIs' \"feeling for the organism\" (Keller, 1983) in this case is the literature and specific molecular pathways directly and indirectly associated (at this time) with obesity; they treat \"literature as an informant\" in order to evolve and compete in the grant-based landscape (Kelty & Landecker, 2009, p. 177 ). I thought if I had a really interesting research question and good data to support it, that I'd be able to get it funded. And that is not true. I think there used to be much more scope to say, okay, we will fund these things that we need to do and [then] all these other people with great ideas [too]. And those people with great ideas don't get money right now because they and to see \"what the concept is\" in order to compare \"the literature\" to her own findings. As with Drs. Harris and Moore, the literature served as an \"informant\" that was used to \"integrate what is known and not known\" so that she could \"relate all of it to funding\" and increased her chances of becoming an independent investigator (personal communication, February 2015; Kelty & Landecker, 2009). Dr. Jackson said she was not \"free\" to \"choose\" whether to follow a particular topic or even change direction if she didn't \"think [the results are] going where I thought it was\" going to (personal communication, February 2015). She concluded, \"I have an investment in this, and it is, I don't know, it is not necessarily what I want to continue\u2026[I]t is a real pain in the ass that we like our jobs\u2026it's really annoying\" (personal communication, February 2015)."}, {"section_title": "145", "text": "Although Dr. Jackson found her work very fulfilling, when I first approached her about shadowing to help me get acclimated to the Lab, she laughed and said it would be \"boring\" for me because she would be at her desk, reading and writing. Because, as she explained, \"that is what you do. You either write for publication or for grants\" (personal communication, February 2015). And which journal she submits to matters a great deal. As we discussed results from the BPA model and glucose tolerance tests they had recently completed, Dr. Jackson worried that her ideal journal would \"hold us to a much higher standard\u2026and we might have to go for a more developmental origins journal where people haven't seen this data in the same way, who are In sum, financial precarity molds investigators' careers as much as it historicizes and structures emergent experimental systems at the Lab. Precarity shapes both research questions and division of laboratory labor in academic science. And, based on workforce analyses by the NIH, NSF, and other federal agencies as to the impact of available funding on science and scientists (which was observed at my research site and noted elsewhere at professional conferences), these findings -that research questions are shaped by individual history as much as external career pressure-are not idiosyncratic. These findings are typical of laboratory life today. In my interpretation of Dr. Harris' explanation about how a programming model of addiction was born, his motives are an inescapable blend of curiosity and practicality. With technicians at the bench (chapter 2), PIs are quite literally distanced from experimental practices. Although PIs have a history of experimentation at the bench, it is confined to their very early careers, tapering off as they finish their post-doctorate fellowships. As a consequence, PIs are better understood as lab managers in which their primary job is to work in relation to the literature and to \"sell\" the Lab's data to funding agencies and other obesity labs so that they can reproduce their own careers and that of others in the Lab. Because, in the end,  March 2015). This is because even though the NIH has an approximately 30 billion dollar budget each year, the overall success rates in 2013 were at a \"historic low\" and generally part of a downward trend that began in 2003 (Rockey, 2015). 30 In 2014, for example, only 15.9% of all new grants were successful, and R01 applications, the \"original and historically oldest grant mechanism used by NIH\" were similarly funded at 15.4% (2017d). 31 In contrast, approximately twenty years ago, if an applicant for an NIH grant was ranked in the 25 th percentile (the lower the percentile, the better the review score), he or she was very likely funded. Today, though, \"if you are in the tenth percentile, [you] may not get funded. That's \"frightening\", Dr. Moore exclaimed (personal communication, March 16, 2015). She added, The whole process is shifting. It is a wake-up call that there are not many young investigators being trained, and no one now gets funded before forty years of age. No one has an R01 before forty, so that has been a wake-up call budget for fiscal year 2015-2016 has grown again. In addition to the field of obesity research becoming more crowded, the NIH budget itself is also subject to expansion and contraction over time; thus linking precarity of scientific work not only to an explosion of obesity researchers in the field, but to the perceived health of the national economy and political environment because it is connected to Congressional appropriations. See https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2014/01/10/fy2013-by-the-numbers/ and for more fiscal year 2015 budget information, see https://officeofbudget.od.nih.gov/pdfs/FY15/FY2015_Overview.pdf. \"You have to have the right topic which NIH is interested in funding,\" as well as, \"and that is why it was a smart move when I came here-to move into obesity because it is a problem, right?\" (personal communication, March 16, 2015). ). Indeed, obesity was introduced as a new health endpoint in grants managed by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (Haugen et al., 2014). Dr. Jackson's sense of anxiety about launching independence is a common thread among early career investigators in particular, but it is also prevalent among senior investigators, including those at the Lab, because they work in a so-called \"soft-money\" institution (Sigl, 2002;Muller & Kenney, 2015). \"This is the strange thing\u2026we've got two [employer] components : it is a research institute and it heads the grants,\" explained Dr. Jackson (personal communication, salary at all. They just provide the infrastructure for us to do our experiments, so there [is] minimal support\" (personal communication January 9, 2016). For Dr. Jackson, the Institute had recently agreed to employ her since she received her own external funding, a two-year R03 grant from the NIH. As with Drs. Harris and Moore, the Institute would help provide some salary support, office space and, in general, the infrastructure needed to work on their studies. Additionally, there was a tenure-track appointment, which was organized and managed by the affiliated university. Dr. Jackson described some of the process and what was at stake for her: [The University will] collect the recommendation letters, and it has to go to the Academic Senate. It is a strange place. I think a lot of people would probably be happy to come here to work as a researcher at the Institute. My prefered position would probably be in a physiology department at a university, and I do like teaching. I am from a family of teachers and so I don't want to find myself having done this for five years, eight years, and then we move because my husand is on a five year contract right now. I don't want to have to go back to square one and say I want to start my tenure-track process even though I have been working on it for years. So, the affiliation with the Institute and Lab is kind of important to me in that sense. I am only here because of Dr. Moore. She does exactly what I want to do in many ways, and the person I worked with before knew her. That person said go to the Institute so you have someone whose work you can tag onto until you get your stuff up and running. Because you really need that at this level. They just won't give me 250K with no proven track record in the country. Everything I did in the past was in Europe, and it is a whole different system. I am not an MD, I am a scientist physiologist. For now, I have to remember we've just got some data, and I want to get it out. (Personal communication, February 25, 2015) In this context, Dr. Moore had described their professional lot as an \"uphill battle, and many times we feel like giving up but you don't because that is the end of you and your career.\" Dr. Jackson added to the conversation, \"and yet lots of people do. Of all the people I did my PhD with, I am the only person still in science\" (personal communication, February 23, 2015). Many, she said, go on to teach, including at community colleges simply because they could not get funding. Reflecting further on the situation, Dr. Moore added: The scary part is that the young generation does not want to go into PhD. And who then is going to be teaching at university level? That is, especially in basic science, we are losing a lot of people and, in fact, we are importing PhDs\u2026.It's sad. We got one person to do a PhD, and we were like -wooa-that is something. I've been here more than 10 years, and [of] all the summer students that have gone through, only one has gone through for a PhD to work in basic science. It speaks volumes that none of them want to do this. At the end of the day, after education, [they say] I want job security. (Personal communication, February 23, 2015) During a casual conversation I had with another young investigator outside of the Lab, I was told that anyone wanting to enter a career in basic science research \"needs a talking to\" (personal communication, June 9, 2015). The apparent difficulties of a life in basic science research are felt outside of the Lab too. Both Dr. Harris and career technician, Eleanor, relayed to me that neither of their children wanted a career in basic research in part because of the tremendous precarity of the job. PIs in academic basic science research have reached the apex of formal education and training and, yet, they are required to be self-supporting professionals. Not only are PIs identifying the inherent precarity of research funding, but they are also pointing out its implications for who exactly is at work in the American basic science workforce. Based on the \"hard realities of soft-money\" in basic science research today, some people opt out of a science career altogether. For others, it extends the period of apprenticeship to evergreater lengths of time, and it also affects the general composition of the scientific workforce. These pressures also affect decisions about what experimental systems to pursue. A constrained choice is, therefore, made as to whether and how to proceed in basic science research. No wonder, I thought, that weekly meetings were often organized around funding. The pace of work at the Lab is largely, though not entirely, determined by funding cycles and the need for new data; all of which is designed to increase credibility of their findings in the field of developmental origins of programmed obesity. Dr. Jackson, explained, That is why these things [models and experiments] are on-going. We have all the projects [experimental systems], different levels of funding, and so [on any given day], this one [model] needs new data, this one [another model] needs preliminary data for a grant, and we\u2026stagger\u2026the schedule. The experiments don't run from start to finish per se. (Personal communication, February 25, 2015) At University Lab, a highly competitive funding landscape shaped the way in which PIs mobilize values about obesity (i.e., it is a global health crisis) in order to raise the translational profile and utility of their own research. During the Lab's meetings, the team was frequently reminded by Drs. Harris and Moore that, \"it takes a long time to get a story,\" and \"what matters is what the grant renewal is\" (personal communication, January 1, 2014). Job security, professional recognition, and personal livelihood cannot be \"decoupled\" from rhythms of scientific productivity and the view of science as precarious labor (Bourdieu, 1999(Bourdieu, , 2004Foster, Rzhetsky, & Evans, 2015, p. 900;Wouters et al., 2008). By situating the Lab in its larger political and economic context of funding for an urgent epidemic, we can attest to the \"mediated character of science\" and discover what it becomes productive of in this time and place, namely an environmental problematizing of obesity through women's reproductive lives (Wouters et al., 2008, p. 326). \"A Somewhat Suspect But Novel Theory of Remodeling\" in the Arcuate Nucleus \"Don't chase phenotypes,\" Dr. Harris' reminded the team during a meeting. \"For the grant renewal, what is the epigenetic mechanism\" we are searching for (personal communication, November 21, 2016)? Although recording animals' phenotypes (e.g., their weight, blood pressure, and insulin levels among other traits) was where the story begins of how the Lab pieces together research questions and a new experimental system, Dr. Harris emphasized the need to move quickly because a R01 renewal application was due in the next few months. In light of this pressure, he wanted to explore \"a somewhat suspect but novel theory of remodeling\" that involves a ratio of appetite to satiety neurons in the arcuate nucleus region of the hypothalamus. His decision to pursue an appetite-satiety programming/re-modeling model of obesity via appetite was driven by the need for a novel yet familiar paradigm that the NIH would likely be receptive to in their renewal. What I will call the Lab's brain model was frequently described in meetings and at the bench in terms of human health correlates with obesity rates, type-2 diabetes, and hypertension. For example, Dr. Jackson once explained: We are interested in learning how appetite is regulated in the brain. In regard to type-2 diabetes, we are interested in changes to glucose in the blood, or insulin insensitivity and how glucose gets out of the blood and into storage tissues such as fat, liver, and skeletal muscle. (Personal communication, January 2015) I was fortunate to begin my fieldwork at an early stage of this new experimental system, and, as a result, in addition to observing technical staff at the bench, I was also able to observe interactions between PIs and technicians during weekly Lab meetings about how to establish this new experimental system. During those meetings, sometimes tense conversations laid bare why and how the Lab would \"grope around\" adult, young, and newborn mouse brains to figure out how the regulation of appetite and satiety might be re-modeled due to changes in newborn chow. A working assumption is that if one can molecularly regulate appetite, one can manage eating and therefore weight and, in the case of excessive weight, co-morbidities of adiposity. Armed with the 'right' input, or balance of hormones and receptors (which can cause changes in gene expression), appetite -the output-might be differently regulated in a socially desirable way. In the following pages, therefore, I illustrate the PI's experimental brain model situated within the arcuate nucleus (ARC) region of the hypothalamus. What is the arcuate nucleus (ARC)? The ARC is a hormone-regulating gland located within a region of the hypothalamus. Within the ARC, there are two main populations of neurons that work antagonistically in relation to one another. Together, they regulate an organism's appetite, i.e., its sense of hunger or fullness. Orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agoutirelated peptide (AgRP) are neurons that stimulate appetite, whereas anorexigenic neuropeptides called proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) stimulate satiety. Because these sets of neurons are \"first-order neurons where peripheral metabolic signals including leptin, insulin, ghrelin, and nutrients are primarily transferred\" (Yu & Kim, 2012, p. 392) from the gut and adipose tissue (among other organs) to the hypothalamus and brainstem, understanding how they form and function have become a mater of care and concern for appetite and obesity programming researchers, not only at my research site but also at labs across the world (Minor, Chang, & Cabo, 2010;Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017). 32 To demonstrate the degree to which researchers value the ARC's function and its control over feeding behavior (which was initially based on brain trauma injuries), one French lab recently described \" [d]isruption of this regulation\" between satiety and appetite neurons in the ARC as giving \"rise to life-threatening conditions that include anorexia nervosa at one extreme and metabolic syndrome at the other\" (Cansell, Denis, Joly-Amado, Castel, & Luquet, 2012, para. 2). From traumatic brain injuries, to epigenetic causes of obesity, the ARC develops its own history as an epistemic thing. At my research site, PIs were interested in how neurons in the ARC form during embryogenesis (first eight weeks of development), become programmed during fetal stage of life, and possibly even re-modeled after birth due to altered newborn food environments. For example, the Lab had previously found in its food-restricted (FR) gestational model that control pups are \"more normal\" in terms of birth weight, but they eat more after they are born. The PIs \"want to know what happens to the neurons that trigger hunger and satiety\" among both the control and experimental groups (personal communication, February 11, 2015). Further, in a complementary experimental system, the PIs study a high-fat maternal obesity (HF) model and have found that \"pups have higher amounts of appetite neurons relative to satiety ones\" (personal communication, February 11, 2015). How is it that two very different gestational exposures -food restriction and high-fat diet-both generate similar increased appetites in the pups? Dr. Harris explained part of this empirical puzzle to the technical team and Dr. Jackson as follows: Stem cells migrate from the periventricular nucleus to the arcuate region, and that is where they differentiate into appetite kinds of neurons such as AgRP, NPY and POMC. This occurs during embryogenesis and early postnatal life. We have already shown that stem cells [from animals], whether they are food restricted or maternal obesity, have more of the AgRP, NPY neurons [appetite] and less of POMC [satiety]. So what we are trying to do is figure out why this is happening. There are transcription factors like Hes1, which is involved in proliferation; and Mash1 and Ngn3 are neurogenetic transcription factors that are involved in this, and we want to show the mechanisms of how this works. (Personal communication, January 2015) This kind of convergence of two different experimental models on a similar outcome has parallels in human epidemiological research too. According to some PIs I observed, this result suggested to them a U-shaped curve between low-birth weight offspring on one end, and high birth weight on the other. Both extremes are believed to be linked to an increased risk for adult obesity and metabolic syndrome because of an increase in appetite neurons. In the food-restricted model, the thrifty-phenotype hypothesis (presented in chapter 1) asserts that small for gestational age (SGA) babies (possibly a result of maternal undernutrition or malnutrition) go through a \"catch up\" period during neonatal life. As a result, low birth weight babies, or uterine growth restricted babies, and those whose mothers had malnutrition show a greater risk for later life illhealth. Today, obesity researchers at my research site, and in labs across the world, employ the same logic of developmental programming and environmental plasticity of small babies to now study large babies. According to a PI at a Society for Reproductive Investigation conference I attended, Although there has been a huge amount of interest in the small babies, these large babies are also at risk of later life ill health, and I think this is increasingly important because we know that mean birth weight is increasing, and the instances of excess birth weight is increasing in part due to the obesity epidemic. As a contributor to later ill-health, these larger babies are increasing in importance [to the medical research community]. If we are thinking about what an [in utero] insult could be, I think we have to postulate an insult that is happening in utero that impacts on birth weight and then later life ill-health. And there is increasing evidence that that insult can be under-or over-nutrition. [Studies on birth weight and BMI in adulthood] suggest to me, and it has suggested to others, that it is maternal obesity that has caused adult obesity and that birth weight has just been a mediator. Again, this is really important because maternal obesity is increasing almost exponentially. (Anonymous, personal communication, June 20, 2015) Drawing on findings by Dr. Flier, former Dean of Faculty of Medicine at Harvard University, Dr. Harris discussed the possibility of studying apoptosis (programmed cell death that occurs naturally) in the ARC because it is thought to influence the ratio of satiety to hunger neurons (McNay, Brian\u00e7on, Kokoeva, Maratos-Flier, & Flier, 2012). According to research at other labs, [S]tudies have showed that consumption of dietary fats promotes hypothalamic resistance to the main anorexigenic [satiety neurons] hormones, leptin and insulin, leading to the progressive loss of the balance between food intake and thermogenesis [caloric use and balance in the body] and, therefore, resulting body mass gain. (Moraes, et al., 2009, p. 1) According to these same authors, it is the consumption of \"dietary fat [not calories per se] that induces apoptosis of neurons and a reduction of synaptic inputs in the arcuate nucleus and lateral hypothalamus\" (p. 1). In addition to these questions about how satiety and hunger neurons are programmed during embryogenesis and fetal life, the Lab was also interested in studying another timeframe of development: the neonatal period. In one of the weekly meetings I regularly attended, Dr. Harris discussed the theory of remodeling with the other PIs and technicians, as follows: We have this theory about remodeling\u2026we talked about remodeling as occurring sometime up until 12 weeks, so if we took samples [newborn mice] at birth, 4, and 8 weeks (I am just picking what we picked for the grant) and said 'Is there any apoptosis, both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways-I don't know where--is [there] a common pathway?...One question is, 'If this remodeling is occurring, how is that happening?' There's gotta be some apoptosis you would think. This [model] is all post-natal. [We could] start with regular mice, day 1, 4weeks, 8 weeks, and staining to see whether there is anything in the arcuate? If we do, then it opens up a whole area, which means going intrinsic, extrinsic, which means comparing it to the FR [food restricted model], finding Dr. Moore agreed and suggested that they worked with control mice first to inject pregnant dams with BrdU, which would cross the placenta to the fetus' DNA. They would then test for cellular apoptosis at birth, 4, and 8 weeks. As the PIs mused further on this emergent system, Dr. Harris discussed part of the puzzle even further: But these cells, once you form a neuron, it supposedly doesn't divide so you're not going to dilute it out. And yet if you remodel, just sort of teleologically, if your neuron in the ARC already has a synaptic connection and it dies off and something else takes its place, how does it reform a connection? Then you're getting quite complicated. Dr. Jackson quipped, \"That is why we get dementia!\" and Dr. Moore continued their discussion of the remodeling theory: So Dr. Flier's work was during fetal life. You inject BrdU [bromodeoxyuridine is a chemical compound that stains cells proliferating in a brain] to the mom and it crosses to the baby, it gets incorporated into the DNA, and it stains that cell forever. And then you go [look] at 1 day of age, 1 week of age and you say [study] how many BrdU cells are in the arcuate, and if I injected at day 10-he doesn't actually explain this well-and it is floating around, then at least to me let's say 50% of the cells in the arcuate are stained. On the other hand, that would mean 50% of the cells were born, or had their final DNA prior to day 10. He finds by one day of age that there are all of these stained cells and you can say, okay, they all came from E[embryonic day]12 to 14 or so. How you got to that conclusion is a little uncertain because did it stay in the progenitor when it was dividing into two daughter cells, or, I don't know? Let's just assume that for a moment. And then he rechecks those at 12 weeks of age and the same number of cells are there in the arcuate, at least the POMC [satiety] and NPY [appetite], but the BrdU is gone. So, oh look!, [he says,] there must be all this remodeling that is going on because how do you lose a POMC [satiety] cells that had been stained with BrdU? \"Right,\" Dr. Harris said, \"neurons don't divide, so if you\u2026.\" \"But even if they divide,\" Dr. Harris continued:"}, {"section_title": "157", "text": "Where are they coming from is one of the questions? Because usually they migrate from the periventricular to the ARC, not the other way around, so if they are reduced by end of embryonic [age], where are the others coming from? Maybe it is not the end of the embryonic [age, after all], and so is there continuing migration, or.. What's happening? We don't know. As the PIs grappled with this new theory, they raised many questions as to the epigenetics of pregnancy, fetal programming, plasticity of critical windows of development, and definitions of the lifespan; all of which helped them assert \"a sort of novel approach, a novel twist on the data\" that could be used in imminent grant renewals. Dr. Harris said, Remember we always talked about that food restriction is the one that becomes fat, but the FRFR [gestational and neonatal food restricted] doesn't and yet both [were initially] food restricted. So one of the things we found in the literature was that in these papers by Flier [and others] was that there is more remodeling of NPY [appetite] cells (more than 95% and 90% of the POMC) but therefore there are twice as many NPYs that are not remodeled as POMCs and so that if you if mess up the NPY remodeling (I can't remember the balance of NPY and POMC)\u2026so that was the approach we took. And now we are working on the diabetes project, which is a fat mouse and doing the same thing. The whole grant is going to be on this somewhat suspect but novel theory of remodeling. \"That's not going to be an easy one to substantiate,\" Dr. Jackson added, but the Lab already had a sense it might be possible. Dr. Harris noted that: It is interesting in the sense that when you look at our FR [food restricted] catch-up group, they become obese [during neonatal life as they eat in abundance]. But [mice] that were food restrict[ed] during [both] pregnancy and lactation, they DO NOT become obese so there is something happening because BOTH are born small. [The difference is chow during lactation period.] So there is something about neonatal nutrition that is causing\u2026you know\u2026 they [the FR] don't eat more. They don't become obese and yet both of them were small to begin with. So something is going on in the neonatal period. What the story is, we don't know. (her emphasis) If you look at the high fat model, if you're just HF in utero, and you're nursed by a HF mom, you become fat. If you are nursed by a control mom, you don't. Within these conversations, a point of contention was raised by Dr. Jackson and fielded by both Drs. Harris and Moore around the weight of cross-fostered HF pups. Dr. Harris said, \"Yeah we kind of\u2026in the adults\u2026at three weeks they are still normal and have normal body fat.\" But, Dr. Harris noted that even though \"[t]heir body weight is not higher, their body composition shifts. Their body weights are the same, but they really reduce their lean body mass\" (personal communication, March 16, 2015). This is an important detail because even if the cross-fostered pups have a \"normal weight,\" the fact that they have less lean body mass than controls presumably affects their overall health. For example, loss of less lean body mass is associated with aging and the elderly, not a typically healthy newborn. 33 In spite of Dr. Jackson's pointed clarification, and perhaps inconvenient finding, Dr. Harris pushed past the caveat to say, Okay, so just staying on body weight, so they're not getting obese and the question is, they're not eating more, so what's happening now in lactation? And how is that controlling their arcuate nucleus? So now we are going to focus this diabetes grant sort of purely on the post-natal period and say remodeling must be impacted. Throughout these conversations, PIs were thinking ahead in anticipation of how the Lab would be funded and sustained over the next several years. In the course of their everyday work, PIs had to learn to care for obesity, or \"see\" obesity in new ways because of their dependence on grants. Thus, drawing on previous experimental systems, and intriguing but \"suspect\" theories and findings in the literature, they focused on epigenetic mechanisms within the ARC both during pre-and post-natal timeframes. This allowed them to consider several new conceptual directions: within fetal programming models of disease, the thrifty-phenotype hypothesis may be less deterministic than originally believed; the epigenetics of disease may be refined through more definitive widows of exposure; and, lastly, the lifespan of obesity itself may be re-shaped due to specific nutritional exposures. For each path, there is a transformation in how biological objects (such as appetite and satiety neurons) in this instance, move from being a \"neglected thing\" to being a \"matter of care\" and \"concern,\" and, therefore, ultimately an \"epistemic thing\" in the work of producing new laboratory knowledge about obesity (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2010Bellacasa, , 2017. If the Lab could show that the effects (appetite and weight) of maternal obesity on newborn pups can be reversed via caloric restriction during lactation, it would be a significant though not unproblematic achievement for obesity sciences because body mass index would continue to trump other considerations such as skeletal muscle and fat distribution. In order to begin advancing the new ARC re-modeling experimental system, Dr. Moore organized the pace of laying out the model. She reminded me, that \"it takes a long time to get a story out of what is happening and getting a handle on what's driving this\" (personal communications, February 2, 2015). \"When we have a concept,\" Dr. Moore elaborated, \"we put [together]..the study designs\u2026It's not like we get the answer as you know in a day or two. It takes sometimes even six months to address or a year. But there are multiple studies going on to address. So one may finish this week, one may finish after two months, and then it's when we get the whole data that the whole story comes through\" for us (personal communications, February 2, 2015)."}, {"section_title": "161", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Chapter 5 Conclusions", "text": "This dissertation has described the effects of economic and political precarity on a laboratory's division of labor and showed how this impacts the content and pace of laboratory fact making in obesity research. It is a case study of how the political economy of laboratory fact making shapes new obesity knowledge (Ragin & Becker, 1992). Specifically, I showed how political and economic precarity affected technicians' care for experimental practices (chapter 2). I drew on ethnographic observations of technicians' labor to illustrate variation in their anticipatory caretaking practices, and how this affected knowledge production. I then used observations with the handling of animal biomass to argue that animal biology was made to labor differently as a result of harmful exposures (chapter 3). Because the target laboratory studied environmental and developmental causes of obesity and metabolic syndrome, I described likewise how biomedical subjecthood became, in the context of fat, environmentally constituted. Through this process, I argued that biological labor of animals was as vital to the creation of scientific capital as human labor. Drawing on interviews and observations, I also showed how grant-based economic precarity impacted principal investigators in terms of their own anticipatory caretaking practices in relation to experimental trajectories (chapter 4) and what this means for knowledge production specific to obesity and basic science in general. I defined anticipatory caretaking practices as a form of labor characterized by a persistent sense of anxiety among technicians and investigators in terms of precarity in grant renewals, publications, and visa status for the Lab's biomedical workforce. Caretaking practices, I argued, have situated meanings that vary by one's social location in the Lab's division of caretaking labor. These practices, in turn, produce epistemic effects through the Lab's experimental systems, creating specific models of environmental and maternal-fetal models of obesity. Anticipatory caretaking practices reveal what kind of obesity knowledge is produced and by whom. They call attention to underlying social and political mechanisms that seep into laboratory \"experimental systems\" (Rheinberger, 1997). They help show how scientific \"forms of life\" are shaped by larger trends in funding and shifts in the political landscape, especially for recent immigrant scientists who are dependent on visas for their professional careers as well as their livelihood in this country (Wittgenstein, 1953). The labor they perform is gendered in that it is precarious, relatively poorly compensated, and has relatively little social status in contrast to principal investigators. \"Science,\" according to the late scientist Paul Kalanithi, \"is as political, competitive, and fierce a career as you can find, full of the temptation to find easy paths\" (as cited in Belluz, Plumer, & Resnick, 2016, introduction). As we saw, this \"frightening\" landscape compelled junior investigators to pursue less risky experimental projects. Senior investigators were also subject to the conservatizing force of grant funding, but their store of capital allowed them greater flexibility in choice of research questions and experimental designs. For the research site, the process of knowledge making involved a turn away from questions of fetal thirst, toward an environmental explanation of fat and appetite because of a shift in federal funding opportunities. In addition to showing how precarity enters into experimental systems, I have also argued that the specificity of this Lab's work produces an environmental turn in obesity studies. As a consequence, new questions are raised as to what it means to medicalize conditions in developmental and environmental epigenetic models of health and disease. Also, within the frameworks of the Developmental Origins perspective and epigenetics, reproductive women are targeted for medical intervention, creating an environmental politics of reproduction. This dissertation, then, offers a window onto how basic science research is organized today and how this affects knowledge production with consequences for the health of human (and non-human) futures. Looking through that very window we find that specific laboratory facts for one of the nation's preeminent health threats are located in maternal-fetal bodies via exposure to nutritional and chemical environments."}, {"section_title": "Contributions to the Literature", "text": "This dissertation treats theoretical scholarship on science in action (Latour, 1987), biovalue (Waldby, 2000), biopolitics (Foucault, 1997), biomedicalization (Clarke et al., 2010), ecobiopolitics (Olson, 2010), and politics of reproduction (Ginsburg & Rapp,199) as central \"sensitizing concepts\" (Blumer, 1954). As a result of following technicians in action, I illustrated how anticipatory caretaking practices, as a form of laboratory labor, and variation within that labor, entered into the Lab's experimental systems (chapter 2). I then showed how the effects of caretaking labor and experimental exposures reconstituted the biology and physiology of laboratory model animal organisms. In the course of being made to live life differently due to chemical and nutritional exposure, I argued that animal biomass was productive of environmental biomedical subjecthood (chapter 3). Further, I extended Waldby's (2000) concept of biovalue to include nonhuman biological labor in the larger production of scientific capital in the form of valuable obesity data. I connected these forms of labor (anticipatory caretaking practices and biomass labor) to investigators (chapter 4); braiding together the larger national funding scene and values about health and disease in chapter 4 with the local lives and practices of PIs at the Lab. Together, these findings provide insights into concepts in science and technology studies, sociology of health and illness, gender, and work and occupations. They include: a) the study of contemporary effects of political-economy on laboratory division of labor and its epistemic effects on knowledge production; b) the production of scientific value through the labor of animal biomass; c) and the creation of environmental biomedical subjecthood in obesity research and studies of metabolic syndrome. I illustrate these contributions below according to the order of the dissertation chapters."}, {"section_title": "Technicians and Anticipatory Caretaking Practices", "text": "In chapter 2 \"Laboratory Technicians and Anticipatory Caretaking Practices,\" I detailed the Lab's division of caretaking labor; highlighting the embodied work of technicians at the bench. I argued that because of funding precarity (which trickled down from PIs) technicians performed experimental labor rather than PIs. In particular, I also showed how technicians' immigration status helped shape the division of caretaking labor at the Lab. I used the notion of anticipatory caretaking practices within this division of labor to describe the effects of different career trajectories, as either a career or temporary technician, and how this affected the kinds of experimental questions they helped pose. I argued that career technicians were able to extend the Lab's existing experimental systems in new directions whereas temporary technicians helped reproduce \"normal science\" because they had to work within established paradigms to quickly produce positive results for publications necessary to their professional timelines as international medical graduates. As a result, I argued that the effects of funding and immigration precarity enter into how science is done, including what questions about obesity and metabolic syndrome are posed. The concept of anticipatory caretaking practices contributes to science, technology, and medicine studies and scientific work and occupations. I illustrated how \"care\" for an experimental system was shaped by technicians' own temporal positioning in the Lab. Caretaking, I have argued, is not a static concept. Rather, it varies by one's social location. In 165 this specific study, the effects of immigration status in particular had a conservatizing effect over temporary technicians who needed to produce \"a happy story\" and \"positive\" results in order to fulfill their occupational requirements as international medical graduates. Career technicians, on the other hand, had a long-term commitment to the Lab and were in a better position to suggest and pursue new experimental questions that would help reproduce the Lab's economic and reputational capital in the field of Developmental Origins. In both instances, the notion of care had different meanings and, therefore, created different outcomes for knowledge production."}, {"section_title": "Biological Labor and the Production of Environmental Biomedical Subjecthood", "text": "In chapter 3 \"Biological Labor and the Biomedical Production of Environmental Subjecthood,\" I traced technicians' practices in handling biomass to show how a biomedical subject in animal models of human health were environmentally constituted. I traced two experimental systems, including the effects of maternal-high fat diet and the effects of maternal-BPA on offspring obesity and altered metabolic profiles. In doing so, I argued that animals, i.e., biomass, were environmentally constituted by nutritional and chemical exposures at different stages of life including uterine and neonatal life. As part of this argument, I showed how what \"it means to be biological\" is specific to environmental milieu of the Lab, which was intentionally designed to translate to human health (Landecker, 2007(Landecker, , 2010Olson, 2010). I also argued in this chapter that nonhuman biomass serves national questions of health and wealth and, as a result, is productive of value for the Lab and the market for obesity facts in general. Because of this, I contended that nonhuman biological matter labors alongside human counterparts in the buildup of \"lively capital\" in contemporary modes of value extraction that occur at the molecular level (Haraway, 2008). Findings in this chapter contribute to medical sociology and anthropology on the politics of reproduction. The trajectory of this scholarship has evolved to now include an environmental politics of women's (and men's) reproductive lives in relation to the rise of epigenetics and theories of developmental programming, as exemplified by Developmental Origins of Health and Disease. Biomonitoring data collected by the Centers for Disease Control suggests that humans are environmentally constituted by chemical exposures; some of which are known to produce harm such as BPA and many more which are unknown because have not been studied. How laboratory knowledge might translate to human health care practices is an emergent area of inquiry. Findings in chapter 3 also contribute to scholarship that analyzes how value is extracted via bodies working in modes of production that are biotechnological and biomedical. I have extended a feminist approach, particularly that of Donna Haraway, that seeks to highlight less visible forms of labor to include the biological labor of biomass in the production of value, or scientific capital, in laboratory research. If data implies value and value is extracted at the molecular level and appropriated for the reproduction of a knowledge market, then the labor of animal biomass, as much if not more, is central to scientific capital accumulation; in fact, it depends on it."}, {"section_title": "Principal Investigators and Anticipatory Caretaking Practices", "text": "In chapter 4 \"Principal Investigators and the Matter of Precarity,\" I highlighted the precarity and competitive nature of the contemporary funding landscape in biomedical and obesity research. I detailed national statistics that complemented ethnographic observations. I then argued that this particular landscape affects the investigators' \"forms of [scientific] life\" (Wittgenstein, 1953), producing what is seen as a \"frightening\" climate for investigators who rely on grant-based funding to not only support their laboratory but their own salaries. PIs work, I argued, is communication-based rather than experimental. As such, PIs are engaged in anticipatory writing practices at the level of inscription, not inscribing. I also claimed that in meeting the NIH's demand for new obesity knowledge, the Lab (among others), reproduces the obesity market and the problematic of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Findings from this chapter dovetail with those of chapter 2 in that funding precarity enters into how principal investigators (PIs) pursue specific research questions and experimental designs. For PIs, however, precarity varies in accordance with whether one is an established PI or a junior investigator trying to establish her independence. For both junior and senior investigators, there is an overall conservatizing impact on the creation of experimental systems because they are bound by what the NIH considers \"hot\" topics. However, senior investigators are able to trade on established reputational capital to pursue topics that fit within the NIH's calls for proposals but which push boundaries. The example of linking obesity to appetite in the framework of programmed addiction in hypothalamic neurons illustrates the bridging of national epidemics in order to be more competitive in grant applications. As with technicians, the role of precarity enters into decision-making and therefore affects the overall course and content of obesity knowledge production."}, {"section_title": "Study Limitations and Future Directions", "text": "This dissertation is an ethnographic study of a basic science biomedical laboratory that studies a burgeoning area in the environmental causes of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Work at my fieldsite (and elsewhere) represents what I have viewed as the physiological functioning of social nature in obesity studies. Findings from my study appear to reflect national trends in terms of grant-based funding, the composition of the biomedical workforce, and the environmental turn in obesity studies. In that way, the ethnographic account helps provide detailed descriptions of how phenomena at the macro-level inform the lived experiences and practical realities of contemporary lab life at the micro-level. When I entered the research site, I did not know I would find how strong the effects of funding and immigration status were on the Lab's personnel. I entered as a novice, aware only of the basic outlines and tenets of epigenetics and Developmental Origins of disease. Over time, I drew connections between the competitiveness and precarity of grant-based funding in obesity research, publication cycles, and the effects of immigration precarity on Lab personnel and how this affected experimental questions. Once I was able to understand the significance of this broader landscape on their everyday lives and practices, it became apparent how experimental questions were not only guided by personal interests but, more accurately, what everyone thought would get funded and published. The interdependence of so many connected actants and external forces that molded their careers to experimental systems raised a multitude of additional questions some of which I have outlined above. In some ways, the political economy of bench work entails perhaps intractable questions about how and in what ways we, as a nation, want to support scientific research. We appear to be witnessing an environmental politics of reproduction. There are several implications for governance in terms of environmental and/or molecular regulation of health concerns that are situated in pregnant bodies (Shostak, 2013;Landecker & Panofsky, 2013). Further, research suggests that bodies are not equally exposed. The sciences of Developmental Origins and epigenetics reflect a \"regime of perceptibility\" (Murphy, 2006) that reveals to us heritable and stratified health outcomes along the lines of race and class in addition to gender. These findings, I have argued, raise questions about how and when (or if) to medicalize a concern such as obesity in the epigenetic era. As Latour notes, \"[t]he laboratory does not exist just to train students, but it is producing the means to deeply modify the practice of medicine\" (1992, p. 299). What, then, does it mean to medicalize obesity (or other diseases) in an epigenetic framework in which social forces are seen as biologically causative in ways that they were not before, and when the mode of proof rests on a triangulation of evidence between epidemiology, clinical, and laboratory work (Landecker & Panofsky, 2013)? In short, what are the changing conditions of medicalization as explanations of causation shift with epigenetics? For medical sociologists, can exposomic medicalization provide a framework to account for shifts in how gene-environment interactions are studied and acted on by biomedical researchers and medical professionals? I have been able to show how larger social forces affect obesity knowledge production and highlighted their effects on science, the scientific pipeline, and medicalization, but there are also methodological limitations to this study. First, ethnographic accounts of laboratory life are not generalizable, but in this study the findings are, in fact, supported by government data on national trends with respect to the biomedical workforce in academia. Second, my data would nonetheless have benefited from a comparison with another obesity laboratory either in academia or at a commercial site that specifically looks for developmental and environmental epigenetic answers to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Third, the analysis would have benefited from spending more time with PIs relative to technicians; although weekly meetings in particular were very revealing. Lab meetings revealed tensions about the interpretation of raw data, ideas to explore for new grants, data needed for publications, paper reviews, and how technicians' work should be organized. Lastly, one might wish that this dissertation had been able to contribute to an analysis of the regulation of ambient chemicals that are of such potential harm to human futures. The paradox, however, is that although the threat of harm is of such importance in the shaping of my dissertation's narrative, issues around regulation were not central in the data itself because scientists-who have no reward structures for being politically engaged-say that policy making is not their job, that it is not their area of expertise. While investigators and technicians very much hope that their results will contribute to change (or that they even find negative results), they do not see advocating for regulation as part of their job. While those at my fieldsite studied the developmental and environmental epigenetics of obesity through maternal-fetal bodies, there is also research being done on the paternal epigenetics of obesity. In studies of infertility and obesity, for example, men are increasingly subjects of investigation in relation to environmental factors that are thought to affect their fertility. A comparative case could be drawn along the lines of gender, environmental biomedical research in obesity studies, infertility, or many other areas of neurological and physiological research such as autism and disorders of sex development. The implications of an environmental politics of reproduction, therefore, extend beyond the reproductive female body, and this would be a fruitful area of future research. Another possible future research direction incudes following PIs in the Lab who are OB/GYN doctors into their clinics. It would be useful to know how, if at all, lessons from laboratory work bleed into clinical interactions or vice-versa, i.e., how information from doctorpatient interactions with pregnant (and often overweight) women entered into their thoughts about how to create experimental designs. My sense though, from talking with PIs/MDs is that they care more about making sure patients return for regular care than to unintentionally shame or scare pregnant women by discussing potential programming effects of what they eat and how this might impact their unborn children. What matters most in the clinical interaction is to support mothers in order that they will return for standardized pregnancy care. Lastly, in the context of clinical care with these same PIs/MDs, it would also be interesting to know how race, ethnicity, and social class impact medicalization of pregnant women in terms of clinical obesity care."}, {"section_title": "Afterward", "text": "Based on scholarship in science and technology studies, sociology of health and illness, medicine, gender, and work and occupations, I have illustrated an environmental turn in obesity that is predicated on a precarious division of caretaking labor between principal investigators and technicians in the Lab. In highlighting anticipatory caretaking practices, I have shown the effects of funding and political precarity on the production of new laboratory facts. While scientists, unless they were personally wealthy, have always experienced political and economic precarity (the risks of religious heresy and of requiring a noble patron are historical examples), the forms of precarity have changed. In this setting, I have articulated the ways in which various forms of labor, from humans to nonhuman biomass, braid together to produce environmental subjecthood in obesity studies through female bodies and therefore an environmental politics of reproduction. I hope my study will lead to further dialogue and investigation into the impacts that precarity has on contemporary science and the creation of facts as well as into immigrant scientists themselves, who constitute a vulnerable population within the scientific pipeline. Finally, this discussion is not limited to obesity or biomedical studies since other areas of science are implicated."}]
