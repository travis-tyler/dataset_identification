[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "From early in the pandemic, the discrepancy in SARS-CoV-2 outcomes across age was striking (1); evidence for sex differences followed soon afterwards (2) . Age profiles associated with infectious disease contain the signature of both transmission dynamics and vulnerabilities to infection (3) . For our analysis of emerging pathogens, and influenza where waning of immunity occurs, we consider the variability in risk of infection across age to be secondary to variability associated with health vulnerabilities. We use age and sex profiles of health outcomes in the context of known features of immune function to probe the underlying mechanisms of the morbidity and mortality impact of SARS-CoV-2."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "We analysed age and sex data for hospitalization, severe disease (requiring intensive care or resulting in death) and death for SARS-CoV-2 (France and globally), MERS (Saudi Arabia), SARS (China), influenza (France and US), as well as all-cause hospitalization (France) and mortality (28 European countries) ( Figure S1 ). For each pathogen, we compare the incidence within each age-group with the incidence observed in 60 year olds (Figure A-C, Figure S2 ). This approach allows us to adjust for differences in mortality that affect all age groups and the age structure of the underlying population. We also compare the incidence between males and females ( Figure D-F, Figure S2 ).\nThe relative increase in the probabilities of hospitalization, severe disease and death are strikingly consistent for older individuals across pathogens as well as with all-cause hospitalization and mortality. For COVID-19 cases over 40y in age, each additional year of life was associated with a 10.7% (95%CI: 10.3-11.0) relative increase in probability of death. This was very similar to SARS (10.2%, 5.2-15.5), MERS (7.1%, 6.2-8.0), influenza (8.5%, 8.1-8.8) and all cause mortality (10.2%, 10.1-104%), and, indeed, the latter has been previously noted (4, 5) . Influenza age distributions were also consistent across countries and across different reporting systems within the same country ( Figures S3-S4) . However, there are notable departures between pathogens among younger age groups.\nQualitatively, all age-patterns echo the classic U-shape of human mortality (6): initially high levels of infant hospitalization, severe disease and death first fall, and then increase ( Figure  1A -C). However, the age at which the increase in hospitalization, severe disease or mortality occurs differs considerably. In particular, for both influenza and all cause hospitalisations, rates remain relatively low between ages 10 and 50, while a stark increase is observed for SARS-CoV-2 right after the minima of 9; and for MERS from 6 years ( Figure  1A ). Severe disease ( Figure 1B ) and deaths ( Figure 1C ) also exhibit a steeper increase from a younger age for the coronaviruses, although the long level period is less apparent.\nThese patterns will be shaped by immune functioning over age (7) . Early in life, development of immune capacity and memory increase protection from infectious diseases. These gains are then eroded by immunosenescence (8): dysregulation of innate immunity and depletion of adaptive effectors including naive B and T-cells diminishes defense against infectious pathogens or cancer, and increases inflammation (9) . The latter effect, sometimes termed 'inflammaging' (10) , is associated with diseases of old age (cardiovascular disease, strokes, diabetes, etc). The remarkable consistency of late life increases in hospitalization, ICU and death across pathogens ( Figure 1A -C) suggests a common mechanism, and immunosenescence is the most obvious candidate. But what do discrepancies earlier in life suggest?\nTheory predicts that immunosenescence should begin at the onset of puberty (11) , and indeed, immunopathology-associated cytokines (like IL-6) gradually increase with age in healthy adults (12, 13) . Falling levels of protective cytokines (like IL-17A and Ifn-gamma) across pediatric and adult SARS-CoV-2 patients (14) echo this result. Thus, one interpretation of the early start to the increase in hospitalization, severe disease and death in SARS-CoV-2 and MERS is that coronaviruses are more sensitive than influenza to this background immunosenescence at earlier life stages.\nTwo possible mechanisms can be invoked to explain this. First, children are likely to experience several influenza infections early in life (15), and may accumulate sufficient immunity to buffer them from either infection or its consequences for much of adulthood. This is not the case for the two emergent coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 or MERS. Second, coronavirus dependence on the ACE2 receptor might make immunopathology a particular risk even for relatively minor viral loads (16), as the ACE2 receptor acts to reduce inflammation. The resulting sensitivity to disruption of homeostasis could interact with the age trajectory of immune decline, so that some threshold for severe outcomes was crossed earlier in coronaviruses than in influenza. The first explanation is thus rooted in development of adaptive immunity, while the second is associated with more general disruption of immune functioning starting around puberty which the emergent coronaviruses might be more likely to trigger. Sex differences in immunity (17) provide another lense into evaluating possible mechanisms underpinning the burden of SARS-CoV-2. In both influenza and SARS-CoV-2, the burden of hospitalization shifts from being male-biased at the youngest ages, to female between the ages of 18 and 24 and then back to male again at late ages ( Figure 1D ), with a slight late life reduction in relative male burden at very late ages presumably attributable to frailty effects (18) . This broad trajectory is also seen for severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1E ). Mortality data lack these non-linearities, and the male burden grows consistently relative to the female burden in both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 across age, but this increase is much more rapid in SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 1F ).\nTypically, a male bias in risk occurs when weak immune responses underlie significant host damage by a pathogen, while a female bias occurs when strong immune responses promote host damage (19) . Respiratory infections typically trigger strong Type 1 immune responses, resulting in inflammation-associated damage to the lung. As estrogens are associated with efficient immune recruitment and response (20) (21) (22) , while androgens are largely characterized as immunosuppressive (17), greater risk of hospitalization in females after puberty and before menopause is not unexpected for respiratory pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and influenza ( Figure  1D ), with further potential amplification of vulnerability during pregnancy (although this is generally only up to 5% of the population hospitalized) (23) . Interestingly, however, this greater risk of hospitalization does not translate into much greater risk of mortality in females for either pathogen ( Figure 1F ), echoing the 'male-female health survival paradox', (where females in worse health survive better than comparable males (24) ) although this effect is typically reported at much later ages.\nAdvances in SARS-CoV-2 immunology broadly aligns with expectations for sex differences. Greater male pathology seems associated with a failure to control the virus soon after infection (16, [25] [26] [27] , while females may both detect (28, 29) and respond (30, 31) earlier. This female advantage may compound over age as a result of the age trajectories of particular immune effectors, e.g., Mucosal Associated Invariant T-cells which are an important line of defense in the lungs recruit more efficiently to airways (32) , and deplete less rapidly with age in female blood. Conversely, female severe outcomes seem driven by over-responding immune systems, i.e., higher levels of innate immune cytokines were associated with worse disease progression in females, but not males (27) .\nAssuming that the broad general patterns hold, for influenza, adaptive immunity could benefit females by diminishing excessive immune responses, or males by enabling more efficient pathogen control. If influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are otherwise comparable, hospitalization data suggests that immunity benefits females, as the hospitalization data indicates a reduced bias towards female burden in influenza relative to SARS-CoV-2 for ages <30 years (blue line above the red line, Figure 1D ); the bias then moves into males in SARS-CoV-2 at a younger age than for influenza, and accelerates more rapidly ( Figure 1D ), also observed for mortality ( Figure 1F ). However, although these patterns suggest that immunity could explain the age and sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, immuno-senescence cannot be dismissed -faster male immunosenescence (33, 34) could also drive these results.\n.

Viral evolution might expose this, which would increase the morbidity and mortality burden associated with the pandemic virus; which vaccination might provide an opportunity to buffer.. More generally, as the global population ages, the intersection of immuno-senescence with pathogens for which we have no adaptive immunity may open important vulnerabilities to emergent pathogens. .

We then calculated the relative incidence within each age group as compared to 60 year olds. This approach allows us to adjust for underlying differences in incidence and outcome across pathogens that affect all age groups in the same way. We considered three different outcomes: Hospitalisation (or emergency department visit in the case of influenza), severe disease (defined as requiring ICU treatment or ending in death) and death. For all cause emergency department visits, we removed the cases that were due to influenza to ensure any patterns weren't being driven by influenza admissions. To capture uncertainty we calculated 95% Wald confidence intervals.
