Collaboration across disciplines in the design and development of such studies is necessary if they are to increase our understanding of child development (Lu, 2014) . This type of transdisciplinary research encourages researchers to incorporate knowledge and skills from other fields, and hence requires the development of new methodologies. The capacity to span multiple domains is one of the strengths of large cohort studies, yet inevitably limits the depth to which each individual construct can be measured. We outline here a new method specifically developed for observing parent-child interactions within a large child cohort study."}, {"section_title": "Observing parent-child interactions in large cohort studies", "text": "Developmental psychologists and child development researchers have long been interested in how parents' day-to-day behaviour with their children impacts on social, emotional, and behavioural development. The quality of parent-child interactions has been implicated in developmental outcomes ranging from psychopathology, to externalising behaviour, to educational attainment (Locke & Prinz, 2002) . Parents' reports of their own parenting behaviours can be extremely informative, but for some behaviours, unbiased observations are needed (Dunn & Kendrick, 1980) . For instance, it may be difficult for parents to estimate how often they smile at their children, because this behaviour is largely outside their awareness, or highly influenced by their own emotional state, their beliefs about the child, and about expectations for that behaviour in general (Gardner, 2000; Margolin et al., 1998) .\nRecognising the importance and value of parentchild interaction, a few large cohort studies have successfully incorporated direct observations. The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) has incorporated parent-child play ('Two Bags Task') and book-reading tasks during the preschool and kindergarten data collection waves. Over 6,000 Two Bags Tasks interactions were coded from recordings at both timepoints (Najarian, Snow, Lennon, Kinsey & Mulligan, 2010) , while a subsample (700) of the book-reading tasks were coded from recordings (Hindman, Skibbe & Foster, 2014) . Having detailed coding from recordings of parent-child interactions for such large samples is ideal, but may not be financially feasible for all cohort studies.\nThe Home Observation Measure of Environment scale (HOME) (Bradley & Caldwell, 1984) has also been pivotal in demonstrating the feasibility and value of observing children's home environments within large cohort studies. The HOME scale is a wellvalidated measure of the quality of the home environment, in particular the learning environment, environmental stimulation, and parent-child interaction. The HOME scale has been instrumental in identifying associations between aspects of the home environment and developmental outcomes for both typical and atypical populations (Totsika & Sylva, 2004) . The quality of the home environment -as measured by the HOME scale -has been associated with a range of important developmental outcomes such as attachment security (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2001 ) and obesity (Strauss & Knight, 1999) . The strongest associations across time have been found with cognitive and academic outcomes (Bradley et al., 1989) . The development of a short-form has enabled the HOME scale to be more widely used by large cohort studies, such as the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth. The HOME scale is succinctly described by Mott (2004, p. 260) as: \"a psychometric hybrid. It represents an attempt -in my opinion, a very successful one -to integrate a psychological assessment into a large-scale data collection.\"\nThe huge contribution and strong psychometric properties of the HOME scale therefore begs the question: do large cohort studies need any other measure of the home environment? We present a task developed here for use in the Growing Up in New Zealand cohort when children were age two that uses a prompted task to elicit parent-child conversation, and focuses more specifically on the content of the verbal interaction, as well as the non-verbal context. Based on extensive research of adult-child bookreading (e.g., Fletcher & Reese, 2005; Haden, Reese & Fivush, 1996; Reese & Cox, 1999) and past-event conversations (e.g., Bird & Reese, 2006; Farrant & Reese, 2000; Reese, Haden & Fivush, 1993; Reese & Newcombe, 2007) , we use photo prompts to elicit parent-child conversation and observe the verbal and non-verbal quality of communication."}, {"section_title": "Why a semi-structured task?", "text": "One of the key advantages to the HOME scale is that no specific tasks are required and interviewers can code behaviours and materials as they occur in their natural environment. This has clear benefits for multi-domain home assessments, but some limitations, particularly with preschoolers. Young children may be present for only some, or none, of the home visit with parent(s) and consequently completion rates and reliability estimates are lower for children under three years compared with older children (Mott, 2004) .\nIn contrast, semi-structured methods require parents and children to engage in a particular task designed to tap into underlying constructs more efficiently. Examples from child development research range from providing the dyad with a standard set of toys or a book to elicit play or reading style (e.g., Fuligni & Brooks-Gunn, 2013; Hindman, Skibbe & Foster, 2014) , to inviting the dyad to discuss specific topics (e.g., Fivush, Berlin, Sales, MenuttiWashburn & Cassidy, 2003; cf. Margolin et al., 1998) , to lab procedures such as the Strange Situation (e.g., Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978) . Shorter observations are not necessarily inferior. For example, Lovejoy, Graczyk, O'Hare and Neuman (2000) showed that, in comparison with longer observations, brief (< 10-min) observations provided larger effect sizes for differences in the positive behaviours shown by depressed and non-depressed mothers' in their interactions with their children. Both unstructured and semi-structured observational methods can provide reliable measures of parentchild interaction with concurrent long-term and predictive validity of children's development (e.g., Bird & Reese, 2006; Dunn, Brown, & Beardsall, 1991; Sroufe, Egeland, Carlson, & Collins, 2005; Taumoepeau & Ruffman, 2006) . We hoped that by using a semi-structured picture discussion task we would be able to engage a higher proportion of our two-year-old cohort, while also eliciting important maternal language and parent-child interaction indicators."}, {"section_title": "Why focus in more depth on the quality of parent-child conversation?", "text": "Talking with one another is an integral part of human nature; it is also a key medium through which children develop relationships and learn about language, other people, their culture, the world, and themselves (Bowlby, 1969; Brockmeier & Carbaugh, 2001; Miller, Mintz, Hoogstra, Fug & Potts, 1992) . Exposure to language through adult dialogue, narration of activities, and book reading is recognised as critical for children's language and cognitive development (Bornstein & Haynes, 1998; Huttenlocher, Haight, Bryk, Seltzer & Lyons, 1991; Huttenlocher, 1998) . The preschool HOME scale measures the general home language environment well; it taps into the frequency (e.g., spontaneously talks to child at least twice) and type (e.g., parent talks with interviewers, names an object or person for child) of parental talk across the home visit.\nYet, while total language exposure is clearly important, not all communication is created equal: interactive conversations between parents and children seem particularly important. For example, Zimmerman and colleagues examined associations of total adult language exposure, adult-child interactive conversations, and total television viewing with twofour year-old children's language development. While all were associated, only adult-child interactive conversations were uniquely predictive of children's language 18 months later (Zimmerman, Gilkerson, Richards, Christakis, Xu, Gray & Yapanel, 2009) . These findings highlight the importance of more detailed measurement of parent-child conversations, beyond global indicators of parental speech.\nDuring infancy most parent talk occurs in the 'here and now', but by the age of two children are engaging in discussions that extend both temporally and contextually: talk about the past, the future, other people, and the hypothetical (Snow, 1991) . Examples of such decontextualized talk could include: talking about a past trip to the zoo while reading a book about animals; building a plane out of Lego and talking about a family holiday you would like to take one day; or even talking about the day at childcare while driving home in the car.\nNaturalistic observations indicate that mothers of two year olds talk about up to six past-events per hour, and two and a half year olds themselves contribute to, on average, two past-event discussions per hour (Miller & Sperry, 1988) . This 'there-andthen' talk appears particularly important for children's cognitive, social and emotional development. For example, parents who guide their children to consider new information by using openended questions and discuss emotional or evaluative content have children with more advanced autobiographical memory (Farrant & Reese, 2000; Reese, Haden & Fivush, 1993; Reese & Newcombe, 2007) . When children are engaged in conversations with their parents about past events that highlight and explain the child's internal states and emotions, they are more likely to display a coherent selfconcept and higher self-esteem (Bird & Reese, 2006; Reese, Bird & Tripp, 2007; Welch-Ross, 1997) .\nBook-reading is another key medium through which children are exposed to varying levels of decontextualised talk. Overall, parents who describe pictures, discuss story meaning, and use the book as a link to other comments or conversations have children with more advanced language and literacy outcomes than parents who focus more on 'reading the words' (Haden, Reese & Fivush, 1996; Reese & Cox, 1999) . Interestingly, mothers' talk about internal states during a picture description task at age 15 months was associated with children's social and emotional understanding at two years of age (Taumoepeau & Ruffman, 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "The broader context of parent-child interactions", "text": "While the specific verbal content of parent-child interactions is increasingly seen as important, the broader non-verbal context of the parent-child interaction is also critical. Parental discipline and warmth -both key constructs measured by the HOME scale -appear central. Differences in parental discipline are associated with children's externalising behaviour difficulties and academic achievement difficulties (see Locke & Prinz, 2002 , for a review). At a broad level, discipline might encompass many different practices (e.g., from verbal correction, to use of behavioural techniques such as 'time-out', to shouting or smacking); or be related to the degree of control in parenting styles (e.g., an authoritarian style characterised by high control and low warmth; Baumrind, 1967) . Similar to the HOME scale, we focus here on specific unhelpful discipline behaviours that relate negatively with child outcomes, such as shouting, visible hostility or physical hitting (Bradley, Corwyn, Burchinal, McAdoo & Garcia Coll, 2001) .\nParental warmth -defined as \"the expression of positive affect, affection, and admiration towards the child\" -is theoretically and empirically related to several other key aspects of parent-child relatedness, such as parental sensitivity and responsivity, which have their origins in attachment theory (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bowlby, 1969) . Measurement of parental warmth typically includes visible positive affect and animation when talking with the child, as well as physical affection and closeness. Parental warmth is an important moderator or protective factor for a range of developmental outcomes (Rutter, 2013) . For example, maternal warmth has been found to moderate the relationship between low birth weight and ADHD (Tully, Arseneault, Caspi, Moffitt & Morgan, 2004) , and between peer bullying and internalising and externalising problems (Bowes, Maughan, Caspi, Moffitt & Arseneault, 2010) .\nFrom the child's perspective, understanding and expressing emotion is a crucial developmental task, and underlies healthy functioning across multiple domains (Gross, 1998 ). The parent-child relationship is a fundamental context through which children develop emotional expression (Grusec, 2011) : first through basic cries, and later through more complex facial, behavioural and verbal communication (Malatesta & Wilson, 1988) . Children who are able to express social emotions such as empathy tend to exhibit more prosocial behaviour (Roberts & Strayer, 1996) and may elicit more positive social responses from both parents and peers (Findlay, Girardi & Coplan, 2006) . Conversely, low empathy has been linked with children's externalising behaviour and social difficulties (de Wied, Gispen-de Wied & van Boxtel, 2010) ; and deficits in emotional understanding and expression underlie most forms of psychopathology (Aldao, Nolen-Hoeksema & Schweizer, 2010) .\nAcross all of these domains of parent-child interaction -parental discipline, warmth, and verbal communication -reliable differences have been observed in parent-child interactions as a function of parents' ethnicity, educational achievement, and socioeconomic status. Parents from cultures with an independent orientation (e.g., most European cultures) tend to engage in more distal (talking) and fewer proximal (touching, smiling) behaviours compared to parents from interdependent cultures (e.g., most non-European cultures; Bornstein et al.,1992) .\nParents with higher educational achievement and socioeconomic status also tend to talk more, and to be less harsh in their disciplinary practices (Bornstein & Bradley, 2014; Hart & Risley, 1995; Jansen et al., 2012) ."}, {"section_title": "Establishing Inter-Observer Agreement in Very Large Samples", "text": "A crucial issue for cohort studies that employ a large team of interviewers is the establishment of inter-observer agreement or reliability. Most developmental research studies involve, at most, several hundred participants. The 'gold standard' of reliability measurement for parent-child interaction was developed in this context: two independent observers evaluate the same behaviour from recordings of the original interaction, and inter-rater reliability is established on a subset of the sample. This gold-standard inter-rater reliability procedure is not always pragmatically possible in the context of a large cohort study.\nMotivated by a desire to observe parent-child interactions for our full sample without the means to record and then code, we sought to identify other methods of establishing inter-rater reliability. We identified these from research conducted in large educational settings, where similar challenges are encountered but for a different reason -namely, the busyness of the classroom environment which results in video recordings failing to capture the behaviours of interest. To overcome this issue in the classroom setting, Coffman, Ornstein, McCall, and Curran (2008) trained all observers prior to going into the field to look for specific teacher behaviours within 30-second intervals. Inter-rater reliability was established by watching pre-prepared video clips of teacher behaviour and comparing ratings with those of an expert coder.\nSimilar time-sampling techniques were used in research conducted prior to the 1970s, before filming techniques had become widespread in child development research (see Lytton, 1971 for a historical review). For example, Rheingold (1960) used this method to observe maternal care of very young infants. Observers were given a checklist of 42 maternal and infant behaviours to observe and tally during set time periods. Again, inter-observer reliability was established prior to the commencement of the study: observers were paired and asked to simultaneously rate maternal and infant behaviours on seven dyads who were not part of the larger study. This procedure was repeated several times during the study to prevent observer drift."}, {"section_title": "Development of a new observational measure within a child cohort study", "text": "We developed a new observational measure of parent-child interaction, the Parent-Child Interaction task, ideally suited for inclusion in studies with larger sample sizes. This measure was designed for the Growing Up in New Zealand study and completed with two-year-old children and their mothers (Morton et al., 2013) . Ideally, we would have repeated the observation with fathers, but for this first step we focused only on mothers as the primary caregivers for most of the children. Given the practical limitations of recording and observing thousands of parent-child interactions, observer reliability was established prior to going into the field (Coffman et al., 2008) .\nWe asked mothers and children to engage in a semi-structured shared discussion task. The observers were the group of interviewers employed to complete the face-to-face interview with the mother of each cohort child when the child was two years old. We used time-sampling techniques to train the observers to observe one behaviour at a time for 30-second intervals. The constructs were chosen for their prominence in the child development literature as outlined above: maternal discipline, maternal warmth, maternal verbal communication (openended questions, linking, and emotion talk), and children's emotional expression.\nSample diversity was an essential design feature of the Growing Up in New Zealand cohort (Morton et al., 2013) . We were interested in how parent-child interaction constructs differed across our diverse sample as a function of ethnicity, child gender, maternal education and socio-demographic status. In order to examine construct validity, we examined associations between observations of parent-child interactions and parent self-report of parenting warmth and hostility, parent-child affiliation, and frequency of book reading and oral story-telling. We predicted that observed maternal warmth and language constructs would be positively associated with self-reported maternal warmth and affiliation, and negatively associated with maternal hostility. Similarly, we predicted that observed maternal discipline would be positively associated with maternal hostility, and negatively associated with observed maternal warmth, affiliation, and language variables. We also predicted that mothers who reported more frequent oral story-telling and book reading interactions with their children would be observed to use more of all aspects of verbal communication: more open-ended questions, linking talk, and emotion references."}, {"section_title": "Method Cohort study participants", "text": "Participants were members of New Zealand's longitudinal pre-birth cohort study: Growing Up in New Zealand.

Each picture and 30-second interval corresponded to a specific construct (e.g., the picture of a mother and child walking in a forest was coded for maternal warmth), with the exception of maternal discipline, which was rated across all five pictures. If children did not engage in the task, interviewers recorded the reason from the following response options: child was asleep; child was unwell; child not in the home; child did not engage; mother refused; child has a physical injury; child has a physical disability; child has a developmental delay; the interview was interpreted; or other.

Face-to-face training events were organised for the observers to establish reliability ii . Two expert coders (ER and MT) prepared video clips for reliability training from an observational study of toddlers' emotional development with New Zealand parents (Taumoepeau & Ruffman, 2006) . The mothers in the clips were either European or Pacific; all had a two-year-old child. Videos showed mothers interacting with their toddlers in a parent-child interaction task iii . All 33 interviewers attended a training day (there were two separate training days for interviewers in different geographical locations). The expert coders first introduced the task to interviewers using a power-point presentation. We explained the reasons for observation, and the way that we were adapting traditional methods for the Growing Up in New Zealand study. We told the interviewers \"you are our eyes and ears\" because we would not be able to directly observe the mother-child interactions. We then introduced each target dimension to the interviewers, noting the decision points (table 1) and emphasising that for each dimension, the interviewer was only going to be looking or listening for a single type of behaviour. We believe that this focus on a single behaviour at a time is one reason we were able to succeed in establishing reliability.\nInterviewers then watched the videos of mothers interacting with their toddler children and practiced coding for the constructs of interest. Feedback was given and discrepancies explained. Interviewers were then shown six video clips corresponding to the six constructs of interest. This process was repeated four more times with different videos, resulting in interviewers viewing a total of 30 different video clips of parent-child interaction (five for each of the six constructs). It should be noted that the training from video may have actually required a higher threshold than in vivo, as many of the disagreements in coding were due to difficulties in hearing or seeing important cues on the video.

Significant correlations between observed variables were in the directions predicted (e.g., maternal discipline was negatively correlated with maternal verbal communication variables and children's empathy; maternal warmth was positively correlated with maternal open-ended questions and emotion talk). The pattern of significant correlations between observer Parent-Child Interaction ratings and mothers' self-reported parenting variables were in the directions predicted, and provide preliminary evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. For example, observed discipline was positively correlated with maternal reports of parenting hostility. Observer ratings of positive Parent-Child Interaction constructs were positively correlated with maternal self-reports of parenting affiliation and book-reading and story-telling with their children; and negatively correlated with maternal self-reports of parenting hostility.\nThe small effect sizes warrant further discussion, particularly given statistical significance is more likely to be achieved with large samples. Small correlations between different Parent-Child Interaction constructs do indicate that we are in fact measuring discrete and specific constructs, rather than observers relying on a global impression of 'positive', or 'negative' parenting.\nAssociations between observed and self-report parent-child interaction variables, although generally in the direction expected, were small also. We must Elaine Reese, Amy L Bird, Mele Taumoepeau, Joanna M Schmidt, \"You are our eyes and our ears\"\u2026 Jatender Mohal, Cameron C Grant, Polly E Atatoa Carr, Susan M B Morton acknowledge the possibility that these small effect sizes reflect larger than desired error (e.g., from observer ratings), particularly given that observer reliability was established prior to going into the field. However, observer agreement ratings were good: both at the initial training and mid-stream check.\nAnother explanation is simply that we are tapping into related, but meaningfully different constructs in these two modes of measurement: observation and self-report. On the one hand, this demonstrates one of the key reasons for observing parent-child interaction in the first place. Self-report parenting measures are designed to tap into parents' internal experience of their relationship with their child (e.g., \"I enjoy having my child around me\"; \"I get angry at my child\"), but parents may not always be aware of some aspects of their behaviour. In the example we gave earlier, parents may not be aware of how often they smile as an indicator of parental warmth. Indeed, there was no significant correlation between parents' observed smiling behaviour and their selfreported warmth. On the other hand, this highlights a limitation whereby self-report measures have been used to validate observational measures. Ideally we would have included another observational measure of the quality of parent-child interaction (e.g., the HOME scale) against which to compare our new task, but this simply was not possible give the interview time and overall cost constraints of the two-year data collection wave.\nThe current findings demonstrate that observers can be reliably trained to code the quality of parentchild conversations and interactions before going into the field, and that this reliability can be maintained across the data collection period. This is a particular strength given that while observers were experienced in data collection, none had prior experience with behavioural observation of parent-child interactions. We believe this was possible because of our emphasis during training on explaining a clear rationale for why we measure parent-child interactions, and simplifying the observation task to focus on a single behaviour during each 30-second time interval (i.e., to utilise either what you see or hear, not both). Certainly with greater personnel and financial resource, interobserver agreement could always be improved. Ideally observers would demonstrate reliability on around 15% of their sample: for our interviewers that would equate to between thirty and forty different dyads. It was simply not possible to record this number of different interactions before going into the field: a sample of this magnitude would represent an entirely separate study. Despite this, our findings demonstrate that reliability can be achieved within the practical constraints of a large cohort study.\nParent-child conversations differed as a function of maternal ethnicity. These findings were generally consistent with past research: Western parents tend to have more elaborative discussions (of which openended questions is a key coding target), for example, when compared with Asian parents (Wang, 2001; Wang & Fivush, 2005; Wang, Leichtman & Davies, 2000) . There is some evidence that Pacific parents (Schluter, Sundborn, Abbott & Paterson, 2007) , and some groups of Asian parents (Lau, Takeuchi & Alegria, 2006) more commonly use physical discipline. The current findings highlight slightly higher levels of observed physical discipline as well as higher rates of mild behavioural corrections for Pacific and Asian mothers.\nWe must consider the possibility, however, that ratings for ethnic minority dyads may be partly impacted by the nature of the task. None of the pictures specifically included M\u0101ori, Pacific or Asian children. Our data for these populations may also be impacted by higher rates of non-participation, particularly for Asian families. It may also be that the nature of the task is less culturally relevant. For example, the use of prompting pictures may be less appropriate or necessary within M\u0101ori culture with its strong tradition of oral story-telling (Reese, Hayne, & MacDonald, 2008) .\nGender differences were also consistent with the existing research pointing to differences in how sons and daughters are socialised. Girls are consistently found to display greater empathy than boys (see Chaplan & Aldao, 2013 , for a recent review). This is thought to be due to a combination of geneticallybased temperament differences and socialisation influences that encourage girls to be more socially driven and express positive rather than negative emotions (Chaplan & Aldao, 2013; Zahn-Waxler, 2000) . The finding of higher maternal discipline ratings with boys is also consistent with the existing literature. Interestingly, mothers were also rated as displaying greater warmth with sons than daughters.\nWhile this is somewhat surprising, it does concur with theory and research that emphasises warmth and discipline as two distinct parenting constructs. It also highlights the need to consider mediating and moderating factors -something that large longitudinal studies are ideally placed to do. In particular, further research is needed to examine interactions between child gender, child temperament, self-reported parenting practices, and observations of parent-child interactions.\nFindings related to maternal warmth warrant further discussion. While maternal warmth is theoretically (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bowlby, 1969) and empirically (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2001 ) related to attachment security, these are distinct constructs. A secure attachment bond is characterised by responsive, sensitive care-giving which allows a child to use their caregiver as a secure base from which to explore, and to return to seek comfort. In contrast, insecure attachment is more likely to be associated with inconsistent, rejecting or avoidant caregiving, and children in turn display avoidant, anxious, or mixed patterns of exploration and responding (Ainsworth et al., 1978) . Attachment security is a dyadic relationship (not a specific maternal behaviour) that encompasses cognitive internal working models as well as observed behaviours. Valid measurement of differences in attachment security is based on observations of young children under mild stress, for example, during separation (Ainsworth et al., 1978) . This is very different to the observation of maternal warmth during a typical parent-child interaction used here. Similarly, our measure of child empathy is just one example of emotional expression, which may not necessarily reflect children's responding across more salient situations (e.g., if a sibling or parent hurts themselves). This highlights the importance of considering observed behaviours in combination with parental self-report.\nOur findings also highlight areas where, in hindsight, a more differentiated coding scheme may be warranted. For example, more than half of our mothers used two or more open-ended questions. There may be variability in the complexity and quality of these questions that could be further separated. For example, a mother asking 'what's happening here?' and 'what else can you see?' could receive the same rating as a mother who asked 'why do you think they are washing the car?' and 'what sort of reward will they get for being so helpful?' Any future researchers using this task may want to consider modifying in this way.\nObservational methods, of course, are not without criticism. The very presence of an observer may create bias, combined with the somewhat artificial nature of engaging parents and children in a semistructured interaction task (Gardner, 2000) . For example, research indicates that parents talk more and laugh less with their toddlers when they think they are being videotaped (Field & Ignatoff, 1981) . However, one could argue that longitudinal cohorts may be less likely to display this type of reactivity: by the time our families were visited at age two, they had already met with Growing Up in New Zealand researchers on two occasions face-to-face in their own homes, and had completed at least two telephone interviews.\nIn conclusion, we believe that we have created a promising tool for the direct observation of parentchild behaviour in very large samples. Valid measurement requires multiple informants and multiple forms of measurement (Dunn & Kendrick, 1980) . It is our opinion that including behavioural observations of parent-child interactions, as well as parent report, will only strengthen our understanding of their contribution to children's emotional, behavioural and social development across time. We look forward to extensions and refinements of the tool and training procedures as other researchers adapt it for their specific purposes.\nElaine Reese, Amy L Bird, Mele Taumoepeau, Joanna M Schmidt, \"You are our eyes and our ears\"\u2026 Jatender Mohal, Cameron C Grant, Polly E Atatoa Carr, Susan M B Morton"}, {"section_title": "Endnotes", "text": "i There was occasional variability depending on chid availability and cooperation, but the Parent-Child Interaction task always followed the consent process and mother interview, and was typically administered part-way through the other child observations (it always followed the Stack and Topple motor play task, and was usually before the child's height and weight measurements).\nii Observers were also trained to establish coding reliability for other child observation tasks not included in this paper (e.g., Stack and Topple).\niii The initial training videos also used a mother-child picture description task, although the dyads in these videos used different prompting pictures to those used in the main study.
