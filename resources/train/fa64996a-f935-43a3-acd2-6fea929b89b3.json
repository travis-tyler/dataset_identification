MRI images of 949 (320 female, mean age 12.6 +/-3.3, range 7-21) healthy individuals were reviewed. Volumetric measurements of the basal ganglia were obtained using automated segmentation (FreeSurfer). We computed two lateralization indices: (L-R)/(L+R) (LI) and right/left ratio (RLR). Tolerance interval estimates were used to calculate reference ranges. Rightward asymmetry of the CN and leftward asymmetry of the PN and GP were confirmed. PN and GP volume decreased with age, but CN volume did not. The lateralization index decreased with age for PN, but not for CN and GP. RLR increased with age for PN and not for CN or GP. Females were associated with smaller volume, but not with either LI or RLR difference.

Precise measurements of basal ganglia volume: caudate nucleus (CN), putamen (PN) and globus pallidus (GP), can provide diagnostic information because in certain brain disorders such as autism, depression, schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) interhemispheric asymmetry in size of the basal ganglia has been reported [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . For instance, in comparison to healthy controls ADHD patients, especially males, have on average smaller left GP [6] [7] , patients with autism display both enlarged CN 8 , patients suffering from depression have significantly smaller PN [9] , whereas schizophrenic patients have a smaller total basal ganglia volume 10 .\nThe clinical significance of raw morphometric measurements of the basal ganglia, however, is not yet established. One reason might be the lack of reliable reference limits of basal ganglia volume established on a large group of healthy subjects of a wide range of age and both genders. Clinicians typically can detect more easily subtle differences in the volume of the basal ganglia between sides based on an assumption they should be symmetric. Precise volume measurements in an individual, however, seldom provide identical values between sides for any brain structure because of anatomical and measurements variability. Furthermore, reported small but substantial interhemispheric differences in average brain volume (less than 1%) indicate that extrapolation of average group symmetry in volume of any brain structure to individual patients may not be correct. Precise volumetric studies of major basal ganglia therefore have a potential to provide important information in detecting structural abnormalities by referring volume measurements to reference tolerance limits of interhemispheric differences. These tolerance are HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliant."}, {"section_title": "Patient population and cognitive evaluation", "text": "The initial dataset includes structural MRI scans from 1087 healthy subjects including 514 (273 males, 238 females) from the ADHD-200 dataset and 573 (474 males, 99 females) from the ABIDE dataset.

Available intelligence measurements (including full scale IQ) depending on the data contributing site were evaluated using the following tests: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition (WISC-IV), Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Chinese Children-Revised (WISCC-R), Differential Ability Scales II (DAS II), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales (WAIS), Hamburg-Wechsler Intelligence Test for Children (HAWIK-IV), Groninger Intel-limits can inform a diagnostician what side-toside differences in basal ganglia volume should still be considered still normal in patients with brain disorders.\nThus, the goal of our study was to estimate such reference tolerance limits of volume and lateralization indices based on automatic segmentation of basal ganglia of the brain from a large group of healthy subjects (n=949)."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Ethical approval", "text": "The study data were acquired from two datasets: Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, University of Pittsburgh), nevertheless there was no overlap between subjects.

This design was applied by Raz et al. 25 and reported evidence consistent with our findings for a different age range . In contrast to their population, our study focuses on childhood and adolescence.\nInfluence of age on basal ganglia growth and degeneration should be considered in the context of already known neurodegenerative disorders affecting the CN and GP. Huntington disease (HD) 26 and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) 27 are both late clinical onset, polyglutamine repeat disorders inherited in an autosomal dominant way and selectively causing atrophy of the CN in HD and the GP in DRPLA. In both disorders an anticipation phenomenon occurs meaning that the next generation of gene carriers will have a longer polyglutamine repeat region and will present clinical symptoms earlier in life. Such mechanism might be present in relation to basal ganglia volume in healthy individuals not affected by genetic risk of the disorders mentioned above.\nBased on previous studies, we expected that age would contribute to decrease the raw volume of the basal ganglia. Regression analysis was applied to define models including age and basal ganglia volume together with gender. Our data confirmed the age-related bilateral atrophy of the PN and GP volumes in males described by Gunning-Dixon et al., yet we also confirmed this relationship in females 24 . Caudate nucleus volume is not associated with age, which confirms previous findings from Vernaleken et al. 22 , but contradicts the Results from Abedelahi et al. 21 , Gunning-Dixon et al. 24 and Raz et al. 25 .\nThe mechanisms of age-related shrinkage of the basal ganglia are still unknown. One of the possible explanations may be synaptic pruning and neuronal selection. Neuronal network optimization is associated with cognitive development 2 . Such conclusion is limited by the cross-sectional design of this study. Negative associations of age and volume of GP and PN confirm this thesis, yet true verification can be provided only by measurement of dynamic Note that the right caudate nucleus is larger than left (R>L); the left putamen is larger than the right (L>R); the left globus pallidus is larger than the left (L>R).\nOur data confirmed our hypotheses and indicate that differences are present in all structures studied. These findings confirm prior Results from Giedd et al. 2 , Abedelahi et al. 21 and Rijpkema et al. 28 .\nThis sex difference might be related to total cerebral volume, sex chromosomes, hormonal and environmental effects or to their combination. Previous research shows that males have a larger total cerebral volume than females. Some researchers have indicated specific cortical regions where this difference is particularly pronounced 2, [29] [30] . According to a study by Munro et al. 31 the sexual dimorphism of the basal ganglia can be explained by the dopamine release system. Sex hormone concentration may also substantially influence basal ganglia volume because of the high density of estrogen and an-In other words, normal variation of polyglutamine region length might directly influence caudate and globus pallidus volume and indirectly impact the behavioural phenotype.\nThe genetic background related to the polyglutamine repeat within normal range might also explain the heritability of basal ganglia volume which has not been extensively studied so far. From a practical perspective, observing volume decline in basal ganglia and departure from expected reference ranges for age and gender may support quantitative prediction of disease progression.\nWe hypothesized that female gender is associated with lower volumes of all basal ganglia across the studied age range. We performed two-sided t-test analysis to identify the differences in basal ganglia volume across genders. 22 where LI was not correlated with age in the CN. However, their study group consisted of 21 male volunteers and the age drogen receptors 32 . This relationship is driven by estrogen that regulates the activity of dopamine-containing fibres originating in the midbrain and terminating in the basal ganglia 33 . The combination of sex hormones, dopamine release and basal ganglia volume contribute to higher prevalence of ADHD in male children having small basal ganglia volume 34 ."}, {"section_title": "Laterality indices of basal ganglia volume", "text": "We hypothesized that measures of asymmetry will have mean values different from zero in case of LI and one in case of RLR. We performed t-test analysis of asymmetry indices against the distribution of the same standard deviation and zero mean value. Generally all studied structures showed evidence consistent with our hypothesis.\nWe found two studies which identified lateralization indices of the basal ganglia. Analysis by Yamashita et al. (2011) in a group of 50 healthy right-handed subjects showed a rightward asymmetry only in the CN 14 hand, the trade-off between sample size and the number of participatory institutions becomes more difficult to solve when faced with the multitude of diverse hardware implementations. Data clustering can be considered one of the additional complications arising from multicentre data collection. These problems can be resolved by applying some (not very precise) changes in the process of acquiring data, such as in other projects, e.g. the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative).\nWe have the largest group across all the studies looking into basal ganglia volume and asymmetry. There is a difference in proportion of females and males driven in comparison to the general population. Our study group contained fewer females because of overrepresentation of males in the patient population in the ABIDE cohort. Male-to-female proportion was 1.96 whereas in the normal population this ratio is 1.06 35 . An increased frequency of males (Male=629, Female=320, s- Figure 1 , Table 1 ) will contribute to higher mean and median volume of the whole group in comparison to an equal gender proportion population.
