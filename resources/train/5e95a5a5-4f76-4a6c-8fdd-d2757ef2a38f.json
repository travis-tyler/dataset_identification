Despite this reduction, academic requirements for final graduation were kept constant to maintain the level of skills. For this reason, the number of teaching hours per year was increased, leading to a higher learning intensity at school, i.e. the ratio of academic curriculum content per unit of instructional time. Leaving the school entry age unchanged, the reform should therefore enable higher secondary school graduation with the same level of qualification one year earlier. Given that (West) Germany had possessed an educational system with 13 years of higher secondary schooling for more than 50 years, the debate about the reform wasand is stillvery controversial. A major issue of the public debate concerns the question of whether it is possible to improve educational performance and quality by increasing the learning intensity at school.\nAs schooling is administered by the federal states in Germany, the reform was not implemented nationwide, but was left to the discretion of the states. In the state of Saxony-Anhalt, the reform was implemented in 2003, eliminating the 13th year of university preparatory secondary school (Gymnasium) for students enrolled in grade 9 at that time. This first cohort to be affected took the Abitur after 12 years in 2007 together with the last cohort graduating after 13 years. Using primary data from the Saxony-Anhalt double cohort of 2007 graduates, we evaluate the effects of the reform on school achievement in mathematics and German literature. These two classes are mandatory in the final examinations and can be supposed to provide a good approximation of the spectrum of required abilities for university studies. Identical final written exams for both cohorts taken exactly at the same time allow for direct assessment of educational performance. Moreover, to evaluate the relevance for post-secondary schooling decisions, we estimate the effect on the probability of enrollment in university. As the reform in Saxony-Anhalt was announced and implemented in a timely manner and the affected students had already been enrolled in secondary school for several years, assignment into the treatment group (with Abitur after 12 years) and the control group (with Abitur after 13 years) can be assumed to be random. This provides a clean natural experiment for evaluating the effects of the reform in 2007. According to the implementation of the reform in Saxony-Anhalt, its impact on a specific outcome results from a combination of the increased learning intensity at school and the younger age at graduation. Both aspects, the schooling effect and the age effect, are integral parts of the reform effect in which we are interested.\nUnderstanding the relationship between learning intensity at school and human capital accumulation is important to avoid a burdening or understimulation of students. However, little is known about this relationship so far and empirical research has mainly focused on variations in instructional time. Pischke (2007) investigates the impact of shortening the instructional time by two short school years in 1966/67 in West Germany on grade repetition, secondary schooling opportunities, earnings and employment. His results show no effects on earnings and employment, but he finds increases in the number of grade repetitions and the choice of lower academic paths. Other evidence is provided by Skirbekk (2006) , who looks at the effect of variation in the duration of schooling on human capital using test scores from Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) for different Swiss cantons. He discovers that differences in the length of the Swiss academic program across regions have no influence on the school achievement in mathematics and science when schoolspecific effects are taken into account. 1 In the Province of Ontario, Canada, an educational reform took place similar to that in Germany. The length of schooling in high school was reduced by one year (from 13 to 12) with the major dif-ference from the German experience being a modified academic curriculum. In the Ontario reform, fewer courses in main subjects, such as mathematics and the English language, were made available for the treatment group and, therefore, the impact of the reform on learning intensity cannot be determined. A further difference stems from the fact that the 13th year was not a fully fledged academic grade as it is in Germany. Students in Ontario were able to graduate from high school after 12 years. Before the educational reform was enacted, students could complete their schooling by utilizing this additional year or not. Morin (2010) estimates the effect of abolishing the 13th year on the academic performance of high-ability students in their first year at university. He finds only small effects on student performance. A similar study by Krashinsky (2006) analyzes the impact on students with lower high school grade averages. The estimates indicate larger negative impacts on academic performance at university.\nOur estimation results of school achievements indicate heterogeneous effects with regard to the academic subjects considered. In addition, gender differences in the effects can be established. Significant negative effects are discovered in mathematics for both genders, but they are more pronounced for males. In contrast, no differences are discovered in German literature. The reform further implies a negative effect on the probability of university enrollment for females in the year of graduation. For males, no difference in university enrollment is found.\nThe remainder of the study is organized as follows. Details of the schooling system, the implementation of the reform and the identification in the natural experiment are provided in Section 2. A description of the dataset used for the empirical analysis is provided in Section 3. Section 4 shows the empirical estimates, Section 5 discusses the implications from these results and the final section concludes."}, {"section_title": "THE EDUCATIONAL REFORM", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Schooling in Germany", "text": "As a result of a longer university curriculum coupled with a prolonged period of secondary schooling, university graduates in Germany are older than in other developed countries when they enter the labor market.\n2 In 1999, the countries of the European Union signed the Bologna Declaration to create a European Higher Education Area (EHEA) by 2010 that includes the adoption of the academic degrees (Bachelor, Master and Doctorate) and the introduction of a credit transfer system to recognize higher educational course work done at other locations. This harmonization of the European educational policy imposed pressure upon Germany to reform its educational system.\nOrganized as a federal republic, the responsibility for educational policy (including the funding of public schools) is entrusted to the 16 federal states (Bundesl\u20ac ander). In the majority of states, students are enrolled in primary school at the age of six and remain there for four years. Upon completion, they are separated according to their cognitive skills into three available types of secondary schooling. The Hauptschule is the basic secondary school and provides educational instruction through to the ninth grade, the minimum required length of schooling. The Realschule provides the intermediate level of instruction through to the tenth grade. Afterwards, graduates from both of these schools usually commence some sort of vocational training in the German apprenticeship system. Until recently, all states (with the exception of Saxony and Thuringia) provided nine years of university preparatory schooling in their Gymnasium leading to the Abitur (the university admittance qualification), i.e. 13 years of schooling in total. 3 After the German political reunification in 1990, the West German schooling system was adopted by the East German states, where university entrance qualification had previously been achieved after 12 years of schooling. 4 Two of the East German states, Saxony and Thuringia, introduced a student selection procedure before the tenth grade, but retained the 12-year graduation policy. The aboveaverage scoring of students in these federal states in comparison assessments (see PISA-Konsortium Deutschland, 2008) added further support to the debate concerning the abolishment of the 13th Gymnasium year in most German states."}, {"section_title": "Implementation of the Reform", "text": "Saxony-Anhalt was the first German state to initiate the educational policy reform that shortened the length of secondary schooling by one year. 5 The change was announced in 2003 and was implemented several months later at the beginning of the 2003/2004 academic year. The first students to be affected by this change were at that time in the ninth grade and were expected to graduate after 12 years of schooling. In spring of 2007, Saxony-Anhalt students in the 12th grade (henceforth referred to as G12) and the 13th grade (G13) participated in a joint commencement ceremony.\nThe reform was implemented as follows. For the G12 students, the 13th year had been eliminated. The academic requirements for the Abitur, however, remained unaltered. As only the last two years of secondary schooling is 3. In addition, several states provide a further kind of comprehensive schooling, the Integrierte Gesamtschule (a comprehensive school), where students are not guided into a specific academic path beforehand. In this school, students can graduate after nine, ten or thirteen years and obtain identically valued academic degrees as in the other three types of secondary schooling. 4. The German Democratic Republic (GDR) had a system of compulsory education, but students were not selected according to scholastic ability before the tenth grade. After the tenth grade, only those who demonstrated a high level of cognitive skills in conjunction with an inclination towards the socialist ideological activities promoted by the regime were eligible for admittance into a two-year Gymnasium. University entrance qualifications were obtained after the 12th grade. 5. Currently, all German states except one have decided to eliminate the last year of secondary schooling. The Kultusministerkonferenz, KMK (a conference consisting of the Secretaries of Education and Cultural Affairs), accentuated the importance of this issue: 'The responsible handling of the lifetime and the educational time spent by young people is of central concern' (press release,\nconsidered when eligibility for Abitur is determined, the academic curriculum of the 12th and 13th years now had to be pushed forward. For the G12 students, the curriculum of the former 11th year (called the preliminary grade) was distributed throughout the lower grades. The whole curriculum of instruction was moved forward in German literature as well as in the foreign languages. Only minor reductions were implemented in mathematics and chemistry, whereas in some other subjects (e.g. biology and history), parts of the 11th-grade curriculum were transformed into additional elective courses. The total instructional time for the G12 students was thus reduced by one academic year. This loss was eased, however, by the addition of some extra classroom hours. Three instructional hours per week were added in the ninth grade and three in the tenth grade. Schools were allowed to decide, however, which subjects would receive these additional instructional hours."}, {"section_title": "Identification: The natural experiment", "text": "The implementation of the policy reform in Saxony-Anhalt provides a natural experiment setting for the evaluation of the effects of a substantial variation in learning intensity on human capital accumulation and post-schooling decisions. The assignment of students to the treatment group, G12, and to the control group, G13, can be assumed to be random. This is due to the fact that the public announcement and the policy implementation took place within three months. In addition, the impacted students in the treatment group had been enrolled in secondary school for a number of years already and simply received the notification without being required to initiate any actions. If there had been some degree of selection bias between groups, this should be observable when comparing the pretreatment characteristics of the sample. Nevertheless, internal validity of the natural experiment may have been affected if parents had reacted in anticipation of the reform. Such a reaction would have entailed a move of parents to a different state within Germany. The opportunity costs of such a move, however, would have been extraordinarily high, in particular given the short time span of the implementation of the reform. Moreover, parents can be expected to have had experience with the 12-year graduation policy from the first years after German unification when Saxony-Anhalt initially maintained the shorter school duration (until 1996) . Therefore, this type of anticipation effect is perceived as being not very likely. The other possibility would be for students to attempt to commute to a school in a neighboring state, but for the sample in the study, the closest border is quite far away, making this option equally unattractive.\nAssuming internal validity to hold, there may still be concerns with respect to the external validity of the natural experiment, i.e. translating the specific findings from the study into a more general setting (see e.g. Meyer, 1995, for a comprehensive discussion). A serious obstacle could be the existence of a general time trend in the accumulation of human capital. If this were the case, the estimates presented here would not capture the causal effect of shortening the duration of secondary schooling. Although a time trend in cognitive achievement is perhaps likely in younger children, it is not very likely to be present in the later periods of educational development considered in this study. Another obstacle Are We Spending Too Many Years in School?\ncould be the existence of transition effects. If teachers need some time for gaining experience in coping with the increased demands of instruction, the reform effects could diminish for subsequent cohorts. However, while these learning effects could be relevant for some teachers, the majority of teachers in Saxony-Anhalt had already been involved in a 12-year graduation policy during the first years after German unification, making implementation effects less likely."}, {"section_title": "DATA DESCRIPTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "The sample", "text": "The empirical analysis is based on primary data obtained from a pen-and-paper survey that was administered to the 2007 Abitur classes of 12 secondary schools. Ten of these schools are located in the city of Magdeburg and two in Halberstadt. 6 All 12 schools are generic and can be considered representative for other public schools. The questionnaire consisted of 101 questions relating to various aspects of the student's personality, social background and educational experiences.\nAs there is no central register providing addresses of students (neither on a county level nor for Germany as a whole), we had to build a unique register for the project at hand. Two main channels were used to identify addresses: on the one hand, we used address information posted in yearbooks of the individual schools. 7 On the other hand, we contacted the deans of all schools to ask for their support. Some of the schools agreed to send the questionnaires via the dean's office using the recorded addresses, while for others were sent by us. Questionnaires were distributed in February and March of 2009 with a response deadline stipulated for the end of April. Overall, 1,628 students graduated from these schools in 2007. For 164 graduates, no names or addresses were available. All in all, 1,464 questionnaires were sent to graduates and 806 responses were received, which corresponds to a response rate of 55%. Moreover, there were no differences in response rates between G12 and G13. We imposed one limitation on the analysis sample for the sake of homogeneity: only non-grade-repeating students who continuously stayed in Germany during their schooling were considered, i.e. students who went abroad for a student exchange and students who repeated a grade were excluded from the analysis. We excluded these students due to the fact that for the G12 cohort, the students who went abroad as well as the students who repeated a grade took the final exams one year later. Our estimation sample contains 724 observations. 8 The share of male students (37%) is smaller than that of female students (63%). This finding is not a result of an imbalance in the response rates, but reflects a trend of higher female 6. Magdeburg (pop. 230,000) is located near the center of Saxony-Anhalt and is the state capital.\nFor post-secondary education, it has a university, a university of applied sciences and several research institutes. Halberstadt (pop. 75,000) is a rural community located in a mountainous area, surrounded by villages and smaller cities. The secondary schools are located in the larger population centers and a university of applied sciences is available. 7. This approach was approved by the data protection commissioner of Saxony-Anhalt. 8. Numbers of observations reported in the estimation results below may vary due to item nonresponse.\nparticipation in university preparatory schooling that began in Germany more than a decade ago (Destatis, 2009 ). The abolishing of a whole year of schooling while maintaining the curriculum will result in less time for instruction and homework, and will thus substantially increase the learning intensity at school. This increase may affect human capital accumulation and the choice of further education. For the estimation of the effects of the increased learning intensity at school due to the educational reform on student's academic achievement, we regarded two academic subject areas that can be construed as proxies for important intellectual capabilities required by students for further study. Mathematics requires logical thinking and a capacity for abstraction. German literature promotes the linguistic instinct and is useful for developing competence in communication. Standardized written exams were employed and the same academic grading scheme, provided by the state Department of Education, was used to evaluate all the students involved. To analyze the effect of the reform on further educational choice, we examined the rate of university enrollment in October 2007 and October 2008. October is the starting month of the fall semester in Germany. As military service was in place in Germany during that time, males were likely to postpone university enrollment."}, {"section_title": "Descriptive statistics", "text": "Mean values for a selection of student-specific variables according to gender are presented in Grades until year 10 range from 1 (excellent) to 6 (failed) and are reverted from grades in years 12/ 13 ranging from 0 (failed) to 15 (excellent).\nobtained in mathematics and German literature by the students in the G12 and G13 groups. The achievement scores range within the interval [0, 15], where 0 denotes failure and 15 denotes excellent achievement. These post-reform grades are significantly different for both genders in mathematics, but do not differ in German literature. To interpret this difference as being a result of the reform effect requires, among other factors, student achievement not to have been different before the reform. This is perceived also in the assumption of the natural experiment. To check the reliability, the second panel of Table 1 contrasts student achievement scores in grade 7 between groups. Here, achievement scores range within the interval [1, 6] , where 1 denotes excellent achievement and 6 failure (i.e. the scale is reverted). In line with the assumption, no significant differences can be established. In addition, we have added some selected sociodemographic variables of the students. As there are no differences observable, they provide further support for the natural experiment assumption.\nTurning to the second outcome of interest, the post-secondary schooling choice, Figure 1 depicts the development of the university enrollment rates according to gender and group between October 2007 and October 2008. Male graduates have a clearly lower enrollment rate during the first year after graduation than females, which can be explained by German military service or alternative civilian service. Moreover, no differences in the enrollment rates of male students across grades can be observed from the descriptive comparison. In October 2008, i.e. the start of the fall semester one year after graduation, the rate of male university students jumps to the level of the female graduates. In contrast, the descriptive picture indicates a clear difference between female graduates of G12 and G13. Whereas the enrollment rate is about 55% in the G13 group, in the G12 group it is only about 45%.\nThe published literature indicates that the degree of intellectual support that a student receives from the family environment is an important factor for educational success (Fuchs and Woessmann, 2007, as well as Todd and Wolpin, 2007) . Mean values of certain variables characterizing the family background of the graduates are presented in Table 2 . These variables relating to characteristics of mothers and fathers and further home-related factors show almost no differences between treated and non-treated students. This further supports the picture of comparability between the G12 and the G13 group. It fosters the assumption of the natural experiment to hold, and we do not expect any systematic differences in the outcomes due to the socioeconomic background of the students."}, {"section_title": "EMPIRICAL RESULTS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Estimation strategy", "text": "Given its implementation and the fact that it is supported by the descriptive comparison of the treated and non-treated group before the reform took place, the educational reform fulfills the requirements of a natural experiment. Hence, we do not have to consider severe selection between the G12 and G13 groups regarding the observable and unobservable characteristics prior to the reform. Nevertheless, for the estimation of the treatment effect on academic achievement and post-secondary schooling choice, some further aspects must be regarded. First, as the sample under consideration stems from a set of 12 schools, school-related influences may play a role. Examples for these school-specific effects are may be differences in the quality of teachers, differences in the infrastructure, differences in the number (and background) of the peers, or the composition of students overall. Therefore, to allow for an unbiased estimate of the reform effect, consideration of school fixed effects is crucial, as they capture all between-school variation. Moreover, the reform effects may differ according to gender. Green and Oxford (1995) confirm that females and males prefer different learning strategies, whereas De Bellis et al. (2001) take into account differences in biological and mental development to conclude that altering the instructional time may lead to gender-specific results. To take into account potential gender differences explicitly, we will undertake separate estimations for male and female students in addition to pooled estimations.\nWe have also included a number of further control variables, which were not affected by the reform, to increase the efficiency of the estimates. Examples include age at school enrollment and background characteristics of the family from the time before the reform took place. The variables relating to specific family background characteristics have proven to be relevant in the empirical literature (see e.g. Fuchs and Woessmann, 2007) . For the achievement scores at graduation, we examine the marks in the same subjects from grade 7 to take into account previous school achievement. If the assumption of a natural experiment is valid, no significant variations in the treatment parameter should be induced by including any further background variables or different specifications of these background variables. Instead, selecting the appropriate model increases the precision of the estimates.\nFinally, related to the school effects, we have to consider the class-level clustering of the sampled students in the estimation. As students in the sample come from a distinct number of classes within schools, there may be some correlation of in-class outcomes. We apply the cluster-robust sandwich estimator suggested by White (1980) . The number of clusters is sufficiently high (above 80) for all models estimated, such that consistency of the variance estimates is presumed.\nTo formalize the estimation model, let D i denote a binary dummy variable taking the value 1 if the student was assigned to the treatment group (G12), and 0 otherwise. Under the assumptions of the natural experiment, we can estimate the treatment effect on achievement scores for individual i by OLS as follows:\ny i;s denotes the outcome of interest in subject s, i.e. the standardized achievement scores in mathematics and German literature obtained in the final written exams. a s is the constant, c j;s denotes the fixed effects of schools j and x i is a matrix of further explanatory variables with d s as the corresponding coefficient vector. The parameter of interest is the average treatment effect b s which denotes the marginal change in SDs of y that is due to the reform. In the estimation, we employ two different specifications for x i ; the first contains student characteristics (age at enrollment in school, marks in grade 7 and in the pooled sample a gender dummy), whereas the second adds further information about the household (the number of books at home and father characteristics comprising unemployment experience, occupational degree and help with homework).\nTo evaluate the effect of the reform on the enrollment rate in university, we follow the same logic. We estimate:\nwhere U i denotes enrollment in university of individual i and prob\u00f0U i \u00bc 1\u00de is the probability of enrolling. We estimate equation (2) "}, {"section_title": "Schooling achievements", "text": "Regarding mathematics, the estimated coefficients in the pooled sample of about \u00c0.2 SDs reveal a significant negative effect of the educational reform, see Table 3 . The average student suffers from the reform through a clear decrease in mathematical skills. When male and female students are considered separately, gender differences become quite apparent. Although students graduating after 12 years experience a decrease in grades in mathematics independently of gender, the negative effect tends to be almost twice as large for males compared to females. Males are on average slightly (about \u00c0.3 SDs) worse off, whereas females have lower grades of about \u00c0.15 SDs. The estimated effects for both genders are significant. For the average male student, this translates into a 10.9% reduction in his conditional mean final grade, whereas the average female student experiences only a 7.9% reduction.

In the case of mathematics, there seem to be limitations in the ability of young people to accelerate the accumulation of knowledge. The findings further clarify the different effects of shortening schooling duration for both genders beyond the gender-specific constant regarded in the pooled estimation. Males and females react differently to the applied changes in learning intensity at school. Turning to the effects in German literature, the estimated coefficients in the pooled sample (Table 4 ) reveal a non-significant effect of the reform of about \u00c0.034 to \u00c0.045 SDs. When male and female students are considered separately, gender-specific differences once again tend to be apparent. Although females earn on average higher grades, gender-specific regressions show that female students would experience no change in their final grades, whereas the average male student would experience a negligible and statistically insignificant increase of 1.7%. In contrast to the effect on grades in mathematics, there are no significant effects due to shortening the schooling duration on those in German literature."}, {"section_title": "D", "text": "(1)\n(2)\n(1)\n(2)\nIndep.

Hence, besides affecting the skill level at graduation, the reform could be expected to affect university enrollment. Lower enrollment rates may result from the average lower scoring of G12 graduates compared to G13 graduates, or from the overload due to increased learning intensity at school. The descriptive picture above has already indicated differences between G12 and G13 groups for females. The corresponding estimation results with consideration of further confounding factors are provided in Table 5 for university enrollment in 2007 and 2008. Marginal effects are displayed that can be interpreted as a point increase in the average enrollment probability.\nThe estimates confirm the descriptive picture in 2007. In the pooled sample, G12 students have on average about a \u00c0.06 to \u00c0.07 lower probability of enrolling in university. There are a number of possible reasons for this result, including the postponing of the decision to study at university, the taking up of a vocational education course in the German apprenticeship system or a gap year (usually taken to do voluntary work in the social sector). Consideration of gender differences shows that women's enrollment rates in particular are affected by the reform. Treated women have on average a \u00c0.10 to \u00c0.11 lower probability of enrolling in university directly after graduation. This is a significant reduction. For males, no effect of the reform can be established. Nevertheless, they have about 25% lower enrollment rates in university compared to women, which can plausibly be explained by military service or alternative civilian service. One year after the reform, in October 2008, G12 students do not differ anymore from G13 students, and the estimates presented do not indicate any statistically significant treatment effects."}, {"section_title": "Robustness analysis: Schooling or age effects", "text": "As affected students not only have one year less schooling, but are also one year younger, the question arises as to whether the reform effect is mainly a schooling effect or an age effect. The cut-off birth date for a school year in Germany is 30 June. Hence, G13 students are normally born between July 1987 and June 1988, whereas G12 students are born between July 1988 and June 1989. To investigate the role of the age effect, the analysis is focused on students who are not very different with respect to age but have a different number of years of schooling. Regressions are run for the subgroup of students born in 1988. One half of this subgroup consists of the younger G13 students (born on or before 30 June 1988), and the other half consists of the older G12 students (born after 30 June in 1988). The age difference in this subgroup is much smaller than in the original sample and is not larger than the age difference within each of the G12 and G13 cohorts. 9 The corresponding results are shown in Table 6 . Regarding the effect for mathematics, the absolute level of the estimated treatment effect is slightly smaller than in the full sample. But the effect is also statistically significant for this more narrowly defined sample conditional on age. If we are willing to assume that individuals born within one year are not very different when age 18-19, the parameter estimates indicate that the increase in learning intensity at school clearly affects the level of qualification. The smaller magnitude of the estimates also implies that age effects may contribute to the reform effect as well. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, both effects are integral parts of the reform effect and cannot be disentangled in practice due to the nature of the reform. For German literature, the coefficient estimates echo the results from the full sample and no significant differences are found.\nThe results for university enrollment in October 2007 and October 2008 show identical signs of the coefficients for all groups, but magnitude and significance 9. Similar approaches are applied, for example, by Krashinsky (2006) and Morin (2010) .\nAre We Spending Too Many Years in School?\ndiffer in some cases. The only significant effect is related to the enrollment rate of female students in October 2007, and the size of the marginal effect is even larger than in the full sample. Again, the finding indicates at least in this case that the reform effect can be explained to a large extent by the increased learning intensity at school, but age effects also contribute to the overall effect. However, the difference between the estimate for the full sample (\u00c010.8 percentage points) and the restricted sample where students have comparable age (\u00c012.9 percentage points) is only about 2 percentage points. This indicatesvery loosely speaking and for this casethat only about a sixth of the overall effect can be attributed to the age effect."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "As indicated by the empirical results, shortening the length of secondary schooling by one year without making a commensurate reduction in the academic curriculum affects the behavior of the impacted students. The time available for instructional purposes is reduced in almost all subject areas and only a limited number of additional hours are added in the core subjects. Consequently, the time available for absorbing the relevant material, for accomplishing the necessary homework, for comprehending the essentials and reiterating the pertinent subject matter declines, while the academic requirements remain the same. The learning intensity at school, the quantity of material to be learned per time period, increases significantly. This acceleration in the tempo of learning will affect student performance in various ways. Some students may not be able to cope with the increased requirements per year. Therefore, dropout ratios or repeating grades may become more likely. Although these behavioral patterns already existed before the educational reform was enacted, they may well be reinforced and become increasingly prevalent. In order to analyze these further effects of the reform, the number of school dropouts, grade repeaters and those who changed schools would be required. Unfortunately, access to these numbers is restricted. Therefore, the fraction of students who complete a university eligible secondary education after the compulsory period of schooling is all that is available. 10 Mandatory schooling in Germany ends after nine years, after which time students can depart and commence vocational training. To some extent, this departure behavior may also be affected by the reform. Therefore, we compared the number of ninth grade students attending the Gymnasium to those who completed the secondary school final examinations in regular time. In the G13 group, 78.3% of the students graduated. In the G12 group, a lower figure, 69.7%, was found. Approximately half of this difference can be attributed to the fact that the rules for spending a year abroad differ between groups. Students in the G12 group who studied a year abroad graduated one year later in 2008, whereas students of the G13 group graduated in 2007. 11 The remaining difference covers those students who were not able to cope with the increased learning intensity at school. If especially low-ability students disappeared from the G12 group, the average grades of the G12 students would probably be higher than the average grades of the G13 students at the time of final examinations. In this case, our estimates are upwardly biased. Due to the negative sign of our estimates, they can sensibly be interpreted as the lower bound of the reform effects, i.e. if bias exists, the true effects would be larger.\nThe empirical results indicate substantially differing effects on human capital accumulation. The impacts are significantly negative on student performance in mathematics for both genders. The effects, however, are insignificant in German literature. One possible explanation of these findings could be the existence of different requirements in higher grades for the subject areas considered here. The curriculum in mathematics requires exposure to new fields, for example statistics, accompanied by the learning of new methods and the understanding of the underlying concepts. The curriculum in German literature focuses on the refinement of familiar concepts and on the application of these concepts. More than half of the time of the curriculum in German literature is devoted to written and oral practice of German language, the remaining time is used to study literature and media. In addition, students are using the German language during day-today life, but mathematical content is mainly provided during school lessons. Hence, both subjects differ with respect to the learning context, which may further explain the differences found. Eren and Henderson (2011) make a similar argument regarding the effects of additional homework on test scores. They find evidence of positive and significant effects of homework on mathematics test scores (see also Aksoy and Link, 2000; Eren and Henderson, 2008) , but little or 10. The Statistical Office of Saxony-Anhalt has provided these data uniquely for the purpose at hand. 11. Those moving abroad from the former G13 group spent grade 10 or grade 11 in another country. They were allowed to return to their former classes or were sent into other G13 or G12 classes.\nno impact on test scores in literature. The effect in German literature indicates that the marginal contribution of the 13th year to native language skills is negligible. The marginal contribution to mathematical skills, however, is highly significant and may have relevant effects on labor demand and supply. To match the demand of engineers and graduates from life sciences in Germany, people with excellent mathematical skills are needed. The negative impact of the educational reform indicates that additional responsibility for the preparation of students will be passed on to the universities. The estimates of the effects on university enrollment rates indicate a clearly lower participation of females due to the reform in the first year after graduation. Contrasting these findings with the original purpose of the reform, namely shortening of the overall education time until graduation from university to compete with international standards, the aim is achieved for the majority of students but not for all. Despite the 'catching-up' effect of the G12 students one year after the reform in terms of enrollment rates in university, some students lost the year of education gained simply by enrolling one year later in university."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "The gain in human capital that can be attributed to the instructional hours received in schools depends on a diverse set of factors. The innate ability of students to absorb the available knowledge, the amount of effort they expend in this intellectual endeavor, the possibility to interact with stimulating teachers, an amiable social contact with peers and the availability of up-to-date academic resources in school, to name but a few, all play an important role. At present, there is little evidence concerning the function of the academic curriculum as an important institutional factor in this process of human capital accumulation. This study, therefore, evaluates the effects of a policy reform that took place in 2007 in the state of Saxony-Anhalt in Germany which shortened the duration of secondary schooling by one full year while maintaining the academic curriculum requirements for graduation virtually unaltered. The reform substantially increased the learning intensity at school experienced by the students involved in the reform. Using data on the double cohort of graduates in 2007, we can expect that the implementation of the reform provides a natural experiment for the identification of the effects of interest. Nevertheless, despite this setting may allow quite general conclusions, the empirical results reported in this study are valid for the specific cohort of graduates in the first place.\nThe estimated effects of the increased learning intensity at school on student school achievement depend on the particular subject areas studied. Moreover, they differ according to gender. Significant negative effects on student school performance in mathematics are discovered that are stronger for males than for females. No differences are discovered in final grades earned in German literature. These results tend to suggest that linear human capital models where hours of instructional time are positively related to human capital accumulation, represented by test scores, provide an inappropriate explanation of the knowledge gains associated with additional schooling (c.f. Pischke, 2007 Pischke, , p. 1240 . The estimated effects on university enrollment show significantly lower take-up rates of females in the year of graduation, but no differences for males. Due to military service in Germany, males have an overall lower propensity to start university studies directly. However, rates catch up in the second year to the level of females.\nOur empirical results indicate that some students are not able to cope with an increased learning intensity at school. Lowering it in such demanding subjects as mathematics by additional instructional time, perhaps at the expense of less intellectually demanding subjects, is a reasonable recommendation. Nevertheless, additional research is required to study the role of the duration of schooling upon the skill formation process. The results presented further suggest that the management of the educational process, relating to academic curriculum planning and, as a result, learning intensity (at school) are important. Policy-makers should turn their attention from raising the quantity of education to increasing the quality of its delivery."}]
