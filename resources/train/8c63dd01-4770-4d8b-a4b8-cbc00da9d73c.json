Many countries in Europe have already developed measures to encourage researchers to remain in or to return to their country of origin but the effect of these policies remains unclear (Laudel, 2005). Understanding the motivations and facilitating/hampering factors underlying the phenomenon is an important input in the formulation of policies to attract researchers (back) to Europe. Mogu\u00e9rou (2006) lists some caveats that have to be taken into account when discussing the brain drain problem. He argues that a correct conclusion on the brain drain problem cannot be made until issues like return migration of European PhDs, the net balances of brain gain and brain loss in relation to the stock of PhDs, and the quality of the PhDs who circulate are looked into properly. The extra-EU study tries to contribute to this discussion by investigating what is driving EU researchers to the US and what is the reason for their return or no return to Europe."}, {"section_title": "Evidence from the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG)", "text": "The focus in the NSCG lies on the mobility of EU researchers to the US, their stay rates and influencing factors. Even though the groups of researchers targeted by this survey are not considered representative groups, the findings of this USbased survey can provide a general picture which can be compared to the findings of the current extra-EU survey on mobility of researchers. The 2003 NSCG was drawn from those residing in the United States on October 1, 2003 or residing abroad as U.S. military personnel. A major drawback which has to be taken into account is that the base sample of the NSCG is only refreshed once every ten-years, resulting in gaps in our knowledge of how the workforce is changing over the decade between the decennial censuses. Therefore, we are likely to undercount for example the number of scientists and engineers who are in the United States on temporary visas. The focus for this report has been on recent adult migrants in the U.S who had been trained in S&E fields and had emigrated, on initial visas for a period of six months or longer, to the U.S. as adults since 1989, and who were now employed in S&E occupations. This is called the 'recent cohort' of adult migrants (representing over 50% of all adult migrants educated in S&E and employed in S&E occupations in 2003) trained in S&E fields and occupied in S&E fields in 2003 to which this exercise for the purposes of this report has been based. For the recent cohort of EU27 migrants, the top three \"first most important\" reasons for coming to the U.S. were: (1) job or economic opportunities, (2) educational opportunities, and (3) the scientific or professional infrastructure. The same reasons were mentioned as the \"second most important reasons\" for moving to the US. We also found that EU27 migrants tend to be employed less often than migrants from other countries in the business/industry sector, but more often in the higher education, government and other education sectors. Related to this, we found that EU27 migrants were overrepresented relative to recent migrants from other countries in terms of devoting time towards performing basic research, applied research and \"other\" work activities. On the other hand, EU27 migrants spend less time than other migrants doing development, design or computer applications. Evidence from the Extra-EU survey"}, {"section_title": "Design of the survey and target groups", "text": "The study on the extra-EU mobility has two main target groups and two additional ones: \u2022 Group M1 (EU-US mobile): EU researchers (researchers who have received their highest degree in the EU) and have worked or are currently working in the US. \u2022 Group M2 (US-EU mobile): US researchers (researchers who have received their highest degree in the US) and have worked or are currently working in the EU. \u2022 Group M3: Researchers who have been mobile after receiving highest degree but do not belong to any of the two groups mentioned before. \u2022 Group M4: Researchers who have not been mobile after receiving highest degree. For all four groups the total population of researchers is unknown, resulting not only in the fact that the survey is not representative but also, that we had to rely on convenience sampling in order to approach researchers who could potentially belong to one of these groups. Web-based search and indirect sampling methods were used to reach the target groups. This indicates that the survey sample is not a statistically representative one and as such the conclusions that can be derived from the survey cannot be generalized to the underlying researchers' population. Consequently, it is recommended that no indicators are not calculated from this sample on specific sample stratifications (e.g. by country, field of science, etc.), since these would not be representative as well. Nevertheless, the Extra-EU sur-vey covers a relatively large sample of around 5 500 researchers, therefore the results and findings, though not representative of the underlying population, provide a very useful 'picture' of the characteristics and opinions of the researchers who have been or not mobile between the EU and US as well as among other regions. The main results from the EU-US mobility survey (1) General characteristics The socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents show that are the following: 56 percent of the 5544 respondents reside in the EU, 30 percent in the US and 14 percent in other countries. 867 respondents belong to the EU-US mobility group (M1); 321 to the US-EU mobility group (M2); 2429 to the 'other' mobility group (M3) and 1927 to the non-mobile group (M4). A larger part of the respondents are men (53%) and a majority (74%) of the respondents are married or co-habiting. More than half of the respondents (52%) obtained their highest educational attainment in the past ten years. Most of the respondents (86%) hold a PhD. Nearly one third has been mobile as a student and 29 percent has worked in industry as a student. With respect to the respondents' employment situation and their career path, we found that: 15 percent are currently PhD-researchers while 42 percent are postdoctoral researchers. Nearly half of the respondents (45%) are involved in some form of formal collaboration with academic researchers from other countries. Regarding the future prospects of their career, it appears that EU-residents are in general confident but to a lesser extent than non-EU-resident researchers. 85% of the researchers are working in the public sector and most of them have always been in that sector (75%). This is expected since the webbased sampling mainly targeted researchers working in this sector. The respondents are quite mobile with respect to both employers and countries: around half of the researchers have worked for two to three employers since graduation with a lower percentage for the non-mobile group suggesting that employer-and geographical mobility go hand in hand. (2) Experience of mobility (2.a) Motivations for mobility The motivations for becoming mobile (or non-mobile) can be grouped in two large parts, namely personal and professional motivations. The top-three motivations were clearly professional: personal education and research agenda, career progression goals and prospects to work with leading experts (\"star scientists\"). A striking finding was that the survey results indicate that researchers who are/have been mobile from the EU to the US have stronger professional motivations to move to the US than those who move in the other direction, while researchers who move from the US to the EU have stronger personal/cultural motivations than those moving from the EU to the US. This implies that EU-based researchers have higher incentives to move to the US in order to fulfil their professional ambitions than their US-based colleagues moving to the EU. For researchers who do not become mobile professional factors are not the driving force for their decision not to move abroad but personal reasons appear more important in dissuading a researcher to move to another country for work. It seems therefore that professional motives tend to drive mobility while personal motives drive non-mobility. (2.b) Influencing factors of mobility Next, we examined the factors that influence the researchers' decision to become mobile; for those who have considered mobility these external factors may play an important role in the decision to actually move. The external factors that were considered are of practical (e.g. social care provisions, immigration regulations or work permission for family members) and of research-related nature (obtaining funding for own research and potential loss with professional network at the location where one previously worked). It was clear that these factors seem to play a minor role in the decision to become mobile. The key factor appeared to be obtaining funding for own research, with 41 percent of those moving from the EU to the US finding it important and 31 percent of those moving in the other direction (US to EU) considering it as an important factor. Furthermore, 52 percent of the non-mobile mentioned that it was an important factor in their non-mobility decision. Also language was important for nearly one third of the researchers moving from the EU to the US while cost and quality of accommodation was important for around one fourth of the US researchers moving to the EU. Even though in general, the practical factors are not nearly as important as the research-related ones, they are more important for US-EU mobile researchers than for the EU-US mobile researchers (except for \"language\"). This implies that researchers driven abroad by strong professional motivations (such as the EU-US mobile) tend to have a higher \"tolerance level\" against practical difficulties. Where obtaining funding is the key influencing factor for the mobile researchers, it is even more important for the immobile researchers: more than half of the immobile researchers have mentioned it as an important to extremely important influencing factor. Not being able to obtain funding for research appears therefore to be an important dissuading/hampering factor of mobility. (2.c) Perceived effects of mobility The survey also includes questions on the perceived effects of mobility (these are not necessarily the same as actual effects). The respondents were asked to evaluate whether the effects of being mobile have been negative, neutral or positive. The effects can be grouped under (1) direct or outcome effects such as a decrease/increase in publication or patent output, or decreased/increased access to infrastructure; and (2) indirect or network effects such as decreased/increased access to an international network of professionals or decreased/increased general recognition in the research community. The findings reveal that the perceived effects of mobility have been positive on all aspects for all mobility groups, with a slight deviation for the US-EU mobility group. The strongest effects have been reported on the network or indirect effects (professional experience as a researcher, access to an international network of professionals and general recognition in the research community were top three effects). A comparison of the reported effects among the three mobility groups indicates that mobility affects the career of EU researchers mobile to the US most positively while the perceived effects appear somewhat lower for the US researchers mobile to the EU (and the effects of the \"other mobility\" group fall in-between). In general, it appears that researchers whose mobility decision is mainly driven by professional reasons (such as for the EU-US mobile group) tend to report higher career effects while researchers whose mobility decision is inspired to a stronger degree by personal reasons tend to report higher personal effects. This suggests that researchers seem to be able to realise the expectations they have of mobility. ("}, {"section_title": "2.d) Motivations of return mobility", "text": "Regarding the aspect of \"return mobility\", for EU-US mobile researchers, this seems strongly driven by birth region attraction while this does not seem so much the case for US-EU mobile researchers. While in general, personal motivations are driving EU-US researchers back to the EU, it is mainly professional and financial reasons that drive US-EU researchers back to the US. Not unexpectedly, the return motivations appear to be the opposite as the motivations to become mobile. When analysing the responses of people who have stayed in either the EU or the US, we find that while the reasons to return to the region of graduation are the opposite of the motivations to become mobile, the reasons to stay are the same as the motivations to become mobile. It is mainly professional and financial reasons that motivate EU graduates to stay in the US and mainly personal reasons that motivate US graduates to stay in the EU. Especially career progression reasons seem to be important to motivate researchers to stay in the US. Financial motives do not seem to play a role in shorter-term stays (shorter than two years) but become important for longer term stays (stays of more than two years). (3) Comparison between EU and non-EU countries as a research environment Further, the survey looked into the researchers' opinion about how the EU as a research environment compares to other parts of the world. In all cases and among all mobility groups, the EU scores on average lower than the US and some other countries as an environment to work as researcher. This is especially true when it comes to the effect of the location where one works as a 'reference' for one's career, and also in terms of collaboration with top-class researchers. These results do not only stem from those researchers whose opinion is based on actual experience but also from those who may not have been working in the EU and instead are basing their opinions on perceptions. (4) Research environment as attractiveness factor of mobility The respondents were asked to indicate the country that was most attractive in their view for potential future mobility. Looking at all respondents' opinions, irre-spective of their mobility group and whether they had been in the country or not, the US seems to be the country that is most attractive for researchers. Since the answers include those of respondents who have actually been in the EU/US as well as of those who have not, it is a collection of opinions based on past experiences but also on perceptions. The researchers who actually worked in the US have an even stronger preference for this country. When aggregating the preferred countries by geographic regions (US, EU15, EU12, other), we see that the EU15 appears to be the most attractive region; however we have to keep in mind that birth-country attraction plays a role in this result as 55% of the sample is born in the EU15. Additional to knowing which locations are most attractive as locations to work as researcher, the analysis can be enriched if complemented with information on which elements researchers consider to indicate a location as attractive. The respondents were therefore asked to provide the three most important keywords describing their most attractive country for future mobility. For all groups \"funding\" and \"research\" are the most often mentioned keywords. Obviously, \"research\" can capture many things such as research agenda, freedom in research, doing research rather than teaching, etc. Therefore this keyword is rather difficult to interpret. Funding seems an important characteristic of a research environment. Keeping in mind that this factor also appeared as the most important influencing factor of the decision to become mobile (or not mobile), good funding opportunities appear key in attracting or keeping researchers."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "1.1 Objectives"}, {"section_title": "Target groups", "text": "As described in the proposal for this project, the objective of work package 5 (WP) has been to develop a pilot study on the extra-European mobility of researchers to the US with the initial goal of shedding light on the mobility patterns and career paths of EU-researchers who have worked in the US.

The aim of this report is to focus on (1) the general characteristics, (2) the motives and (3) the influencing factors of EU researchers who have been mobile in the US and to compare these factors with the respective characteristics, motivations and influencing factors of the 'mirror' group (the US researchers who have been mobile in the EU).

The primary objective of this analysis is to present data on the magnitude of EU-migrants in the United States as of 2003, disaggregated by field of study, highest degree, country of birth, and country of highest degree. Subsequently, for this group of immigrants we investigate their motivation for coming to the U.S. and the role they play in the U.S. scientific community. 2.1 Data issues: Potential data sources on mobile researchers to the US There are several good candidates for data on foreign talent in science and engineering in the United States. These are the decennial U.S. population census (www.census.gov), the Current Population Survey (www.census.gov/cps), the new American Community Survey (www.2010census.biz/acs/), the Survey of Doctorate Recipients, the National Survey of Recent College Graduates, and the National Survey of College Graduates. The latter three are all contained in SES-TAT, the Scientists and Engineers Data System, sponsored by the National Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov/statistics/SESTAT/). Here we discuss why we have chosen to work exclusively with the NSCG. Data from the decennial U.S. population survey cannot be used to meet this project's objectives because, among other things, it lacks information on the field in which a degree was earned and where/when it was earned. Thus, neither can we distinguish between life scientists and physical scientists, for example, as defined by field of education, nor do we know whether they have been educated here or abroad, or in both locations. 2 Furthermore, we cannot study career outcomes in terms of the important questions of whether those trained in S&E remain employed in S&E, move to non-S&E employment or are not working. Unfortunately, data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey suffer from these same failings. Although the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) and the National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG) include data on both the educational field and the employment field of scientists and engineers in the United States 3 only the NSCG includes talent from abroad who have not subsequently received at least a baccalaureate degree in the United States. Moreover, the NSCG is the only part of SESTAT that includes individuals whose only degree is a medical degree. Yet these individuals are an important group in the scientific community. The NSCG draws a sample of all college graduates from the long form respondents to the previous decennial U.S. population census, with oversampling of those who reported they worked in S&E occupations. The 2003 NSCG was drawn from those residing in the United States on October 1, 2003 or residing abroad as U.S. military personnel. The 2003 NSCG also includes a sample of respondents from the 2001 NSRCG to cover new S&E degree recipients between April 15, 2000 andJune 30, 2000. By using the analysis weights that have been added to each record in the survey data, 4 we can obtain \"unbiased\" estimates that are \"representative\" of the entire science and engineering community in the U.S. 5 Unfortunately, the NSCG has one major drawback. Since the base sample of the NSCG is only refreshed once every ten-years, there are gaps in our knowledge of how the workforce is changing over the decade between the decennial censuses. This means that we are likely to undercount the number of scientists and engineers who are in the United States on temporary visas. For example, the 2003 NSCG does not include immigrants with only degrees earned abroad if they came to the U.S after April 1, 2000 The primary objective of working with the NSCG is to gauge the magnitude of EUmigrants in the United States as of 2003, disaggregated by field of study, highest degree, country of birth, and country of highest degree. Once we identify this group of immigrants, we will investigate their motivation for coming to the U.S. and the role they play in the U.S. scientific community. To do so, we carry out the following steps: 1. Describe the composition of the S&E workforce in the U.S. by field of study, highest degree, country of birth, and country of highest degree. Here all those with degrees in S&E are included regardless of their employment sector. Thus, migrants who came to the U.S. at any age and during any time period are included at this stage of the analysis. 2. Determine the distribution of scientists and engineers with S&E degrees who are employed solely in S&E occupations, by field of study, highest degree, country of birth, and country of highest degree. Here we omit those with S&E degrees who are employed in non-S&E occupations, but retain migrants who came to the U.S. at any age and during any time period. 3. Determine the distribution of immigrant scientists and engineers who came to the U.S. as adults and are employed in S&E occupations. Here we omit both those employed in non-S&E occupations and those who came to the U.S. as children (less than age 18). For this group, we explore their visa status upon entry to the U.S., and their primary and secondary reasons for coming to the U.S. 4. Determine the distribution of immigrant scientists and engineers who are employed in S&E occupations and who came to the U.S. as adults since the 1980s, i.e., over the period [1990][1991][1992][1993][1994][1995][1996][1997][1998][1999][2000]. For this most recent cohort, we also explore their primary and secondary reasons for coming to the U.S. as well as their employment sector and primary work activity. Before proceeding, a few definitions are needed. The National Science Foundation (NSF) defines S&E fields 6 as: -Computer and mathematical sciences, -Biological, agricultural, and environmental life sciences, -Physical and related sciences, -Engineering, -S&E-related fields, and -Social and related sciences. Occupations are defined similarly using the same broad categories as above. 7 In terms of education, the (highest) degree earned is either a Bachelor's degree (e.g., BS, BA, AB), Master's degree (e.g., MS, MA, MBA), Doctorate (e.g., PhD, DSc, EdD., etc) or Other Professional degree ( e.g., JD, LLB, MD, DDS, etc. First, we examine the composition of the U.S. scientific workforce from the perspective of field of study. From a public policy point of view, nations are concerned with having an educational system that prepares its students for productive roles in the knowledge-based economies of the 21 st century. This requires strong programs in S&E. In describing the scientific workforce in the U.S., we highlight the EU27 countries as well as China and India, two of the major sources of foreign talent in the U.S. 9 Overall, for all S&E fields of study at all degree levels, the U.S. scientific workforce in 2003 numbered about 16.2 million, with 2.8 million (or 17.2%) born abroad, with 13.5% having been born in EU27 countries. As shown in Annex 1 Tables A1-2-1 until A1-2-5, the three biggest sources of talent overall were China, India, and the United Kingdom; within the EU27, Germany and France were the second and third largest suppliers after the United Kingdom. The larg-est S&E discipline were so-called science-related fields, accounting for 31.6% of all degrees awarded. In this broad discipline, just 16.0% were foreign born and only 4.2% were born in EU27 countries. As Table 2-1 shows, in terms of highest degree earned for all S&E fields of study combined, the most prevalent degree was at the baccalaureate level, accounting for almost two-thirds of all S&E degrees. While almost a third of all doctorate holders in S&E fields in the U.S. were born abroad, the share coming from EU27 countries was 6.4%. This represents the EU27's largest share of scientific manpower at any degree level in the U.S. Source: Annex 1, Tables A1-2-1 to A1-2-5 The distribution shown in Table 2-1 changes considerably when country of highest degree and not country of birth is examined, since many foreign students come to the U.S. for their higher education and often remain after completing their studies (Finn, 2007). This is shown in Table 2-2.  Tables A1-3-1 until A1-3-5 Not surprisingly, given the flow of foreign students into American colleges and universities especially at the doctoral level, we see that, by comparing Table 2-1  and Table 2-2, the percentage of degree-holders who are foreign educated falls at all levels of education, but most dramatically at the doctoral level -from 31.6% to 11.8%. While the percentage receiving degrees in EU27 countries falls as well relative to the percentage born in EU27 countries, the declines are less substantial. Moreover, both tables indicate that migration to the U.S. is highest for those scientists and engineers who possess doctorate or professional degrees (which include medical doctors) earned abroad, a finding consistent with the literature on international mobility. Among the EU27 countries, the United Kingdom is the largest producer of S&E degree-holders who are in the U.S. in 2003 (see Annex 1, Tables A1-2-1 until A1-2-5). Moreover, as a group, EU27-educated scientists and engineers outnumber the next largest supplier of scientific manpower in the U.S. at that time. These finding highlights the problem that the MORE study is investigating. Thus far we have gained an overview of the educational background of immigrant scientists and engineers in the U.S. in terms of their highest degree level, country of birth and country of highest degree. But scientists trained in one area of science may work in a different area of science, may work in non-S&E occupations or may not work at all, being unemployed or out of the labor force. 10 Since the task of the MORE study is to understand the mobility of those \"doing\" science, we focus in the next section on those scientists and engineers, as defined by field of study, who are employed in S&E occupations in the U.S. in 2003."}, {"section_title": "2.2.2", "text": "The scientific workforce in the U.S. in 2003: Individuals educated in S&E fields and employed in S&E-occupations Overall, for all degree levels, Table 2-3 shows that only 7.7 million (47.5%) of the more than 16 million individuals holding degrees in S&E fields were employed in S&E occupations in 2003. Furthermore, the highest retention rate in S&E occupations was at the professional level, consisting primarily of medical doctors, and the lowest retention rate was at the bachelor's level. Not surprising, those with the least invested in their education -those with bachelor's degrees in S&E fields, are the most likely to leave science. The percentage of the scientific workforce -those educated and employed in S&E, that is foreign born is higher at all degree levels than the percentage of foreign born degree-holders found in Table 2-1. For all degree levels except the master's and professional level, the percentage born in EU27 countries employed in S&E exceeds the percentage from these countries holding degrees in S&E. In other words, the foreign born and, in particular, those born in the EU27, were less likely to leave S&E occupations than their American-born counterparts. Similarly, comparing Table 2-3 with Table 2-2, we see that with the exception of the master's and professional degree levels, the percentage foreign educated and the percentage EU27 educated represent a larger share of their groups holding S&E degrees. Table 2-3 also shows that at every degree level, the share held by those educated in the EU27 among the foreign educated is higher than the share held by those born in the EU27 among the foreign born suggesting that scientists and engineers educated in the EU27 are relatively less likely than their counterparts from other foreign countries to leave science. Finally, Table 2-3 indicates that immigrant scientists and engineers employed in S&E occupations in the U.S. are most likely to hold the doctorate degree. This is true for all foreign immigrants as well as those from the EU27. Of those foreign born scientists and engineers employed in S&E occupation in the U.S., the three biggest sources of talent were China, the EU27, and India; within the EU27, the three biggest sources were the United Kingdom, Romania and Germany (See Annex 1, Tables A1-3-1 until A1-3-5). Furthermore, of those foreign educated scientists and engineers employed in S&E occupations in the U.S., the three biggest educators were China, the EU27 and the United Kingdom; within the EU27, the three biggest educators were the United Kingdom, Romania and Germany. These results once again highlight the brain drain issue facing countries within the EU27, especially the United Kingdom. 10 The numbers falling into the latter two categories tend to be relatively small for those educated in S&E fields with most of the movement out of scientific occupations accounted for by the movement into non-S&E occupations such as business. Source: Annex 1, Table A1-4-1 until Table A1-4-5 and Table A1-5-1 until Table A1-5-5. Before investigating the reasons why scientific talent from the EU27 migrates to the U.S. we must make another adjustment to the estimates of scientific manpower in the U.S. Thus far our data contain individuals educated in S&E who migrated to the United States at all ages, including childhood. But children are not likely to make their own decisions concerning emigration. Consequently, to really understand the factors that have played an important role in the mobility of EU scientists, we need to restrict the population of migrants to those who have chosen to come to the United States as adults (age 18 or older). Thus, in the next section, we take a close look at the distribution of adult migrants to the United States."}, {"section_title": "Scientists and engineers who came to the U.S. as adults and are employed in S&E occupations in 2003", "text": "In total, adult 11 immigrants in the scientific workforce as defined above number about 1.2 million and account for approximately 80% of the entire population of immigrant scientists and engineers who were employed in S&E occupations in 2003. This percentage varies by field of employment as shown in Table 2-4. Indeed, scientists and engineers who first entered the United States as adults were more likely to be employed as biological or physical scientists than employed as social scientists or in S&E-related occupations such as health practitioners, S&E managers, architects or actuaries. 11 Adult immigrants are determined by comparing the year of arrival for a stay of 6 months of longer with their age in the year 2003. Unfortunately, we do not know if they subsequently returned home and re-entered the United States at a later date.  Tables A1-3-1 until A1-3-5 A3 and Tables A1-6-1 until A1-6-5. Subgroups may not add to total due to rounding. Moreover, as Table 2-5 shows those with a bachelor's degree as the highest degree earned account for 40% of all scientists and engineers who came to the U.S. as adults and are employed in S&E occupations; those with a master's degree, 30%; those with a doctorate, 17%; and those with a professional degree, 13%. At every degree levels, Indian natives account for the largest percentage of adult immigrants employed in the life sciences in the U.S. Chinese natives account for the largest percentage of adult immigrants employed in computer and mathematical occupations at all degree levels except the doctorate and professional level. Overall, the largest share of EU27 scientists and engineers who came to the U.S. as adults and are employed in S&E occupations was at the doctorate level, where those born in the EU27 account for 18.6% of all those with the doctorate as the highest degree. 12 Scientists and engineers from EU27 countries possessing a bachelor's as their highest degree enjoy their largest share of all degree holders employed at that level in engineering (11.9%); those with a master's as the highest degree, in the social and related sciences (31.7%); those with a doctorate as the highest degree, in the physical sciences (24.5%); and those with a professional degree as their highest, in the social and related sciences (45.9%). Furthermore, the EU27's share of immigrant scientists and engineers who came to the U.S. as adults and are employed in S&E occupations exceeds the share coming from the more populous countries of India and China in five instances: at the master's level, in the social and related sciences; at the doctorate level, in the physical sciences, in the social and related sciences, and in the S&E-related occupations; and at the professional level, in the social and related sciences. A similar analysis to that presented in Table 2-5 can be done in terms of country of highest degree rather than country of birth. Table 2-6 presents a summary of  these findings. Overall, compared with Table 2-4, it is once again evident that neither India nor China educates many of their native-born scientists and engineers who were employed in S&E occupations in the U.S. in 2003. On the other hand, the EU27 still educates a large percentage of their native-born scientists and engineers who have migrated to the U.S. as adults and are employed in S&E occupations in 2003. 13 Indeed, Table 2-6 shows that, at the doctoral level, the EU27 educate a greater percentage of immigrant scientists and engineers employed in the biological/life sciences than were born in the EU27. This is also true for EU27 migrants possessing the professional degree as the highest degree earned who are now employed in computer and mathematical occupations or in S&E-related occupations.

Next, Table 2-7 examines the visa status of these immigrants. 14 The MORE project is especially interested in the numbers (and percent) entering the U.S. on study/training visas or temporary work visas from EU27 countries, although data on all visa types and EU27 region of highest degree are presented in Annex 1, Tables A1-8-1 until A1-8-5. 15 Overall, study/training visas and temporary work visas account for almost 60% of all visas initially issued to these emigrants who were 18 or older when they first entered the U.S. for a period of six months or longer. Nearly three-quarters of those holding doctorates as their highest degree entered on study/training visas, while temporary work visas were most prevalent at the bachelor's degree level. EU27-visa holders account for 11.5% of all visas at all degree levels, holding nearly 50,000 study/training visas and 33,000 temporary work visas upon initial entry into the U.S. EU27 migrants, however, account for 18.6% of all visas issued to immigrants whose highest degree is at the doctoral level. But EU27 migrants are more prevalent among the temporary work visa holders at this degree level than those with study/training visas, accounting for nearly a third of the former but less than one-sixth of the latter group. Table 2-8 provides details on the occupational distribution of EU27 migrants by highest degree earned and visa type. Here the highest-degree levels have been collapsed into just two levels: bachelor's degree and master's and above, because the (raw) cell sizes become small in some visa/occupational categories limiting the reliability of the population estimates. As Table 2-8 shows, for all degree levels combined, study/training visas dominated the visas initially held by immigrants who are now employed in the biological/life sciences, physical sciences and the social sciences; temporary work visas, although substantially less numerous, were most often held by adult immigrants who are now employed as computer/mathematical scientists. Overall, for all S&E occupations combined, those born in EU27 countries held just 10.2% of the study/training visas and 13.1% of the temporary work visas. Both study/training visas and temporary work visas were much more numerous among immigrants having a more advanced degree than among those holding only a bachelor's degree. Furthermore, study/training visas accounted for more than one-half of all visas issued at the advanced degree levels, although tempo-rary work visas were more common than study/training visas for those holding no higher than a bachelor's degree. But here, other visas types obviously played a more important role since study/training visas and temporary work visas only account for 46% of the total number of visas that were initially held. At the bachelor's level, Table 2-8 shows that study/training visas were more often held initially by those now employed in the biological/life sciences and the social sciences. On the other hand, temporary work visas were much more common for those now employed as computer scientists than for those employed in any other S&E occupation. Moreover, at the bachelor's degree level, the data show that EU27 natives often did not account for much more than 10% of the migrants who held initially either of these visa types, although they did account for 20.2% of the temporary work visas initially held by employed as engineers in 2003. At the advanced degree levels, we find that the three occupations that accounted for the largest share of immigrants who initially entered on study/training visasbiological/life sciences, social sciences, and the physical sciences -were also the three biggest occupations in terms of migrants coming from EU27 countries. With respect to the smaller number of immigrants entering with temporary work visas, EU27 migrants account for more than 60% of those now employed in social science occupations and nearly 40% of those employed as biologists/life scientists.

Table 2-9 examines the most important reasons 16 given by these adult immigrants for their initial entry into the United States for a period of six months or  longer. In this table, we focus on all degree levels combined; Annex 1, Tables  A1-10-1 until A1-10-3 also has the details broken down by the highest degree earned: bachelor's degree or master's and above. For all S&E occupations combined, all migrants as well as those from EU27 countries came primarily for educational and job or economic opportunities. Overall, migrants from the EU27 are more likely to have come to the U.S. because of job or economic opportunities, scientific of professional infrastructure or \"other\" reasons than their counterparts from other countries. In addition, regardless of their occupation in 2003, EU27 migrants were less likely than immigrants from other countries to have come to the U.S. because of educational opportunities. This likely reflects the overall quality of tertiary education in the EU27 region. Jobs or economic opportunities were one of the two factors most important in the decision of EU27 natives to come to the U.S. This is especially evident for those who are now employed as computer/mathematical scientists or engineers, with over 40% indicating this as their most important reason. This suggests weakness in these job markets in the EU27 region. Finally, the scientific or profession infrastructure was particularly important to the decision to migrate for those who are now employed in the biological/life sciences and the physical sciences. Moreover, in these two occupations, migrants from the EU27 region list this reason much more frequently (43% and 39% of the time) than those who came to the U.S. from all countries combined (36% and 20% of the time). In a similar fashion, Table 2-10 examines the second most important reasons 17 given by these adult immigrants for their initial entry into the United States for a period of six months or longer. Once again, we focus on all degree levels combined; Annex 1, Tables A1-11-1 until A1-11-3 contains the details broken down  by the highest degree earned: bachelor's degree or master's and above. After excluding the respondents who gave no second reason for their decision to migrate to the U.S., Table 2-10 shows that overall, for all S&E occupations combined, jobs or economic opportunities and scientific or professional infrastructure now rank ahead of educational opportunities as the \"second\" most important reason given by these migrants. This is especially true when one considers all migrants as a group because as Table 2-9 showed, the scientific or professional infrastructure was also the most important primary reason given by EU27 migrants employed in the biological/life sciences or in the physical sciences in 2003. In fact, we find that for all EU27 migrants, except those now employed in S&Erelated occupations, the scientific or professional infrastructure is more often chosen than either educational or job or economic opportunities as the second most important reason for initially coming to the U.S. Table 2-10: Second most important reasons given for migrating to the U.S. by adult migrants trained and employed in S&E, by nativity and occupation in 2003 Source: Annex 1, A1-11-1 until A1-11-3. In this section, we have focused on scientists and engineers who migrated to the U.S. as adults and were employed in S&E occupations in 2003. But thus far, we have not paid attention to when these migrants initially entered the U.S. Yet we know that social and economic conditions have changed world-wide and in the United States over the last few decades. Since a goal of the MORE study is to ob- 17 Immigrants were asked to indicate the two factors that were the second most important in their decision to come. tain a clear picture of EU-U.S. mobility in the recent past, in the next section we refine the analysis once again and by focus only on the most recent cohort of immigrant scientists and engineers, those who came to the U.S. since 1989. 2.2.4 Scientists and engineers who came to the U.S. as adults during the 1990s and are employed in S&E occupations in 2003 Table 2-11 shows that more than 50% of scientists and engineers who came to the U.S. as adults and were employed in S&E occupations in 2003 came to the U.S. since 1989. Source: Calculated from Annex 1, Table A1-11-1 until A1-11-3. Subgroups may not add up to total due to rounding. The data (as shown in Annex 1, Tables A1-12-1 until A1-12-3) indicate that there have been marked changes in the initial visa type and the primary reason given for the decision to come to the U.S., but been few changes over time in the second most important reasons given for migration decision. The most recent cohort is typically less likely to have entered the U.S. with a permanent resident visa (Green card) or a study/training visa and increasingly more likely than previous cohorts to have entered on a temporary work visa. In terms of the most important reasons for entering the U.S., over time, immigrant scientists and engineers have been less likely to have come for educational opportunities and more likely to have come because of job or economic opportunities. EU27 migrants accounted for 72,280 (11.5%) of the 632,240 scientists and engineers in the most recent cohort; moreover, for all S&E occupations combined, EU27 migrants more often held study/training or temporary work visas than any other visa type upon entry to the U.S. (see Annex 1 , Tables A1-12-1 until A1-12-3). At all degree levels, the three largest S&E occupations that these recent migrants were employed in as of 2003, both all migrants together and EU27 migrants separately, were in diminishing order, science-related occupations, computer/mathematics occupations and engineering. Table 2-12 examines the most important reasons given by those adult migrants who first entered the U.S. after 1989, by nativity and occupation in 2003. Educational opportunities, although still relatively important, are no longer as important a reason for the decision to migrate to the U.S. for this more recent cohort than for all cohorts together, as we saw in Table 2-9. For EU27 migrants, educational opportunities were also less often given as the most important reason for their decision to migrate except for those employed in the physical sciences, social sciences and in science-related occupations. For all groups of recent migrants (except EU27 migrants employed in the physical or social sciences), job or economic opportunities have increased in importance relative to its importance for all cohorts combined (Table 2-9). Similarly, for all groups of recent migrants (except EU27 migrants employed in engineering), the scientific or professional infrastructure has increased in importance relative to its importance for all cohorts combined. Overall, for the recent cohort of EU27 migrants, the top three \"first\" reasons for coming to the U.S. are job or economic opportunities, educational opportunities, and the scientific or professional infrastructure. The second most important reasons given for coming to the U.S. by the most recent cohort of migrants are summarized in Table 2-13. Again, we focus only on those who responded that they had some second reasons (details are provided in Table A1-14). Overall, the table shows that migrants who listed second reasons were mostly employed in either science-related occupations or in computer/mathematical occupations. For all S&E occupations combined, when comparing the most recent cohort with all cohorts taken together (Table 2-10) Table 2-13 indicates that the scientific infrastructure and jobs or economic opportunities were slightly more important as second reasons for migrating, while educational opportunities were slightly less important. Moreover, the importance of the scientific or professional infrastructure in the decision to migrate increased the most for migrants especially from EU27 countries who were now employed in engineering occupations. In fact, with few exceptions, 18 EU27 migrants chose the scientific or professional infrastructure more often than either educational or job or economic opportunities as the second most important reason for their move to the U.S.   For all degree levels and all S&E occupations combined, Table 14 shows that the most common sector of employment for all of these recent migrants was business/industry. This is not surprising given the overall size of this sector in the U.S. economy. EU27 migrants tend to be employed less often than migrants from other countries in business/industry, but more often in the higher education, government and other education sectors. Finally Table 2-15 provides some idea of what this most recent cohort of migrant scientists and engineers have been contributing directly to the U.S. economy by summarizing their responses to the NSCG survey question: \"On which TWO activities..., did you work the most hours during a typical week on this job\"? Here we focus on those activities that most directly contribute to science and innovation outputs, namely basic research, applied research, development, design (of equipment, processes, structures), and computer applications (including programming and systems analysis). All other activities have been combined into the \"other\" category in the   Table 2-15 shows that EU27 migrants who entered the U.S. since 1989 are overrepresented relative to recent migrants from other countries in terms of time spent on performing basic research, applied research and the remaining activities in the category \"other.\" On the other hand, EU27 migrants spend less time than other migrants doing development, design or computer applications."}, {"section_title": "Main findings", "text": "To understand the magnitudes and reasons for the flow of scientific talent from the EU to the United States, we have utilized data from the 2003 NSCG, the best available database for investigating the issues raised by the MORE study. Systematically, we refined the analysis step by step so that in the final stage we had a representative sample of recent adult migrants in the U.S -those who had been trained in S&E fields, who had emigrated (initial visas was for a period of six months or longer) to the U.S. as adults (aged 18 and older), who had emigrated since 1989, and who were now employed in S&E occupations. -This recent cohort of adult migrants represented over 50% of all adult migrants educated in science and engineering who were now employed in S&E occupations in 2003. -For the recent cohort of EU27 migrants, we found that the top three \"first\" reasons for coming to the U.S. were job or economic opportunities, educational opportunities, and the scientific or professional infrastructure. -These same reasons were also the top three given by recent EU27 migrants as their \"second\" most important reasons for their move to the U.S. -We also discovered that EU27 migrants tend to be employed less often than migrants from other countries in the business/industry sector, but more often than migrants from other countries in the higher education, government and other education sectors. -EU27 migrants were overrepresented relative to recent migrants from other countries in terms of devoting time towards performing basic research, applied research and \"other\" work activities. On the other hand, EU27 migrants spend less time than other migrants doing development, design or computer applications. Part 2 THE EXTRA-EU PILOT MOBILITY SURVEY 3 SURVEY METHODOLOGY AND DESIGN\nIn the net-sample, the EU 27 is strongly represented (as region of residence) with 3116 respondents or 56%, followed by the US with 1676 respondents or 30%. From the EU27 Member States, Italy has the largest share, with 575 respondents or 10.4%, followed by the UK with 325 respondents or 5.9% and Germany with 318 respondents or 5.7%. 56% of the respondents are residing in the EU, 30% in the US and less than 14% in other countries. By region of birth, the US has the highest percentage of respondents staying in their birth region with 82%. In the EU this percentage is slightly lower, but still three quarters of the respondents born in the EU, still live in the EU. Within the three mobility groups, the respondents from mobility group 2 and 3 mainly reside in the EU, with 77% and 60% respectively. Conversely, for mobility group 1 only half of the respondents live in the EU, while the other half live in the US. Half of the non-mobile respondents reside in the EU, 36% of them reside in the US and the remaining 13% reside in other countries. In general, for the EU and the US the results are as expected. For each mobility group, the majority of respondents born in the EU are also EU nationals. The same holds true for the respondents born in the US of which the majority are US nationals. There are no remarkable differences between the groups of mobile researchers versus the group of non-mobile researchers. The share of male researchers residing in the EU and US is 65% and 66% respectively, which is somewhat higher than in the group of other countries (62%). The share of male students is lowest in the group of non-mobile researchers, with only 61%. More than half of the respondents (53%) are between 36 and 55 years old. Researchers residing in the EU are, on average, slightly younger compared to researchers residing in the US and the group of other countries. Researchers in mobility groups 2 (US to EU) and 3 (other mobility) are, on average, slightly older compared to researchers in mobility groups 1 (EU to US) and 4 (no mobility). More than half of the respondents (52%) achieved their highest educational degree between 2000 and 2010. A quarter of the respondents achieved their highest degree in the 1990s. 54% of the respondents residing in the EU and 56% of the respondents residing in the US have children, compared to 62% in the group of other countries. Nearly 60% of the respondents in mobility groups 2 and 3 have children, compared to 53% and 52.5% in mobility group 1 and 4. We would, however, expect that persons with children are less mobile than persons without. Nearly 86% of the respondents have a PhD or equivalent degree. For the respondents residing in the US, this number is 92%. The group of non-mobile researchers has a significantly lower share of respondents with a PhD. Overall, only 1.4% have not obtained a graduate degree. Most of the respondents achieved their highest educational attainment in natural (41%) and social sciences (30%). Researchers that graduated in the US are relatively less represented in natural, medical and health and agricultural sciences and engineering and technology, but there are nearly twice as many researchers in social sciences and 50 to 60% more researchers in humanities compared to the other regions (EU and group of other countries). The fields of science and humanities contain the highest percentage of respondents who have been mobile as a student (44%), in contrast to the groups of medical and health sciences and engineering and technology researchers, both with a share of only 26%. The high percentage of respondents in humanities who have been mobile as a student is caused by the high percentages in the subfields of languages and literature (49%) and history and archaeology (48%). The subfields with the highest share of researchers having been mobile as a student are the fields of industrial biotechnology (67%) and medical engineering (61%), both within the field of engineering and technology. The field of science with the highest share of researchers that have had work experience in industry as student is the field of engineering and technology (41%), while humanities has the lowest share with a percentage of only half as high. Subfields with a high share of researchers having had work experience in industry as student are environmental engineering and materials engineering (both 50%), while environmental biotechnology (14%), philosophy, ethics and religion (8%) are situated at the lower end. None of the respondents in the subfield of industrial biotechnology has had work experience in industry as student. Medical and health sciences have the highest percentage of researchers that have not been mobile as a student, nor have had work experience in industry as student. Mobility group 2 (US to EU) has the highest percentage of researchers that have not been mobile as a student (57%), nor have had work experience in industry as student, closely followed by the group of non-mobile researchers (55%). In the group of non-mobile researchers, half of the remaining respondents have only had work experience in industry as student.\nOut of the 5544 total respondents in the net-sample, 15% are PhD-students, 42% are post-doctoral researchers and the remaining 43% are another type of researcher. By region of residence, the results only differ marginally across the three regions. A notable result by mobility group is the high share of PhD-students in the group of non-mobile researchers (23%) compared to the groups of mobile researchers (with a share of 6% to 12%). Within the group of mobile researchers, we see that mobility group 1 (EU to US) has the highest share of post-doctoral researchers. The highest shares of researchers who have obtained their highest degree in the field of natural science work for a research institution, a higher education institution or a company. Three quarters of the respondents working for a company have an open ended contract, although in higher education institutions and research institutions, this share is substantially lower, with only 48% for higher education institutions, 45% for public and 36% for private research institutions. In the sample, researchers working in higher education institutions, public research institutions and the self employed are working, on average, longer under their current contract status (10 years, 9.3 years and 9.4 years respectively) compared to researchers working in private research institutes and companies (both 6.2 years). We do not see remarkable differences between the regions of residence with respect to the field of science in which the researchers obtained their highest educational degree. The group of US residents has a slightly lower share of researchers that obtained their highest degree in the field of engineering and technology (6.7%) compared to the other regions (10% in the EU and 10.5% in the group of other countries). There are, however, relatively more researchers residing in the US with a highest degree in the field of humanities. Half of the researchers in mobility group 1 (EU to US) obtained their highest degree in the field of natural sciences, a share that is higher than in the other mobility groups. The results of the non-mobile researchers do not deviate noticeably from the results of the mobile researchers. There is a slightly lower share of respondents with an open ended contract in the group of non-mobile researchers, compared to the group of mobile researchers. Looking at the years of employment under the current contract status, we notice that the researchers in mobility group 3 (other mobility) work the longest under their current contract status, with 10 years on average, and the researchers in mobility group 2 (US to EU) the shortest, with 8.4 years on average. The group of non-mobile researchers has a slightly higher percentage of respondents that have been working under their contract status 5 to 9 years, compared to the group of mobile researchers. 45% of the respondents report that their current work as a researcher involves formal collaboration, but only with academic researchers from other countries. 38% of the researchers are not involved in formal collaboration with researchers from other countries. Looking at the results by region of residence, we observe that the share of researchers not involved in formal collaboration with other countries is the highest in the US, with 52%. Looking at the results per field of science, we see that the current work of the respondents that obtained their highest degree in humanities and social sciences involves formal collaboration with other countries the least (50% and 58% respectively), in contrast to the highest share (73%) in agricultural sciences. The group of non-mobile researchers has the highest share of respondents that have a job that does not involve formal collaboration with researchers from other countries. This is quite expected. Mobility groups 3 (other mobility) and 1 (EU to US) have the highest share of respondents involved in collaboration both with academic and industrial researchers (17.5% in M3 and 16.7% in M1 compared to 14.3% in M4 -no mobility, and 13.7% in M2 -US to EU). We see that the collaborative activity of respondents working for a company is quite distinct from the collaborative activity of those working for other types of employers. Indeed, researchers working for a company are the least involved in formal collaboration with researchers from other countries. About half of the researchers working for a higher education institution or a research institution indicate that when they formally collaborate with researchers from other countries it is only with academic researchers. 85% of the respondents in the net-sample are very (46%) to somewhat (39%) confident about the future prospects for their research career. Only 4.5% report that they very much lack confidence about their future prospects. Looking at the results by region of residence, we see that EU-residents are remarkably less confident compared to the respondents living outside the EU. The results by field of science show that researchers that obtained their highest degree in social sciences and humanities are the most confident. Looking at the results by type of employer, we see that the respondents working for a higher education institution are by far the most confident, with half of them reporting to be very confident about their future prospects. Researchers working for a company, and especially the self employed, are the least confident. In fact, 16% of the self employed declare that they very much lack confidence regarding their future research prospects. These results are not surprising as having a selfemployment position is related in general with higher risks and less security. We would expect the highest confidence concerning future career prospects to be expressed by researchers with an open ended contract. This is confirmed by the results, where 90% of those with an open ended contract are confident about their future career prospects. Furthermore, as expected, we find that the shorter the duration of the fixed contract, the lower the confidence expressed by the respondent. In addition, respondents who are self employed are quite uncertain about their future prospects as a researcher.\nIn this section, we briefly summarise the conclusions that can be drawn from the information gathered by our survey with respect to career paths and international mobility. Around 85 percent of the researchers in the survey are working in the public sector and most of them have always been in the public sector (around threefourths). The distribution over career paths is very similar for all regions of residence and for all mobility groups. Researchers are quite mobile with respect to employers, around half of the researchers in all regions have worked for two to three employers since graduation and more than ten percent have worked for four or more employers. Again, the distribution is similar over all regions (with a minor exception being the EU12 which has a slightly lower percentage of researchers having worked for four to five employers). Also the non-mobile group (M4) is slightly less \"employermobile\" and has a higher percentage of respondents who have worked for either zero or only one employer after graduation. Further, geographical non-mobility appears to go together with employer non-mobility. Within the EU, there are large differences with respect to the number of countries in which a researcher has worked abroad. EU15 resident researchers are the most mobile in terms of working in different countries after graduation (33% have worked in zero to one (different) country) and EU12 resident researchers are the least mobile (50% have worked in zero to one country). Even the group of \"nonmobile\" researchers includes 25% of researchers working in two or more different countries either for less than 3 months or before obtaining his/her highest degree. Researchers who are mobile from the US to the EU tend to remain for a longer duration than do the researchers who move from the EU to the US (51% versus 40% respectively). There appears to be a U-shape relationship between the length of stay and the percentage of researchers having worked in zero to one country. If researchers are not very mobile in terms of countries where they have worked since graduation, they tend to go on very short or very long visits. In the next chapter we will go deeper into the motivations of researchers to become mobile and whether these differ according to the direction of the move and other characteristics discussed earlier.\nThe strongest conclusion to be drawn from the survey results presented in this section on motivations for mobility is that researchers going from the EU to the US have stronger professional motivations and researchers going from the US to the EU have stronger personal motivations. The desire to work with \"star scien-tists\" appears to have a positive effect on both types of mobility, while financial motivations do not appear to play a role in the decision to be mobile. Specifically for the EU27 researchers being mobile to the US we find that career progression goals, personal education or research agenda, the prospect to work with leading experts and access to facilities and equipment are very important motivations in the mobility decision. This is in line with the conclusions that were drawn based on the NSCG survey where the top three reasons for moving to the US mentioned by EU27 immigrants were job or economic opportunities, educational opportunities and scientific or professional infrastructure which are all of professional nature. Professional motivations generally play a lesser role in the decision not to become mobile than in the decision to become mobile while career progression goals are the second most important reason not to move. The most important factors in deciding not to become mobile are personal factors. Based on the career path a researcher followed, we found that the 'personal education and research agenda' motivation and career progression goals are the two most important motivations, while gaining access to facilities and equipment and the prospect to work with star scientists appears more important in the public career paths and less so in the private career paths. For all fields of science, the same top three motivations were recorded (personal education and/or research agenda, career progression goals, prospects to work with leading experts). The financial motivation is most important for engineering and technical sciences compared to its importance in the other fields of science. In general, for all mobility groups, the influencing factors have not played a significant role in the decision to actually move. This suggests that the true reasons for being mobile lie in the motivational part. Only the influencing factor \"obtaining funding for own research\" appears to be an important influencing factor and significantly more so for those researchers that are not mobile. Quality and cost of accommodation and language follow in importance. Most of the \"practical\" considerations play a stronger role in US-EU mobility than in the EU-US mobility. Especially \"obtaining work permission for partner/other family members\" and \"availability of adequate schools\" were considered important by around 30 percent of the US-EU mobile researchers and \"quality and cost of accommodation\" and \"pension and social care provisions\" were considered important by 25 to 30 percent of the US-EU mobile researchers. In a multivariate context, where other effects are taken into consideration, it is the practical considerations (pension and social care provisions, immigration regulations and language) that matter for EU-US mobility. Pension and social care provisions appear to work positively to attract US graduates to the EU, and negatively in the other direction. For the US graduates the fear of losing contact with the network of the 'base' country plays an important role in becoming mobile to the EU rather than to another region. None of the influencing factors appear important, but the longer the stay abroad, the more important do the influencing factors become in affecting the decision to become mobile. Obtaining funding for own research appears to be of lower importance in the \"always private\" career path compared to the other paths. Researchers from all fields of science are influenced by \"obtaining funding for own research\" and to a lesser extent \"language\" and \"quality and cost of accommodation\".\nThe effects of mobility are generally (very) positive. The three most important effects of mobility are network effects: mobility appears to have (strongly) positive effects on professional experience, the researcher's international network and his recognition in the researcher community. However, nearly all the effects are significantly higher for researchers moving from the EU to the US than the other way around. Additionally, we find that the percentage of researchers moving from the EU to the US hardly experiences any negative effects of mobility while for those moving the other way around negative (decreasing) effects do seem to exist for between 10 and 20 percent of the researchers. Although the ranking of the three most important effects is the same in nearly all career paths, effects are generally lower in the \"public to private\" career path. Obviously, we cannot draw any causal conclusions here, as it might be that public-sector researchers who do not obtain the desired effects of mobility, move to the private sector but also that researchers with a public background do not obtain the desired effects when they move to the private sector. Overall, career effects appear to be larger than personal and family effects. This holds true for the total sample and for all subgroups but the US to EU mobility group, where career and personal effects are equal. For US to EU mobility specifically, the overall career effect is the lowest and the overall personal and family effect highest compared to other mobility groups. The strongest overall career effect exists for the group of researchers who stayed between two and three years, those who primarily followed a public career path and those in the medical and health sciences followed by those in engineering and the technical sciences and agricultural sciences. Corrected for other factors, this effect in medical and health sciences disappears and it seems that the other two groups record stronger effects. There appears to be a correspondence between motivations and effects for the different mobility groups: (1) for EU to US mobile researchers, both the professional motivations and the professional effects are larger; and (2) for US to EU mobile researchers both the personal motivations and the personal and family effects are larger. This positive correlation between the strength of a certain type of motivation and its corresponding effect is also confirmed statistically. Negative or non-existent correlations exist between personal/cultural motivations and effects while the largest positive correlations are found between \"matching\" professional motivations and effects. The multivariate analysis confirms this again. Corrected for characteristics of researchers and their mobility, we find that higher professional motivations lead to higher overall career effects while higher personal motivations lead to higher personal effects. In general, this suggests that researchers can realize their expectations of mobility. Concluding, both the summary statistics and the multivariate results suggest that it is a better career move to be mobile from the EU to the US than the other way around.\nThe results from the survey are quite negative for the EU as it comes out as less attractive to work in as a researcher compared to other regions. The US and other countries are especially better as a reference for the researcher's career and for collaboration with top-class researchers. These results do not only stem from those researchers whose opinion is based on actual experience in both regions, but also from those who may not even have been in the EU. Since the respondents from the mobility group US to EU appear to agree that the EU is less attractive as a research environment, these researchers may not have moved or definitely will not stay for professional reasons as was suggested before. These general impressions hold for all fields of science, especially for the medical and health sciences. The US generally comes out best compared to the EU for humanities, though the result is somewhat milder. The US is rated above the EU for post-doctoral and other positions but especially for PhD students. Even though PhD students moving from the EU to the US are most positive about the US compared to researchers in other positions, they are also least negative about the EU. As can be expected from these results, returning to the EU is strongly driven by the attraction of the birth region. On the contrary, the birth region attraction does not seem to affect the decision to return to the US. Returning from the EU back to the US is done mainly for professional and financial reasons. Personal motivations are stronger in driving EU graduates back to the EU than they are in driving US graduates back to the US. For engineering and technical sciences they even appear to be the sole reason for moving back to the EU. Financial reasons are the most important reason researchers in humanities and social sciences to move back to the US, while career progression is the most important factor driving researchers in natural sciences back to the US. While the reasons to return to the region of graduation are the opposite of the motivations to become mobile, the reasons to stay are the same as the motivations to become mobile. This means that predominantly professional and financial reasons keep EU graduates in the US and solely personal reasons keep US graduates in the EU. This is the case in all fields of science. Given all of the results, there appears to be no fields of science where the EU would be a professionally better base than the US. In terms of future mobility, the US seems to be the most attractive country, followed by EU15 countries, Australia and Canada. Looking at regions, the EU15 comes out as the most attractive region, but it is important to note that this is influenced by birth country attraction as 55% of the sample is born in the EU15. Based on the \"cloud\" analysis of the keywords related to what constitutes an appealing research environment, it appears that \"funding\" and \"research\" were the most important factors for all groups. While \"colleagues\" came out as important factor for the non-mobile and the US to EU mobility groups, \"infrastructure\" came out strongly in the EU to US group and the other-mobility groups."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "As described in the introductory part of this report, the aim of this study is to design a pilot study for the analysis of the motives and stay-rates of EU researchers going to the US. Moreover, as indicated earlier, the survey population was broadened to include not only EU researchers moving to the US, but also US researchers moving to the EU. In addition, the survey now includes the opinions of researchers who are mobile but not between the EU and the US and non-mobile researchers. This chapter provides an overview of the main definitions used in the survey, the target groups of the survey, the sampling method followed, and the main sections of the survey.\nIn this chapter we first give an overview of the different characteristics of the career path of the respondents in the survey. The issues discussed include: (1) whether the respondents have been working in the public versus the private sector or shifted between the two; (2) the number of employers that respondents have had since graduation; (3) the number of countries they have worked in since graduation and (4) the duration of their most recent stay (for stays longer than three months) in the country that the researcher has been mobile to (or has mainly been working in as a researcher for the non-mobile group). Second, we delve deeper into the characteristics of international mobility by looking at general indicators of mobility, such as whether one is living in the country that one was born in or graduated in, the number of countries one has worked in since graduation, and whether one has been mobile as a student or not. We will compare these mobility indicators by region of residence and by mobility group in order to draw conclusions on mobility characteristics.\nIn this chapter we discuss the motivations that drive researchers to become mobile and well as other influencing --external--factors. While motivations are the reasons one chooses to become mobile, once the decision to become mobile is made other considerations may influence whether a move is feasible. A motivation, for example, could be the desire to work with star scientists at the destination country, an external factor, such as a problem trying to obtain resident or work permits for family members, might prevent mobility. It is important to distinguish between motivations and external factors from a policy perspective. In this chapter we look at whether the motivations to become mobile and the factors influencing this decision are different for the four mobility groups and whether these factors differ based on the characteristics of the researcher such as his or her field of science and highest degree earned, career path and experience abroad. In the survey, all mobility groups were presented with the same motivation and influencing factors, although, as indicated earlier, the question was posed differently to each mobility group. The motivation question was framed as follows: \"To what extent were the following aspects important as factor in: motivating you to become mobile to the US?\" (M1: EU to US); motivating you to become mobile to the EU?\" (M2: US to EU); motivating you to become mobile to [country different from graduation country]?\" (M3: other mobility); dissuading you to become mobile?\" (M4: no mobility). The question where the respondent was asked about the extent to which external factors influenced his/her decision to become mobile was addressed to each mobility group in a similar fashion. All personal motivations and external factors presented in the survey were compulsory questions where the respondent was to score each motivational or influencing factor from 1 (a factor the he or she judged \"not important at all\" in the decision to become mobile) to 5 (an \"Extremely important\" factor). The respondent was also allowed to answer \"Not applicable (NA)\". In the remainder of this chapter we present the average score of the motivational and influencing factors. We have excluded respondents who answered \"notapplicable\" and categories with ten or fewer respondents. We have focused on seven possible motivational factors based on the international mobility literature and interviews with researchers who have been mobile. These factors can be grouped into two main categories, the personal motivations (related to person-specific preferences) and the professional motivations (related to professional objectives and goals). These are listed below: In the following sections, we focus on the significance that these different motivational factors have had on the researchers' mobility decision. We also investigate the role that various influencing external factors have had on the mobility decision.\nIn this chapter we discuss the effects of mobility. All mobile groups have been presented with a compulsory section in the questionnaire where they were asked to indicate how their mobility has affected various outcomes such as publication output, patent output and access to infrastructure. The respondents were asked to rate these effects with a score going from 1 to indicate a strongly negative effect to 5 to indicate a strongly positive effect, with 3 as the neutral option. The final aim is to check whether the motivations for mobility have the desired effect and whether different motivations have lead to different effects. The non-mobility group has not been presented with these questions concerning the effects of mobility, and are therefore excluded in the following tables. The respondents were presented with the following effects:  Table 8-1 shows that network effects are the most important effects from mobility. The strongest effects have been recorded on professional experience as a researcher, followed by access to an international network of professionals and general recognition in the research community. All averages lie on the positive side of three suggesting that in general the effects of mobility are positive. When zooming in on the different mobility groups, we see that the effects for the researchers that have been mobile from the US to the EU are the smallest among the three groups, while the effects of going from the EU to the US are the largest. Further we observe that the differences between group M1 and M2 are significant. We also find that mobility on average has had no effect on the group of researchers who moved from the US to the EU. The numbers suggest that being mobile in that direction did not have any effects on patent output and future job opportunities in the country where one previously worked or studied (all direct effects). Source: MORE extra -EU survey a Averages are based on all observations belonging to M1, M2 and M3, but due to the respondents who answered \"NA\", the actual number of respondents on which the average is based can differ for each effect. Cases were the number of respondents is ten or below are omitted. *** significant at 1% In Figure A2.3 we give a visual presentation of the importance of effects of mobility where the category \"decreased\" combines the answers \"strongly decreased\" and \"decreased\" and the category \"increased\" combines the answers \"increased\" and \"strongly increased\". Confirming the results in the averages table above, we notice that on all effects there is a much higher percentage of the EU-US mobile researchers than the US-EU mobile researchers who answer \"increased\". The difference is quite striking for \"professional experience as a researcher\" where nearly all of the EU-US mobile researchers have answered that it increased while only around 70 percent of the US-EU mobile researchers fall in the \"increased\" category. In general, the percentage of EU-US mobile researchers who answer that mobility has had a negative effect (\"decreased\") on the issues presented, is very low -for 6 out of the 8 effects it is under 5 percent -while the effects for US-EU mobile researchers are more often negative (between 10 and 20 percent for most of the effects answered that mobility \"decreased\" the output or networking issue presented). The radar graph in Figure 8-1 shows the striking differences. In the second part of the figure we clearly see how all the effects for the researchers who move from the US to the EU are smaller than those for the researchers who move in the other direction. Also when adding the other mobility group (M3) the effects of moving to the EU from the US remain the smallest on all points. Source: MORE extra -EU survey\nIn this chapter we go deeper into what makes a region attractive for researchers and how a region compares to other regions in terms of its attractiveness. To this goal, we looked at the answers to five different types of questions: 1. The comparison question. This question was asked to the four mobility groups but in a way which was relevant for the responding group. For the M1 (EU to US) group, the question was asked as follows: \"How does working as a researcher in the US compare to working as a researcher in the EU?\" For the other mobility groups, the comparison country is the EU and the question becomes: \"How does working as a researcher in the EU compare to working as a researcher in the US?\" (M2), or \"How do you think working as a researcher in an EU country compares to working in country x?\" (M3 and M4). The \"other mobility\" and \"no mobility\" groups were only required to answer the comparison question if the country of their most recent stay or the country where they have mostly worked as a researcher is not part of the EU. 2. The return to the region of graduation question. The reasons why a researcher has returned to his or her region of graduation is asked to two type of researchers, namely (1) those who have been mobile from the EU to the US and have worked in the EU as a researcher after having been to the US, and (2) those who have been mobile from the US to the EU and have worked as a researcher in the US after having been to the EU. 3. The no return to the region of graduation question. The reasons why a researcher has not returned to his or her region of graduation is asked to two type of researchers, namely (1) those who have been mobile from the EU to the US and have not worked in the EU as a researcher after having been to the US, and (2) those who have been mobile from the US to the EU and have not worked as a researcher in the US after having been to the EU."}, {"section_title": "The main definitions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mobility event", "text": "For this survey, a researcher is defined as mobile if he/she moved, to a country other than his/her country of highest educational attainment, after receiving said degree, to work as a researcher, for minimum of three months.

A mobility event is therefore one where the researcher has obtained his highest degree in country X, and, -subsequently has worked as a researcher for minimum of three months in country Y (where X is different from Y). This researcher is then considered as being mobile from country X to country Y."}, {"section_title": "EU and non-EU researchers", "text": "Due to the definition of a mobility event, an EU researcher is not necessarily defined as an EU national working as a researcher, but rather as a national of any country who has received his/her highest degree from an educational institution in one of the EU27 countries. Similarly, a non-EU researcher is defined as a researcher who obtained his/her highest degree from an educational institution in a non-EU country, regardless of nationality. Applying the foregoing definitions, a researcher is mobile from the EU to the US if he has obtained his highest degree in an EU27 country and has subsequently worked as a researcher for minimum of three months in the US.

The pilot survey also includes information on researchers who have been mobile between any other two geographical blocks other than the EU and US and researchers who have never been mobile. To summarize, the two main target groups of the survey are: \u2022 Group M1 (EU-US mobile): EU researchers (researchers who have received their highest degree in the EU) and have worked or are currently working in the US. \u2022 Group M2 (US-EU mobile): US researchers (researchers who have received their highest degree in the US) and have worked or are currently working in the EU. And, to enrich the survey results, the following two groups were added: \u2022 Group M3: Researchers who have been mobile after receiving highest degree but do not belong neither to group M1 nor to group M2. \u2022 Group M4: Researchers who have not been mobile after receiving highest degree. The following graph summarizes this information. "}, {"section_title": "Sampling method", "text": "This survey has been designed as a pilot study to analyse and compare the mobility patterns of EU researchers to the US with the mobility patterns of US researchers to the EU. Two main methods of sampling were used to identify the sample group for the survey: -Web-based search where we have specified the criteria for which email addresses of researchers will be searched on the web (see 3.4.1) -Indirect sampling methods (see 3.4.2)"}, {"section_title": "Web-based search", "text": "The web was used to extract a large sample of email addresses of people likely to be US academics who previously resided in Europe or European academics who previously resided in the US. To achieve this, the following steps were used: 1. First, a large sample of HTML or PDF CVs or home pages were obtained from US universities, by searching for relevant European countries in a series of searches in major search engines. Two basic searches were used: -CV site:edu @ -apply -application -applicants -\"Home page\" site:edu @ -apply -application -applicants Each of the above searches was submitted twice for each relevant European country replacing @: once for PDF files and once for HTML files. The first 1,000 results were recorded from both Yahoo and Bing (formerly Microsoft Live Search). 1,000 results is the maximum returned by search engines. In addition, query splitting was used to gain additional results if the search engine reported were more than 1000. The searches were designed to capture the web CV or home page of US academics or researchers in web sites ending in .edu, when the academic was mentioned alongside a relevant European country in that CV or home page. The excluded terms (application, apply, applicants) were used to exclude pages that were advertising jobs and requesting a CV to be sent in. The searches nevertheless still produced many spurious matches, for example due to the country name appearing as a conference or book publisher location. A similar procedure was used for relevant European countries except that site:edu was replaced with a country-specific search, like site:fr for France, and the word \"University\" was added, with USA being used as the country name. This change was made, because with the exception of the UK, European countries do not have a generic educational domain name like .edu. Thus, adding in the term \"University\" was an attempt to narrow down the European results to academic pages within the country. The European searches produced fewer results than the US searches, so additional searches of 670 individual European university web sites were performed, replacing the generic term \"university\" with the name of one of the most popular US universities from the previous searches. Universities searched for included: Harvard University, University of California, Princeton University, University of Chicago, Columbia University, Stanford University, Yale University and Cornell University. Three types of searches were used: university USA site:at cv -apply -application -applicants university USA site:at \"home page\" -apply -applicationapplicants -\"Cornell University\" site:kfunigraz.ac.at cv -applyapplication -applicants Initially attempts were made to translate the searches into local languages, i.e., French, Spanish, Italian and German; however, these searches did not generate many additional emails and this step was abandoned. 2. The second stage was to eliminate duplicates and download all pages identified using the LexiURL Searcher. 3. The third stage was to convert the PDF files into a more easily processed format. The program pdf2html was used for this, with an MSDOS batch file automating the process for the over 100,000 files involved. 4. The fourth stage was to process the HTML files (whether directly downloaded or converted from PDF) to extract email addresses. This was achieved using a program that searched the HTML files for patterns apparently matching email addresses, i.e. containing @ and text immediately before and after. Standard non-academic email addresses, such as those starting with sales@ or info@ were eliminated at this stage. Each email address extracted was marked as filtered if it was extracted from a page in which the country name appeared above any occurrence of the words \"publications\" or \"journal\". This heuristic was adopted because most CVs include an email address above any publication list. Furthermore, a country name appearing below an email address is likely to be associated with a publica-tion rather than a visit location or previous appointment. The filtered email addresses were thus marked for prioritisation in the survey. 5. The final stage was to eliminate duplicates from the combined lists (retaining the filtered addresses when a choice was available) and to perform a final manual check to remove incorrect email addresses. The overall result of the above process was the creation of two email address lists of academics that had a reasonable chance of being based in the US after having previously worked in a relevant European country and vice versa. This database of email addresses was used to form the main panel of addresses to which the survey was sent."}, {"section_title": "Indirect sampling methods", "text": "The team asked the European Commission to facilitate the sampling process for this survey by forwarding the link to the survey to: Researchers who received this link from one of these sources could use it to fill in the survey.

Finally, \"snowballing\" was used as an additional source to create the survey's sample. All respondents of the survey had the opportunity to forward the link to people who they thought should also be included in the survey. The following graph summarises the sampling methods employed for this survey. "}, {"section_title": "Drawbacks of the sampling approach", "text": "As already mentioned, the sampling approach has been based on convenience sampling. This is a consequence of the fact that access to data on the total relevant population, from which a representative sample could be drawn, could not be established (and we have no knowledge of such data actually existing). Therefore, the conclusions that can be derived from the survey cannot be generalized to the overall population. We explain the main reasons that the sample has not been representative in more detail below: \u2022 The study focuses on the EU-US mobility, i.e. the mobility of EU graduates to the US. In order to construct a representative sample and given that the EU27 is our reference for the MORE study, we would first need to know the population of EU27 graduates who move to the US after their highest education degree. This information however is not available. Subsequently we would need to have access to the contact details of these researchers. \u2022 As the target group of this study has been expanded to include also researchers moving from the US to the EU, we would need to know the population of US researchers moving to the EU as well as contact details for this population. This has not been possible to be established within the scope of the project. \u2022 Additionally, the other target groups of the mobile researchers between regions other than the EU and the US as well as the group of non-mobile researchers would require information on the population of researchers on a world-wide basis. Given the before-mentioned limitations, together with the fact that the present study is a pilot one and the focus has not been put into the construction of a representative sample, especially as access to such information could not be established, it should be taken into account that the sample analysed is not a statistically representative one. Therefore, the findings and conclusions drawn refer to this particular sample only and cannot be generalized to the whole population. However, in the future actions should be taken so that follow-up surveys will aim to target a sample representative of the population. This would ideally include (1) access to data study/training visas or temporary work visas from EU27 countries to and from the US on a yearly basis with contact details of persons getting these visas (almost impossible to get), or (2) access to data on scholarships, employment contracts or other contracts received from EU or US research-performing or research-funding institutions. However, the data presented in Chapter 2 on the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) in the US provide a sample of EU immigrants which is representative of the US science and engineering community. This sample is not representative of the EU research community; however we still provide a comparison of the results of the extra-EU mobility with the NSCG survey in terms of the underlying samples in what follows. Due to the sampling strategy we see that there is a significant difference in the distribution of US immigrants by country of highest degree. The US immigrants in the extra-EU mobility survey are dominated by researchers who obtained their highest degree in the EU27 (87.6%) which is, due to the sampling strategy and the objectives of the survey, significantly higher than the respective share in the NSCG survey (9.2%). Therefore, the two samples should not be directly compared as their target population is a different one. However, in the section describing the motivational factors of mobility (Chapter 7) we do refer to the findings related to the motivational factors of mobility as presented by the NSCG survey."}, {"section_title": "Design and content of the questionnaire", "text": "This section provides an overview of the main topics that the questionnaire covers and the differences in terms of questions among the four mobility groups.

Part I of the questionnaire begins with a question to determine whether the respondent is currently a researcher according to the definition set forth in the MORE project 21 .

Here we see that the EU has the largest percentage of graduating researchers that stay in the EU, while this is only 71% in the US. Thus, we can conclude that graduating in the EU leads to a more permanent stay as opposed to graduating in the US. This result is partially explained by the region of birth: after graduating in another region, researchers likely want to return to their region of birth. The fact that a much higher share of respondents born in the EU graduated in the US (13%) compared to the share of respondents born in the US and graduated in the EU (only 5%) would then explain this difference in Table 4-5 (see Table 4-6).

The remaining respondents of these two groups are more or less equally distributed between the US and the other countries.

Half of the non-mobile respondents reside in the EU, 36% of them reside in the US and the remaining 13% reside in other countries.  For the group of other countries, this percentage is slightly lower in all mobility groups, but especially in mobility group 1 (EU to US) where only 43% of the respondents born in the group of other countries are classified as having 'EU'nationality. There are no remarkable differences between the groups of mobile researchers versus the group of non-mobile researchers."}, {"section_title": "Region of birth, nationality and region of graduation", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Gender, age and family situation", "text": "The following table provides a number of personal characteristics of the responding researchers by region of residence. The share of male researchers residing in the EU and US is 65% and 66% respectively, which is somewhat higher than in the group of other countries (62%). The average responding researcher is nearly 44 years old. More than half of the respondents (53%) are between 36 and 55 years old. Researchers residing in the EU are, on average, slightly younger compared to researchers residing in the US and the group of other countries. More than half of the respondents (52%) achieved their highest degree between 2000 and 2010. A quarter of the respondents achieved it in the 1990's. Comparing these results with the age distribution, we see that the responding researchers take quite some time before they eventually achieve their highest educational degree. Another explanation is that they have research breaks in their career, alternating academic life with jobs in the private sector, and therefore get their highest degree in a later stage of their working life. Looking at marital status, we see that nearly 74% of the respondents are married or cohabiting and 20% are single. Only a minor share are widowed or divorced. In the EU, the share of married/cohabiting respondents is somewhat lower than in the other regions of residence, while the share of single respondents is slightly higher. 54% of the EU and 56% of the US respondents have children, compared to 62% in the group of other countries. In addition, the number of children is higher in the group of other countries than in EU and US, with 74% of the respondents having more than 1 child, compared to 66% in the EU and US. Figure 4-3 below shows the share of researchers younger than 45 years old, married or cohabitating and with children. Looking at the researchers younger than 45 years old, we see that the share in the EU is 62%, which is slightly higher than in the US and other countries of residence (49% and 55% respectively). Next, we computed a new variable, by looking at the difference in years between attainment of the highest educational degree and the year of birth. This difference is the age at which the respondent achieved his/her highest educational degree. We assigned these age-results to four age groups. The following table shows the distribution across the four age groups in general and per type of highest educational degree received. As expected, respondents that obtained a PhD-degree are on average the eldest group of researchers, followed by the group of respondents with a graduate degree. The majority of the respondents with a PhD-degree (48%) obtained this degree between ages 26 and 30. 41% of respondents obtained their PhD between ages 31 and 40; the majority of which obtained their PhD before the age of 34. From the group of respondents with an undergraduate degree only, 78% obtained this degree between the ages of 17 and 25, which is a very logical result. The results of the group of respondents with only a secondary degree are somewhat surprising, as 80% of the respondents obtained this degree after the age of 25; however, it is important to note that the number of observations (10) is very low.  The share of male students is highest in the group of mobile researchers (with the highest percentage of 68% for mobility group 3 -other mobility) and lowest in the group of non-mobile researchers (mobility group 4 -no mobility with only 61%). This is not surprising, since women are still more restricted due to familyreasons (e.g., pregnancy and raising up children) than men.  Table 4-10, we see that researchers in mobility groups 2 (US to EU) and 3 (other mobility) are, on average, also slightly older compared to researchers in mobility groups 1 (EU to US) and 4 (no mobility). This is also illustrated in Figure 4-5 below, where the group of non-mobile researchers has the highest share of respondents younger than 45, closely followed by mobility group 1. There are relatively more married (or cohabiting) and relatively less single respondents in mobility group 2, compared to the three other groups. The group of non-mobile researchers has the lowest percentage of married/cohabitating respondents and the highest percentage of single respondents (see also Figure  4-5). Nearly 60% of the respondents in mobility groups 2 and 3 have children, compared to 53% and 52.5% in mobility group 1 and 4. This is a remarkable result, as we would expect that persons with children are less mobile than persons without. However, we can take into consideration that since mobility is motivated by better economic opportunities, married researchers with children, having greater needs, might be more motivated to move. Given the lower percentage for mobility group 4 (no mobility), this argumentation does not hold true. The share of respondents with only 1 child is lowest in mobility group 2 (US to EU). Mobility group 1 (EU to US) has relatively more 'larger households' with 6.8% of the respondents having 4 or more children compared to 5.4%, 4.9% and 4.3% for mobility group 3, 4 and 2 respectively. Here the results of mobility group 4 conflict with the results that would be expected, since the group of non-mobile researchers has fewer 'large households' than does the group of mobile researchers, while the opposite would seem to be more logical.  In conclusion, mobility group 4 (no mobility) and 1 (EU to US) contain more 'younger' and 'single' researchers without 'children' than mobility group 2 (US to EU) and 3 (other mobility). This finding is not as expected for the no-mobile groups as we would expect that persons not bound by a relationship and/ or family obligations would be more mobile."}, {"section_title": "Education and training", "text": "Section four deals with topic 'education and training'. The first two sections discuss the highest educational attainment and the field of science in which the researchers obtained their highest educational diploma. Subsequently, the results on student mobility and work experience in industry as student are presented. The following table presents the highest educational attainment of researchers by a number of profile characteristics. Nearly 86% of the respondents have a PhD or equivalent. For the respondents residing in the US, this number is 92%. The results by region of graduation are more or less similar, with the highest share of PhD-degrees in the US. By mobility group, it is group 2 that has the highest share of respondents with a PhD-degree with 94.4%, closely followed by group 1 with 92.8%. The group of non-mobile researchers has a significantly lower share of respondents with a PhD (only 77%). For the whole sample the share of respondents with a degree lower than Graduate (e.g. Undergraduate or lower) is only 1.4%.  Most of the respondents obtained their highest educational degree in natural (41%) and social sciences (30%). Medical and health sciences (5%) and agricultural sciences (3.5%) are the least represented. By region of residence, we see that there are relatively more researchers specialised in engineering and technology in the EU12 and the non-EU and non-US countries than in the US and the EU15. The US has the highest percentage of those in the humanities and the lowest percentage of researchers in agricultural sciences (only 1.7%). However, we have to keep in mind that it is not a representative sample and that the total share of researchers with a highest degree in agricultural sciences is very small in this sample."}, {"section_title": "Field of science", "text": "The differences are larger between the different regions of graduation. In the US, there are relatively less researchers in natural, medical and health and agricul-tural sciences and engineering and technology, but nearly twice as much researchers in social sciences and 50 to 60% more researchers in humanities compared to the other regions. Also the fields of sciences are distributed differently between the different mobility groups. Indeed, the results from the respondents in mobility group 2 (US to EU) differ the most from the other mobility groups. We see that half of the researchers in mobility group 1 (EU to US) obtained their highest degree in natural sciences, which compared to the other groups, is by far the highest share. Conversely, researchers in mobility group 1 have relatively less social science graduates than the other groups. Next, we present the distribution for the variable 'age at obtainment of the highest educational degree' across the four different age groups per field of science. Here, we expect, on average, a higher duration for the medical and health sciences, which are science fields with a longer study-path than other fields. Together with humanities (average age 32.8), the medical and health sciences (average age 32.6) is indeed the field of science where researchers obtain their highest educational degree approximately 2 to 3 years later than other fields, (i.e., the natural sciences (average age 29.8) and engineering and technology (average age 30.1)). In both these fields however we see that there are relatively higher shares of respondent with a PhD. This is however not the case of Natural Sciences where the average age of graduation (highest degree) is relatively low although there is a high share of respondents with a PhD.   The field of humanities consists of the highest percentage of respondents having been mobile as a student (44%), in contrast to the fields of medical and health science and engineering and technology, both with a share of only 26%. The high percentage in humanities is caused by the high percentages in the subfields of languages and literature (49%) and history and archaeology (48%). The subfields with the highest share of researchers having been mobile as a student are industrial biotechnology (67%) and medical engineering (61%), both of which are categorized in the field of engineering and technology. Subfields with the lowest share are 'other' unspecified medical sciences, materials engineering and agricultural biotechnology with only 13%, 14% and 16% respectively. Next, Table  4-15 provides the share of researches that have had work experience in the industry as student, per field of graduation. The results show a different picture compared to the results of having been mobile as a student. The field of engineering and technology has the highest share of researchers that have work experience in industry as student (41%), while humanities has the lowest share with a percentage only half as high. Subfields with a high share of researchers having had work experience as student in industry are 'other' unspecified engineering and technologies, environmental engineering (51%) and materials engineering (all with 50%), while environmental biotechnology (14%), philosophy, ethics and religion (8%) are situated at the lower end. Remarkable is the fact that none of the respondents in the subfield of industrial biotechnology has had work experience in industry as student. With 15% the field of social sciences presents the highest share of responding researchers that have been both mobile as a student and have had work experience in industry as student, while the medical and health sciences presents the lowest, with only 6%. Conversely, medical and health sciences present the highest percentage of researchers that have not been mobile as a student nor have had work experience in industry as student.  Mobility group 2 (US to EU) has the highest percentage of researchers that have not been mobile as a student (57%), nor have had work experience in industry as student, closely followed by the group of non-mobile researchers (55%). In the group of non-mobile researchers, half of the remaining respondents have only had work experience in industry as student. In mobility group 3 (other mobility) the share of researchers that have had work experience in industry as student is also larger than the share of researchers that have been mobile, while in mobility group 1 (EU to US) and 2 (US to EU) the proportion is the reverse."}, {"section_title": "CURRENT EMPLOYMENT OF RESEARCHERS", "text": "This chapter describes the current employment situation of the researchers that have responded to the survey.

Only 31% state that their job encompasses the developing of new products or processes. And only 21% supervise the research. By region of residence, we see that the share of researchers having to carry out research is nearly 99% in the US, which is slightly higher than in the other regions. For all other kinds of tasks, the respondents from the group of countries outside EU and US have the highest share. Looking at the results per mobility group, we find that the respondents in mobility group 2 (US to EU) must carry out research the most, while they must develop new products and processes and supervise research the least. The group of nonmobile researchers have the highest share of respondents that need to develop new products and processes in their job. For these researchers, their job focus is less on the improvement of products or processes, compared to the group of mobile researchers."}, {"section_title": "Current status as researcher", "text": "The following figure presents the share of researchers according to their status as researcher (i.e. currently doctoral researchers, or post-doctoral researchers or other type of researcher). 15% of the respondents are PhD researchers, 42% are post-doctoral researchers and the remaining 43% act as another type of researcher. Next, Table 5-3 presents the current 'status' (doctoral, postdoctoral or other type of researcher) of the researchers by region of residence and region of graduation. By region of residence, the results only differ marginally across the three regions. In the US there are somewhat less researchers working as PhD researchers and relatively more post-doctoral researchers. The differences are slightly higher by region of graduation. The US and the EU have the highest share of post-doctoral researchers with 43%, compared to the group of other countries, with only 33.5%. Conversely, the share of PhD researchers in other countries is 8 to 10 percentage points higher than in the EU and the US. Finally, Table 5-4 presents the current status of the researchers by mobility group. An interesting result is the high share of PhD researchers in the group of nonmobile researchers (23%) compared to the groups of mobile researchers (with a share of 6% to 12%), which could be related to the younger age on average of the respondents in this group. Within the group of mobile researchers, we see that the share of PhD-students in mobility group 3 (other mobility) is nearly twice as high as the share within mobility group 2 (US to EU).

When we look at the distribution of the different types of employers across the six fields of science, we see that the highest shares of researchers have obtained their highest degree in the field of natural sciences and work for a research institute, a higher education institution or a company. There are nearly no researchers in this sample working for private research institutes whom have obtained a highest degree in agricultural sciences. However, we have to keep in mind that this is not a representative sample. Only 4% of the researchers working for public research institutes have obtained their highest degree in medical and health sciences. Companies form an exception in the field of engineering and technology; while only 4 to 9.5% of researchers working for the other types of organisations have obtained their highest degree in this particular field the share of researchers working for a company is 25%. Next, looking at the contract status per type of employer, we see that three quarters of the respondents working for a company have an open ended contract, while in higher education institutions and research institutions this share is substantially lower (48% for higher education institutions, 45% for public and 36% for private research institutions). The share of fixed contracts in these types of organisations is relatively higher than in companies. The share of nonemployment contracts is highest in the group of researchers working at private research institutions. Finally, the years of employment under the current contract status is, on average, highest in higher education institutions (10.1 years), followed by self employed researchers (9.5 years) and those employed by public research institutions (9.4 years) and lowest in private research institutes and companies (both 6.3 years).

Looking at the field of science, the distribution of the three regions does not strongly differ. The group of US residents has a slightly lower share of researchers that obtained their highest degree in the field of engineering and technology (6.7%) compared to the other regions (10% in the EU and 10.5% in the group of other countries). There are, however, relatively more researchers residing in the US with a highest degree in the field of humanities. There are relatively more researchers residing outside the US and the EU with a highest degree in agricultural sciences. But with only 6.5%, this is still a very limited share. When examining the distribution of the contract status for each of the regions, we observed a smaller share of researchers residing in the US with a fixed contract of more than 2 years, but a larger share of researchers with a contract other than the six specified types of contracts. Relatively less researchers residing outside the EU and the US have an open ended contract, but there are relatively more researchers with a fixed contract of 1 to 2 years, compared to the EU and USresidents. The distribution by years of employment does not strongly differ between the regions. In the US, there are slightly less researchers who have worked less than 1 year under their current contract status, while there are slightly more researchers who have worked 10 years or more under their current contract status. The fact that researchers seem to work a relatively longer period under the current contract status is confirmed by looking to the average years of employment.

Researchers in mobility group 2 (US to EU) are more likely to have obtained their highest degree in social sciences compared to the other mobility groups,(42% compared to 34% in M4 -no mobility, 28% in M3 -other mobility, and only 22% in M1 -EU to US). The share of respondents in mobility group 2 who obtained their highest degree in medical and health sciences is extremely small, with only 2% compared to 4% in M3, 6% in M4 and 7,5% in M1. Half of the researchers in mobility group 1 obtained their highest degree in the field of natural sciences, a share that is higher than any other mobility group.

Source: MORE extra -EU survey 45% of the respondents reports that their current work as researcher involves formal collaboration, but only with academic researchers from other countries. 38% of the researchers are not involved in formal collaboration with researchers from other countries. Looking at the results by region of residence, we observe that the share of researchers not involved in formal collaboration with other countries is highest in the US, with 52%. The distribution between the EU and the group of other countries (non-EU/non-US) is quite similar. Looking at the results per field of science, we see that the current work of the respondents that obtained their highest degree in humanities and social sciences involves the least formal collaboration with other countries (50% and 58% respectively), in contrast to the highest share (73%) in the agricultural sciences. The field of engineering and technology has the highest share of researchers reporting that their job encompasses formal collaboration both with academic as well as industrial researchers from other countries (33%, which is 17 percentage points above the average). Next, Table 5-10 presents the results per mobility group. The group of non-mobile researchers has the highest share of respondents that hold a job which does not involve formal collaboration with researchers from other countries. This is quite expected. Mobility groups 3 (other mobility) and 1 (EU to US) have the highest share of respondents involved in collaboration both with academic and industrial researchers (17.5% in M3 and 16.7% in M1 compared to 14.3% in M4 -no mobility, and 13.7% in M2 -US to EU). Figure 5-3 presents the results per type of employer. Here we see that the collaborative activities of companies are quite distinct from those of the other types of employers. First, researchers working for a company are the least involved in formal collaboration with researchers from other countries. About half of the researchers working for a higher education institution or research institute state that when they formally collaborate with researchers from other countries, it is only with academic researchers (52% for public researchers, 49% for private researchers and 45% for higher education institutes)."}, {"section_title": "Prospects of career as researcher", "text": "This final section of chapter 3 deals with the respondents' career prospects as a researcher.

Conversely, the respondents living in the EU have a different answering behaviour. They are remarkably less confident compared to the respondents living outside the EU. The results by field of science show that the researchers that obtained their highest degree in social sciences and humanities are the most confident (89% and 85% respectively at least somewhat confident), while researchers in agricultural sciences are the least (79% at least somewhat confident). Table 5-12 presents the results per mobility group. While there are no remarkable differences between the groups, the non-mobile researchers are slightly less confident about the future prospects for their research career.  Figure 5-5 shows that respondents working for a higher education institution are by far the most confident with about half of them reporting being very confident about their future prospects. The researchers working for a company, and especially self employed researchers, are the least confident. In fact, 16% of the self employed declared that they lack confidence about their future research career prospects. These results are not surprising as having a self-employment position is related in general with higher risks and less security. Finally, Figure 5-6 presents the results per employment status. We would expect the highest confidence to be expressed by researchers with an open ended contract. This is confirmed by the survey results, where 90% of those with open ended contracts report that they are confident about their future projects. 55% claim to be very confident, which is twice as high as the share of the total group of respondents.

The distribution is very similar for all residence regions. Three-fourths of the respondents have always worked in the public sector. Another 10 percent is currently in the public sector, but with a different history (either from the public sector via the private sector and then back, or from the private to the public sector). Overall, 85 percent of researchers in all regions are currently employed by the public sector. Only 3 percent have always worked in the private sector and another 3 percent is currently working in the private sector but was formerly in the public sector. We should however keep in mind here that the sample is not representative of the underlying population and these findings are largely dependent on the sampling strategy that has been followed for this survey. Table 6-2 shows that half of the respondents have worked for two to three employers since they graduated. Nearly one in four has worked for zero to one employer (zero if the respondent considers himself as not having graduated yet) and around one in five has worked for four to five employers. A minority has worked for more than five employers. Again, the distribution is very similar over the regions of residence. For EU12 residents we see that employer mobility is lower than for researchers residing in the other regions.  Figure 6-1 shows that in all mobile groups (mobility groups M1, M2 and M3) the percentage of researchers that has worked for zero to one employer since graduation is lower (nearly 20%) than the total average (23%) whereas this percentage is higher in the non mobile group (M4) (34%). So non-mobility goes together with a not so frequent shift in employers.  In total half of the respondents worked in two to three different countries after graduation. This percentage is higher in the EU15 (56%) and much lower in the EU12 (36.5%). The result for the US researchers lies somewhere in between, with 44% having worked in two to three countries. The percentages of researchers in the categories with four to five or more than five countries where they worked, are very similar across the regions, the trade-off lies between the zero/one and the two/three categories. From these results it appears that EU15 resident researchers have been most mobile in terms of working in different countries abroad, followed by the \"other regions\", while US resident researchers and lastly EU12 resident researchers appear the least mobile in terms of working in other countries.  Figure 6-2 shows the differences by mobility groups. The three mobile groups are very similar with a nearly equal percentage (around 80%) of researchers in the combined \"two or more countries worked in\" category. As expected, it is the nonmobile group that differs from the general picture. In the case of non-mobile researchers, 75% have worked in zero to one countries following graduation, which is much higher than for mobile researchers, where only 20% have worked in zero to one countries."}, {"section_title": "Changes of employers", "text": "The fact that 25 percent of the non-mobile researchers have worked in more than two different countries may seem as a contradiction at first, but bearing in mind the definition of non-mobility, a respondent is non-mobile if he or she, after obtaining his/her highest degree, has not worked for a minimum of three months in a country other than the graduation country, then being non-mobile and having worked in different countries after graduation is possible. This can occur, for example, if the respondent has answered the question \"in how many countries have you worked since graduation?\" by including stays after graduation which are shorter than three months or if he or she did not consider \"graduation\" to be the moment when the highest degree was attained. If the respondent attaches the \"graduation\" time to another (lower) degree that was obtained, he/she may well have been working in a different country before obtaining his/her highest degree.  Table 6-4 shows the duration of the latest stay by region of residence. The largest percentages can be found in either the long-term stays of more than three years (51%) or the very short-term stays between three and six months (18%). The remaining 30 percent is equally distributed over the other durations. Of the researchers currently residing in the US, a considerably higher share (63%) stayed for more than three years and a considerably lower share (13%) was on a short-term visit for less than six months. In the EU27, the percentage of long-term visitors (44%) is much lower than in the US, while the percentage of short-term visitors (21%) is much higher than in the US. We have to be careful while interpreting these results because they include all researchers residing in a region irrespective of their mobility group, including the non-mobile group which represents 1927 respondents  Figure 6-3 shows indeed that 86 percent of the respondents belonging to the nonmobile group have answered \"more than three years\" as the duration of their latest stay. The \"other mobility\"-group has the relatively highest percentage of short-term visits (29%). Those going from the US to the EU have relatively more researchers (51%) who stay long-term, compared to those going from the EU to the US (40%). In Figure 6-4 we visualize the relationship between the number of countries a researcher has worked in and the duration of his/her latest stay. We find a U-shape relationship between the length of stay and the percentage of researchers having worked in zero to one country (hence an inverted U-shape between the length of stay and the percentage of researchers having worked in two or more countries after graduation).

The percentage is especially high for researchers living in the US, where more than half of them (56.4 percent) were not born there. Of the researchers living in the EU27 nearly one third were not born there. For the EU12 researchers, only one in eight were not born there. From the results on this indicator the US appears the most attractive region for researchers worldwide, having a researcher population where the foreign born part is larger than the US born. For the second indicator, whether one's country of residence is the same as one's region of graduation, the percentage for the total group of respondents is slightly lower -only 35.6 percent do not live in the region where they graduated. For this indicator, the US and EU27 have the same score. However, it is apparent that the EU27 score is driven by the EU15 score since for the EU12, only 19 percent did not graduate there. Based on the first and second indicator our survey findings suggest the following conclusions: (1) The US appears to attract researchers both for education and employment, (2) the EU15 resident researchers of foreign origin seem to get educated in the EU15 and remain there to work, but the EU15 does not attract many researchers having graduated somewhere else, and (3) in the EU12, researchers seem to leave to be educated elsewhere and then return to the EU12. The EU12 seems to be the least attractive region for foreign born and foreign educated researchers. For the indicators \"mobile as researcher, \"mobile as a student\" and \"mobile as researcher, not mobile as a student\", the regions do not differ much from each other, with the exception of the EU12. Between 35 and 38 percent of all mobile researchers were mobile as students (see Table 6-8) while only around one fifth of the non-mobile researchers have been mobile as a student (around one fifth). On the basis of this, student mobility seems to indicate future mobility, which seems lower in EU12. The indicator \"number of countries where worked since graduation is two or more\" shows that US based researchers have been the least internationally mobile compared to the EU27 researchers and researchers based in other regions which could be partly attributed to the fact that they do not often leave the US to pursue doctoral study. Within the EU27 there is a large difference between the EU15 and the EU12 with the former having a larger percentage of researchers (67%) who have worked in two or more countries after their graduation, while the latter has a lower percentage (50%). Overall, the EU12 appears to have the least mobile population of researchers scoring lowest on four of the five mobility indicators, with the exception of 'being mobile as researcher, but not as a student'-indicator, where it ranks the second lowest."}, {"section_title": "Types of international mobility for this survey", "text": "Next we look at the distribution of the four mobility groups, as defined for this study by M1 (mobile from the EU to the US), M2 (mobile from the US to the EU), M3 (mobile but not belonging to the M1 or M2 types of mobility) and M4 (not mo-bile according to the current definition for mobility), by region of residence at the time of the survey and the duration of their stay."}, {"section_title": "The four groups of mobility for this survey", "text": "Of all respondents residing in the EU27, 14 percent have been mobile to the US and 8 percent mobile from the US, whereas from the US researcher population only 2 percent has been mobile to the EU27. We can conclude for the researchers in the sample that there is a larger flow of researchers going from the EU27 to the US than the other way around reflecting the results of other studies. We should however keep in mind that these findings refer to this particular sample and cannot be generalised. The EU27, however, appears to be more attractive than the US for researchers from other regions (46.7 percent of EU27 researchers are \"other mobile\" researchers compared to only 32 percent in the US). The US has the largest group of \"non-mobile\" researchers closely followed by the EU12.  Figure 6-5 clearly shows that the US appears to have the largest share of \"nonmobile\" researchers suggesting that it is the region that best retains its graduates. The EU15 has the lowest share of non-mobile researchers.  Table 6-7 shows that the longer the duration of the latest stay respondents increasingly fall into the non-mobile group and therefore are less likely to belong to any other mobility group. The group who is mobile the US from the EU is mostly represented in the one to two year duration group, while this mobility group is the least represented in the shortest and longest duration groups. The group who visits the EU from the US constitutes around 6 percent of all duration types (with the exception of the 2 to 3 year visit).

These results confirm the conclusion based on the summary statistics that researchers move from the US to the EU for personal reasons and move from the EU to the US for career progression goals. A new result is that, once corrected for other effects, the star scientist motivation also drives US graduates to the EU, but does not drive EU graduates to the US.\nIn general, motivations have a strong affect on the effects of mobility: the more important the motivation, the stronger the effect. This is especially the case where a motivation has a corresponding mobility effect, for example between the \"access to facilities\"-motivation and the \"access to infrastructure and know-how\" effect or between the \"working with star scientists\"-motivation and the \"international network of professionals\" and \"professional experience\"-effects but also between the \"personal and family\" or \"cultural interest\"-motivations and overall personal effects. Researchers who are driven by \"career progression goals\" record strong positive effects on nearly all professional effects (except for \"working in industry\").

In Figure A2.1 we present a visual overview of the importance of the motivations for the different mobility groups. It shows the percentages that find a motivation \"not important\" (combining the respondents who have answered either \"not important at all\" or \"not important\"), \"neutral\" or \"important\" (combining the answers \"important\" and \"extremely important\". We will compare these results with the averages presented above. Financial and cultural motivations do not seem to be an important factor in the decision to become mobile (average score less than 3). All of the professional motivations seem to be fairly important with the highest importance found for \"personal education and/or research agenda\" and \"career progression goals\". Focusing on the group of researchers that has been or is mobile from the EU to the US (M1 in Table 7-1), we find that \"career progression goals\" is the most important motivational factor followed by \"personal education or research agenda\" and \"prospects to work with leading experts\". These motivations have an average score which is higher than the average score for the total (all groups combined). We can reach a similar conclusion by looking at the distribution in Figure A2.1: 80 percent of the researchers going from the EU to the US find the first two motivations important and less than ten percent finds them not important. \"Prospects to work with leading experts\" follows with more than 70 percent finding it important and around ten percent finding it not important. Personal or financial motivations seem the least important for going to the US. The opposite is true for the researchers who graduated in the US and are moving to the EU. For those researchers personal motivations are very important. \"Personal/family factors\" share first place with \"personal education and/or research agenda\" followed by career progression goals. See also the results in Figure A2.1 where around 60 percent of the researchers going from the US to the EU finds these motivations important. Personal/family factors and interest in the culture are the two exceptions where the motivational score going from the US to the EU is higher than for those going from the EU to the US (and significant at 1%). The EU-to-US mobile researchers indicate that all of the professional motivations are more important to them than do the US to EU mobile researchers (and significant at 1%). Financial motivations do not play an important role; they are the least important for those going from the US to the EU and third least important for those going from the EU to the US. The radar graph in the second part of Figure 7-1 shows that respondents in group M2 score much higher on the two personal motivations while respondents in group M1 score much higher on all professional motivations. For both groups, financial motivations do not play an important role. When comparing the non-mobile group to the other groups, we find that personal/family factors drive group M2 to become mobile and career progression goals drive the M1 group to become mobile, while these two factors are the motivations that drive the non-mobile group to not be mobile ( Figure A2.1 shows that nearly 60 percent of the non-mobile researchers answered that personal/family factors were important in their decision not to become mobile, while slightly over 40 percent answered that career progression goals were important confirming that the most important driver of non-mobility is personal/family factors). All other motivations play a more neutral role in the decision not to become mobile. In the first part of the radar graph in Figure 7-1 we can see that the importance of the motivational factors is always the least strong for the non-mobile group (and the difference is significant at 1%) but for the financial and personal/family factor motivations.  Source: MORE extra -EU survey Next, we compare the motivations (or de-motivations) for becoming mobile by the respondents international experience (duration of latest stay and number of countries worked since graduation), career path (measured by both the number of employers since graduation and career path in terms of working in the public versus private sector), and educational background (indicated by the highest degree and field of science). Table 7-2 below provides information per duration of stay and per category of number of countries worked abroad for the mobile groups M1, M2, M3.\nIn general we find that the respondents in mobility groups M1, M3 and M4 who are comparing the US or another region to the EU tend to weakly agree with the propositions which are presented in favour of the region of \"destination.\" The respondents of mobility group M2 tend to weakly disagree with all propositions presented in favour of the EU. This means that the EU comes out as the worst region on nearly all topics, especially when compared to the US. When we focus on the researchers who have been mobile from the EU to the US, they agree on all propositions that the researcher situation with respect to obtaining funding, career references, research infrastructure, collaboration with topclass researchers, access to knowledge, remuneration schemes and opportunities to work in industry, is better in the US than in the EU. They agree most strongly with the propositions that working in the US is a better reference for their career than working in the EU (80 percent of the EU-US mobile researchers agrees to strongly agrees with this proposition-see Figure A2.4) and that the US offers better opportunities for collaboration with top-class researchers (around 75 percent agrees to strongly agrees). Looking at the group who has been mobile in the other direction (US to EU), they tend to disagree on all propositions confirming the results described above, that the US as a research environment offers better opportunities than the EU, but they do so less strongly. The averages are lower and also the percentages of researchers agreeing to strongly agreeing are generally lower. Even when comparing another country to the EU, the latter comes out worse on nearly all propositions, the exception being \"access to knowledge is better in country X than in the EU\". Knowing that these scores are given by respondents who may not have been even working in the EU as a researcher suggests that the notion that the EU is worse in terms of research environment is \"common knowledge\" amongst researchers. Source: MORE extra -EU survey a Averages are based on all observations belonging to M1, M2, M3 and M4 who were required to answer but due to the respondents who answered \"No opinion\" -which has not been taken into account while calculating averages-the actual number of respondents on which the average is based can differ for each attractiveness factor. *** Difference between group M1 and M2 is significant at 1%; \u2206\u2206\u2206 Difference between the mobile group of researchers (M1, M2, M3) and the non-mobile group (M4) is significant at 1%. The graphs in Figure A2.4 show that most researchers tend to agree to strongly agree with the propositions that the US is a better reference for a career as a researcher, that the US offers better opportunities to collaborate with top-class researchers and that the US offers better funding opportunities than the EU. It is especially the EU-researchers who have been/are mobile to the US that agree strongest on these points with between 70 and 80 percent agreeing to strongly agreeing. The non-mobile group also tends to agree mostly but in this group of researchers we find less than 50 percent agreeing while there also is a large share of non-mobile researchers who do not agree on these points (upto 35%). The radar graphs in Figure 9-1 give a visual presentation of the striking results. The second part of the figure shows that all the scores for the researchers having been mobile from the US to the EU lie below the \"indifferent\" line (score of 3) meaning that they disagree with all propositions describing the EU as a better research environment than the US. Quite to the contrary, all scores given by researchers who have been or are mobile between the EU to US all lie above the \"indifferent\" line meaning that they agree with the propositions describing the US as the better research environment. As for the other mobility groups, they also tend to agree that \"another country\" is better in terms of research environment than the EU except for the score on \"access to knowledge\".  In this section we check whether the general results described above hold true for all fields of science or whether the EU is a better region to work for some fields while the US might be more attractive in other fields. It appears that the general impression holds true for all fields of science. We find the highest numbers in the M1 part and the lowest in the M2 part. Researchers from all fields of science seem to agree that working in the US is better, at least professionally, than working in the EU. The only proposition the EU does not score the worst on is the \"access to knowledge not available in reference country\". Focusing on the researchers who have been mobile from the EU to the US, it is especially true for the medical and health sciences where the US comes out far better than the EU, while for the humanities the result is less strong, but still in favour of the US. This result is confirmed in the M2 part where we see the only slightly positive scores for the EU in the field of humanities. Researchers in engineering and technical sciences also rather strongly agree with the fact that remunerative schemes in the US are better. The strongest agreement that the US is better for ones career was found in the social sciences.

When the duration is shorter than three years personal and family related factors do not appear to have much influence over the mobility decision. With regards to stays of longer than six months, cultural motivations do not seem to be important. For the 'personal education and research agenda' motivation and the 'prospects to work with leading experts' motivation, the importance is lowest for durations greater than three years, although both motivations are very important in general. Career progression goals are the second most important motivation for all durations, but the least so for researchers with a stays of less than six months. Getting access to facilities is equally important for all durations. Financial motivations play a stronger role, the longer the duration, but are in general not important. We also see that the longer the duration, the differences in motivations narrows.

Getting access to facilities/equipment appears to be a less important motivation for those with private career path (\"always private\" and \"private to public and back\") than for those with a mainly public career path (\"always public\" and \"public to private and back\").

This question was presented to all four mobility groups and adapted accordingly. For the first group, researchers moving from the EU to the US, the question was: \"During the period of time when you have been deciding to become mobile, to what extent have the following factors been important in influencing your decision to work in the US?\". The destination country is adapted to: (1) EU for group M2, (2) country x for groups M3 and M4 where country x is the country of latest mobility (M3) or of non-mobility (M4).

Source: MORE extra -EU survey a Averages are based on all observations belonging to M1, M2, M3 and M4 but due to the respondents who answered \"NA\" the actual number of respondents on which the average is based can differ for each influencing factor. *** Difference between group M1 and M2 is significant at 1%; \u2206\u2206\u2206 Difference between the mobile group of researchers (M1, M2, M3) and the non-mobile group (M4) is significant at 1%. Similar to the motivations described in the former section, we also include a visual presentation of the importance of the influencing factors in annex 2 ( Figure  A2.2). On average not many of the external factors seem to be important having average scores below three. Only \"obtaining funding for own research\" seems to be important when one considers the decision to move. As much as 41 percent of those mobile from the EU to the US consider it as important and 31 percent of the researchers moving in the opposite direction also consider it important. Also noteworthy is the fact that 52 percent of the non-mobile consider \"obtaining fund-ing for own research\" as an important influencing factor suggesting that it plays the role of barrier to mobility when funding is not easily made available. Among all groups combined, \"language\" and \"quality and cost of accommodation\" are also of some importance. Pension and social care provisions and immigration regulations are of the least concern. Even though \"obtaining funding for own research\" appears to be a more important issue when one moves from the EU to the US, the difference is not significant. The difference is significant however, between the mobile and non-mobile group with the latter attaching a higher importance to the issue. From this sample we see that researchers moving from the EU to the US seem less concerned about pension and social care provisions in the US, or if they do, it does not affect their decision to become mobile. Researchers moving in the other direction (US to EU) seem slightly more concerned about pension and social care provisions in the EU (around 30 percent of the US-EU mobile researchers finds this an important concern), and also about immigration regulations (which 20 percent finds important), work permission for partners (more than 30 percent of the US-EU mobile researchers considers this important), availability of adequate schools (also considered as important by more than 30 percent of the US-EU mobile researchers) and cost and quality of accommodation (considered important by more than 20 percent). Hence we can conclude that \"practical\" considerations play an important role for around one fourth to one third of the researchers moving from the US to the EU. This is also clear from the second part in the radar graph in Figure 7-2. The first part of the graph shows that mobile groups M1 (EU to US) and M3 (other mobility) appear to attach the same importance to the issues presented. Except for one influencing factor, the factors are significantly more important for the non-mobile group than for the mobile group. This seems obvious as it might be these external factors that caused the researchers to remain immobile, even if they had the desire to be mobile. However, the non-mobile group, judges most factors as not important. Therefore we may conclude that the true reason they are not mobile lies in the motivational factors rather than in the external factors. Source: MORE extra -EU survey 7.3.2 Influencing factors and experience abroad Table 7-6 shows that, generally, none of the influencing factors plays a strong role. \"Obtaining funding for research\", \"language\" and \"quality and cost of accommodation\" seem to be the most important considerations (but remain fairly unimportant). In general, there also appears to be a positive correlation between the length of stay and the importance of an issue. Regarding the number of countries where researchers have worked, none of the factors appear to be important. The \"obtaining funding for own research\" factor is of most importance. \nInfluencing factors appear to have completely different effects for both groups. While pension and social care considerations work positively to attract US graduates to the EU, it works negatively in the other direction. Immigration regulations and language drive EU graduates towards the US. The fear of losing contact with a professional network in the base country positively affects the decision of US graduates to move to the EU. The significance of these influencing factors contradicts slightly the conclusions drawn before where \"obtaining funding for own research\" seemed to be the most important. In this multivariate context, where other effects are corrected for, it is the practical considerations (pension and social care provisions, immigration regulations and language) that matter most when deciding to move from the EU to the US, while for the US graduates the fear of loss of contact with the network of the 'base' country plays an important role. This drives US graduates to the EU rather than to another region indicating that it might be easier to keep contact with the US network of researchers from the EU.

In the \"always private\" career path, the funding factor is of less importance and shares first place with \"quality and cost of accommodation\". In the \"private to public and back\" career path, \"language\" and \"quality and cost of accommodation\" play a slightly larger role than in any of the other paths.

For all fields of science \"obtaining funding for own research\" receives the highest importance when deciding to become mobile, with \"language\" and \"quality and cost of accommodation\" factors in second and third place. For all fields, pension and social care provisions and immigration regulations are of least importance. The same conclusions hold for the different educational backgrounds. In this section the aim is to compare both the motivations and the influencing factors driving European graduates to the US (group M1) versus those that are driving US graduates to the EU. From the tables above we saw that US graduates come to the EU primarily for personal and/or cultural reasons while European graduates move to the US primarily for professional reasons. With respect to the influencing factors, the summary tables did not show a strong difference between the two mobility groups, and overall, the influencing factors did not appear to be of importance. To test whether these results also hold in a multivariate setting (logit model), where we investigate the effect of the motivations and influencing factors together with the effect of other explanatory variables such as sex, age, educational background, employment background etc, we introduce the following dependent variables. For mobile EU graduates we tested what drives them towards the US rather than to another region by creating a variable equal to one if mobile EU graduates move to the US and zero if they move elsewhere. Similarly for US graduates, we define a variable equal to one for mobile US graduates who move to the EU and zero if they move elsewhere. We only consider mobile EU and US graduates in this analysis and test whether the factors driving EU graduates to the US and US graduates to the EU are the same. Table 7-9 shows the results of these regressions (using the statistical software package STATA). The column titled \"EUgrads\" analyses how the explanatory variables affect the decision of mobile EU graduates to choose the US over other regions, while the column titled \"USgrads\" analyses how the explanatory variables affect the decision of mobile US graduates to choose the EU over other regions. In columns 1and 2we include a set of explanatory variables including: gender, age (and age squared), educational background (highest degree earned, experience (in years since graduation), field of science, marital status, number of children, region of birth, the number of employers one has worked for, whether the researcher was also mobile as a student, and the type of position the respondent holds (whether the respondent is a PhD student, a post-doctoral researcher or has another position). In columns (3) and (4) we add the different motivations a person might have to become mobile and in (5) and (6) we add the influencing factors to see whether they have any power in explaining the mobility decision of a researcher. Generally, the set of explanatory factors seems to be better in explaining the decision of the US graduates to move to the EU than the other way around (regressions (2), (4) and (6) show a higher pseudo R\u00b2). The results in the first part of the table suggest that the variables that affect the choice of an EU graduate to move to the US and of a US graduate to move to the EU are somewhat similar but that some differences exist. 1. General variables (part 1 of Table 7 -9) Educational attainments, marital status, the number of children and the position a researcher holds do not seem to have an effect on the mobility direction for both groups. Even the field of science does not have an impact, though it appears that being in the medical and health sciences positively affects the decision of EU graduates to move to the US rather than elsewhere; however, this effect disappears when motivations and influencing factors are added (in columns (3) and (4) and (5) and (6)). Male researchers having graduated in the US appear to choose to move to another region as opposed to the EU. The years of experience (measured as \"years since graduation\") of the EU graduates seem to be positively correlated with moving to the US. Graduates of the EU who are born either in the EU15 or in the US prefer the US over any other region, while graduates of the US born in the EU15 prefer to move back to the EU. When the motivations and the influencing factors are added, the effect of returning to the region of one's birth disappears for US researchers who graduated in the EU. This suggests that for US born researchers it is not the attraction of the birth country that plays a role but motivations and external considerations (see further). For EU15-born researchers the birth region attraction exists also when taking into account motivations and influencing factors. For EU12 born researchers, there appears to be no birth region attraction. The number of employers a researcher has worked for appears to affect the choice of the US negatively (for EU graduates), while it appears to affect the choice of the EU positively (for US graduates). But the latter effect disappears when influencing factors are introduced."}, {"section_title": "8", "text": "EFFECTS OF MOBILITY"}, {"section_title": "Effects and experience abroad", "text": "When comparing the magnitude of the effects over different durations of stay, Table 8-2 shows that a researcher's professional experience has been most affected by mobility and the positive effect exists regardless of the duration of the stay (but with a small peak for a stay between two and three years).

The positive effect on access to an international network, however, seems to decrease after a stay of more than three years, while the effect on general recognition in the research community continues to exist after three years. The results in Table 8-2 suggest that it is not the number of countries where one has worked that matters, but only the fact that one is mobile. The positive effects of being mobile do not appear to change according to the number of countries one has worked in.

Moreover, the effects are nearly the same for all categories of number of employers. Thus, we can conclude that this characteristic does not impact the magnitude of the effects. Looking at career path, the ranking of the effects is the same over all career paths with a minor exception in the \"private to public and back\" path where the increase in the ability to work in the industrial sector is as important as obtaining general recognition in the research community.

With respect to the highest educational attainment, the largest difference lies in the effect of mobility on future job opportunities in the previous country of residence. This effect is quite a bit larger for researchers with a graduate degree than for those with a postgraduate degree. On the other hand, for the effect of mobility on publication output, the opposite holds true, the effect is larger if the researcher has a postgraduate degree. "}, {"section_title": "Overall effects of mobility", "text": "The questionnaire also included a question on the overall effects of mobility both on a researcher's career and on his or her personal and family life. In total, the effect of mobility on the researcher's career is valued as positive to strongly positive and the effect of mobility on a researcher's personal and family life is valued slightly lower, although still positive. The positive effect on personal and family life is valued most in the group of researchers who move from the US to the EU. The career effects are highest for the group of researchers who moved from the EU to the US. For the researchers who moved from the US to the EU, the effects on the researcher's career are valued the same as the effects on personal and family life. Here we do find a correlation in the motivations that drive researchers to become mobile, mainly when personal and cultural factors play more of a role, the effects on personal and family life are stronger. Where professional motivations are most important, the effects on career are larger than the effects on personal and family life. For all categories, except the US to EU mobility group, the career effects are generally larger than the personal and family effects. As was suggested earlier, the overall effect on a researcher's career is valued most positively by those who stayed abroad between two and three years, although this group experiences the lowest effects on personal and family life. The strongest effects on researchers' careers can be found in the primarily public career paths (always public, public to private and back, private to public). In contrast, the strongest effects on personal and family life (characterized by a large difference compared to the other categories) are found in the always-private career path. The largest overall career effects can be found in the field of medical and health sciences, followed by the fields of engineering and technical sciences and agricultural sciences. The lowest effects are found in the social sciences. Career effects are more or less equal irrespective of whether the researchers have a postgraduate, graduate or undergraduate degree. "}, {"section_title": "Effects and motivations of mobility", "text": "Looking at the pair wise correlations between all possible motivations and effects shown in Table 8-6 we see that the strongest positive correlations can be found on the \"matching\" motivations and effects, for example the motivation for mobility to work with leading experts is most strongly correlated with the effect on access to an international network of professionals. Getting access to facilities and/or equipment is most strongly correlated with the effect on access to infrastructure and know-how, career progression goals with professional experience as researcher and access to international network of professionals. In general the correlation between professional motivations and effects is high whereas the correlation between personal or cultural motivations and effects is negative or not significant. The graphs in Figure 8-2 confirm that higher personal motivations correspond with lower overall career effects. The relationship between professional motivations and overall professional effects is somewhat more ambiguous. In general the results suggest that researchers can realize the expectations they have of being mobile.  "}, {"section_title": "Effects of mobility: does location matter?", "text": "In order to determine which variables have an influence on the effects of mobility and more specifically how the direction of mobility (measured by mobility group) and the motivations to become mobile affect the effects of being mobile, we include a multivariate analysis. We consider only the mobility groups M1 (EU to US) and M2 (US to EU) and M3 (other mobility) with other mobility as the base category. For each of the effects we run an ordered logistic regression, which is used to explain discrete variables where the different categories have a specific (decreasing or increasing) order. This is the case here as the respondents were asked to rate the effects from \"strongly decreased\" (value 1), \"decreased\" (value 2), \"no effect\" (value 3), to \"increased\" (value 4) and \"strongly increased\" (value 5). We present the results in Table 8-7. The first part contains the same general explanatory variables as were discussed before. The second part contains the effects of motivations and mobility direction (where M1 and M2 will be compared to M3).\nTaking the descriptive results one step further, we tried, by means of a multivariate analysis, to determine which variables have an influence on the effects of mobility, the direction of mobility and the motivations to become mobile. The effects of mobility appear to be consistently larger for researchers with a partner (married/cohabiting) than for single researchers, especially with respect to the overall effect that mobility has on personal and family life of the researcher. Mobile researchers with a partner seem to realize larger effects of mobility on personal life but also larger effects on their professional career. Policy measures decreasing the barriers of mobility and targeting researchers with family seem that can drive higher effects of mobility. Researchers born in the EU12 appear to see larger effects of mobility on their publication output, access to infrastructure and know-how and professional experience compared to researchers born in other regions. This may be explained by a relatively lower degree of integration of these countries into the broader scientific community/networks with more developed countries as well as by an overall lower level of infrastructure and know-how. Researchers with origin from EU12 countries seem to realize larger effects from mobility on their publication output, access to infrastructure and their professional experience. The finding that the types of motivations for mobility influence the type of the effects of mobility is confirmed here as well. This is especially the case where a motivation has a corresponding mobility effect: Between the \"access to facilities\" motivation and the \"access to infrastructure and know-how\" effect; between the \"working with star scientists\" motivation and the \"international network of professionals\" and \"professional experience\" effects, and between the \"personal and family\" or \"cultural interest\" motivations and overall personal effects. When we take into account the mobility group of the researchers, according to the effects that researches perceive, it seems that moving from the EU to the US is more beneficial professionally than moving from the US to the EU. This result clearly points out significant differences among the research environment in the EU and the US. As indicated previously (see section 10.2.7.1), the ranking of the mobility groups in terms of effects is confirmed by the multivariate analysis. That is, we see that the effects of moving from the EU to the US are higher than the effects of the control group (other mobility') which in turn shows higher effects than the US-to-EU mobility group. The research environment in the US seems more 'fertile' in the realization of positive effects from mobility of EU graduates than the research environment in the EU is for US graduates."}, {"section_title": "General effects", "text": "There are not so many consistent conclusions to be drawn from the general variables, the effects of which differ quite a lot with respect to the effect under consideration. However, some results are worthwhile mentioning. Having a partner (married or cohabiting) appears to have a positive influence on most of the effects (except for patent output, working in industry and job opportunities in previous country). Being born in the EU12 also appears to have more positive effects than being born in the other regions, at least for publication output, access to infrastructure and know-how and professional experience. For the fields of science, effects seem to be the most positive for Engineering and technical sciences. Researchers working for a public employer appear to reach higher outcomes in publication output and general recognition as a researcher than the researchers connected to a private employer. For the opportunities to work in industry it is the other way around."}, {"section_title": "Mobility direction", "text": "Lastly, we have a look at the differences in the effects by mobility group. The result is quite striking: the results suggest that moving from the EU to the US (M1) has much more positive effects than other types of mobility (including moving from the US to the EU) on nearly all possible effects of mobility (only for job opportunities in previous country) there is no difference). With respect to US to EU mobility, the effects appear to be significantly smaller than for the other types of mobility. Concluding, the results suggest that moving from the EU to the US has the most positive effects on professional outcomes, followed by other types of mobility and lastly, by moving from the US to the EU. It seems to be much more professionally beneficial to move from the EU to the US than the other way around. On top of the better results in professional life, moving from the EU to the US also has more positive effects on personal and family life of the researchers so on professional and personal domains alike the move from the EU to the US appears to be a better one.

We only consider the group of researchers who have been mobile from the EU to the US and back and those who have been mobile from the US to the EU and back. The respondents who returned to their region of graduation were required to indicate for a list of potential factors whether the factor was not important at all to extremely important in their decision to return. Of all researchers who have been mobile from the EU to the US, 52 percent returned to the EU (447 respondents). Of these, 94 percent were born in the EU. So returning to the EU is apparently strongly driven by the attraction of the birth region. Of those who did not return to the EU and stayed in the US, only ten percent were US born. Of the researchers who have been mobile from the US to the EU, 30 percent returned to the US (96 respondents). Of these 48 percent were born in the US, so in this case it is not birth region that necessarily motivates return. Based on the results in section 9.2.1 we would expect a lower percentage of researchers to return from the US to the EU, than from the EU to the US as it seems that researchers consider the US as having a better research environment compared to the EU (see Table 9-1). The fact that this is not the case suggests that there are other motivations driving researchers to become long-term mobile. Alternatively, it may suggest that the positive effects of mobility to the US can be reaped after a limited stay abroad. The results in Table 9-5 confirm that those who return to the EU after having been in the US do so because of personal/family reasons, the opposite of what has driven them towards the US. On the other hand, researchers who return to the US after having worked in the EU do so primarily because of career progression and financial reasons, also opposite to what has driven them towards the EU, and to a lesser extent because of personal reasons. In Figure A2.5 we provide a visualisation of the importance of the return factors, which show the percentages of researchers for whom a return reason was \"not important\" (combining the answers \"not important at all\" and \"not important\"), neutral or \"important\" (combining the answers \"important and \"extremely important\"). We see the differences between the EU-US and the US-EU mobile researchers very clearly. Personal and family reasons were important for nearly 70 percent of those returning to the EU from the US while this was the case for only 40 percent of those returning to the US. Financial motivations were important for less than 20 percent returning to the EU but important for more than half of the researchers returning to the US. Personal educational reasons were important for half of those returning to the US and career progression goals were important for as many as 60 percent. The radar graph in Figure 9-2 clearly shows the difference in return motivations for both groups. Personal/family and cultural motivations weigh on average stronger in the decision for EU graduates to return to the EU after having been in the US, while professional and financial reasons affect the decision of US graduates who have been mobile to the EU, to return to the US. Source: MORE extra -EU survey 9.3.2 Return and experience abroad Table 9-6 gives an overview of the return motivations by duration of the latest stay. Personal motivations are the most important in driving EU graduates back to the EU after having been in the US, irrespective of the duration of the stay, but for short stays and stays between two and three years, the personal motive plays an important role in driving researchers back to the EU. Also for researchers re-turning to the US, career progression and financial motivations are most strongly pronounced after short durations and slightly less so after durations of more than three years. There are, unfortunately, too few observations returning from the EU back to the US to conclude anything on the duration between one and three years. Source: MORE extra -EU survey; Cases were the number of respondents is ten or below are omitted. Table 9-7 shows that the personal motivations are stronger for EU return mobility than for US return mobility for all fields of science. For engineering and technical science they are the strongest and even the sole reason for returning back to the EU. The financial motivation is the most important motivation for researchers in social sciences and humanities to move back to the US while career progression goals are the most important motive for researchers in the natural sciences to move back to the US. There are too few observations to be able to draw conclusions on engineering and technical sciences, medical and health sciences and agricultural sciences.

Here we only consider the group of researchers who have been mobile from the EU to the US and stayed and those who have been mobile from the US to the EU and stayed. These respondents were also required to indicate on the same list of possible factors whether the factor was not important at all to extremely important in their decision to stay. It is the mirror image of the group of researchers who did return to their region of graduation and we expect the results to behave as such. In total there are 645 respondents who decided not to return consisting of 420 who did not return to the EU after having visited/worked in the US and 225 who did not return to the US after having visited/worked in EU. Table 9-8 shows, as expected, that for EU graduates who stay in the US, career progression and salary reasons are the most important, while personal reasons are much less important. For graduates from the US who remained in the EU, personal motivations were the key reason to stay with other reasons on average much less important. The reasons to stay correspond well with the motivations to become mobile and are the opposite of the reasons to return. This is clearly visu-alised in Figure 9-3. Also the bar graphs in Figure A2.6 (showing the percentages of researchers who find a no return reason important, neutral or not important) show clearly the similarity with Figure A2.1 (showing the percentages of researchers who find a mobility motivation important, neutral or not important). The only strong difference we see is in the importance of personal educational reasons for EU-US mobile researchers: 80 percent considered this as an important reason to become mobile from the EU to the US while it is only important for around 25 percent of those staying in the US (not returning to the EU).  Table 9-9 shows that for researchers moving from the US to the EU and staying there, personal motivation is the only truly important factor for all durations of the latest stay, with the strength of the motivation increasing with the length of the stay. With respect to staying in the US for EU graduates, however, the picture is not the same over all durations of stay. While career progression reasons are the first consideration for all durations, the financial reasons become important for longer term stays of two years or more. For short-term stays of less than a year the personal motive is the most important factor for staying in the US.

The bar graphs in Figure A2.7 which show the percentages of researchers who find a reason important, neutral or not important for moving or not moving to the EU, confirm the primary importance of personal and family reasons for moving to the EU (nearly 70 percent considers this as important to extremely important) and the second place of career progression goals (considered important by around half of the researchers) for moving to the EU while these two motivations share the same importance for not moving to the EU (around half the researchers consider the reasons important). Financial considerations appear less important for moving than for not moving to the EU (20 versus 40 percent respectively of the researchers considers this as important) so financial considerations play rather in the disadvantage of the EU to attract non-EU educated researchers (motivating researchers to return to the US or not to move to the EU from third countries)."}, {"section_title": "No return and education", "text": "With respect to the researchers' field of science, the general picture is confirmed in all fields.

Other reasons do not seem important except for the personal education/research agenda which comes as a third reason for moving to the EU if a researcher has not worked in many different countries (zero to one). Generally the motivations to move to the EU appear to be decreasing in strength as the researcher has worked in more countries.  Table 9-13 indicates, for all fields of science the most important reason to move to the EU from other countries is personal motivations followed by career progression goals. For humanities, however, the order is reversed. This is also the case for medical and health sciences and for natural sciences, although the difference is not so large in the latter field. Generally we can conclude that personal motivations and career progression goals are motivating other country researchers from all fields both to move and not to move to the EU. We can draw a similar conclusion by highest educational attainment. Personal motivations are the most important in both directions followed by career progression goals. The motivations are slightly lower for the group who did not move to the EU. According to the position a researcher holds, we do observe some differences, however. While post-doctoral researcher and \"other\" positions follow the general conclusion, PhD students show a different picture. First, we find a third reason for mobility to or away from the EU and second, reasons appear to be stronger in strength. Moving to the EU from other countries is strongly driven by career progression goals, personal motivations and personal education and research agenda and these motivations are higher in strength for PhDs than for others.

In this section we present the ten countries that were mentioned most by the total sample, the mobile versus non mobile groups and the four mobility groups, in order of their popularity. Additionally, we group the countries into regions (EU15, EU12, US, other) and do the same exercise. While drawing conclusions, it has to be kept in mind that these results might be heavily biased towards birth country or region and/or towards resident country or region. With more than half of the sample (55%) born in the EU15 and 50 percent currently residing in the EU15 and 30 percent currently residing in the US (16% were born in the US) we expect a strong response for these regions. Table 9-14 shows that the US is by far the preferred country as one in four respondents answer that the US is the most attractive country in terms of future mobility. It is followed by the UK, Germany and France. Next in line are mostly EU15 countries with the exceptions of Australia as the sixth and Canada as the eight most popular countries. With respect to the US we can hardly speak of a birth region bias as only 11 percent of those born in the US have mentioned it as their most popular country in terms of future mobility. Of course, given that 82 percent of those born in the US also reside there and then an additional 11 percent who considers it the most attractive in terms of potential future mobility that does not leave many US born researchers who are not now or in the future contemplating residing in the US. So there might be a strong birth country attraction for the US, which also scores high on professional terms. It is nearly always the same ten countries that appear in the top ten with a different weight for the two first (US and UK) according to mobility type. The US appears slightly more attractive to mobile researchers than to the non-mobile researchers. Not unexpectedly, it is the most attractive region for more than one third of the M1 mobility researchers (see Table 9-17).  When the countries are combined into regions, we see a different picture (see Table 9-16 and Table 9-17). The EU15 appears to be the most attractive region for researchers, especially for the non-mobile ones. For the latter group, the US comes in at the third place as a potential region of future mobility. What is consistent over all groups is the low attraction of the EU12 countries.   Table 9-18 shows that most respondents have mentioned places where they have been on a research visit or worked before. For the US, this is as high as 78 percent while it is lowest for Australia with only 52 percent who have been there on a work related stay. In anticipating going on a research visit to the country that was mentioned, the large majority was positive, on average 82 percent were anticipating a visit to his/her most likely country of future mobility. This percentage is highest for both the US and Australia, with respectively the highest and lowest percentage of visits in the past. The percentage of respondents who are anticipating employment in their most attractive country is much lower than those who anticipate going there on a research visit. Switzerland and Canada appear to be the most attractive in seeking employment as 70 and 63 percent respectively of those who answered this country also anticipate seeking employment there.

For all groups \"funding\" and \"research\" jump out as the most mentioned keywords. Obviously, \"research\" can capture many things such as research agenda, freedom in research, doing research rather than teaching, etc. Therefore this keyword is rather difficult to interpret. For the non-mobility group and the US to EU mobility group \"colleagues\" were also mentioned quite consistently which is less true for the EU to US mobility group.

Although the survey was designed to target broader groups, the main focus has remained in analysing the mobility of researchers between the EU and the US. Since the groups of researchers targeted by this survey are not considered representative groups, some indication of the findings of USbased surveys on EU researchers working in the US can provide a general picture which can be compared to the findings of the current extra-EU survey on mobility of researchers. Therefore, the first chapters of this report provide some facts from the National Survey of College Graduates in the US (NSCG). The 2003 NSCG was drawn from those residing in the United States on October 1, 2003 or residing abroad as U.S. military personnel. However, the NSCG has one major drawback. Since the base sample of the NSCG is only refreshed once every ten-years, there are gaps in our knowledge of how the workforce is changing over the decade between the decennial censuses. Therefore, we are likely to undercount the number of scientists and engineers who are in the United States on temporary visas. For example, the 2003 NSCG does not include immigrants with only degrees earned abroad if they came to the U.S after April 1, 2000. The primary objective of working with the NSCG has been to gauge the magnitude of EU-migrants in the United States as of 2003, disaggregated by field of study, highest degree, country of birth and country of highest degree. Once this group of immigrants was identified, their motivation for coming to the U.S. and the role they play in the U.S. scientific community were investigated. The focus for this report has been look at the 2003 NSCG survey of recent adult migrants in the U.S who had been trained in S&E fields and had emigrated, on initial visas for a period of six months or longer, to the U.S. as adults since 1989, and who were now employed in S&E occupations. This is the 'recent cohort' of adult migrants trained in S&E fields and occupied in S&E fields in 2003 to which this exercise for the purposes of this report has been based. The following main findings and conclusions that can be drawn from this exercise: \u2022 This recent cohort of adult migrants represented over 50% of all adult migrants educated in science and engineering who were now employed in S&E occupations in 2003. \u2022 For the recent cohort of EU27 migrants, the top three \"first\" reasons for coming to the U.S. were o job or economic opportunities, o educational opportunities, and o the scientific or professional infrastructure. \u2022 These same reasons were also the second most important EU27 migrants gave for their move to the U.S. \u2022 We also discovered that EU27 migrants tend to be employed o less often than migrants from other countries in the business/industry sector, but o more often than migrants from other countries in the higher education, government and other education sectors. \u2022 EU27 migrants were overrepresented relative to recent migrants from other countries in terms of devoting time towards performing basic research, applied research and \"other\" work activities. On the other hand, EU27 migrants spend less time than other migrants doing development, design or computer applications. 10.2 Results from the Extra-EU mobility survey 10.2.1 Design of the survey and main groups 10.2.1.1 Sampling Although the aim of this study was initially the design of a pilot study for the analysis of the motives and stay-rates of EU researchers going to the US, the present study on the extra-EU mobility is linked to a survey in which there are two main target groups and two additional ones: \u2022 Group M1 (EU-US mobile): EU researchers (researchers who have received their highest degree in the EU) and have worked or are currently working in the US. \u2022 Group M2 (US-EU mobile): US researchers (researchers who have received their highest degree in the US) and have worked or are currently working in the EU. \u2022 Group M3: Researchers who have been mobile after receiving highest degree but do not belong neither to group M1 nor to group M2. \u2022 Group M4: Researchers who have not been mobile after receiving highest degree. For the main groups of researchers, EU-US mobile and US-EU mobile, as well as for the additional two groups, the population of researchers is not known. Therefore, not only can the survey not be representative but, also, we had to rely on convenience sampling in order to approach researchers who would potentially belong to one of these groups. Two methods of sampling were used: -Web-based search where we have specified the criteria for which email addresses of researchers will be searched on the web More details on the precise methods of sampling used are provided in Section 3.4. The results of this survey can therefore not be generalised for the overall population."}, {"section_title": "Questionnaire", "text": "The questionnaire contains two main parts.

We focused on seven main factors as motivations which can be grouped under two main categories, the personal motivations, those related to person-specific preferences, and the professional motivations, those related to professional objectives and goals.

There, it was clear that for researchers working in the public sector the main motives to move abroad or not are based on their ambition to progress their career further and to work with leading experts in their field of research."}, {"section_title": "EU-US mobile vs. US-EU mobile researchers", "text": "The survey results indicate that researchers who have been mobile from the EU to the US have stronger professional motivations to move to the US while researchers who move from the US to the EU have stronger personal/cultural motivations. This implies that EU-based researchers have higher incentives to move to the US in order to fulfil their professional ambitions than their US-based colleagues moving to the EU. Conversely, US-based researchers assign larger importance to personal factors and getting acquainted with the culture in a EU country when considering moving to the EU. In more detail, around 80 percent of the EU-US mobile researcher considers career progression goals important for moving and the same percentage for personal education/research agenda. More than 70 percent of the EU-US mobile researchers answered that \"prospects to work with leading experts\" was an important motivation. The top-3 looks slightly different for US-EU mobile researchers (in terms of percentage of researchers finding the motivation important to extremely important): More than 60 percent considers personal education/research agenda important to extremely important, followed by around 60 percent who considers personal and family reasons important to extremely important and around 55 percent who considers career progression goals as important to extremely important in the decision to move to the EU. While cultural interest is the least important motivation to move from the EU to the US, it is the fourth most important for moving to the EU in terms of percentage of researchers considering it an important to extremely important motivation. -EU-US mobile (M1) researchers tend to have stronger professional motivations for their mobility to the US. -US-EU mobile (M2) researchers tend to have stronger personal and cultural motivations for their mobility to the EU.\nEven though none of the practical-related factors (except for \"language\") seem to be as significant as the research-related factors, most of these factors seem to play a stronger role in US-EU mobility than the other way around. However, among those, language is more of an issue for the mobile group moving from the EU to US rather than for the group moving from the US to the EU. The fact that English is broadly spoken as a foreign language within the research environments of most of EU countries, including those where English is not the official language, seems to reduce the significance of this factor for the US-based researchers considering to move to the EU. Researchers moving from the US to the EU seem to attach higher importance to pension and social-care provisions while those moving from the EU to the US look to immigration regulations, work permission for partner, adequate schools for children and quality/cost of accommodation. We can relate this to the previous result that US-EU mobile researchers tend to attach lower importance in professional-related motivations and higher importance in personal/cultural-related motivations than EU-US mobile researchers. This indicates that for EU-US researchers, for whom mainly professionally related factors drive mobility, the 'threshold' above which practical influencing factors start becoming important is rather lower compared to the threshold level of US-EU mobility. When additional factors are taken into account the practical factors are not to be significant for EU-US mobility. Drivers of mobility and the 'tolerance level' to practical difficulties (other things equal): -Researchers driven abroad largely by professional factors (EU-US mobile) tend to have a higher 'tolerance level' against practical difficulties and find practical influencing factors of mobility as less important. -Researchers driven abroad largely by personal/cultural factors (US-EU mobile) seem to have lower 'tolerance levels' to practical problems: their threshold above which practical influencing factors (immigration regulations, accommodation, etc.) start becoming important is lower."}, {"section_title": "Mobile vs immobile researchers", "text": "Among the overall mobile versus immobile groups of researchers, we find that, in general, professional factors as (de-)motivations for mobility play a less important role in the decision not to become mobile than in the decision to become mobile. For researchers who have already been mobile, professional factors seem to have been an important motivation to work abroad; However, for researchers who do not become mobile professional factors are not the driving force for their decision not to move abroad. Therefore, personal reasons appear more important in dissuading a researcher to move to another country for work. However, 'career progression goals' form an exception, as this type of professional motivation is the second most important reason not to move abroad. This could be the case for researchers who fear the loss of their professional network contacts because when their intention is to eventually return to their home country. Professional motives mainly drive mobility, while personal factors mainly drive immobility.\nIn general most of the external influencing factors of mobility are not important for researchers and their decisions regarding mobility. 'Obtaining funding for own research' seems to be important when one considers the decision to move abroad. There appears to be a significant difference in the importance that mobile vs. non-mobile researchers assign to this factor. Obtaining funding seems an external factor which is more important for immobile researchers than for mobile ones: More than half of the immobile researchers have mentioned it as an important to extremely important influencing factor. Not being able to obtain funding for research appears therefore to be an important dissuading factor of mobility."}, {"section_title": "Experience abroad", "text": "Professional motivations in general do not seem to differ significantly over the duration of stay when this is less than 3 years. However, professional motivations (excluding financial motivations) become less important as the duration of stay increases to longer than 3 years. Additionally, for those stays of more than 3 years, personal and family factors are more important as drivers for mobility. In the cases where the researcher moves to a country mainly driven by a personal or family-related factor (e.g. to follow spouse, to move back to the country of his/her family, etc.) then these reasons are likely to have a more long-term effect and result in long-term mobility. On the other hand, cultural motivations decrease in importance for longer stays. Researchers, who are particularly interested in getting acquainted with a culture of a country as a reason to become mobile, fulfil this objective after a relatively short-term stay. These people can also be expected to be interested to move to another country for a short visit. Although professional motivations, in general, seem to be less important the longer the stay abroad, financial motivations are an exception. Financial incentives do not seem to play a very important role as a motivation to move abroad, but, gains in importance the longer the stay of the mobile researcher. The longer the stay abroad, \u2026 the less important the professional motivations (except for financial ones) are as factors driving mobility; the less unimportant the financial motivations are as factors driving mobility; the more important personal motivations are as factors driving mobility; the less important culture-related motivations are as factors driving mobility. Researchers who have not been mobile or have moved to only one country abroad tend to assign higher importance to personal/family factors as drivers of mobility/immobility. It is reasonable to expect that researchers, who are driven by personal/family factors, tend to assign high importance to this motivation for the specific country in which they have particular personal or family factors. Professional motivations are increasingly important for researchers who have worked in up to 3 countries. A larger number of countries visited to work as researcher reduce the importance of professional motivations as driver to work abroad. It can be expected that researchers assign high importance to professional factors as drivers to work abroad in a limited set of specific countries. In these countries they expect to find the infrastructure, network, and expertise that can increase their qualities as researchers. Visits to more than 3 countries are increasingly driven by other personal, family or cultural related factors.\nFor stays as a mobile researcher shorter than 2 years, none of the external influencing factors examined appears to be important. As the duration of stay increases, the importance that researchers assign to most of the factors increases, most notably the 'obtaining funding for own research' factor. Ability to obtain the financial means to do one's own research is also increasingly important for longer durations of stay abroad. We can speculate that access to funding is easier for shorter stays thus resulting in lower scores on the significance of this factor for short durations, but as the duration of stay increases, funding is not obtained as easily and thus the significance of this factor increases.\nThe highest effects for nearly all topics examined are reported by researchers who have been mobile between two and three years and sometimes for more than three years. The effects on publication and patent output increase along with an increase in the duration of stay, with the highest scores reported for durations of mobility of more than 3 years. This can be partly explained from the fact that publications and patents developed during the mobility period, or any other period, need more time to be realised. The effect on the ability to work in the industrial sector (for the importance of this effect compared to the other effects see section 8.2.1, Table 8-1) varies the least among groups of respondents with different durations of their mobility stay. This seems logical as the ability to find work in the industrial sector seems unrelated to the time researchers spend in a given location but rather related to the specific characteristics of the location in terms of the existence of a local business sector related to the field of research."}, {"section_title": "Career paths and educational background", "text": "The top 3 factors, personal education and research agenda, career progression goals and prospects to work with leading experts, are those with consistently high scores of importance for all career paths as (de-) motivations for mobility (e.g. worked only in public sector, worked only in private sector, worked in private sector, then moves to private and beck, etc.). 'Getting access to facilities and equipment' is also an important motivation to work abroad, but much more for the researchers who have worked mainly in the public sector than for mainly in the private sector. This can be explained by the higher possibility of finding significant differences in terms of availability of research infrastructures among different countries in the public sector rather than in the private sector. Similarly, the prospect to work with \"star\" scientists is a factor driving mobility which is more important among the researchers working in the public sector than for those working on the private sector. For researchers working in academia and public research institutions direct research output is more crucial for their future career than it is for their colleagues working on the private sector. Working with \"star\" scientists can have significant impact on the research output of researchers working in the public sector and it can be expected that this is less relevant for researchers working in the private sector. Among researchers with different educational background, according to science field of their highest educational attainment, these same three factors are the top motivations to work abroad. The financial motivation is stronger for researchers who graduated within with engineering and technical science degrees. An explanation for this is that in these fields wages can be very attractive, especially for researchers working in the in-dustry sector. With the possibility of working abroad at a high salary these researchers are thus increasingly interested in the wage they receive when considering mobility.\nWhen distinguishing among the career path that the researchers have followed we find that the same pattern is followed with no striking differences among the different groups. Again, 'obtaining funding for own research' seems the most important influencing factor of mobility; However, this factor appears less important in influencing mobility for researchers who work in the private sector, because when applying for a position in the private sector, having access to funding is easier. Among researchers with different educational backgrounds no particular differences exist in the importance assigned to the different external influencing factors other than the general picture described above. 10.2.6.5 Mobile to the US or to the EU: do drivers matter? This report has tried to shed light on the differences among the motivations and the influencing factors driving EU graduates to the US (group M1) versus those that are driving US graduates to the EU (group M2). The previous discussion has already indicated that US graduates come to the EU for personal and/or cultural reasons while EU graduates move to the US for professional reasons. With respect to the influencing factors we did not find a strong difference between the two mobility groups and overall the influencing factors were not very important. In terms of logistic analysis, we examined the factors that affect the decision of EU graduates to move to the US compared to any other destination country, as well as the motives of US graduates to move to the EU compared to any other region. Years of experience (measured as \"years since graduation\") seem to have a positive relationship with the probability that EU graduates move to the US rather than any other region; however, the converse is not true. It seems that the US attracts EU researchers at the later stage of their career while the same cannot be said for the US graduates moving to the EU. EU graduates who are born either in the EU15 or in the US prefer to move to the US over another region. However, when the motivation variables are added, the effect of returning to the country where one is born disappears for the EU graduates born in the US; This suggests that it is not the attraction of the birth country that plays a role but other professional motivations. On the other hand, US graduates born in the EU15 prefer to move back to the EU while those born in the US would rather move to another region. Years of experience seem to have a positive relationship with the probability that EU graduates move to the US rather than any other region. The EU seems to attract EU-born US graduates back mainly because of birth-return mobility. The multivariate analysis confirms the findings of the descriptive analysis. We concluded that: -Personal and family factors seem to drive US graduates to the EU while this does not seem to be the case for EU graduates. -Career progression goals seem to drive EU graduates to the US while they do not have a significant effect in the other direction (for US-EU mobile). In addition, the multivariate analysis indicates that that the possibility of US graduates moving to the EU rather than to another region increases the more driven the researchers are to work with \"star\" scientists. So, although professional motivations seem to attract US graduates to the EU to a lesser extent than EU graduates to the US, \"star\" scientists seem to be a significant factor of mobility both in the US and in the EU. When introducing multivariate analysis, combining the effects of both motivations and external factors on mobility, we see that practical considerations are an important determination for moving from the EU to the US. For the US graduates, the fear of loss of contact with the network of the home country plays an important role. This drives US graduates to the EU rather than to another region. This indicates that it might be easier for a US graduate to keep contact with the US when moving to the EU rather than when moving to another region. Although professional motives seem to drive EU graduates to the US rather than US graduates to the EU, \"star\" scientists are attractiveness factors of mobility both for the US as for the EU as location to do research."}, {"section_title": "Factors influencing mobility", "text": "This survey examined the importance of specific factors that influenced the final mobility decision. The idea behind this is that there are factors which motivate or de-motivate researchers to become mobile; However, for those who have considered mobility there are external factors which may play an important role in the decision to actually move. The external factors that were considered are: In general, for all mobility groups and the non-mobile group, the influencing factors appear not to have played a significant role in the decision to become mobile. This suggests that the true reasons for being mobile or not mobile lie in the motivational part. However, when introducing multivariate analysis we see that influencing factors play a more significant role. The external factor which appears to affect the decision to become mobile most is obtaining funding for own research, followed by language, and quality and cost of accommodation. However the latter two factors appear to be only fairly important. This result confirms the opinions expressed during the exploratory interviews where most of the interviewees indicated that finding the resources to fund their mobility move is an important influencing factor."}, {"section_title": "Effects of mobility", "text": "The survey also investigates the perceived effects of mobility on the individual researchers. The respondents were asked to evaluate the benefits that they have experienced due to being mobile abroad in each of the following: We should note that the effects reported are not necessarily the actual effects but the perceived effects. The average scores indicate that the effects have been positive on all aspects for all mobility groups, with a slight deviation for the US-EU mobility group. The strongest effects have been reported on the network of indirect effects: -Professional experience as a researcher, -Access to an international network of professionals and -General recognition in the research community. Additionally the researchers were asked to rank the overall effects they have realised on their professional career as researcher and on their personal and family life. 10.2.7.1 EU-US mobile vs. US-EU mobile researchers A comparison of the reported effects among the three mobility groups indicates that the overall ranking of the three mobility groups in terms of perceived effects realised is the following: Rank 1: EU researchers mobile to the US Rank 2: Mobility with home-destination combination different from EU-US and from US-EU ('other' mobility group) Rank 3: US researchers mobile to the EU -Overall, mobility contributes mainly to network-related and more indirect effects on researchers' career. -Mobility affects more positively the career of EU researchers mobile in the US than that of US researchers mobile in the EU. Researchers having been mobile from the EU to the US seem to experience the largest positive effects. On the other hand, for researchers having been mobile from the US to the EU some effects are neutral or only fairly positive. Researchers from both groups seem to agree that the larger effects of mobility are on network or indirect effects. Professional experience, the access to an international network of researchers and the general recognition in the research community are consistently the three highest ranked effects across all groups. While EU-US researchers do not seem to experience negative effects (the percentages that have answered \"decreased\" on respective effects were very small), negative effects are more likely to exist for the US-EU mobile researchers(with sometimes up to 30 percent of the researchers claiming a \"decreasing\" effect on the issue presented. Especially with respect to patent output, ability to work in the industrial sector and future job opportunities in the country where one previously worked US-EU mobile researchers seem to experience negative effects. On average, researchers mobile from the US to the EU have experienced no effects on patent output, on their ability to work in the industrial sector, or on their future opportunities in the US as a result of their mobility to the EU. Also for the EU-US mobile researchers the effects on these three issues were smallest on average (and showing the highest percentages who experienced a \"decreasing\" effect). That is, the same three effects rank lowest for the EU to US mobile group, looking at averages as well as looking at percentages who mention that there was a decreasing effect. So for the EU-US researchers, the effects of these three issues were the least positive (but still positive on average) and recorded the highest percentages with decreased effects. Looking to the overall effects on career and personal/family life, effects on career are higher for the EU-US mobile group than for the US-EU mobile group. At the same time, the effects on personal and family life seem to be higher for the US-EU mobility group compared to the EU-US group. Thus, when we compare this with the results on the motivations across the different groups, we see that, researchers, who are motivated with respect to specific targets, tend to achieve their targets: -For EU to US mobile researchers, professional motivations are more significant and professional effects are larger; and -For US to EU mobile researchers personal motivations are more significant and personal and family effects are larger. When it comes to the experiences acquired from mobility, expectations seem to be realized. -Researchers driven mainly by professional reasons to become mobile tend to report higher effects on their career. -Researchers driven mainly by personal reasons to become mobile tend to report higher effects on their personal and family life."}, {"section_title": "Research environment as an attractiveness factor of researchers", "text": "The survey looked further into the return mobility of the mobile researchers as well as on their opinion about how EU compares to other parts of the world to do research."}, {"section_title": "Comparison of research environment", "text": "In all cases and among all mobility groups, the EU scores on average lower than the US and other countries as an environment to work as researcher (for details see 9.2, Table 9-1). This is especially true when it comes to the effect of location where one works as 'reference' for one's career, and also in terms of collaboration with top-class researchers. We should note, that these results do not only stem from those researchers whose opinion is based on actual experience in both countries but also from those who may not have been in the EU to work and instead are giving opinions based on perceptions. Some additional results indicate differences in the scores given by researchers in the various fields of science, although for all factors the US outscores the EU: -For medical and health sciences US generally comes out as a better research environment compared to the EU, while for humanities, even though the numbers still in favour the US the result is somewhat milder. -Researchers in engineering and technical sciences agree most with the proposition on better remunerative schemes in the US. -Researchers in social sciences tend to agree the strongest that working in the US is better for one's career. 10.2.8.2 Decision to return vs. to stay at 'home' country Analysing the return mobility of the two main target groups, we see that: \u2022 52% of the EU graduates who have been mobile in the US have returned to the EU: o 94% of these graduates were born in the EU. o Of those who did not return to the EU and stayed in the US, only 2% were US-born. \u2022 On the other hand, 30% of the US graduates who have been mobile in the EU have returned to the US: o 48% of these graduates were born in the US. o Of those who did not return to the US and stayed in the EU, 44% were EU-born. For the EU-US mobile researchers, return-mobility is driven strongly by the region of birth, while this does not seem to be as strong for the group of the US-EU mobile researchers. Returning to the US from the EU is mainly driven by professional and financial reasons while returning to the EU from the US is mainly driven by personal and cultural reasons (for more details see section 9.3.1). -Personal motivations are stronger in driving EU graduates back to the EU than they are in driving US graduates back to the US, irrespective of the duration of stay. -Personal motivations are more important in the decision of EU graduates to return to the EU than in the decision of US graduates to return to the US. For engineering and technical sciences they even appear to be the sole reason for moving back to the EU. -Financial reasons are the most important factors for researchers in humanities and social sciences to move back to the US, while career progression is the most important factor in driving researchers in natural sciences back to the US. Professional motivations are the main reasons why EU graduates go to the US but it is mainly personal reasons that drive them back to the EU. On the other hand, personal motivations are the main reasons why US graduates go to the EU but it is mainly professional reasons that drive them back to the US. When analysing the responses of people who have stayed in either the EU or the US (see section 9.4.1), we find that although the reasons to return to the region of graduation are the opposite of the motivations to become mobile, the reasons to stay are the same as the motivations to become mobile. It is mainly professional and financial reasons that motivate EU graduates to stay in the US and mainly personal reasons that motivate US graduates to stay in the EU. -Career progression reasons seem to be most important to motivate researchers to stay in the US for all durations of stay. -Financial motives do not play a role in shorter-term stays (shorter than two years) and only become important for longer term stays (stays of more than two years). 10.2.8.3 Decision to move to the EU or not for mobile researchers other than M1 and M2 When considering the decision of mobile researchers not belonging to the EU-US or the US-EU groups, i.e. those belonging to group M3, who have been mobile in a non-EU country to move to the EU or not, we see that: -While personal reasons are the most important reason both for moving and not moving to the EU from third countries, they play a slightly stronger role in moving to the EU. -Career progression reasons are another motivation to move or not move to the EU after being mobile in a non-EU country. -PhD students show a different picture: an additional reason both for moving and not moving to the EU after being mobile in a non-EU country, is \"personal education and research agenda\"."}, {"section_title": "Future mobility 'hotspots'", "text": "Taking into account all respondents' opinions independently of their mobility group, the US seems to be the country considered in which it is most attractive to do research.

The top-10 most attractive locations appear to be the following: "}, {"section_title": "Italy", "text": "The researchers who actually worked in the US have a stronger preference for this country. When aggregating the countries by geographic regions, we see that the EU15 appears to be the most attractive region; however we also observe that birthcountry attraction plays a role in this result as 55% of the sample is born in the EU15. Knowing which locations are most attractive as locations to work as researcher is a very important piece of information. However, this analysis can be more informative if complemented with information on which elements researchers consider to make a location attractive for research. The respondents were therefore asked to provide the three most important keywords describing their most attractive research environment. For all groups \"funding\" and \"research\" are the most often mentioned keywords. Obviously, \"research\" can capture many things such as research agenda, freedom in research, doing research rather than teaching, etc. Therefore this keyword is rather difficult to interpret. Funding seems an important characteristic of a research environment. \"Colleagues\" are an important characteristic especially for the respondents belonging to the non-mobility group as well as to the US-EU mobile group. \"Infrastructure\" is also often mentioned as an important characteristic of an attractive environment for research. This is mainly the case for the EU-US group as well as for the \"other\" mobility group, but it is not often mentioned in the US-EU group or the non-mobile group.
