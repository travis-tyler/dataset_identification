[{"section_title": "", "text": "Campylobacteriosis, the most common bacterial diarrheal illness in the United States, annually causes an estimated 1.3 million illnesses, 13 240 hospitalizations, and 119 deaths with a cost of approximately $1.7 billion in medical care and lost productivity [1, 2] . Campylobacter, the causative agent of campylobacteriosis, usually results in self-limited, mild-to-severe gastroenteritis, but can lead to invasive infections. Persons with campylobacteriosis are at increased risk for postinfection longterm complications including reactive arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) [3, 4] . Infection with the most commonly identified etiologic agent of GBS, Campylobacter jejuni, precedes paralysis in approximately 30% of patients [5] . Antimicrobial treatment is not required for mild, noninvasive infections; however, in severe or prolonged infections and during pregnancy, treatment can shorten illness duration and be life-saving [6, 7] . Erythromycin (a macrolide) is the preferred treatment, but ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) is often used empirically because of its broad spectrum of activity against enteric pathogens [6, 7] . Increasing resistance to both fluoroquinolone and macrolide agents has been reported in Campylobacter worldwide [6] .\nCampylobacter is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, usually through ingestion of contaminated food or water or through contact with animals or birds or environments contaminated by their feces [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Person-to-person transmission is uncommon and outbreaks are rare. Campylobacter data are reported regularly by sentinel sites to the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) [14] . Although FoodNet data indicate that campylobacteriosis incidence is increasing, FoodNet represents only 15% of the population. Because campylobacteriosis incidence varies widely by site, we examined the national picture by using multiple data sources, providing a significant update to the previous national campylobacteriosis analysis conducted >30 years ago [14] [15] [16] ."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Collection", "text": "We analyzed the epidemiology of Campylobacter-associated infections, outbreaks, and antimicrobial resistance in the United States by summarizing data during 2004-2012 from 4 surveillance systems: the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) [17] ; the National Outbreak Reporting System (NORS) [11] and antecedent outbreak reporting systems; the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) [7] ; and FoodNet [14] .\nNNDSS is a passive national surveillance system that collects demographic and geographic information on cases of nationally notifiable diseases and conditions [17] . Although campylobacteriosis did not become nationally notifiable until 2015, almost all states required reporting of cases to their health departments before 2015 and reported these cases to NNDSS [18] . We examined records of campylobacteriosis reported to NNDSS during 2004-2012 and verified data directly with individual states to improve data completeness and accuracy. We also requested and received data from 12 states and the District of Columbia for years they collected data but did not report to NNDSS. Our final data set, comprised of NNDSS data supplemented with data from states and FoodNet, which we refer to as the national data set, includes all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\nNORS is a passive national surveillance system for investigated enteric disease outbreaks that collects data including etiology, vehicle, and number of illnesses and deaths. An outbreak is defined as \u22652 infections linked to a common source. Outbreaks of campylobacteriosis are investigated by health departments and reported through NORS, which integrates the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System and the Waterborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System [11] .\nNARMS is an isolate-based surveillance system that conducts antimicrobial susceptibility testing on enteric pathogens. For Campylobacter, NARMS conducts surveillance only in FoodNet sites, using a convenience sample of isolates for submission. FoodNet is a collaboration among the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 10 state health departments, the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS), and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FoodNet conducts active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed infections of 9 bacterial and parasitic pathogens transmitted commonly through food and for hemolytic uremic syndrome [15] . Since 2004, the FoodNet catchment area has included all or part of 10 states [15] .

Comparing data from 2004-2010 with the more recent years 2011-2012, resistance to ciprofloxacin increased among domestic (13.0% vs 17.0%) infections, and resistance to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin was more commonly travel-associated (60.2 vs 67.5% and 3.6% vs 6.8%, respectively) ( Table 2 )."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "Our analysis reveals broad increases in the incidence of Campylobacter infection across demographic groups and throughout the United States during 2004-2012. Campylobacteriosis incidence was highest in the West and lowest in the South but increased substantially during the study period across all regions. We also found consistently higher rates in rural counties than in metropolitan counties, but incidence increased across all types of counties. Our findings are consistent with the incidence increases and demographic patterns that FoodNet has described [1, 15, 16] . The overall annual IR of 11.4 per 100 000 is 16% lower than the rate reported from FoodNet, likely reflecting underreporting in NNDSS, which is a passive system [15] . It could also reflect true differences. Studies examining whether geographic differences in medical diagnostic practices or in levels of poultry contamination are associated with the observed variability in campylobacteriosis have not produced clear answers [20] [21] [22] [23] . Little information is available regarding the overall contribution of waterborne sources, especially untreated drinking water, to Campylobacter infections. Our data do not explain these geographic differences, but they do highlight the regions and demographic groups at greatest risk. Campylobacter has long been among the most common causes of bacterial diarrheal illness in the United States, so broad recent increases in incidence emphasize the need for effective control measures.\nThe demographic patterns we report both confirm and extend previous observations. Consistent with other studies, the highest incidence occurred among children aged <5 years and among males [16, 21, 24, 25] . However, in 3 states persons aged >60 years had the highest incidence of infection, which may reflect differences in geographical differences in exposures and risks of infection. Compared with non-Hispanics and whites, markedly higher rates occurred among Hispanics and American Indian or Alaska Native populations, respectively, across almost all age groups. Conversely, rates among blacks were lower. Some degree of protective immunity can be produced by exposure to Campylobacter [6] , so the age-related patterns we observe may reflect age-related exposures producing such immunity. Collection of standardized case exposure data could facilitate investigation of risk factors and transmission pathways [15] . The sex and race/ethnicity patterns for campylobacteriosis differ from those of other enteric infections, for example FoodNet data, indicate that Salmonella rates are higher in females than males, and highest in blacks compared with other races [15] .\nOur seasonality data reveal noteworthy patterns beyond the known summer seasonality of Campylobacter [26] . First, geographic areas and age groups with higher incidence had more pronounced summer peaks than those with lower incidence. Second, we observed a small but distinct January peak among age groups <30 years and in metropolitan counties.\nThird, over the study period we observed the highest seasonal increase in the spring. Finally, the spring/summer peak was substantially greater for outbreaks than for cases overall. These observations may be associated with seasonality of exposures to Campylobacter, although how precisely this might occur is as yet undetermined.\nCampylobacter outbreaks also increased 2-fold during the study period. This pattern contrasts with other enteric pathogens such as Salmonella, where the number of outbreaks was similar in 2004-2006 to 2010-2012 [27] . The majority of Campylobacter outbreaks are foodborne, with unpasteurized milk and poultry the most common vehicles. Studies in the United States and elsewhere have reported that poultry is an important outbreak vehicle and risk factor for sporadic infections and that chicken livers specifically may be an increasingly important vehicle [9, 10, 21, [28] [29] [30] . The dramatic increase in Campylobacter outbreaks associated with unpasteurized milk has been noted previously [31, 32] . This increase coincides with an increase in consumer demand for unpasteurized milk, which has led to changes in policies to reduce restrictions on the sale of unpasteurized milk in some states [31] . Waterborne outbreaks, although less common than foodborne outbreaks, tend to be larger, and have recently been associated with both contaminated drinking water and obstacle races [33] [34] [35] .\nChanges in antimicrobial resistance can fluctuate quickly; when comparing the 2 most recent years with 2004-2010, we found concerning trends in Campylobacter resistance to both ciprofloxacin and erythromycin. For ciprofloxacin, although the resistant proportion was highest for travel-associated infections, we found not only that most resistant infections were domestically acquired but also that the resistant proportion among domestically acquired infections increased over the study period. Although resistance was less common for erythromycin, both travel-related and domestically acquired resistant infections were reported, and the resistant proportion increased for travel-related infections. Ciprofloxacin-resistant campylobacteriosis increased rapidly after the approval of fluoroquinolones for use in poultry and has been shown to be associated with poultry consumption, findings that contributed to the withdrawal of the approval for poultry by the FDA [36] . Our findings echo global concerns about antimicrobial resistance across pathogens and agents and emphasize the need for effective stewardship of antimicrobial agents wherever they are used [37] . This study had limitations beyond those previously discussed. It is estimated that 30 Campylobacter illnesses occur for every culture-confirmed and reported illness, and our analysis included only culture-confirmed cases [1] . In FoodNet, the percentage of campylobacteriosis cases diagnosed by culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDTs) has increased from 8% in 2010 to 28% in 2015 [38, 39] . The increasing availability and rapid adoption of CIDTs is further decreasing the proportion of cases captured in current surveillance systems [38, 39] . Another limitation is that data regarding species of Campylobacter causing infections are collected by few states and are not reported to NNDSS. Lack of species data is unlikely to affect our results substantially because a large majority of infections are caused by C. jejuni. Nonetheless, seasonality, demographics, and risk factors for campylobacteriosis vary by species; therefore, we are unable to assess the extent to which our results are driven by differences in species causing infections among different areas or population subgroups [26, 40] .\nOur study highlights an urgent need for improved prevention and control of Campylobacter infection and outbreaks in the United States. Major food safety measures recently implemented hold promise. In 2011 the Food Safety Modernization Act granted FDA authority to regulate food facilities, establish standards for safe produce, recall contaminated foods, and oversee imported foods [41] . In 2016 USDA implemented the first pathogen reduction performance standards for chicken parts (former standards were for whole birds), microbial testing at a point closer to the final product at poultry facilities, and posting of individual companies' food safety performance online [42] . Monitoring the impact of these measures with surveillance data will be important to determine if additional measures are needed.\nCampylobacter infection is common worldwide, and multiple countries have taken innovative steps to control it. These interventions have recently involved pairing surveillance with advanced molecular techniques, for example, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole-genome sequencing. A notable example is New Zealand, where a common MLST subtype was linked to a specific poultry producer. Voluntary and regulatory interventions focused on poultry were implemented and were followed by a 54% decline in national campylobacteriosis incidence [43] . Whole-genome sequencing offers promise for the future; linking WGS data with exposure history data might facilitate rapid identification of exposures associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "Campylobacter is the most common cause of bacterial enteric infection in the United States, yet little national information has been available. These data provide baseline rates for monitoring change now that campylobacteriosis is a nationally notifiable disease and reveal several newly described aspects of Campylobacter epidemiology in the United States. The marked geographic variability seen in our analysis suggests that FoodNet sentinel surveillance, which is conducted in only 10 states, may not accurately reflect important aspects of Campylobacter epidemiology. Nonetheless, the age, race, and ethnicity-specific patterns we describe are also seen in FoodNet data alone. FoodNet sites collect standardized demographic, species, and exposure data for most reported Campylobacter cases. These data could be used as a comparison group to explore sources of infection among the groups identified in this study with the highest incidence or increasing incidence of infection. In addition, increasing antimicrobial resistance among both domestic and travel-associated infections reinforces the need for responsible antibiotic use in both humans and animals. Uptake of CIDTs threatens the utility of our surveillance systems, and strategies to incorporate advanced molecular diagnostics in routine surveillance are needed to maintain and improve surveillance for antimicrobial resistance, outbreaks, and the role of various Campylobacter species in human illness. Our findings also underscore the importance of standardizing national surveillance for campylobacteriosis, which is important in understanding the burden of infection, better describing geographic variations and differences among species, elucidating risk factors, and targeting prevention and control measures.
