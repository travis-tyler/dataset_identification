A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at: http:// adni.loni.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/ how_to_apply/ADNI_Acknowledgement_ List.pdf Background: Episodic memory impairment can be subdivided into two subtypes, encoding failure vs. retrieval deficit. We defined two subtypes of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) according to recognition performance on the memory test: aMCI with encoding failure or aMCI-E and aMCI with retrieval deficit or aMCI-R. We hypothesized that compared to aMCI-R, subjects with aMCI-E are more likely to convert to Alzheimer's disease, as encoding failure suggests that medial temporal lobes are affected early in the disease process. We also investigated whether aMCI-E can be a predictor for progression to AD. Methods: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, a total of 397 aMCI subjects were included. APOE genotype, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fluid biomarkers, and a set of neuropsychological measures were also collected. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were calculated to predict the conversion to AD dementia. The Spearman's rs test was used to measure the degree of correlation between aMCI subtypes and the prognostic factors for progression to AD. Results: Among the 397 subjects, 209 (52.6%) subjects were classified into aMCI-E and 188 (47.4%) into aMCI-R. One hundred two (48.8%) subjects with aMCI-E and 57 (30.3%) of those with aMCI-R progressed to AD (unadjusted odds ratio= 2.19 with 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45-3.31) over 3 years. However, when adjusted odds ratio by a logistic regression was calculated, probability value of aMCI-E disappeared with the odds of conversion by of 1.47 (95% CI 0.89-2.43). There were statistically significant correlations between aMCI-E subtype and MMSE, CDR Memory, RAVLT delayed recall, CSF biomarkers, and genotypes. Conclusions: This analysis did not show that aMCI-E is an independent prognostic factor to predict the progression to AD. However, this subtype significantly correlates with other prognostic factors for progression. This may suggest that aMCI-E might be a later stage of aMCI and aMCI-R an earlier stage which might be a better target than aMCI-E for therapeutic intervention. Further studies are needed to validate this conjecture."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), particularly, amnestic MCI (aMCI) has been identified as a precursor to AD. In ge neral, subjects with MCI convert to dementia at an annual rate in the range of 1015% [1] . Approximately 80% of aMCI patients progress to AD dementia within 6 years [2] . Predict ing who among a group of aMCI patients are most likely to further decline in cognition would enable clinicians and re searchers to identify individuals for early intervention, patient education, as well as the designing clinical trials. The list of risk factors for the progression from MCI to AD dementia include advanced age [35] , severity of cognitive impairment [6] , apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE \u03b54) carrier status [710] , struc tural and functional changes of brain [1116] , cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes [1719] , and positive amyloid imaging [20, 21] .\nThe medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures and frontal lobes generally play different, but complementary roles in ep isodic memory; encoding and retrieval respectively [22] . Since encoding failure with poor recognition is characteristic of memory impairment seen in AD, we hypothesized that aM CIE is more likely to progress to AD than aMCIR. Howev er, the value of aMCIE to predict the conversion to AD de mentia has rarely been studied. Thus far, only a few studies have investigated the clinical significance of these different patterns of memory impairment in aMCI according to rec ognition performance [23, 24] and their potential use to pre dict the progression to AD dementia [25] .\nIn this analysis, we divided aMCI into two subtypes accord ing to the recognition patterns. One is aMCI with poor en coding and poor retrieval (aMCI with encoding failure, aM CIE), and the other is aMCI with poor encoding but preserv ed recognition/retrieval (aMCI with retrieval deficit, aMCI R). We compared baseline characteristics including neuro psychological, genetic, CSF biomarkers, and conversion rate between two subgroups of aMCI and also investigated the re lation between aMCIE and the known prognostic factors for conversion to AD dementia."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained adniinfo.org [26, 27] .\nA total of 397 subjects with aMCI from the ADNI study were included in the current analysis.

Using a cut off of 1.0 S.D. did not change the probability value of aMCIE to predict progression to AD and only MMSE score and RA VLT delayed recall reliably remained statistically significant like analysis using a 1.5 S.D. cutoff.\nRabin et al. [25] characterized the relative ability of memory tests to predict the progression from aMCI to AD over follow up for 4 years. Although the small sample size made the in terpretation cautious regarding statistical power and general ization, logical memory recognition best predicted the pro gression to AD. In other words, this finding may indirectly imply that not all subjects with aMCIE convert to AD de mentia and aMCIR may also progress to AD dementia.\nIn contrast to our hypothesis, the current analysis did not reveal that aMCIE is an independent risk factor of progres sion to AD dementia although univariable analysis showed that odds ratio of aMCIE to predict progression is 2.19. But there were significant correlations between aMCIE and the severity of memory and global cognition, CSF biomarkers, and APOE \u03b54 genotype. This may imply that aMCIE itself is not as strong as other known factors to be a prognostic factor.\nAs aMCIE, age which is one of known risk factors of progres sion to AD dementia did not have prognostic value. This may be ascribed to younger age of aMCIE subjects than those with aMCIR.\nAs mentioned earlier, the ADNI is devoid of aMCI subjects with vascular risk factors as indicated in the inclusion criteria with a Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score\u2264 4. This may ac count for relative preservation of frontal executive function in aMCIR patients in this study. Because aMCI is a hetero geneous condition even in terms of course and etiology, ex cluding those subjects with vascular risk factors will limit the generalizability of the results from this analysis to the aMCI population.\nInterestingly, even in the current study which lacks vascular MCI subjects, 57 subjects (about 36%) among the 159 aMCI patients who progressed to AD dementia had aMCIR. This consolidates the earlier point that aMCIR is heterogeneous in terms of recognition performance on memory tests as well.\nThere have been debates regarding the progression of aMCI subtypes depending on the involvement of only memory func tion or other cognitive domains. Some evidence indicates that single domain aMCI places one at highest risk for con version to dementia [34, 35] "}]
