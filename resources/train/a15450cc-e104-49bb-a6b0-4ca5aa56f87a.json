[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Children with cognitive delay have been shown to have more behavior problems than typically developing children; however, few studies have investigated this relationship over time or among very young children.\nOur findings provide some of the first national, prospective evidence that having a cognitive delay may place children at risk for developing and maintaining behavior problems before school age. Early identification and intervention may improve outcomes for these children. abstract OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between cognitive delay (CD) and behavior problems between ages 9 months and 5 years, while adjusting for covariates related to CD.\nStudy, Birth Cohort (n = 8000). Children were classified as typically developing (TD) or as having resolved, newly developed, or persistent CD between 9 and 24 months, based on scores from the Bayley Short Form-Research Edition below or above the 10th percentile. Child behavior was measured by using the Infant/Toddler Symptom Checklist (ages 9 and 24 months) and the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales (ages 4 and 5 years); children in the top 10th percentile were considered to have a behavior problem. Hierarchical linear modeling estimated the effect of CD status on children' s behavioral trajectories, adjusted for confounders.\nRESULTS: CD resolved for 80.3% of children between 9 and 24 months. Behavior problems at 24 months were detected in 19.3%, 21.8%, and 35.5% of children with resolved, newly developed, and persistent CD, respectively, versus 13.0% of TD children. Behavior problems increased among children with CD over time, and more so among children with persistent CD. By age 5, children with persistent CD had behavior scores moderately (0.59 SD) higher than TD children.\nCONCLUSIONS: Behavior problems among children with CD are slightly higher at 9 months, clearly evident by 24 months, and increase as children move toward school age. Efforts to promote the earliest identification, evaluation, and service referral may be necessary to improve outcomes for these children.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Between 30% and 50% of children and adolescents with CD are estimated to develop mental health disorders, a risk nearly 3 times that of typically developing (TD) children. 2 Behavior problems with CD are associated with increased costs of care, 9 social isolation, 17 poor academic achievement, 17 parental stress, 7 and residential treatment placement. 17 Despite these clinical and societal costs, there are critical gaps in our knowledge about behavior problems among children with CD. Few studies have evaluated very young children with CD, focusing instead onschool-agedchildrenandadolescents. 2 Moreover, existing data on very young children are drawn predominantly from convenience samples, 7, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] limiting generalizability. We know of only 1 relevant study in a nationally representative sample. Emerson and Einfeld 16 reported that 2-to 3-year-old children living in the UK and Australia with developmental delays had more behavioral difficulties than their TD peers. However, differences in social, environmental, and health care resources may preclude generalization of that study to US populations.\nAdditionally, studies have mostly been cross-sectional. To our knowledge, only 2 longitudinal studies evaluated behavior problems among very young children with CD and both were limited by short follow-up periods and the use of convenience samples. 10, 12, 18 Baker et al 7, 10 reported more behavior problems in children with developmental delays than in those without delays between 36 and 48 months; by contrast, Feldman et al 12 reported no differences. 18 The above studies leave important questions about the dynamics of behavior problems as children with CD age, especially as CD status may change. 19 Recently, McManus and Rosenberg 20 found that young children with persistent developmental delays were more likely to use early intervention (EI) services than children whose delays improved, emerged, or worsened. It is unknown whether such dynamics of early childhood CD also affect its association with behavioral development.\nUsing a large, national cohort of US children, we investigated the relationship between CD and behavior problems subsequent over a 3-year period in early childhood. We measured CD at 9 and 24 months, enabling us to examine how the onset and persistence of CD related to behavior problems. We hypothesized that children with indications of CD would have more behavior problems than their TD peers, with differences increasing with age. We also anticipated that the timing and persistence of CD would be associatedwithdifferent behavioraltrajectories."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "Data were from 4 waves of the nationally representative Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B).

For these scores, the age at administration for preterm children was recorded as chronological age adjusted for weeks preterm.\nConsistent with previous research, [25] [26] [27] we considered falling within the lowest 10th percentile of age-normed scores at either time point to indicate CD.

Models were fit with random slopes and intercepts allowing correlation between individual-level random effects. 33 Fixed effects estimated average growth trajectories of child behavior over the study period, characterized by an intercept (ie, baseline behavior) and slope (ie, linear change in behavior with age).

Our results are important on several counts. First, our population-based data clarify that behavior problems among children with indications of CD are prevalent at very early ages. Across all preschool ages, children testing positive for CD by our criteria had worse behavior than their TD peers. This is consistent with previous clinic 7, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] and nationally representative 16 studies.\nSecond, adding to existing clinic-based work, 10, 12, 18 behavior problems among children with CD increased significantly faster than among TD children, particularly between 24 months and 5 years of age. Importantly, our rich data set allowed us to examine behavior problems among young children with CD over multiple years and adjust for numerous potential confounders, providing a more complete view of the developmental course of these problems than previously reported.\nThird, CD status as measured changed considerably between 9 and 24 months. Although some changes may be due to measurement error, especially leading to misclassification of borderline cases, the BSF-R has been reported to have high reliability. 24 Hence most of the changes, especially among children with newly developed CD, are likely real, highlighting an important period for interventions 0.53 (0.01)*** ***P # .0001; **P # .01; *P # .05. a Child behavior was measured by the ITSC (ages 9 and 24 mo) and the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales-2nd Edition (ages 4 and 5).

Further, although over 85% of children with CD at 24 months displayed typical cognitive development at 9 months, 20% were persistently delayed. Birth factors, including lower birth weights and congenital anomalies characterized persistently delayed children; this was not true for newly developing cases. There are limited data on the emergence, evolution, and resolution of childhood CD 19 ; our findings suggest that understanding these dynamics may be critical to inform prevention and rehabilitation efforts.\nFourth, the development of behavior problems varied across the timing and persistence of CD. Persistently delayed children fared worst, both in terms of early behavior problems and subsequent changes with age. This may be related to the etiology of persistent CD, as specific syndromes associated with CD (eg, cerebral palsy or Down syndrome) have been associated with distinct phenotypic expressions and patterns of childhood behaviors. 11, 35, 36 This group may also represent those with the most severe manifestations of CD and most accurate CD classification.\nLow SES was associated with worse child behavior regardless of CD status. This aligns with previous research 37 and suggests that interventions to ameliorate children' s behavior problems may need to consider the influence of low SES. Non-Hispanic black race and male gender also had equal or larger associations with behavior problems than CD. These children may be viewed as particularly important groups for monitoring, prevention, and intervention services. Although these variables had stronger estimated associations with behavior than CD, they were likely measured without error, while CD was identified via a screening instrument.\nMore accurate diagnosis of CD may have led to higher associations.\nOur data cannot prove that CD is causally related to behavior problems, because both seem to develop together from the earliest ages. It is notable, however, that behavior problems increased most rapidly with age in the group where CD was often due to problems present at birth.

Strategies to increase developmental screening in primary care (eg, addressing reimbursement and time and personnel limitations), 43 simplifying application procedures, 44 and care coordination 39 may promote early identification and EI service use among children with CD; future research in these areas is warranted.\nThis study has limitations. First, our child behavior measure may be subject to recall bias. Second, in the absence of diagnostic criteria, we used a cutoff score on a one-time continuous measure to estimate the prevalence of behavior problems. The ECLS-B data set lacked information on the detection and treatment of children with CD, which may have influenced our findings. Further, our estimated prevalence and trajectory of behavior problems may be influenced by differential dropout rates. We also limited the scope of these analyses to associations with CD, as determined by a screening tool. Future research should examine more faceted classifications of CD, as well as other critical components of infant development, including early motor skills."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "To date, the association between early CD and the development of behavior problems has not been adequately investigated in the United States. Although there have been cross-sectional 7, 8, 16 and short-term follow-up studies, 10, 12, 18 we believe ours is the first to examine this relationship across multiple years by using a national cohort of US children. Our findings establish, on a population-level, that disparities in behavior problems among children with CD originate at the earliest stages of life. We also found that the timing and persistence of CD influences children' s psychosocial development. These findings support early identification, evaluation, and EI service referral for children with CD."}]
