As a consequence, pesticide residues in surface and ground water are highest during the spring and the first months of summer (Winchester et al., 2009) .\nA number of researchers have hypothesized that this seasonal variation in pesticide contamination is linked in a causal sense to certain types of birth defects. Consistent with this hypothesis, Winchester et al. (2009) found that children conceived in the months of April through July were more likely to be born with birth defects such as cleft lip, clubfoot, and Down Syndrome than children conceived in other months; using data from Minnesota birth certificates, Garry et al. (1996) found a so-called \"spring spike\" in birth defects in regions where wheat was the predominant crop and the use of chlorophenoxy herbicides was common.\nThe current study tests whether the magnitude of the spring spike in birth defects is related to levels of agricultural production in Texas. Based on the results of Winchester et al. (2009) and Garry et al. (1996) , we hypothesize that, all else equal, the spring spike in birth defects will be most pronounced in counties with the highest levels of agricultural production.\nBecause farms are common in many urban counties of Texas (Langlois et al., 2010) , we are able to jointly take into account the influences of both urbanization and agricultural production.\nOur results provide evidence of a spike in birth defects among children conceived in the spring and summer, but it is more pronounced in urban non-agricultural counties than in other types of counties. Furthermore, the spike lasts into the fall in urban non-agricultural counties as compared to other types of counties.

(1996) and Winchester et al. (2009) , who used birth certificate data available through the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). One drawback to using birth certificate data is that there is no agreedupon national standard for recording birth defects. In fact, despite the fact that not all congenital anomalies are apparent at birth (Stillerman et al., 2008) and are therefore not recorded on birth certificates (Watkins et al., 1996; DiGiuseppe et al., 2002) , some states do not \"actively assess birth defects up to the first year of life, which is the best method for fully ascertaining birth defects\" (Stillerman et al. 2008, p. 632) .\nOur analysis draws on data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR) data for the period [1996] [1997] [1998] [1999] [2000] [2001] [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] . 1 The TBDR is an active birth defects surveillance system; its staff routinely reviews medical records from birth hospitals, referral hospitals and specialty clinics. All birth defects diagnosed prenatally or within the first year after delivery are entered into its web-based system which contains multiple human and computer checks to ensure that consistent surveillance procedures are followed throughout Texas (Sheu et al., 2011) . Birth defects records from the TBDR were combined with Texas birth certificate data for the years 1996-2007.\nCrucially, these data include estimates of the month of conception for each birth, based on both the stated date of last menstrual period as well as the estimated gestational age at birth. These data also include the mother's county of residence at the time of delivery."}, {"section_title": "Agricultural production data", "text": "Measures of agricultural production by county for the years 1995-2007 were obtained from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Specifically, the NASS provided acres planted by county and year for the 6 major cash crops in Texas: cotton, corn, wheat sorghum, soybeans and rice. These, along with the total land area of each county, were merged with the birth certificate and birth defects data based on mother's county of residence at delivery."}, {"section_title": "Designation of agricultural vs. non-agricultural counties", "text": "Texas is composed of 254 counties. Counties were designated as agricultural if, on average, 9.8% of their total area was planted with cotton, corn, wheat, sorghum, soybeans or rice during the period under study. Eighty-nine Texas counties met this criterion, which is equivalent to being above the 65 th percentile of acres planted in these 6 crops. Eighty-nine counties were below the 35 th percentile of planted acres. That is, less than 1.2% of their total area was planted with the 6 major cash crops in Texas. These counties were designated as non-agricultural.\nBirths to mothers from the 76 counties between the 35 th and 65 th percentile were dropped from the analysis, although their inclusion does not substantially alter the results reported below."}, {"section_title": "Designation of urban vs. non-urban counties", "text": "Counties were designated as urban if, based on 2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes, they belong to a metropolitan area of at least 1 million residents. One advantage of using the TBDR data is that Texas agricultural production is not highly correlated with urban/rural status (Langlois et al., 2010) . As a consequence, comparing counties with high agricultural production to those with low agricultural production does not simply reduce to a (potentially confounded)\ncomparison of urban versus rural.\nOf the 178 counties that contributed data to the analysis, 18 were designated as urban. Table 1 shows the relationship between this designation and the agricultural designation described above. Urban counties are evenly divided between agricultural and non-agricultural counties, as are non-urban counties. To be clear, the same threshold (greater than 9.8% of acres planted on average each year) was used to determine agricultural counties in both urban and nonurban settings. Non-agricultural urban counties averaged 10.4 births per 100 acres for the period 1996-2007, while agricultural urban counties averaged 7.8 births per 100 acres. Figure 1 plots the birth defects per 1000 births by month of conception for the entire state of Texas. We observe an increase in birth defects between April and May, with a peak in June."}, {"section_title": "Descriptive statistics", "text": "The birth defect rate remains elevated through August, and then declines. The magnitude of this spike is similar to that documented for the entire country by Winchester et al. (2009) , as is its timing. While this is typically referred to as a \"spring spike,\" it could more appropriately be called a \"spring spike that lasts through the summer.\"\n2 Figure 2 plots birth defects per 1000 births separately for agricultural and nonagricultural counties. The birth defect rate is clearly higher in agricultural counties than nonagricultural counties. The spring spike, however, appears to be more pronounced in nonagricultural counties.\n2 The terminology in part is due to the fact that some studies have used data of last menstrual period (LMP), as opposed to date of conception, which occurs about 2 weeks later. These studies find a spike that runs April-July rather than May through August (e.g., Winchester et al., 2009 ).\nIn Table 2 shows that residents of agricultural counties differed, on average, from residents of non-agricultural counties in ways that could have affected birth outcomes. Our empirical analysis below focuses on whether the seasonal spike in defects is more pronounced in agricultural counties.\nIn Table 3 , we report observation counts by birth defect classification. Of the 2,209,303 births in our sample, 79,594 are recorded as having at least one birth defect. 4 Counts are reported for the following categories of birth defects: circulatory defects, chromosomal defects, selected musculoskeletal defects (limb reduction defects, talipes equinovarus/clubfoot, diaphragmatic hernia, omphalocele, gastroschisis), selected central nervous system defects (anencephaly, spina bifida without anencephaly, hydrocephaly without spina bifida, microcephaly), selected urogenital defects (hypospadias, renal agenesis/dysgenesis), oral clefts, and selected digestive defects (tracheoesophageal fistula/esophageal atresia, stenosis or atresia of 3 Our results are virtually unchanged if black mothers are excluded from the sample.\n4 The Texas Birth Defects Registry monitors all major structural and chromosomal defects and records the defects using modified British Pediatric Association (BPA) codes. large intestine, rectum or anal canal). There were 32,914 births with at least one defect not belonging to one of the 6 categories listed above; 9.35% of the 79,594 cases with at least one birth defect had defects from multiple categories."}, {"section_title": "The statistical analysis", "text": "Our basic specification is:\n(1)\nwhere BD is an indicator for whether child i conceived in month m, year t, and county c had a birth defect. 5 Spring is an indicator that equals one for children conceived in May through\nAugust.

The vector X i includes controls for sex of child, mother's age, mother's race/ethnicity, mother's education, plurality of the birth and parity of the birth. 6 Year is a vector of year fixed effects. Standard errors are corrected for clustering at the county level.\nThe first two columns of Table 4 report estimates of the spring spike from equation (1) separately for agricultural and non-agricultural counties. There is evidence of a spring spike in birth defects among children born to mothers who lived in agricultural counties. Specifically, the probability of a birth defect increased by 0.0013 if conception took place in months of May, June, July, or August. However, the spring spike is twice this size when the sample is restricted to mothers who lived in non-agricultural counties: the probability of a birth defect increased by 5 We estimate linear probability models in all of our analysis. For all models, approximately 3.7% of the sample has predicted probabilities outside the 0-1 interval. 6 More specifically, mother's age is controlled for with a set of indicators for ages 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and 40 or older (the omitted category is composed of birth to mothers under the age of 20); mother's race/ethnicity is controlled for by indicators for black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, other non-Hispanic (the omitted category is composed of births to white non-Hispanic mothers); mother's education is controlled for by indicators for high school degree and greater than a high school degreee (the omitted category is composed of births to mothers with less than a high school degree). The regression also includes indicator variables for parity (up to 4 th or higher birth), plurality (up to 3 or more) and for whether the infant was male. 0.0026 if conception occurred in May, June, July, or August. To provide a sense of magnitude, we note that the birth defect rate was 0.0407 when the sample was restricted to children born to mothers living in agricultural counties and 0.0316 when the sample was restricted to children born to mothers living in non-agricultural areas.\nColumn 3 combines the first two columns into:\n(2) In this specification, 1 \u03b2 estimates the spring spike in non-agricultural counties, 2 \u03b2 estimates the difference in birth defect rates between agricultural and non-agricultural areas for months other than May through August, and 3 \u03b2 estimates the difference in the spring spike between agricultural and non-agricultural areas. The negative coefficient on Spring*Agric in column 3\nindicates that the spring spike is smaller in agricultural areas than non-agricultural areas. The difference is significant at the 10 percent level (p-value = 0.057).\nFinally, in column 4 of Table 4 , county fixed effects are added to (2), which causes the indicators Agric and Urban to drop out of our model: The column 3 results are highly robust to the addition of county fixed effects. Table 5 reports results separately by birth defect classification. Equation (3) is estimated replacing the birth defect indicator with indicators for each of the birth defect categories given in Table 3 . For each of these categories, the sample is restricted to observations that reported a birth defect in that category or no birth defect. We find evidence of a spring spike for circulatory defects, selected defects of the central nervous system, selected urogenital defects, selected digestive defects, and defects not elsewhere classified. For five all of these categories, the coefficient on the Spring*Agric interaction is negative but statistically insignificant at 8 conventional levels. The point estimates provide suggestive evidence that the spring spike is smaller in agricultural counties than in non-agricultural counties, but the lack of statistical significance means we cannot formally reject the hypothesis that there is no difference in the spring spike between agricultural and non-agricultural areas."}, {"section_title": "Seasonal variation by urban vs. agricultural designation", "text": "A 1997 EPA report found that roughly 28% of annual pesticide use in the United States is by residential, commercial, industrial or public entities (Aspelin, 1997 The widespread use of the insecticide diazinon on lawns and other urban settings has affected water quality in the Trinity River basin. Wastewater from a number of city sewage treatment plants\u2026can fail monthly toxicity tests because diazinon has reached the system through runoff and is not removed by the treatment plant (p.17)\nThe report also highlighted the use of pesticides by the Texas Department of Transportation in right-of-way maintenance for state highways, as well as the use of aquatic herbicides by the Texas Parks and Wildflife department, lake managers, golf courses and individual homeowners as other areas for concern.\nWhile we know that agricultural pesticide usage is highest at the beginning of the growing season and drops off considerably by mid-summer, it is not clear whether this is true for commercial/residential pesticide usage where aesthetic concerns, turf preservation and insect control may result in continued applications into fall. It is difficult to obtain any information on pesticide applications by month and reason for application, and none exists for Texas. California does, however, require registration of pesticide use. In the pesticide data from California, we find that a larger fraction of commercial/residential pesticide use occurs in the fall months compared to agriculture. Specifically, in the California data, 52% of all agricultural pesticide application occurs May through August, but only 16% occurs September through November. In contrast, 44% of all non-agricultural pesticide application occurs May through August, and 24%\noccurs September through November."}, {"section_title": "7", "text": "In order to test whether the spring spike in non-agricultural counties is predominantly an urban phenomenon, we estimate the following extensions to models (1) through (3): through November, so it is not the case that there is an omitted Summer indicator. Equation (4) is estimated separately for agricultural and non-agricultural counties. Equation (5) combines the agricultural and non-agricultural counties into one model, and Equation (6) includes county fixed effects.\nIn equations (5) and (6), our key parameters of interest are 2 \u03b2 and 3 \u03b2 . The estimate of 2 \u03b2 corresponds to the difference in spring spikes between agricultural and non-agricultural counties restricting the comparison to non-urban counties; the estimate of 3 \u03b2 is the difference in spring spikes between urban and non-urban counties restricting the comparison to nonagricultural counties. If the urban spring spike lasts into the fall, this will be reflected in the estimate of 7 \u03b2 .\nEstimates of equation (4) are reported separately for agricultural and non-agricultural counties in the first two columns of Table 6 . In column 1, the coefficient of Spring indicates that, among mothers living in non-urban agricultural counties, spring conceptions are associated with an increase of 0.0012 in the probability of a birth defect. The estimated coefficient of Spring*Urban represents the difference in spring spikes between urban and non-urban agricultural counties. However, this difference (0.0007) is not statistically significant at conventional levels.\nWhen the sample is restricted to non-agricultural counties, the estimated coefficient of Spring, is a modest (and statistically insignificant) 0.0008. In contrast, the estimated coefficient of 0.0039 for the Spring*Urban interaction indicates that the spring spike is much larger in urban as compared to non-urban counties. Moreover, the coefficient estimate of 0.0027 for the Fall*Urban interaction indicates that the urban spike in birth defects persists into the fall. The spring spike in non-agricultural areas reported in Table 4 is almost entirely an urban phenomenon that lasts into the fall.\nEstimates from equations (5) and (6) are reported in the remaining columns of Table 6 .\nThe estimated coefficient of the Spring*Agric interaction is positive, but not statistically significant. In contrast, the estimated coefficient of the Spring*Urban interaction provides additional evidence that the spring spike is larger in urban non-agricultural counties than in nonurban non-agricultural areas. Specifically, the spring spike in urban non-agricultural counties is 0.0039 larger than in non-urban non-agricultural counties, a non-trivial difference given that the mean birth defect rate for non-agricultural counties is 0.0316 (Table 2 ).

Children with birth defects who survive beyond their first year often must grapple with life-long disabilities, emotional distress, and pain.\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a pesticide is \"any agent used to kill or control undesired insects, weeds, rodents, fungi, bacteria, or other organisms\" (EPA, 2012). Every year, approximately 5 billion pounds of herbicides, insecticides and fungicides are used in the Unites States (Grube et al., 2011) . Although the majority of birth defects cannot be linked to a specific cause, researchers have hypothesized that prenatal exposure to pesticides could increase the risk of being born with a defect (Stillerman et al., 2008) .\nEvidence for this hypothesis comes from a variety of sources. Shaw et al. (1999) , Rull et al. (2006) , and Nordby et al. (2005) found that living near farms that use pesticides is associated with increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). Having a parent who works in an agricultural occupation is also associated with increased risk of NTDs (Blatter et al., 1994; Blatter and Roeleveld, 1996; Garcia et al., 1999; Hanke and Jurewicz, 2004; Lacasa\u00f1a et al., 2006) , oral clefts (Hanke and Jurewicz, 2004; Romitti et al., 2007 , and congenital heart defects (Garry et al., 1996; Shaw et al., 1999; Loffredo et al., 2001 )."}, {"section_title": "Winchester et al.

They found children whose mothers had their last menstrual period (LMP) during the months of April-July were more likely to have a birth defect than mothers whose LMP was in other months. 9 Moreover, they found that concentrations of atrazine, nitrates and other pesticides in surface waters were higher during the months of April-July. 10 However, any seasonal variation in birth defects could potentially be 9 Conception occurs about two weeks after LMP. Therefore, the Winchester et al. (2009) result is consistent with our finding of a spring spike in birth defects for babies conceived May through August.

They find that spina bifida, circulatory/respiratory anomalies, tracheo-esophogeal defects, gastrointestinal defects, urogenital defects, cleft lip, adactyly, clubfoot, musculoskeletal anomalies, Down's syndrome and other birth defects were found to be significantly higher in April through July than in other months of the year.\n10 Because they could not rule out the possibility that a third factor was responsible for the increased risk of being born with a birth defect among children conceived in the spring and early summer, they conceded that \" [a] causal link between birth defects and\u2026pesticides is plausible but not proven from this present ecological study\" (p. 667).\ncaused by factors such another type of environmental pollution, viral infections, selection into pregnancy, or even the use of decongestants such as pseudoephedrine.\n11 Garry et al. (1996) and Schreinemachers (2003) compared the spring spike across areas with different types of agricultural production or pesticide usage. Both focus on wheat production in the Midwest, which typically involves the application of chlorophenoxy herbicides. Using data from Minnesota birth certificates for the period 1989-1992, Garry et al. (1996) found a spring spike in birth defects in regions where chlorophenoxy herbicides and/or fungicides were frequently used. There was no evidence of a spring spike in regions with low or no reported use of chlorophenoxy herbicides/fungicides."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "Schreinemachers (2003) argued that a comparison of regions with high wheat production to low wheat production (and therefore low chlorophenoxy use) should be limited to a sample of rural, agricultural counties, so as not to improperly compare the high wheat producing areas to urban, non-agricultural areas. Analyzing a sample of rural counties with high agricultural production located in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota, she found that the spring spike in birth defects was equally as strong in low-wheat producing agricultural areas as the high-wheat producing areas, suggesting that other pesticides besides chlorophenoxy may play a role in the spring spike.\n11 Dolk et al. (2010) and Skinner et al. (2010) review the literature on environmental pollution and birth defects. Zhang and Cai (1993) and Acs et al. (2006) found that experiencing a cold in the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a variety of birth defects. Shaw et al. (1998) found an association between illness resulting in fever and neural tube defects. Werler et al. (2002) found an association between the use of pseudoephedrine, a common decongestant, while pregnant and small intestinal atresia. Buckles and Hungerman (2013) found that births during winter are disproportionally to teenagers and single women.\nOurs is the first study of the spring spike to jointly investigate agricultural production and urban status. 13 We find evidence of a spring spike in Texas birth defects, but this spike is more pronounced in urban non-agricultural counties than in other types of counties. Furthermore, we find that the spike lasts longer into the fall in urban non-agricultural counties as compared to other types of counties.\nThese results suggest that, if pesticides contribute to the spring spike in Texas birth defects, they do so in a manner that generates a larger spike in urban non-agricultural counties than in other counties. For example, pesticides used in agricultural production could lead to the contamination of urban water supplies, or the more pronounced spike in urban non-agricultural counties could be attributable to commercial and residential pesticide use. Better (e.g., monthly) data on pesticide applications and pesticide concentrations in watersheds is required to more definitively investigate this relationship."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "It is possible that pesticide use by farmers can lead to birth defects. Prior research has, in fact, shown that there is an elevated risk of birth defects if conception took place in the spring, when pesticide use by farmers is highest (Garry, 1996; Winchester et al., 2009) . However, it is also possible that this association is spurious-driven by seasonal fluctuations in other types of environmental pollution, viral infections, or even the use of decongestants such as pseudoephedrine.\nUsing data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR) data for the period 1996-2007, the current study tests whether the magnitude of the spring spike in birth defects is related to 13 Siffel et al. (2005) examined data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program for the years 1978-2001. These authors found little evidence of seasonality in birth defects. levels of agricultural production. Prior researchers have tested whether the spring spike is more pronounced in agricultural areas than in non-agricultural areas, but these studies did not consider the role of urban status.\nOur results provide evidence that the spring spike in birth defects is smaller in agricultural counties than in counties with low levels of agricultural production. Furthermore, we find evidence of a sizeable spring spike in urban non-agricultural counties relative to nonurban non-agricultural counties. The increased risk of birth defects observed in urban nonagricultural counties lasts into the fall. Our calculations using California pesticide data indicate that non-agricultural pesticide use in that state typically lasts later into the growing season than does pesticide use by farmers. If the same were true for Texas, this prolonged spring spike in urban areas would be consistent with a role for residential and commercial pesticide use.\nMonitoring of residential and commercial pesticide usage would provide the data needed to explore this relationship.\nWhile the spring spike is larger in non-agricultural areas, birth defects remain more common in agricultural areas than non-agricultural areas. These results highlight the need for better monitoring of both agricultural and non-agricultural pesticide usage that would provide the data necessary to more definitively estimate the relationship between birth defects and pesticide use.\nFinally, while the evidence presented here is clearly circumstantial, it may provide guidance to future researchers with access to detailed information on pesticide use and concentrations. With this information, it may be possible to identify what causes the spring spike in birth defects. Our results suggest that any alternative explanation cannot simply predict a spring spike but must also predict a larger spring spike in urban non-agricultural areas.
