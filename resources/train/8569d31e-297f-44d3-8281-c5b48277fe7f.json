This report presents selected findings from the Public School Principal Data File of NTPS. NTPS is a redesign of the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). SASS was conducted on behalf of the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) on a 4-year cycle, beginning with the 1987-88 school year and ending in the 2011-12 school year. NTPS maintains the same focus on schools, teachers, and administrators that was traditionally held by SASS; however, it has a different structure and sample than previous administrations of SASS and operates on a 2-year survey cycle. NTPS collects data on core topics including teacher and principal preparation, classes taught, school characteristics, and demographics of the teacher and principal labor force. It is developed by NCES of the Institute of Education Sciences within the U.S. Department of Education and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. This report represents the initial results of the first collection of NTPS. The purpose of NTPS is to collect information that can provide a detailed picture of U.S. elementary and secondary schools and their staff. This information is collected through school, principal, and teacher surveys, and information can be linked across all three surveys. The 2015-16 NTPS uses a school-based sample of public schools. Because of this school-based design, principals associated with public schools were included in the sample. Teachers associated with a selected school were sampled from a teacher list provided by the school, collected from school websites, or purchased from a vendor. The selected samples include about 8,300 traditional and charter public schools and public school principals, and 40,000 public school teachers. The samples were drawn to support estimates by geography, grade span, and charter school status. The reader is referred to the Survey Documentation for the 2015-16 National Teacher and Principal Survey (Cox et al. forthcoming) for details about these estimation domains and their precision criteria. The data were collected via mailed questionnaires and internet instruments with telephone and in-person field follow-up. The first questionnaires were mailed in September 2015, and data collection ended in August 2016. The weighted unit response rate was 71.8 percent for public school principals. For detailed information about response rates, bias analysis results, methodology, and design of the 2015-16 NTPS, please see the technical notes of this report in appendix B or the Survey Documentation for the 2015-16 National Teacher and Principal Survey (Cox et al. forthcoming). The purpose of this First Look is to introduce new data through the presentation of tables containing descriptive information. Selected findings chosen for this report demonstrate the range of information available on the 2015-16 NTPS Public School Principal Restricted-Use Data File. The selected findings do not represent a complete review of all observed differences in the data and are not meant to emphasize any issue. This First Look report highlights findings from the NTPS public school principal survey. Findings from the school and teacher data files will be presented in two companion First Look reports: \u2022  2015-16 National Teacher andPrincipal Survey First Look (NCES 2017-072). The tables in this report contain frequencies and percentages demonstrating bivariate relationships. All results have been weighted to reflect the sample design and to account for nonresponse and other adjustments. Comparisons drawn in the selected findings have been tested for statistical significance at the .05 level using Student's t statistics to ensure that the differences are larger than those that might be expected due to sampling variation. While the selected findings include only statistically significant findings they do not include every statistically significant comparison. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Many of the variables examined are related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships have not been explored. Statistical Analysis Software (SAS 9.4) and SUDAAN (11.1) were used to compute the statistics for this report. Tables of standard errors are provided in appendix A. Detailed information about the survey methodology is provided in appendix B. Appendix C contains a description of the variables used in this report.

Among public school principals, 78 percent were non-Hispanic White, 11 percent were non-Hispanic Black or African American, 8 percent were Hispanic, and 3 percent were another race/ethnicity 2 (table 1). \u2022 Overall, 54 percent of public school principals were female. Relatively more primary school principals were female (68 percent) than were middle, high, or combined school principals (40 percent, 33 percent, and 42 percent, respectively). The average age of public school principals was 47 (table 2). \u2022 Among public schools, a majority of principals held a master's degree (61 percent) as their highest degree, compared to a bachelor's degree or less (2 percent), an education specialist/professional diploma 3 (27 percent) or a doctorate/first professional degree (10 percent) (table 3). \u2022 The average annual salary of public school principals was $95,700. 4 Public school principals in high schools earned more ($101,200) than their peers in middle schools ($98,000), primary schools ($94,600), and combined schools ($86,500) (table 4). \u2022 Public school principals spent an average of 58.6 hours per week on all school-related activities. 5 On average, principals spent about 30 percent of their time on internal administrative tasks, 30 percent of their time on curriculum and teaching-related tasks, 23 percent of their time on student interactions, and 14 percent of their time on parent interactions (table 5). \u2022 Public school principals had an average of 6.6 years of experience as a principal and an average of 4 years as a principal of their current school. Principals in traditional public schools were generally more experienced (6.6 years) than those in charter schools (5.9 years) (table 6). \u2022 Among public school principals, 95 percent reported having a major influence on decisions concerning evaluating teachers, 87 percent reported having a major influence on hiring new full-time teachers, and 75 percent reported having a major influence on setting discipline policy (table 7). Hispanic includes Latino. Other race/ethnicity includes American Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic; Asian, non-Hispanic; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic; and Two or more races, non-Hispanic.

NTPS is a nationally representative sample survey of public K-12 schools, principals, and teachers in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. This is the first year of NTPS. The 2015-16 NTPS consisted of questionnaires for three types of respondents: public schools, public school principals, and public school teachers. The information can be linked across teachers, principals, and schools. There is a separate data file for each type of respondent (school, principal, and teacher). For the content of the questionnaires, see https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ntps/question1516.asp. NTPS was designed to produce national estimates for public elementary and secondary schools, principals, and teachers, including national estimates for public charter schools and the principals and teachers within them. Additionally, the teacher survey was designed to produce national estimates of teachers by subject matter taught and by full-time or part-time status. 1-4 (Goldring et al. 2017).

The starting point for the 2015-16 NTPS public school sampling frame was the preliminary 2013-14 Common Core of Data (CCD) Nonfiscal School Universe data file. 1 The sampling frame was adjusted from CCD to fit the definition of a school eligible for NTPS. To be eligible for NTPS, a school was defined as an institution or part of an institution that provides classroom instruction to students, has one or more teachers to provide instruction, serves students in one or more of grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent, and is located in one or more buildings apart from a private home. It was possible for two or more schools to share the same building; in that case, they were treated as different schools if they had different administrators (i.e., principal or school head). This definition is unchanged from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS). The 2015-16 NTPS universe of schools is confined to the 50 states plus the District of Columbia and excludes the other jurisdictions, Department of Defense overseas schools, and CCD schools that do not offer teacher-provided classroom instruction in grades 1-12 or the ungraded equivalent. This last group includes schools that are essentially administrative units that may oversee entities that provide classroom instruction or may only provide funding and oversight. Although Bureau of Indian Education-funded (BIE) schools are included in NTPS, these schools were not oversampled and the data do not support separate BIE estimates. The NTPS definition of a school is generally similar to the CCD definition, with some exceptions. Like SASS, NTPS allows schools to define themselves. During SASS collections, Census Bureau staff observed that in situations where two or more schools have the same administration, these schools were reported separately on CCD but generally reported as one entity for the SASS. Thus, CCD schools with the same location, address, and phone number were collapsed during the frame building on the assumption that the respondent would consider them to be one school. Due to similarities with SASS, NTPS also followed the same type of collapsing procedure. A set of rules was applied to determine in which instances school records should be collapsed together. When school records were collapsed together, the student and teacher counts, grade ranges, and names as reported to CCD were all modified to reflect the change. Finally, since CCD and NTPS differ in scope and their definition of a school, some records were deleted, added, or modified to provide better coverage and a more efficient sample design for NTPS. For a detailed list of frame modifications, see the Survey Documentation for the 2015-16 National Teacher and Principal Survey (Cox et al. forthcoming). After deleting, collapsing, and adding school records, the NTPS public school sampling frame consisted of about 87,600 traditional public schools and 6,500 public charter schools. NTPS uses a systematic, probability proportionate to size (PPS) sample (for an explanation of PPS sampling, see Cochran, 1977). Unlike SASS, NTPS did not stratify schools prior to sampling. Rather, some types of schools were oversampled based on specific characteristics such as the following: \u2022 School grade level (primary, middle, high, combined); \u2022 Collapsed urbanicity (city, suburban, town, rural); and \u2022 Charter status. In addition to oversampling based on specific school characteristics, sample sizes were inflated for schools in the six states with the smallest number of schools: Alaska, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wyoming. Prior to sampling, schools were sorted by the following: \u2022 charter status; \u2022 school grade level (four categories); \u2022 urbanicity (four categories); \u2022 poverty status (four categories); \u2022 school size category (based on full-time equivalent [FTE] teachers; two categories for middle and combined charter schools, three categories for all other schools); \u2022 school type for noncharter schools (four categories); \u2022 state; and \u2022 number of FTE teachers. These sampling procedures resulted in a total public school sample of about 7,130 traditional public schools and 1,170 public charter schools. Principals. The principal of each sampled school was selected. About 8,300 school principals were sampled (7,130 traditional public school principals, 1,170 public charter school principals)."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Procedures", "text": "In 2015-16, NTPS employed a combined mail-based and internet survey approach, with subsequent telephone and in-person follow-up. Data collection included the Teacher Listing Form, Principal Questionnaire, School Questionnaire, and Teacher Questionnaire. This report focuses on the Principal Questionnaire."}, {"section_title": "B-4", "text": "In preparation for school-level data collection, advance letters were mailed to the sampled schools in June 2015 to verify their addresses. Initial school packages were mailed in September 2015. 2 Next, schools were telephoned using a computer-assisted telephone-interviewing instrument to verify school information, establish a survey coordinator, and follow up on the Teacher Listing Form if the school had not already provided an electronic teacher list. The in-person follow-up period was preceded by phone calls from the telephone centers to remind the survey coordinators to have staff complete and return all forms. Data collection ended in August 2016. One of the main goals of the data collection plan for the 2015-16 NTPS was to target the schools that presented a challenge to data collection during previous administrations of SASS. These \"known difficult\" schools have resulted in poor response rates for certain school types (e.g., large schools in urban areas). Sampled schools that have a known large impact on weighting were targeted, as well. These schools were identified during sampling, and their data collection priority flag was set accordingly. Contact strategies that were more proactive during the early phases of data collection were employed during 2015-16 NTPS data collection to mitigate potential low response rates for these cases. Survey coordinators also were utilized during data collection. The role of the survey coordinator was to be the primary contact person at the school. A survey coordinator's duties included facilitating data collection by passing out questionnaires to the appropriate staff, reminding the staff to complete their questionnaires, and collecting the questionnaires to return. The data collection follow-up strategies for schools with a survey coordinator were different from schools without a survey coordinator, with the more proactive approach taken for those schools without a survey coordinator."}, {"section_title": "Data Processing and Imputation", "text": "The Census Bureau checked returned questionnaires, keyed the data, and implemented quality control procedures. Questionnaires that had a preliminary classification of a complete interview were submitted to a series of computer edits consisting of a range check, a consistency edit, 3 a blanking edit, 4 and a logic edit. 5 After these edits were run and reviewed by analysts, the records were put through another edit to make a final determination as to whether the case was eligible for the survey and whether sufficient data had been collected for the case to be classified as a complete interview. After the final edits were run, cases with \"not-answered\" values for items remained. Values were imputed for these cases using two main approaches. First, donor respondent methods, such as hot-deck imputation, were used. Second, if no suitable donor case could be matched, the few remaining items were imputed using mean or mode from groups of similar cases to impute a value to the item with missing data. After each stage of imputation, computer edits were run again to verify that the imputed data were consistent with the existing questionnaire data. If that was not the case, an imputed value was blanked out by one of these computer edits due to inconsistency with other data within the same questionnaire or because it was out of the range of acceptable values. In these situations, Census Bureau analysts looked at the items and tried to determine an appropriate value. Edit and imputation flags, indicating which edit or imputation method was used, were assigned to each relevant survey variable. For further information, see the sections \u2022 Percent free or reduced-price lunch eligible, for schools where less than 35 percent of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Evidence of potential bias formed after nonresponse adjustments for the following national-level items included in the analysis: \u2022 Charter status, for charter and noncharter schools; and \u2022 Pupil-teacher ratio, for schools with a student-teacher ratio of 15 to less than 20 students. For further information on unit response rates and nonresponse bias analysis, see the Survey Documentation for the 2015-16 National Teacher and Principal Survey (Cox et al. forthcoming). Item response rates. The item response rate indicates the percentage of respondents who answered a given survey question or item. The weighted NTPS item response rate is calculated by dividing the weighted number of respondents who provided an answer to an item by the weighted number of respondents who were eligible to answer that item. 8 Table B-2 provides a summary of the weighted item response rates. For the public school principal data, no items had a response rate below 85 percent. For further information on item response rates and bias analysis, see the Survey Documentation for the 2015-16 National Teacher and Principal Survey (Cox et al. forthcoming). "}, {"section_title": "Weighting", "text": "The general purpose of weighting is to scale up the sample estimates to represent the target survey population. For NTPS, a base weight is used as the starting point. In most cases, this base weight is the simple reciprocal of the unit's probability of selection on the frame (the initial base weight), and in other cases, adjustments are made to this frame base weight to reflect multiple chances of selection from the frame or other situations such as subsampling. Next, a series of nonresponse adjustment factors are calculated and applied based on a weighting cell adjustment. Weighting cells are developed using tree search algorithms. These cells are selected to be homogeneous in response propensity within cells and heterogeneous in response propensity across cells (response propensity is the underlying \"chance\" that a particular sample unit will respond by completing the questionnaire: its individual response rate). The adjustment is the inverse of the weighted response rate within each cell, and each respondent in the cell receives this adjustment. Nonrespondents are given weights of zero and the respondents are reweighted to represent the nonrespondents. The variables examined for potential bias were the same as those used by the tree search algorithms. All of the subgroups that showed potential bias as given in table B-1 above were used as cell generators by the tree search algorithms except for charter status, as well as other subgroups which are related, and may show B-8 differential response conditional on other subgroups (i.e., they may be chosen as cell generators by the tree search algorithm within particular branches). Finally, for the principal file, a raking factor is calculated and applied to the sample to adjust the sample totals to the frame totals, so that the sum of the weights within each of the specified cells is equal to the corresponding frame total for the cell. These cells are defined based on school level, urbanicity, and percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. The weights are then adjusted to the control totals by an iterative process, referred to as raking, until the weights simultaneously aggregate to be equal to each set of control totals. In some cases, extreme weights may be trimmed back to a cutoff value. This all improves the precision of survey estimates. The product of these factors is the final weight for each NTPS respondent, which appears as PFNLWGT on NTPS Public School Principal Data File. The counts in table 1 (in the Estimate Tables section) do not necessarily match the frame counts because some cases in the frame were found to be ineligible (i.e., out of scope). Some of the counts for selected school characteristics may not match between school and principal data files due to independent weighting procedures, differential nonresponse, rounding, and not every school having a principal."}, {"section_title": "Variance Estimation", "text": "In surveys with complex sample designs, such as NTPS, direct estimates of sampling errors that assume a simple random sample typically underestimate the variability in the estimates. The NTPS sample design and estimation include procedures that deviate from the assumption of simple random sampling, such as sampling with differential probabilities. One method of calculating sampling errors of complex sample designs is jackknife replication. Jackknife replication methods involve dropping a small portion of the sample from the full sample and computing the statistic of interest for the retained and reweighted sample (the jackknife replicate). The sum of squares of the replicate estimates around the full sample estimate provides an estimate of the variance of the statistic. The NTPS principal data file includes a set of 200 replicate weights designed to produce variance estimates. The set of replicate weights for each file should be applied to the respondents in that file. The replicate weights for NTPS respondents are PREPWT1-PREPWT200 for principals."}, {"section_title": "Reliability of Data", "text": "NTPS estimates are based on samples. The sample estimates may differ somewhat from the values that would be obtained from the universe of respondents using the same questionnaire, instructions, and field representatives. The difference occurs because a sample survey estimate is subject to two types of errors: nonsampling and sampling. Estimates of the magnitude of sampling error for NTPS data can be derived or calculated. Nonsampling errors are attributed to many sources, including definitional difficulties, the inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide correct information, differences in the interpretation of questions, an inability to recall information, errors made in collection (e.g., in recording or coding the data), errors made in processing the data, and errors made in estimating values for missing data.
