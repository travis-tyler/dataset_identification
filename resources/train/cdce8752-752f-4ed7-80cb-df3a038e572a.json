[{"section_title": "", "text": "potentially incompatible roles of worker and parent might clarify the differential effects of parental status on the advancement of men and women (Tharenou, 1999) . Statistics indicate that mothers earn 60 cents for every dollar earned by fathers (Waldfogel, 1998) and face a 5 percent penalty in wages for each child they parent (Budig & England, 2001 ) whereas men's salaries can actually increase when they become fathers (Tharenou et al., 1994) . Despite such evidence, the processes underlying this 'maternal wall ' have not yet been fully investigated.\nOn the one hand, it is argued that gender differences in the relationship between parental status and career success are explained by genuine differences in mothers' work behaviors and attitudes (e.g. decreased commitment, part-time work; O'Neill, 1994) . On the other hand, it is possible that gender disparities may be accounted for by subjective and inaccurate biases that arise from gender role stereotypes (Correll & Benard, 2007; Williams, 2001) . The current research draws from social role theory (Eagly, 1987) , which posits that the distribution of men and women into breadwinner and homemaker roles has led to both genuine and perceived gender differences (i.e. stereotypes). These differences are exacerbated among parents, for whom gender roles may become particularly salient (Hebl et al., 2007) . The present study quantifies bias as the extent to which decision-makers underestimate mothers' (or overestimate fathers') commitment to, involvement in, or availability. As such, this research offers the first test of the operation and effects of bias toward working mothers."}, {"section_title": "Advancement, work-family and gender", "text": "The extent to which employees ascend through the hierarchy of organizations has been labeled 'career success' (e.g. Kammeyer-Mueller et al., 2008) , 'career achievement' (e.g. Brand & Halaby, 2006) , 'upward mobility' (e.g. Wellin, 2008) , and 'organizational advancement' (e.g. Schaubroeck & Lam, 2002) . For the purposes of the current research, I utilize these terms interchangeably to refer to a broad construct defined as the 'accumulated positive work and psychological outcomes resulting from one's work experiences' (Ng et al., 2005: 368) . There are both extrinsic (externally evaluated) and intrinsic (internally evaluated) measures of this construct. Extrinsic measures of career success have included salary, number of promotions, job level, and span-of-control indicators (e.g. De Souza, 2002; Judiesch & Lyness, 1999; Schneer & Reitman, 1993; Seibert et al., 1999; Tharenou, 2001; Tharenou et al., 1994) . Intrinsic measures of advancement typically include career satisfaction or subjective success (e.g. Peluchette, 1993) .\nRecent evidence confirms that extrinsic and intrinsic measures capture distinct elements of success, and that both constructs should be utilized to best conceptualize advancement (Ng et al., 2005) , and the current article includes income, hierarchical level, and promotions, as well as subjective evaluations of the potential for progression as indicators of advancement.\nIn an article examining predictors of success, Tharenou and colleagues (1994) argued that the determinants of career advancement were not yet understood. The authors further specified that most studies examine narrow constructs and do not include the wide variety of personal and situational variables that are likely to influence career success. For example, researchers have studied proactive personality (Seibert et al., 1999) , physical height (Judge & Cable, 2004) , general mental ability (Judge et al., 1999) , and mentoring experiences (Dreher & Ash, 1990) as predictors of advancement without fully integrating other potential determinants. In particular, I argue that not enough research has included a wide range of indicators of family responsibilities or related perceptual biases. Despite this underlying limitation, a body of knowledge has amassed with regard to other, independent determinants of career success. More than a decade after Tharenou et al.'s (1994) comments, Ng and his colleagues (2005) offered the first systematic, quantitative summary of empirical studies that investigate predictors of advancement.\nIn their meta-analysis of 140 studies, Ng et al. drew from upward mobility theoretical backgrounds to consider contest-mobility and sponsoredmobility explanations for success. The former theory suggests that advancement is determined in an open contest as a function of individual performance and contributions, and thus is contingent upon employee behavior (Turner, 1960) . The latter perspective specifies that advancement is determined by the choices of organizational elites, and thus is contingent on the perceptions of the powerful (Turban & Dougherty, 1994; Turner, 1960) . The results of this review suggest that each theoretical perspective is useful, or that 'career success is largely a function of two important career experiences: working hard and receiving sponsorship ' (p. 393) . However, this review did not include indicators of family, suggesting that work-family constructs may be largely unexamined determinants of advancement.\nIt is important to clarify that the theoretical rationale and evidence presented in the current article is concerned with mothers and fathers, rather than men and women more generally. In many cases, arguments about the status of women include discussions of their family roles without consideration of their actual parental status (see Williams & Segal, 2004) . Here, previous research is clarified and extended by directly comparing men and women who have children. A substantial body of research has considered the intersection of gender and family . Researchers have found that women with and without children are responsible for the overwhelming majority of household labor (Lennon & Rosenfield, 1994; Major, 1993) , and as such, can experience the conflicting demands of work and family (Hammer et al., 1997) , feel stressed (Parasuraman & Simmers, 2001) and make accommodations (Fredricksen-Goldsen & Scharlach, 2001 ), more so than men. Although gender and family factors can be considered as joint predictors of career success, virtually no previous field research and very limited laboratory research has examined perceptions of working mothers.\nOne context in which consideration of the relationship between parenthood and advancement may be particularly important and informative is academia. Academia is a profession that does not include a timecard or highly structured production requirements, and professors who have children may have more flexibility than doctors, lawyers, or factory workers. However, in a manner comparable to the experiences of women in other elite professions, the developmental phase characterized by greatest fertility is also the phase in which junior faculty are expected (moreover, required) to be maximally productive (Madden, 2004) . Because long hours at work are correlated with faculty success, many parents who work as professors struggle to meet the demands of work and family (Jacobs & Winslow, 2004) . These challenges may be particularly pronounced for professors who are mothers; mother-professors report spending more time on domestic labor than do father-professors (Suitor et al., 2001) . Indeed, the challenges of balancing work and family have been theorized (see Mason & Goulden, 2004) to account for the underrepresentation of women in the most powerful and prestigious levels of academics (e.g. as full professors, department chairs, and deans). A survey of doctorate recipients in the USA sponsored by the National Science Foundation demonstrated that men who became fathers early in their careers were substantially (38%) more likely to gain tenure than were women who became mothers (Mason & Goulden, 2002) . Thus, consistent with sociological data (Waldfogel, 1998) that suggests that being a parent inhibits the success of women more than men across occupations, I predict that mothers who work in the academy will be less likely to advance than will fathers. That is, Hypothesis 1: Compared to fathers, mothers will occupy lower levels (H1a), have lower incomes (H1b), and anticipate lower advancement potential (H1c).\nAlthough research has generally found discrepancies in the advancement of mothers and fathers (in general, and in the context of academics), little empirical evidence has tested potential explanations for this difference. Theoretical explanations utilize two primary, often polarized, interpretations: first, that mothers are making choices to disengage in work in favor of family, or second, that stereotypes and discrimination are at work. Consistent with the former 'choice' explanation, there is evidence to suggest that mothers are more likely to take leave and work part-time than are fathers (Stroh et al., 1992 (Stroh et al., , 1996 . Women tend to spend fewer hours at work (Keene & Reynolds, 2005) , are more likely to rearrange work hours and refuse overtime (Keene & Reynolds, 2005) , and are more likely to work parttime than men (Stroh et al., 1992) . However, consistent with the latter 'bias' interpretation, decision-makers may unfairly perceive mothers to be less able to work (Hebl & Foster, 2005; Hebl et al., 2007) . For example, experimentally manipulated targets that were depicted as mothers were rated as less competent than identical targets that were fathers (Cuddy et al., 2004) and were less likely to be hired (Correll & Benard, 2007) . Inaccurate assumptions may be made about mothers and fathers as a function of their parental status (Williams, 2001) . Indeed, women have reported that they felt limited by presumptions that their family responsibilities would interfere with work rather than actual conflict between their work and family responsibilities (Stoner & Hartman, 1990) . Although the limited existing research on these issues has taken the sole perspective of (and supported) one explanation or the other in isolation, social role theory incorporates both ideas and offers a framework for understanding genuine choices and biased perceptions."}, {"section_title": "A social role perspective", "text": "According to role theory (Katz & Kahn, 1978) , social roles can be defined as shared expectations about individuals who occupy particular social positions or categories. Gender roles can be understood as 'consensual beliefs about the attributes of men and women' (Eagly & Karau, 2002: 574) . Eagly (1987) proposed that the distribution of men and women into the social roles of breadwinner and homemaker lead to gender differences in 1) skills, beliefs, and attitudes, 2) stereotypes and expectations, and ultimately to 3) gender differences in behavior. Men and women engage in gender-appropriate behaviors and hone appropriate skills and feel better when they do so (Wood et al., 1997) . Because women occupy homemaker roles, they may acquire beliefs and attitudes that legitimize nurturant, caregiving, or helpful behaviors. Social role theory further posits that, 'differential role occupancy in the family and occupations fosters gender stereotypes by which each sex is expected to have characteristics that equip it to function adequately in its King The effect of bias on the advancement of working mothers 1 6 8 1 typical role' (Diekman & Eagly, 2000 : 1172 . That is, the norms that are associated with tasks that are typically assigned to men (i.e. work) and women (i.e. household labor) are translated into stereotypes. Gender role expectations facilitate the selection and placement of men and women into positions that fulfill stereotypic roles and limit their placement into counterstereotypic roles (Eagly, 1987) . Thus, social roles create not only genuine gender differences in attitudes and abilities, but also differential expectations and perceptions of men and women. With regard to parenting in particular, social roles that emerged from reproductive responsibilities that have been perpetuated over time (Wood & Eagly, 2000) dictate genuine and perceptual differences in parents such that fathers are (and should be) more highly involved in work, committed to work, flexible for work, and competent at work than mothers are (and should be) (see also Eagly & Steffen, 1986) . Thus, social role theory predicts that mothers and fathers will tend to have (and be perceived to have) systematically different attitudes (Pleck, 1977) . Specifically, it is expected that gender roles will dictate genuine gender differences such that mothers will be more likely to hold attitudes consistent with their homemaker role, whereas fathers will be more likely to endorse attitudes that support their breadwinner role. In particular, the current article focuses on constructs that have been of focus in work-family research (see Eby et al., 2005) that are likely to impact career success: involvement, flexibility, and commitment."}, {"section_title": "Role involvement", "text": "According to Paullay and colleagues (Paullay et al., 1994: 224) , role involvement can be defined as 'the degree to which one is cognitively preoccupied with, engaged in, and concerned with' a particular role. Role involvement can also be conceptualized as the investment of cognitive, emotional, physical, and time resources in a given role (Carlson & Frone, 2003) . For the purposes of the current research, involvement with one's job role is considered in relation to gender and to career success. Consistent with the predictions of social role theory, there is some evidence to suggest that women and men differ in work involvement according to their gender roles. Specifically, women tend to be more highly involved in family roles and men tend to be more highly involved in work roles (e.g. Baltes & Heydens-Gahir, 2003) . Thus, it is anticipated that, Hypothesis 2a: Mothers will report lower work involvement than will fathers.\nWork role involvement may be desired by organizational decision-makers because of its linkages with effort, innovation, and general work performance (see Kanungo, 1982) . For example, role involvement is positively correlated with time spent working (Frone & Rice, 1987) , which is in turn associated with career success (Ng et al., 2005) . As such, genuine and perceived gender differences in work role involvement might translate into differential rates of advancement for working mothers and fathers. It follows that one of the central questions in this research is whether decision-makers' estimations of employee work and family attitudes are the same for parents of both genders. It is expected that the discrepancy between what an individual reports and what others observe about them will vary as a function of their gender. Meta-analytic research suggests that self-and superior-ratings of performance are only moderately correlated (r = .35; Harris & Schaubroeck, 1988) , and recent research from a multi-trait multi-method perspective suggests that trait effects are generally larger than source effects, or in other words, that raters are less important than the traits they are rating (Woehr et al., 2005) . Given that ratings by superiors and subordinates should be moderately correlated, the emergence of any systematic gender differences between self-and superior-ratings can be conceptualized as bias (see also Shore & Thornton, 1986) .\nFollowing the tenets of social role theory, gender role stereotypes will influence decision-makers' perceptions of mothers and fathers on domains relevant to their gender roles (i.e. work and home; Eagly, 1987) . Specifically, because women are expected to devote their time and energy into their children as their top priority, whereas men are expected to devote their time and energy into work (Crittenden, 2001 ), mothers will likely be perceived to be less involved with work than fathers. In other words, according to social role theory, fathers will be stereotyped as higher in work role involvement than will mothers. Hypothesis 2b: Superiors will perceive that mothers have lower work involvement than fathers to a greater degree than the parents report themselves."}, {"section_title": "Commitment", "text": "Organizational commitment can be conceptualized as a psychological state that characterizes an employee's relationship with their organization and their attitudes toward continuation of membership in the organization (Meyer et al., 1993) . Meyer and Allen also identified three separate components of organizational commitment (1991): affective attachment to the organization (i.e. affective), perceived costs of leaving the organization (i.e. continuance), and obligation to remain in the organization (i.e. normative). There is little evidence to suggest that mothers and fathers genuinely differ in their relative levels of organizational commitment on any of these components. In fact, most research suggests that mothers and fathers have equal levels of attachment to their work (e.g. Bielby & Bielby, 1984; Marsden et al., 1993) .\nParticipants evaluated target subordinates with regard to their commitment to the organization using Meyer and Allen's three-component model (1991) . A sample item from the affective commitment subscale is, 'I really feel as if this organization's problems are my own.' A sample item from the continuance commitment subscale is, 'I feel that I have too few options to consider leaving this organization.' A sample item from the normative commitment subscale is, 'I would feel guilty if I left my organization right now.' The internal consistencies of these scales for self-reported (and superior-reported) commitment was .91 (.91), .80 (.78), and .86 (.86) for affective, continuance, and normative commitment."}, {"section_title": "Hypothesis 3a:", "text": "Mothers will report equivalent affective, normative, and continuance commitment to work as fathers.\nFrom the perspective of many organizations, the ideal worker is one who is committed to their work above all else (Epstein et al., 1999) . Such attachment may be desirable because it is positively associated with extra-role behaviors (Shore & Wayne, 1993) , and negatively associated with withdrawal behaviors (e.g. LeBlanc & Kelloway, 2002) . Thus, employees who are believed to have divided commitments, or to be less committed to their organization in general, may be held back from advancement opportunities. This is consistent with previous research that demonstrated a positive association between manager's assessments of subordinate's commitment and their promotability (Shore et al., 1995) . In other words, if mothers are inaccurately perceived to have less commitment to their organizations than their counterparts, their advancement in organizations may be unfairly obstructed.\nUnfortunately, then, perceptions about organizational commitment are likely to follow gender role stereotypes that indicate that children are their mothers' primary commitment. Because such stereotypes suggest that women do not prioritize work outside the home to the same extent as do fathers, mothers are likely to be perceived as less committed to their organizations (Crittenden, 2001) . Perceptions that mothers are not committed to their organizations are especially likely for continuance and normative components, which imply that employees have alternatives to working and that they have more important obligations than work. Consistent with this rationale, Ridgeway and Correll (2004) noted that there are normative cultural assumptions regarding a negative connection between the role of motherhood and the role of a committed worker. Thus, Hypothesis 3b: Superiors will perceive that mothers have lower affective, normative, and continuance commitment to work than fathers to a greater degree than parents report."}, {"section_title": "Flexibility", "text": "Gender differences may exist in the extent to which mothers and fathers are flexible for unpredictable work responsibilities. For example, research suggests that women are more likely to restructure their work schedules to meet their family demands than are men (Karambayya & Reilly, 1992) . Similarly, women are less likely than men to restructure their home responsibilities to meet the demands of work (Keene & Reynolds, 2005) . Because mothers tend to be responsible for childcare and household labor, it may be difficult for them to be flexible for work. Thus, it is expected that, Hypothesis 4a: Mothers will report less availability for work than will fathers.\nDifferences in availability for work demands might lead to gender differences in career success. In addition to being committed to and involved in the organization, ideal employees are those who are willing and able to 'devote enormous hours each week to \"face time\" at work, to work late nights or on weekends, and to drop everything at a moment's notice for a new work demand' (Ridgeway & Correll, 2004: 690) . This quote illustrates the expectation that employees should be not only practically available, but also psychologically flexible. Thus, any gender discrepancies in flexibility may lead to discrepancies in advancement.\nAs such, perceptions that mothers are inflexible with regard to work responsibilities can have negative consequences. Gender role stereotypes are expected to drive expectations that mothers direct their time and energy to their children first and foremost (Hays, 1996) and thus, perceptions arise that mothers are less flexible than fathers for work-related demands.\nHypothesis 4b: Superiors will perceive that mothers have lower availability for work than fathers to a greater degree than parents report."}, {"section_title": "Desire and flexibility for advancement", "text": "[M]en and women differ in what they state are their priorities in life. To sum it up: men, on average, are more likely to chase status at the expense of their families; women give a more balanced weighting. (Pinker, 2005) Steven Pinker's observation, which was made in response to Harvard President Larry Summers's controversial remarks about the status of women King The effect of bias on the advancement of working mothers 1 6 8 5 in science disciplines, is more consistent with gender role stereotypes than with empirical evidence. That is, little empirical evidence suggests that women have less desire to advance than men. In fact, research suggests that men and women are equally motivated to achieve success. For example, men and women's attitudes toward career advancement were found to be equivalent among a sample of managerial, professional, and technical employees (Rynes & Rosen, 1983) . In another more recent sample of human resource workers, mothers actually reported higher levels of desire for advancement than did fathers and individuals without children (King et al., 2008) . Furthermore, there are few gender differences in the acceptance of developmental opportunities that might lead to advancement (Rynes & Rosen, 1983) . For example, the number and ages of children are not related to either mothers' or fathers' willingness to relocate for work (Brett et al., 1993) . It follows that, Hypothesis 5a: Mothers and fathers will report equivalent desire and flexibility for advancement.\nHowever, married women tend to be offered fewer relocation opportunities than do married men (Eby et al., 1999) . This tendency is likely driven by the influence of gender role stereotypes on assumptions about the desire and flexibility that mothers have for advancement. In other words, despite little empirical evidence to support such expectations, assumptions about the desire and flexibility of mothers for advancement might limit their advancement in organizations. Similarly, gender role stereotypes of men and fathers as agentic lead to assumptions that they seek success and status. Because the socially constructed requirements of being a 'good father' are congruent with those of being a 'good worker' (e.g. being available for work), whereas the requirements of being a 'good mother' (e.g. being available for children) are incongruent with those of being a 'good worker' (Fuegen et al., 2004; Kobrynowicz & Biernat, 1997) , mothers will be perceived as less interested in career success.

For example, the degree to which an individual is involved in work likely reflects the investment of psychological and physical energy that would lead to organizational accomplishments. According to Ng and colleagues' metaanalysis (2005) , studies measuring work centrality or willingness to transfer found small positive relationships with salary and number of promotions received, but additional attitudes about work and family (e.g. commitment, flexibility) were not represented in the literature reviewed. Very little research has considered the influence of perceptions of attitudes on advancement despite an assumed or implied association. The extent to which decisionmakers perceive that individuals hold such attitudes may lead to advancement from a sponsorship perspective (i.e. a sponsored mobility perspective).\nOrganizational elites may give favorable opportunities to and evaluations of those who they believe will help them succeed (Ng et al., 2005) , including for example, individuals who are perceived to be available whenever they are needed for work. Given the limited nature of research on this topic, it would be difficult to make specific predictions about the relative importance of any one particular attitude. Instead, the current research provides a global test of the extent to which gender-linked attitudes about work and family are related to advancement overall. It is theorized that gender role stereotypes will drive biased perceptions of mothers and fathers that account for the 'maternal wall'. That is, over and above the effects of genuine differences, differential predictions of mothers and fathers are expected to explain the discrepant organizational status of mothers and fathers such that, Hypothesis 6: Superiors' perceptions of attitudes toward work and family (i.e. involvement, commitment, flexibility, desire and flexibility for advancement) will be related to organizational advancement over and above parents' self-ratings.\nPrevious research has documented a general tendency for mothers to be less successful than fathers (see Williams, 2001) . Researchers have attempted to explain this trend through rationale that considers family responsibilities and bias explanations independently. As detailed previously, I theorize that gender role stereotypes will drive biased perceptions of mothers and fathers that account for the 'maternal wall' (Williams & Segal, 2004) . That is, I have argued that over and above the effects of genuine gender differences, the behaviors of mothers and fathers will be perceived differently. These perceptions, in turn, are expected to explain the discrepant organizational status of mothers and fathers.

Correlations with gender are non-parametric (Spearman-Brown).\nthe pairs of variables of interest was .33 (see Table 3 ), indicating that the two sources were moderately correlated (and had an average intra-class correlation of .51). A hierarchical regression analysis tested H1a-c by considering the extent to which Parent Gender predicted indicators of advancement after controlling for appropriate covariates. After controlling for demographic variables that have been previously linked to advancement (i.e. ethnicity, age, tenure, and marital status), Parent Gender did not predict variance in Level (H1a), but did account for additional variance in Total Income (\u03b2 = -.25, \u0394R 2 = .06, p < .01) (H1b) and Superior Expected Advancement (\u03b2 = -.25, \u0394R 2 = .06, p < .05), and a similar (but non-significant) effect emerged for Expected Advancement (\u03b2 = -.13, \u0394R2 = .02, p < .10, NS). There were no effects of Parent Gender on Advancement Satisfaction, Current Level, or Highest Level Expected (see Table 4 ). Thus, H1b and H1c were supported while H1a did not receive support; mothers made less money and were expected to advance less than fathers. Hypothesis 2a anticipated that mothers would report less work involvement than fathers. According to an independent sample t-test, this hypothesis was disconfirmed: mothers actually reported higher levels of Work Involvement (M = 4.32, SD = 1.00) than did fathers (M = 3.95, SD = 1.00), t(156) = -2.31, p < .05). Hypothesis 2b specified that superiors would underestimate mothers' involvement relative to fathers. To overcome difficulties in using differences scores as a criterion, Edwards (1995 Edwards ( , 2002 suggested that multivariate regression analyses be utilized to predict the component dependent variables from identical models. The coefficients from King The effect of bias on the advancement of working mothers 1 6 9 3 these models can be compared to clarify whether a particular predictor (i.e. Parent Gender) is differentially related to each component (i.e. self-and supervisor-ratings), and the significance of the difference between betas can be derived from Wilks' \u03bb and its associated F test. Following Edwards's (1995) guidelines, Parent Gender was entered into two regression equations for each construct; one equation that predicted self-ratings and the other equation that predicted supervisor-ratings of the target construct (see Table 5 ). Supporting H2b, Parent Gender was differentially related to self-and superior-reports of Work Involvement (Wilks \u03bb = .85, p < .01); Parent Gender was more strongly related to superior than self-ratings of Work Involvement. Hypothesis 3a predicted that there would be no difference in the commitment reported by mothers and fathers. Mothers and fathers reported similar levels of Affective Commitment (M = 4.84 and 4.59, respectively) and Normative Commitment (M = 3.80 and 3.46, respectively, p > .10, NS). However, mothers reported higher levels of Continuance Commitment (M = 4.12, SD = 1.11) than did fathers (M = 3.72, SD = 1.13), t(156) = -2.23, p < .05. Thus, H3a was partially supported. Providing some support for H3b, Parent Gender was somewhat more related to superior-reports of Continuance Commitment (but not Affective or Normative Commitment) than to self-reports (Wilks \u03bb = .93, p < .10, NS).\nKing The effect of bias on the advancement of working mothers 1 6 9 5 Table 4 The effect of parent gender on advancement Hypothesis 4a specified that mothers would report less availability for work than would fathers. This prediction was not supported by a t-test; mothers and fathers reported similar levels of Availability (M = 4.91 and 5.21, respectively), p > .10, NS. Hypothesis 4b received weak support; Parent Gender was somewhat more strongly related to superior-reports of Flexibility than self-reports (Wilks \u03bb = .91, p < .10, NS)."}, {"section_title": "Dependent variables ------------------------------", "text": "Hypothesis 5a predicted that mothers and fathers would report equivalent Desire and Flexibility for Advancement. In accordance with H5a, there Human Relations 61(12) 1 6 9 6 Table 5 Parent gender as a predictor of self and superiors' ratings of work-family attitudes was no evidence of difference in mothers' and fathers' Desire for Advancement (M = 5.55 and 5.36, respectively) or Flexibility for Advancement (M = 4.67 and 4.60, respectively, p > .10, NS). Supporting H5b, Parent Gender was more strongly related to superiors' ratings of Flexibility for Advancement than self-ratings (Wilks \u03bb = .85, p < .01), and a similar but non-significant trend emerged for Desire for Advancement (Wilks \u03bb = .94, p < .10, NS). Hypotheses 6 and 7 predict that superiors' ratings will account for variance in advancement, and for the relationship between gender and advancement, after controlling for self-reports. Both hypotheses can be tested in a series of hierarchical regression analyses which include the covariates in the first step of each regression model, gender in the second step, and selfreports of attitudes related to work and family in the third step. In separate models, the third step will include self-ratings only and self-and superiorratings together. To more directly test the mediated effect, I used the procedure outlined by Freedman and Schatzkin (1992) and confirmed by MacKinnon and colleagues (2002) . Despite a general tendency to utilize Baron and Kenny's (1986) procedures for testing statistical mediation, several statisticians have noted problems with this approach (including, of most relevance to the current study, low power) and have proposed as many as 13 alternative approaches (e.g. MacKinnon et al., 2000 MacKinnon et al., , 2002 . Most of these approaches use the basic procedure of comparing regression models with and without the hypothesized mediator, but the tests vary with regard primarily to the manner in which a significant effect is determined. To compare the relative performance of each test, MacKinnon and colleagues (2002) conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study of the methods of testing mediation. Based on the results of the simulation, the authors suggested that particular tests provide optimal power and Type I error rates depending on the constraints of the data."}, {"section_title": "Dependent", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Independent variables variables ------------------------------", "text": "Following MacKinnon and colleagues' (2002) recommendations, power in the current study can be maximized without creating Type I error utilizing the Freedman-Schatzkin test as follows (Freedman & Schatzkin, 1992 ). First, I tested the extent to which self-ratings account for the relationship between gender and those three dependent variables for which Parent Gender was a meaningful predictor (Tables 6-8 ). As expected, the relationship between Parent Gender and Total Income was somewhat lower after including those self-reported attitudes, though this effect did not reach the .05 level of significance (t FS (127) = -1.25 p < .10, NS). Similarly, the relationship between Parent Gender and Expected Advancement decreased significantly after adding self-reported mediators (t FS (120) = -1.64, p < .01).

As predicted, the relationship between Parent Gender and Total Income was significantly lower after including both self-and superiorratings of attitudes (t FS (55) = -10.54, p < .01). In addition, providing support for H6, superior ratings accounted for an additional 27 percent of the variance in total income over and above self-ratings. Similarly, the relationship between Parent Gender and Expected Advancement decreased significantly after adding self-and superior-reported mediators (t FS (48) = -3.17, p < .01), and the addition of superior-ratings contributed 9 percent of variance above self-ratings. Finally, the relationship between Parent Gender and Superior Expected Advancement (t FS (53) = -24.12, p < .01) was accounted for by self-and superior-ratings. Moreover, the addition of superior-ratings explained 30 percent more variance than did self-ratings alone. Thus, hypotheses 6 and 7 received support; both self-and superiorratings of attitudes partially accounted for the relationship between parent gender and advancement.\nIn addition to testing the omnibus effect of superiors' ratings of junior faculty's attitudes toward work and family, the current data also allow for exploration of the relative importance of individual mediating variables. Following the procedure detailed by MacKinnon (2000) , I conducted contrast tests comparing the magnitude of each of the superiors' ratings that approached statistical significance in the mediation models. This procedure requires calculation of the square root of the variance of the difference between mediated effects based on the multivariate delta method (for details, see MacKinnon, 2000) . Comparisons between superiors' perceptions of Work Involvement and Continuance Commitment (Upper Limit = 26,042; Lower Limit = 3898), as well as Work Involvement and Flexibility for Advancement (Upper Limit = 18,221, Lower Limit = 1618), suggested that perceived Work Involvement accounted for more variance in the relationship between Parent Gender and Total Income (i.e. the confidence interval around the contrast did not include zero). However, there did not appear to be a difference in the magnitude of the effects of Continuance Commitment and Flexibility for Advancement (i.e. the confidence interval included zero; Upper limit = 2503, lower limit = -12,606). There were no individual superior ratings that approached significance as mediators in predicting Expected Advancement, so no contrast effects were conducted for this dependent King The effect of bias on the advancement of working mothers 1 7 0 1 variable. However, both Affective Commitment and Desire for Advancement appeared to be meaningful predictors of Superiors' Expected Advancement. A contrast analysis suggested that these variables were comparable in their effect (upper limit = .52, lower limit = -1.22)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The goal of this study was to extend a growing body of research regarding the increasingly important work-family interface (Zedeck & Moiser, 1990) by clarifying whether gender disparities in parents' advancement (Williams, 2001 ) are driven by legitimate or inaccurate differences in attitudes. Consistent with social role theory (Eagly, 1987) , the pattern of findings suggests that mothers' advancement lags behind fathers, that there are genuine and perceived gender differences in attitudes toward work and family, and that both genuine and perceived attitudes partially account for the relationship between parent gender and advancement. Thus, this research implies that stereotypes may impede mothers' success relative to fathers. Specifically, the current data demonstrate that mothers lag behind fathers with regard to income and expected advancement. This is consistent with previous sociological data from across industries and occupations (Waldfogel, 1998) , but extends this research by considering the advancement of faculty while controlling for potential differences due to age, marital status, organizational tenure, and ethnicity. These results suggest that mothers in academe may encounter a 'maternal wall' (e.g. Crosby et al., 2004) similar to that experienced by mothers in other fields. Contrary to expectations, mothers and fathers reported comparable levels of attitudes related to work and family with the exception of work involvement and continuance commitment. Even in these cases, mothers reported higher levels than did fathers, suggesting that mother-professors' attitudes related to work and family are not consistent with stereotypes. Mothers may be even more involved in work than their counterparts, and may feel a greater need to continue working for their organizations than do fathers. These findings may be due to recognition on the part of mother-professors that more effort and attention is required for their advancement.\nHowever, stereotypes about mothers and fathers have persisted among academics in several areas. Gender was a stronger predictor of superior ratings of work involvement and flexibility for advancement (but not commitment) than self-ratings. Superiors perceived that mothers were less involved in work and less flexible for advancement than fathers than the professors reported themselves. The results of previous research suggest that there are unique expectations of parents (especially mothers) compared with non-parents (e.g. Cuddy et al., 2004; Williams & Segal, 2004) , and that mothers who work outside the home earn substantially lower salaries than fathers (e.g. Budig & England, 2001 ). The current research represents an important step toward linking the results of laboratory research on maternal stereotypes with those of field surveys on the maternal wall by exploring the role of parent gender in supervisors' expectations of attitudes about work and family. The results suggest that stereotypes about working mothers may indeed influence the evaluations that their superiors provide, and therefore, that bias may partially account for the challenges mothers face in advancing in organizations (Cuddy et al., 2004) . Consistent with social role theory (Eagly, 1987) , which suggests that the breadwinner and homemaker roles that mothers and fathers are generally expected to fulfill create expectations that fathers are more involved, committed, and skilled in work than are mothers, the current results suggest that superiors underestimate the involvement and flexibility of mothers.\nIn addition, these results suggest that some of employees' self-rated attitudes were related to their success, as were those perceptions of their superiors. Confirming Ng and colleagues' meta-analytic conclusions (2005), this study shows that both contest-and sponsored-mobility perspectives explain advancement in organizations. It is both what employees say they do (i.e. contest perspective), and what superiors perceive that they do (i.e. sponsored perspective), that predicts career success. Additionally, the pattern of relations that emerged in the current study suggests that gender-based discrepancies in assumptions about parents' work-and family attitudes might unfairly inhibit the success of mothers. Consistent with social role theory (Eagly, 1987) , the results of the current study show that part of the explanation for the 'maternal wall' is genuine differences in the attitudes of mothers and fathers. Because the overall mediation analyses suggest that superior-ratings of attitudes toward work and family (which are contaminated by systematic gender differences) account for additional variance in the relationship between parent gender and advancement, the results suggest that bias contributes to the maternal wall. In particular, the exploratory analyses suggest that perceptions of work involvement may be particularly important in explaining why mothers earn less than fathers. In addition, perceptions of affective commitment and desire for advancement were of distinct importance in explaining gender differences in supervisors' expectations of parents' advancement."}, {"section_title": "Theoretical implications", "text": "These findings inform both 'family needs' (i.e. gender differences due entirely to choices mothers make) and 'bias' (i.e. gender differences due entirely to discrimination) explanations for mothers' slow advancement compared to fathers. Whereas previous research has focused solely on one explanation or the other in isolation, the current research suggests that each perspective holds part of the answer. These results support the application of social role theory to understanding gender differences in the advancement of working parents, and refute sole reliance on either 'family needs' or 'bias' explanations that ignore the impact of the alternative explanation. In addition, the results imply that despite empirical evidence that involvement in multiple roles can be beneficial for employees (e.g. Pratt & Rosa, 2003; Rothbard & Edwards, 2003; Ruderman et al., 2002) , common 'wisdom' perpetuates the expectation that the roles of mother and worker are incompatible (see also Barnett & Hyde, 2001) . That is, rather than viewing motherhood as a potential source of facilitation of the work role, participants in this study seemed to view motherhood as a distraction. The current findings also support Ng and colleagues' (2005) conclusion that advancement in organizations can be understood through both contest-and sponsored-mobility perspectives; advancement may depend on an individual's behaviors as well as sponsorship or support from organizational elites. This integration of social role theory and mobility frameworks provides a unique theoretical lens through which to understand the advancement of mothers in organizations."}, {"section_title": "Practical implications", "text": "Furthermore, these results have practical implications for organizational decision-makers. Because reliance on stereotypes (including parental and gender-based stereotypes) is most likely under subjective conditions, it may be important for practitioners to construct decision-making strategies that rely on objective data and to increase awareness of such stereotypes. The results of exploratory contrast tests suggest that it may be most important to address supervisors' perceptions of mothers' involvement in work, commitment to work, and desire for advancement. The results also imply that mothers have an opportunity to proactively combat the stereotypes by directly clarifying their desire for advancement, availability for developmental opportunities, and commitment to work to ensure that false assumptions are not relied upon in decision-making. It may be that the efforts of organizations, joined by the efforts of the targets of bias, create the most effective change."}, {"section_title": "Limitations and directions for future research", "text": "It is critical to acknowledge the limitations of the generalizability of this research. First, the data collection procedure was cross-sectional in nature and thus causality cannot be clearly designated. Although variability in age and organizational tenure were controlled, more longitudinal research is needed to more accurately capture advancement over time. Second, a potentially limiting issue is the specific sample utilized; the results of the current study might not generalize outside of academia. Compared to many professions, it may be easier for academics to balance work and family (e.g. leave work early to care for a sick child). This implies that the impact of the interface on advancement may be different depending on the job type and points to the importance of either methodologically controlling for job type (as in the current study) or examining a wide range of job types. Also related to the sample, though senior faculty typically participate in tenure decisions, the amount of influence likely varies across institutions and departments. The degree to which genuine and perceived attitudes affect success could actually be stronger in less flexible professions or when perceivers' (potentially biased) evaluations are sole and direct determinants of promotions. In addition, the independent nature of work in academe suggests that the amount of information or knowledge that senior colleagues have regarding junior faculty's professional and personal lives may be limited. This may increase the likelihood of stereotyping, given that individuals are more likely to rely on stereotypes when information is ambiguous (see Dovidio & Gaertner, 2000) . Nevertheless, it is clear from the current and previous research (e.g. Mason & Goulden, 2004 ) that mothers are finding academics to be a challenging context in which to balance family and success in much the same way as do mothers in other professions, and that this is an important context to work toward understanding the maternal wall.\nA final and important limitation is that this research focused on comparisons between mothers and fathers without reference to their nonparent counterparts, weakening conclusions regarding 'maternal' (rather than simply gender) bias. Indeed, it is possible that women in general (and not mothers in particular) are expected to be less involved in work and flexible for advancement than men in general (and not fathers in particular). As such, the implications of the current findings for understanding the maternal wall are inherently less direct than would be ideal. Although the nature of the theory and constructs of interest are most applicable to parents, it is important that future research test differences with regard to the interaction of gender and parental status.\nGiven these limitations, it is clear that more research is needed to fully understand the complex experiences and perceptions of working parents. For example, it is critical that future research begins to consider family-related attitudes as a class of determinants of career success. The current research is the first to highlight the importance of genuine attitudes and their perceptions in predicting career success, and more evidence is needed to understand the conditions that give rise to these patterns and in particular the strategies through which stereotypes might be overcome. Relatedly, it would be useful to examine characteristics of individuals who are most likely to enact stereotypes about mothers. It may be that supervisors who have children, or those who are women, understand that becoming a mother does not necessarily interfere with effective work."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Following social role theory, I have theorized and found that perceptions about gender, work, and family can unjustly support the advancement of fathers relative to mothers. Thus, the current research makes three important contributions. First, this research provides a test of the extent to which career success is influenced by attitudes toward work and family, and shows that indeed, these attitudes are correlated with parents' advancement. Second, this study provides evidence of the manner in which maternal bias is manifested by demonstrating gender differences in the relationship between genuine and perceived work-family attitudes. Third, this research suggests that mothers' advancement is attributable in part to inaccurate assumptions about parents' work-family attitudes. The increasing importance of the work-family interface and the persistent nature of inequity in the workplace underscore the need for continued attention to this topic."}]
