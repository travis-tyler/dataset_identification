Pathways contributing to the increase in VT risk have been demonstrated for several hemostatic measures, including endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, total protein S, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), normalized activated protein C (APC) sensitivity ratio (nAPCsr), and antithrombin, levels of which are associated with oral use of these exogenous estrogens and progestins [5] [6] [7] [8] . Furthermore, high levels of endogenous free and total testosterone (T) have been positively associated with some cardiovascular biomarkers and disease risk among midlife and postmenopausal women [9] [10] [11] . Although a substantial body of research has formed regarding the positive association between use of oral exogenous estrogens and progestins and both hemostatic factor levels and VT event risk [1] [2] [3] [4] , the relationship between endogenous steroid hormone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and precursor steroid levels and thrombotic risk is poorly characterized.\nBetter characterization of the relationship between endogenous hormone and hemostatic factor levels may provide insights into the underlying risk of thromboembolic disease in postmenopausal women. Eight hemostatic biomarkers were previously measured among Heart and Vascular Health (HVH) study participants, including the four parameters of thrombin generation (TG), nAPCsr, factor VII activity (FVIIc), antithrombin activity (ATc), and total protein S antigen (PSAg). Thrombin plays a multitude of roles in the complex coagulation system, and TG is useful as a global measure of plasma's tendency to generate thrombin [12] . The TG assay produces a TG curve composed of four parameters that characterize: initiation (lag time); time to thrombin peak; peak thrombin concentration; and the individual's ETP. Greater TG peak and ETP levels have been positively associated with the risk of incident VT [13] . From the ETP-based nAPCsr, resistance to APC can be quantified, with high nAPCsr values being positively associated with VT risk [14] . The complex formed by tissue factor (TF) and FVIIc initiates the coagulation cascade; however, high FVIIc levels have not consistently been associated with an increased risk of VT [15, 16] . The natural anticoagulant ATc inactivates the coagulation cascade by binding with heparin, and ATc levels have been shown to be one of the primary determinants associated negatively with thrombin formation [17] . In the presence of APC, PSAg shows anticoagulant activity, and lower PSAg levels are thought to be associated with a higher VT risk, although evidence for an association between PSAg levels and VT risk in population-based studies is lacking [18] . The levels of most of these hemostatic factors have not previously In this cross-sectional analysis among postmenopausal women not using HT at the time of phlebotomy, we evaluated the relationship between postmenopausal endogenous steroid hormones, SHBG, and precursor steroid levels and hemostatic factor levels. Given the greater risk of VT associated with exogenous HT use, we hypothesized a priori that estrogen levels (E2 and E1) would be positively associated with measures of TG, nAPCsr values, and FVIIc, and negatively associated with levels of the anticoagulant factors ATc and PSAg. A priori, we hypothesized that there would be similar directional differences in hemostatic factors associated with higher total and free T and with lower levels of SHBG, given the relationships between high free and total T levels and cardiovascular biomarkers and disease, and the relationship between lower SHBG levels and higher levels of circulating androgens. As the adrenal and precursor steroids DHEAS, DHEA and androstenedione are converted into androgens, and, to a lesser extent, estrogens, we a priori hypothesized that there would be similar directional differences in hemostatic factor levels associated with higher levels of DHEAS, DHEA, and androstenedione."}, {"section_title": "Materials and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Setting and study design", "text": "This cross-sectional study was conducted within the HVH study, which is a population-based, case-control study set in Group Health Cooperative (GHC), an integrated healthcare system in Washington State.

Subjects eligible for study inclusion were females aged 18-89 years with an index date between 2003 and 2010 who had consented to blood draw, had provided a blood specimen, had not been prescribed an anticoagulant in the previous 180 days, were not currently using oral estrogen-alone or estrogen plus progesterone HT, and who were postmenopausal at the time of blood draw (n = 3353). A woman was considered to be postmenopausal if there was a notation of the cessation of menses in the medical record or at \u2265 55 years of age.

Women not using oral estrogencontaining HT for whom hemostatic factor levels were measured were randomly selected, with non-HT users matched to the age distribution of users of oral HT. Current and recent oral HT use at the time of phlebotomy was determined from GHC computerized pharmacy records, which included prescription fill dates, medication quantity, and dosing instructions or the anticipated days' supply, assuming 80% compliance.

Prior to shipment, samples were stored for an average of 4.5 years (standard deviation [SD] 2.0). Samples were thawed once in October 2010, for these measurements of hemostatic factors.\nThe TG assay measured four TG parameters: lag time, time to peak, peak thrombin concentration value, and the area under the curve, which approximates ETP [17] . A fluorogenic assay (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France) was used to measure these four TG parameters (coefficient of variation [CV] for ETP from normal pooled plasma: 19.8%) [8] . The ETP-based nAPCsr was estimated from the normalized ratio of the area under the TG curve without added APC to the area under the TG curve with added APC [22] . ETP in the absence of APC had been measured as part of the TG assay; ETP in the presence of APC was measured with a fluorogenic assay (Thrombinoscope TM, Synapse BV, Maastricht, the Netherlands). FVIIc and ATc were measured with the STA-R analyzer (Diagnostica Stago) (CVs: 9.2% and 3.0%, respectively). PSAg levels were measured with an ELISA (Diagnostica Stago) (CV with a commercial quality control: 4.2%) [8] .\nHormone measurements Stored EDTA plasma samples were transported locally on dry ice from storage to the Department of Veterans Affairs in Seattle, where hormone levels were measured in February 2014.

Spearman correlation coefficients were computed among the endogenous hormone levels, among the hemostatic factor levels, and between each endogenous hormone and each hemostatic factor.\nMultiple linear regression with robust standard errors was used to model the association between each individual hormone and hemostatic factor level, adjusting for potential confounders: linear age, linear BMI (kg m \u00c02 ), current versus never/past smoking status, treated diabetes, treated hypertension, non-white versus white race, prevalent CVD, and surgical versus natural menopause. Linear regression models were used to estimate the adjusted average difference in the hemostatic factor level associated with a 1-unit higher endogenous hormone level. To standardize comparisons within each hormone across hemostatic factors, adjusted average differences were expressed as the percentage of one hemostatic factor SD associated with a 1-SD difference in the hormone level [([b 9 SD hormone ]/SD hemostatic factor ) 9 100]. Although not tested statistically, a visual inspection of scatterplots did not lead us to suspect that associations deviated from linearity. Scatterplots were inspected visually for possible outlying values, which were excluded from sensitivity analyses. Histograms were used to evaluate the distribution of each hormone and hemostatic factor for evidence of skewness, and all hormones and hemostatic factors other than TG peak and PSAg had evidence of skew. In sensitivity analyses, we natural logtransformed all hormones and hemostatic factors, including TG peak and PSAg, for ease of interpretation and consistency.\nFor each hormone, there were eight tests for association with hemostatic factors, so we defined the nominal P-value required for statistical significance as 0.00625 (0.05/8). To reduce the possibility of Type I error across all hormones, we set an overall threshold of statistical significance, which was a Bonferroni-corrected level of 0.00069 (0.05/72 tests).\nIn secondary analyses, separately for each hemostatic factor, we performed linear regression analyses with all hormone exposures and other covariates in one model. We used likelihood ratio tests to evaluate whether there was any association between hormone levels and differences in each hemostatic factor level, using a threshold for statistical significance of 0.00625 (0.05/8 hemostatic factors).

Other associations were no longer nominally statistically significant.\nIn secondary analyses that included all hormone levels and covariates in one model per hemostatic factor level, there was evidence of a significant association between differences in hormone levels and differences in PSAg levels (likelihood ratio test, P = 0.0020).

Our study's relatively small sample size limits power, and additional studies in larger samples are warranted. Plasma samples were stored prior to the measurement of hemostatic factor and endogenous hormone levels. The effect of long-term sample storage on hemostatic factor levels is unclear [8] , but many hemostatic factor measurements appear to be relatively stable in plasma samples stored for up to 2 years [33] . Although the rank order of endogenous steroid hormone levels, including E2, total T, and free T, appears to be relatively stable over at least 3 years of storage [34] , long-term sample storage appeared to decrease SHBG levels in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging in men [35] . Although the women eligible for this study were not using HT at the time of phlebotomy, and no participants had used HT in in the 2 months prior to blood draw, women who had previously used HT were included; we did not evaluate differences by ever versus never HT use, owing to our study's relatively small sample size. Furthermore, our study predominantly included women in late postmenopause; therefore, it was underpowered to evaluate the possibility of an interaction by early versus late postmenopausal status.\nOur primary analyses included all observations. In sensitivity analyses that excluded women with possible outlying hormone values, estimated adjusted average differences in hemostatic factor levels were similar. As expected, associations and P-values were slightly diminished, with two of the three primary findings remaining significant at a level of P < 0.00069 (DHEAS with TG peak, and DHEAS with ETP). Although normality of the exposure and outcome variables is not required to fit a valid linear regression model [36] , in small samples, the largest observations of explanatory variables with skewed distributions can have a large influence. To reduce this influence, we conducted sensitivity analyses using natural log-transformed hormone and hemostatic factor levels to determine impact on the primary analyses. The results from natural log-transformed analyses suggested similar directional differences in hemostatic factor levels as in primary analyses, but several associations that had been statistically significant in primary analyses became non-significant, and two associations (E2 with ATc, and DHEA with TG peak) became significant at a level of P < 0.00625. Although there was some difference in the significance of associations, it is unclear whether the transformed data better represent associations. Given that few published studies have evaluated the associations between hormone levels and hemostatic factor levels in postmenopausal women, it will be of interest to determine whether associations identified as significant in primary and sensitivity analyses are present in other study populations.\nA strength of our study was the inclusion of measures of TG, which is a global marker for thrombotic risk. Another strength is that our study utilized sensitive LC-MS/MS methods of hormone measurement, which enabled us to capture generally low levels of endogenous hormones present in postmenopausal women."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this study of postmenopausal women not currently using HT, we found statistically significant evidence that higher E1 levels were associated with lower levels of the natural anticoagulant, PSAg.

When we corrected only for comparisons made within hormones, there was some suggestion that higher E2 and DHEA levels were associated with lower PSAg levels, that higher E1 levels were associated with lower ATc levels, and that higher DHEAS levels were associated with lower nAPCsr values.
