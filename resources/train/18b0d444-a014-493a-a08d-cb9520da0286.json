As future leaders, junior scientists are uniquely poised to shape the culture and practice of science in response to these challenges. A group of postdocs in the Boston area who are invested in improving the scientific endeavor, planned a symposium held on October 2 and 3 , 2014, as a way to join the discussion about the future of US biomedical research. Here we present a report of the proceedings of participant-driven workshops and the organizers' synthesis of the outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Executive summary", "text": "The Future of Research Symposium, held in Boston in October 2014, was born out of a desire on the part of junior scientists to influence discussions about the future of biomedical research in the United States. We the organizers believe that current trainees in academic research represent a talented pool of people contributing to scientific progress. This pool, however, is far larger than the current academic system is able to support in the long term. As structural forces governing the funding and administration of science push many graduate students and postdocs out of research, the public funds supporting their training are poorly repaid.\nWhile scientists continue to advocate for increased funding, they must also create a scientific enterprise that is sustainable with the current resources. A sustainable long-term investment in science, including the young people who carry it out, is essential to the longterm economic and social interests of the US. In the experience of the organizers, the current hyper-competitive environment stunts scientific curiosity and productivity, breeds fabrication and carelessness in the publication of data, and leads to a waste of valuable resources and intellectual capital. In all of our discussions of these problems, we have kept two goals in mind: to maximize the potential for wide-ranging and fundamental scientific discovery; and to minimize the loss of talented young researchers who can contribute greatly to science.\nIn addition to voicing our concerns, we junior scientists recognize that we need to become more aware of the issues facing the research enterprise, comprised of academia, industry, publishing, and government. To accomplish this, the initial sessions of the symposium consisted of a series of talks and panel discussions from leaders who have been outspoken about the challenges that science faces. These were followed by workshops designed to elicit the opinions and ideas of participants, largely postdocs and graduate students, on problems and solutions surrounding training, the structure of the research workforce, funding, and incentives and rewards in science. We present the outcomes of those discussions in this report, conveying in aggregate many young biomedical scientists' concerns about the sustainability of the research enterprise and our hopes for change.\nFrom the many ideas presented in the workshops and continued discussions among the organizers, we have distilled the following three principles to guide future activities towards scientific reform:\n1. We recommend increased connectivity among junior scientists and other stakeholders to promote discussions on reforming the structure of the scientific enterprise.\n2. We advocate for increased transparency. This includes the number and career outcomes of trainees, as well as the expectations of the balance between employment and training in individual postdoctoral appointments.\n3. We call for an increased investment in junior scientists, with increased numbers of grants that provide financial independence from Principal Investigator (PI) research grants, and increased accountability for the quality of training as a requirement of funding approval.\nAs the engine of academic research, junior scientists must claim a voice fitting their role as major stakeholders in the scientific enterprise. Equally, junior scientists must be educated about their role so that they have the context necessary to make a well-informed contribution and to effectively advocate for their interests. By bringing our concerns into the conversation that guides policy, the dialogue will be enriched with diversity and fresh perspectives. We encourage our peers to continue this conversation, engage their colleagues, and to get involved in shaping the Future of Research."}, {"section_title": "Context for the Future of Research Symposium", "text": "\"\"The government should provide a reasonable number of undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships in order to develop scientific talent in American youth.

We have made a number of changes in response to the suggestions from Dr. Gibbs. We feel that these changes significantly improve the focus and tone of the paper. First, we have moved the pre-registration survey, exit survey, and media response sections to the supplemental material. They can now be found in Appendices 1, 3, and 4 in Dataset 1, respectively. The remainder of the text has been organized as suggested into three main sections: background and context; the symposium itself; and conclusions and recommendations. In the symposium section, we have used charts to summarize the outcomes of each of the four workshops. We find that this significantly improves the readability of these sections and appreciate the suggestions. We have left the original text in these sections as we felt that the charts alone did not provide all the information the reader required.\nAs to the comments on tone, we have clarified when we are sharing an opinion and when we are presenting established fact.\nWe have ensured that all facts are supported with appropriate references.

This process is overseen by a committee of 3-5 faculty members and requires the development of some core skills.\nIn contrast, it is notoriously difficult to determine how many postdoctoral scholars there are, let alone what kind of training they are or should be receiving. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) define a postdoctoral scholar as \"an individual who has received a doctoral degree (or equivalent) and is engaged in a temporary and defined period of mentored advanced training to enhance the professional skills and research independence needed to pursue his or her chosen career path\" (Bravo & Olsen, 2007 In spite of the number of years spent in pre-and postdoctoral training, the organizers perceive that many scientists feel that they are inadequately prepared for any job other than conducting research. Many feel they are unaware of what jobs they should be training for, let alone what skills those jobs require. One common complaint we hear among our colleagues is that scientists are not being prepared for non-faculty positions, yet in the organizer's experience many new faculty appear unprepared for their non-research responsibilities (such as managing employees and budgets or teaching and we feel that we are not even being properly trained to become future faculty.\nWhere did all the graduate students and postdocs come from? While the number of US graduate students in biomedical science have increased from about 46,500 in 1993 (Table B -18 in (National Science Foundation, 1994) ) to almost 71,000 in 2012 (Table 16 in (National Science Foundation, 2014)), the fraction of PhDs in life sciences in a tenure-track position 5 years post-PhD decreased from 17.3% (1993) to 10.6% (2010) ( Table 3 -18 in (National Science Board, 2014)). There has also been a tremendous shift in the job market outside of academia over the past decades, with a general slowdown and even contractions in government and industry. This situation has long been deemed unsustainable by many senior academics (Bourne, 2013a; Stephan, 2012a; Stephan, 2012b; Teitelbaum, 2008) .\nWith the number of graduate students increasing faster than the number of faculty positions (Figure 1 in (Schillebeeckx et al., 2013) ), it is unsurprising that the NIH estimates that the number of postdoctoral researchers also doubled during that time. However, estimates of the number of postdocs vary drastically. The National Research Council puts the number of postdocs at just over 50,000 (National Research Council (US) Committee to Study the National Needs for Biomedical, Behavioral, and Clinical Research Personnel, 2011) , but the NIH states that this could be under-estimated by as much as a factor of two (Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group, 2012) . According to a recent report by the National Postdoctoral Association (NPA), the NPA's 167 member institutions alone estimate that their postdoc offices serve about 79,000 postdocs (Ferguson et al., 2014) .\nWhere do graduate students and postdocs actually go? Data from the NSF Survey of Doctorate Recipients suggests that the US-trained biomedical PhDs \"who do the longest postdocs are the ones who go on to tenure-track academic research careers\" (Rockey, 2012) . However, in spite of the number of scientists remaining in long postdocs in the hopes of landing a tenure-track faculty position, the data show clearly that academia is an \"alternative\" career, not the default. In 2010, less than 15% of US-trained science, engineering and health sciences postdocs had obtained a tenure-track faculty position within 5-7 years of completing their PhD (Sauermann & Roach, 2012) . The rest of the job market encompasses many fields that are expanding and that we the organizers believe can benefit from the trained minds of PhDs and postdocs. These include (but are not limited to): consulting for life sciences, biotech and biopharmaceutical industries, sales and marketing of technologically advanced products, regulatory affairs, science policy, science communications, and intellectual property.\nEven though the majority of postdocs will do something other than become tenure-track faculty members, the default assumption of many PIs (and their mentees) remains that graduate students and postdocs will follow their mentors' career trajectory and acquire an academic faculty position at a research-intensive institution (Sauermann & Roach, 2012) . The data show that by the end of their PhD training, only 50% of graduate students want to become academics, and that expectations change over time: a faculty position becomes less attractive over the course of a PhD, in spite of active encouragement by advisors (Sauermann & Roach, 2012) .\nThus, many junior scientists want, and most will obtain, non-faculty jobs. However, we the organizers feel that few young scientists and their faculty mentors know what careers are actually available, let alone what skills those jobs require or how to obtain them. The mismatch between scientists' career expectations and the realities of the job market has led to extended occupancy of postdoc positions (Biomedical Research Workforce Working Group, 2012) and we believe this leads to highly inflated expectations from academic employers for prior productivity.\nHow does the funding system contribute to workforce and training problems?\nIn the US, the funding system has had a profound impact on the structure of universities and academic and applied research departments, and how the time of principal investigators and young scientists is spent.\nAs early as 2003, the rapid increase in funds over the previous decade was generating questions about where trainees would end up in the absence of a concomitant increase in academic positions (Russo, 2003) . In response to these concerns, there have been calls for institutions to become more responsible for funding \"hardmoney\" faculty positions, and to increase NIH incentives for doing so, rather than relying on external sources of funding for \"soft-money\" positions (Alberts, 2010). These problems were left unresolved, however, and now that there has been a contraction in funding they have become immediate. For institutions and individual researchers attempting to make long-term decisions, financial uncertainty makes planning very challenging. It is clear that simply putting more money into the system would provide only a temporary fix, not a long-term solution to the systemic problems with academic research (Alberts et al., 2014; Martinson, 2007) . Among these problems is an implication (expressed through the growth of, and reliance on, graduate student and postdoc populations) that the enterprise will grow exponentially. In the face of stagnant funding, this growth has instead intensified competition for jobs, grants, and publications (Alberts et al., 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "What's wrong with competition?", "text": "An assumption of many industries is that increased competition between groups or individuals yields largely beneficial results. However, academic science in the US was essentially founded on Vannevar Bush's principle of the \"supreme importance of affording the prepared mind complete freedom for the exercise of initiative\" (Bush, 1945) . These two principles are incompatible.\nIndeed, we organizers believe that the problems caused by the current unsustainable workforce are threatening the very foundations of scientific research. The high stakes and low expectations of success prevalent throughout biomedical research, from grant applications to hiring decisions, promote academic dishonesty (Lang, 2013) . Also, success in grant applications and career progression relies heavily on publications (van Dijk et al., 2014) . This can lead to hyper-competition for \"high-impact\" publications and in some recent cases, a lack of truth in publishing (Nosek et al., 2012; Sovacool, 2008) . Competition also encourages scientists to present data in the most optimistic light, and to include only data that lead to a clean and understandable conclusion. As postdocs, we see and experience these pressures first-hand. The pressure to publish needs to be balanced with incentives for rigorous and honest scientific communication.\nHowever, dishonesty is not the only problem threatening the integrity of academic literature. Part of the scientific endeavor is to provide checks and balances, reproduce results, and highlight when reproducibility fails. However, it is difficult (and unrewarding) to publish the results of replicative experiments or negative data, and there is a worrying trend in the lack of reproducibility in some forms of analysis; this issue was recently highlighted with regard to the widely-used technique of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (Hines et al., 2014) . Some journals have made a call specifically for papers reporting negative data, and there are indications that the NIH may be looking to drive more studies testing whether data can be reproduced (Collins & Tabak, 2014) .\nHyper-competition can also discourage creative thinking and risktaking, strong foundations of the scientific endeavor (Alberts et al., 2014) . Rather than grant applications for innovative, breakthrough science, we have observed that hyper-competition results in \"safe\" applications, driving incremental, slow improvements on existing knowledge (Alberts et al., 2014) . It blunts the blade of science, preventing it from piercing through existing ideas and paradigms to expose new frontiers."}, {"section_title": "Junior scientists must join the debate", "text": "A range of problems with the biomedical research system in particular have been the subject of increasing alarm in the scientific community (Alberts et al., 2014; Bourne, 2013a; Bourne, 2013b; Bourne, 2013c) . While the focus has mostly been on US academic science, many of the problems are universal. These issues are not just relevant to those inside academia: due to their importance to national competitiveness, they are increasingly featured in the popular media as well (Harris, 2014a; Harris, 2014b; Harris, 2014c; Harris, 2014d) .\nThe public debate surrounding these issues has so far been led by senior members of academia (Alberts et al., 2014) . One group that has yet to contribute significantly to the discussion is the largest group of researchers affected: graduate students and postdocs. Boston-area postdocs organized the Future of Research Symposium to raise awareness of the difficulties faced by young scientists and to provide a venue for further discussion and problem-solving during a set of interactive workshops.\nWe issued a call-to-arms to our peers to announce what we were doing, and to emphasize our view that young researchers should have a say in shaping the future direction of the research endeavor (McDowell et al., 2014a) . To achieve our goal of giving a voice to the aspirations of young researchers, we synthesized the current issues that have been identified as obstructing the progress of scientific research into four focus areas: funding for biomedical research, training of the scientific workforce, the structure of the workforce, and incentives and rewards for scientists (McDowell et al., 2014c) . Interactive problem-solving workshops honed in on each topic to explore the problems and propose solutions with the aim of formulating a response that we can provide to the larger scientific community. This document is the first to begin disseminating that response to foster and foment further discussion and action. Here we present the problems identified and tentative solutions suggested by participants in the workshops. We then discuss areas identified through ongoing discussions as requiring the most urgent action from young scientists to improve the Future of Research.\n\"To be creative\u2026emphasize new possibilities by disclosing those hidden episodes of the past when, even if in brief flashes, people showed their ability to resist, to join together, occasionally to win\".\nHoward Zinn (Zinn, 2014)"}, {"section_title": "Symposium organization", "text": "The While we did not strictly monitor the attendance at the symposium, registration data suggested that the majority of participants were postdocs and graduate students. Of 658 registrants, 344 were postdocs, 140 were graduate students, and the remainder included a mix of professors, instructors, journalists, administrators, research technicians, and research scientists from both academia and industry.\nFor detailed information on the requirements for preparing a symposium please see: The Logistics of Organizing the Future of Research Symposium (Mazzilli et al., 2014) ."}, {"section_title": "Participant-led workshops at the Future of Research Symposium", "text": "In order to focus the aims of the workshops, participants were invited to complete an anonymous survey of their ideas about how science should be conducted and supported, and the problems they identified with the current system. The results of this survey can be found in Appendices 1A & 1B in Dataset 1.\nWe considered the results of the survey as indicative of a general dissatisfaction with the current research paradigm, but not necessarily prescriptive of specific and comprehensive solutions. The output of this survey is informative in gauging the general opinion of educated, disciplined, and curious people pursuing science in the US.\nSymposium workshops were designed to allow participants to discuss issues identified as obstructing the progress of scientific research as well as to provide opportunities to discuss potential solutions.\nEach workshop was overseen by three to four moderators from the organizing committee who provided some background on the current system and posed the specific objective for each session. The four objectives were to ask:\n\u2022 How can trainees be better prepared for careers in science in 2014?\n\u2022 How should the supply of postdocs and graduate students be matched to the demand for jobs in order to create a sustainable workforce?\n\u2022 How can the funding of academic research be structured to promote desired outcomes such as the discovery of basic knowledge, finding applications of knowledge for the betterment of society, and training the next generation of scientists?\n\u2022 How can the current system of incentives be fixed so that scientists and institutions are rewarded for the behaviors that are believed to support good science?\nWorkshops were broken down into two separate 90-minute sessions. The number of participants per topic per session was typically between 20 and 30. Individual participants were asked to write down the perceived problems with the current system on post-it notes and to post them on the wall. Working as a group, participants categorized these individual responses and identified major themes. Participants were then asked to individually write down possible solutions to the identified problems. This was once again done on post-it notes. Solutions were categorized according to the level of implementation, ranging from actions that can be accomplished by individual graduate students and postdocs to those requiring action from society as a whole. If time permitted, participants voted on solutions they found most compelling and discussed the pros and cons of these solutions further. Generally, there was not sufficient time to discuss any potential solutions in depth. We view these sessions primarily as a way to begin debate, not to end it.\nThe workshops identified a large number of problems and potential solutions, many of which were raised repeatedly, though the immediate topic of conversation varied. In the following sections, we summarize the identified problems and proposed solutions in Chart 1-Chart 4. We also list the identified problems and proposed solutions in more detail, without necessarily endorsing each possible solution, together with a few common themes distilled from each workshop. The raw data for each workshop can be found in Appendices 2A-D.\nAt the end of each workshop, participants were asked to fill out a short exit survey (full text in Appendix 3; individual comments from each workshop in Appendices 3A-D in Dataset 1). The survey was designed to address three objectives; 1) to assess how well the workshop format was working and how it could be improved; 2) to determine whether or not participants felt they had reached a consensus during the workshop, and to gauge the importance participants placed on reaching consensus about these issues; and 3) to solicit specific suggestions they might have about next steps to be taken after the symposium. The results of the survey are summarized in Appendix 3 in Dataset 1.

Most PIs know little about non-academic careers, even though these comprise the majority of future careers for today's postdocs. These non-faculty careers are often still looked down upon by those in academia. There is little attention given to training for the careers that the majority of junior scientists will eventually pursue.\n\"Structure of academic workforce is pyramidal/feudal, generating too many trainees per PI\". Use of graduate students and postdocs as cheap labor: Junior scientists are primarily treated as cheap labor rather than as participants in a well-rounded training program that prepares participants for a range of clearly identified career options. Postdocs are conflictingly defined as trainees and employees in different situations, which is made possible by the lack of a standardized designation for postdocs and of a clear definition of their duties and responsibilities. There is also no oversight over the number of graduate students and postdocs and whether that number is appropriate given the perceived job market demand. Additionally, there was consensus that funding postdocs through research grants puts them in a vulnerable position and encourages low postdoc salaries allowing for the use of funds elsewhere.\n\"Postdocs are really hired to produce results, not scientists\".\n\"Postdoc pay is low so PIs can hire more postdocs to generate more results\".\n\"Lack of oversight for equal pay for trainees and to prevent exploitation\".\nParticipants identified problems with funding in the following key areas (Appendix 2C in Dataset 1):\nFunding mechanisms were considered insufficiently diverse: Many participants were in favor of extending the time scales of awarded grants, and cited a need for alternative mechanisms to workhorse grants like the R01, that might permit research projects with alternative aims and organization.

Summary of the outcomes of the incentives workshop.\nThe output of this workshop was a call by young researchers for incentivization of transparency and honesty in science by developing new metrics and possibly incorporating these criteria into funding mechanisms. In particular, we propose the creation of a website for trainees to anonymously publish feedback on their training experiences and outcomes, ideally using the IDP (Fuhrmann et al., n.d.) as a framework. Trainees might complete an IDP, then later return to the site to report on their progress. Data, aggregated at the departmental or program level, would form part of a training score for the department and institution. This would permit prospective students and fellows to factor this information into their career decisions, thereby rewarding institutions that place an emphasis on training with improved student and fellow recruitment. Incorporating this score into the grant review process would encourage departments to invest in training. The website could also facilitate publication of institutions' training plans that outlines available career development opportunities. This could encourage the creation of de facto universal standards for training (Chart 4)."}, {"section_title": "Prompt", "text": "How can the current system of incentives be fixed so that scientists and institutions are rewarded for the behaviors that are believed to support good science?"}, {"section_title": "Honesty and integrity", "text": "Better What we want from scientists and science Participants identified three major classes of behaviors they wished to see in science (in order of popularity, Appendix 2D in Dataset 1):\nHonesty and integrity: Scientists should pursue the discovery of truth with honesty and integrity, and to the best of their ability; and should continue pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and asking new questions."}, {"section_title": "Communication and collaboration:", "text": "Scientists should share information and ideas freely, both among the scientific community and outside of it.

Two new files have been added (Appendices 1A and 4), one file has been renamed (Appendix 1 has become Appendix 1B) and one file has been modified (Appendix 3)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "The workshops represented an opportunity for junior scientists to come together and discuss problems with the current scientific enterprise, and they produced an abundance of suggested solutions. Given the limited time of the workshops and the varied background of the participants in terms of their perspective on the current system and its challenges, a consensus on specific steps to be taken was not achieved. There were, however, certain common themes that require further discussion; because of the interconnected nature of these issues, effecting change will require a deeper understanding of both the causes of the problems and the effects of the proposed solutions. As a starting point for a larger and longer discussion, we the organizers have distilled three main proposals that can be implemented at all levels, from individual postdocs to institutions such as the NIH.\nFirst, we recommend increased connectivity among junior scientists as well as between junior scientists and other segments of the scientific community. Postdocs and graduate students frequently conduct their research in isolation, as their work is rewarded primarily upon the basis of its novelty and independence, and as they are all competitors for a vanishingly small pool of advanced academic positions. The sense of isolation is particularly strong among postdocs, as many uproot themselves from their professional networks to take positions in geographically distant institutions without an accompanying cohort (such as in graduate school). This isolation precludes awareness of larger institutional issues and makes it more difficult for postdocs to advocate for themselves and bring about positive change. Postdocs and graduate students also must connect with other stakeholders in science so as to participate in the ongoing discussions about changes in training, funding, and other important policy issues. Finally, postdocs and graduate students should come together to define their position as major stakeholders in the research enterprise. While as individuals, junior scientists are temporary, replaceable, and largely anonymous, together they constitute the engine of the academic workforce. As such, they need to take collective action to ensure that their interests are protected as they work to maximize scientific output and efficiency (Cain et al., 2014) . Only by bringing all stakeholders together will science be able to effectively grow and adapt to current and future challenges.\nSecond, we recommend increased transparency in trainee numbers and outcomes. Currently, national conversations decrying the \"STEM shortage\", as well as a lack of accessible information about the state of the workforce, create skewed perceptions regarding the demand for PhDs among many beginning biomedical graduate students. Students may become aware of the pyramidal structure of the academic workforce only late in their training. To remedy this, the number of graduate students and postdocs at all institutions should be made publicly available, together with information on career outcomes. Collecting and publishing information on career outcomes should be made a condition of an institution receiving NIH funding. Many institutions already collect this information at regular intervals, but lack a centralizing node to distribute it, and to compare the effect of their leadership. These organizations have a moral imperative to share this information; its dissemination will enable informed career and policy decisions. In addition, former students and postdocs should have a forum in which to anonymously report the outcomes of their training and subsequent career moves. Furthermore, there is a significant need to better define the role and purpose of the postdoc position. We advocate for transparency in terms of defining expectations of the balance between employment and training in individual postdoc appointments.\nFinally, we call for increased investment in postdocs through financial independence from PI research grants and increased accountability for the quality of postdoc training. Currently, many postdocs have little power to freely pursue creative research directions and individual professional development plans, or to negotiate for necessary employment benefits. We propose two possible mechanisms for increasing postdoc autonomy. First, postdocs should not be supported by research grants, but rather exclusively by individual training fellowships. With this increased intellectual independence, postdocs would be allowed to pursue projects of mutual interest to themselves and their mentors. This creates a much-needed line between staff scientists and technicians, who may be paid and directed by research grants, and postdoctoral scholars, who should be focused on training and development. Second, the institutions employing, and the agencies funding, postdocs should seek increased accountability for their training through direct postdoc feedback to the funding agency. These reports of training experience and support given by PIs, departments, and institutions should be used in evaluating grants for award and renewal. Furthermore, some of this information, properly anonymized and aggregated, could be used to create a publicly accessible \"training score\" for departments; this metric would incentivize excellence in mentoring to maintain competitiveness in recruitment of young, talented scientists.\nAs the source of future scientific leadership, postdocs and graduate students are uniquely placed to influence the direction and culture of the research enterprise. To be most effective, however, we must educate ourselves about the prevailing conditions affecting the workforce and sustainability of research, and their historical and institutional bases. The voices of junior researchers must command a greater audience in the present discussion; additionally, as we take our places as the next generation of independent academic scientists, we can influence the culture, efficiency, and integrity of research from within. From both the attendance at the symposium and the ongoing coverage of the event and issues discussed, it is clear that junior scientists are invested in and passionate about these issues. We all must now rise to the challenge of taking action to build a sustainable, productive, and equitable scientific community.\npurpose of this symposium: adding the voices of this groups of postdocs to the debate.\nSymposium. Clearly and concisely describe the symposium. List the four or five major goals/foci of the symposium (likely the workgroups). Then, for each, use a table to describe: 1. The central issue, 2. How postdocs describe the problem (only list the main points, and if possible include the percentages of postdocs conceptualizing the problem in that manner), and 3. The proposed solutions (with individual students, PIs/research groups, institutions, and funding agencies as their own column). Four charts would significantly enhance readability. All additional information can be put in the supplement.\nSummary recommendations. This could include a very brief nod to the media coverage (most of that should be in the supplement), the recommendations (currently the conclusions), and future recommendations. 2. Tone. The paper read as a policy report, editorial, and meeting minutes all as one. There are many points where the authors make declarative statements but don't offer any citations. Two examples of many include:\n\"Specifically, the hyper-competition that * , which stunts scientific we have all experienced* curiosity and productivity, breeds fabrication and carelessness in the publication of data, and leads to a waste of valuable resources and intellectual capital, must be alleviated.\" It is not clear that all have experienced this and would make these conclusions. The paragraph starting with this sentence: \"In spite of the number of years spent in pre-and postdoctoral training, *only a handful of scientists feel that they are adequately pre-pared *\" While career preparation is highly variable, it is . for any job other than conducting research an overstatement to say \"only a handful feel prepared\" for careers outside of research. The authors would be well served by making it clear when they are stating something that is a fact, versus when they are conveying the opinions of the participants. Additionally, sometimes the term \"we\" is used, and it's unclear who it is referring to-the paper's authors, FOR Symposium attendees, the broader research community. Please be clear to whom you are referring.\nFinally, the manuscript has something that seemed to be a major contradiction. In the executive summary, the authors say their report \"represents a united voice of young biomedical scientists, conveying our concerns about the sustainability of the research enterprise and our hopes for change.\" However, on at least two occasions, they describe the challenge in reaching consensus among FOR Symposium participants \"Overall, the respondents' concerns and criticisms centered on a few key themes; however, there was disagreement regarding which issues are most important to the future of groundbreaking and sustainable science.\"\n\"Participants also indicated that the workshops were more successful in generating multiple solutions than in finding unanimity.\" Even if there is not a \"uniform voice\" the symposium findings are still important. Don't feel the need to overstate conclusions.\nAgain, I feel the work is important. I fully expect the authors will be able to address my comments, at which point I would enthusiastically approve it.\nI have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however I have significant reservations, as outlined above."}]
