[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "This research study focused on the relationship between home background and students ' "}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) represent the most comprehensive international comparism of students' achievement yet conducted (Kiamanesh, 2005) . The TIMSS assessment was conducted to study the effects of different factors on students' achievement, including instructional activities, classroom environment, home background and possessions, students' confidence in mathematics and science ability, and students' attitudes towards mathematics.\nThe preliminary investigations of the TIMSS data in Iran indicated that there is a positive relationship between students' achievement in mathematics and science and home background variable such as parents level of education, number of books at home and possessing dictionary, computer and study desk. However, Iranian students who come from a family with higher level of education of either parents (8% of the students) possess all the three educational aids i.e. dictionary, desk and computer (5% of the students) and have more than 200 books at home (9% of the students), scored much lower than the international average score (Kiamanesh and Khereih, 2011) .\nPrevious study on TIMSS, 1999 data in Iran, using factor analysis and regression analysis showed that mathematics self-concept and home background were the strongest factors in predicting students' mathematics achievement. These two factors explained 12.5 and 5.4 percent of the variance in Iranian students' mathematics score respectively. The most important factors affecting the Iranian girl students' mathematics achievement were self-concept and home background that accounted for 13.6 and 6.9 parent of the variance in the girls' mathematics score respectively. However, the aforementioned factors explained 12.2 and 4.6 percent of the variance in the Iranian boy students' mathematics score, respectively (Kiamanesh, 2004) .\nInvariably, a students' home environment can be seen as an agency that aids in the construction of student attitudes and school achievement. Martin (1996) posited that many studies have in fact shown that there is a relationship between family background characteristics and students' achievement. Researchers have suggested that achievement in mathematics and science in secondary school is a function of many interrelated variables such as students' ability, attitudes and perceptions, socio-economic variables, parent and peer influences, and school related variables. Many of these variables are home and family-related and thus are difficult to change and are outside the control of educators (Sign, Granille and Dika, 2002) .\nArguing further, Beane and Lipka (2003) posited that some of the young peoples' difficulties at school can be due to problems caused by parents. They argued that home is the backbone for children's personality development and influence children directly and indirectly through the kind of relationship the family members have among themselves as well as through helping then to get in contact with society.\nIn the Nigerian context, Sharma (1997) contended that home environment exerts a significant influence on students' educational aspirations, which in turn influence the school-to-work transition. In other words, when parents have high expectations, youths have high occupational aspirations. Sjogren (2002) emphasized that youths from poorly educated parents are sensitive to economic incentives since they are to a greater extent attracted to occupations with high wage rates and high return in education.\nHence, this study seeks to investigate the extent home background has relationship with students' achievement in mathematics at the senior secondary II level in Rivers State, Nigeria."}, {"section_title": "The Problem", "text": "An increasing number of students are experiencing mathematics problems. On the international scene, United States of America had recorded dropping percentage in mathematics achievement (Coetzer, 2001 ). The national pass rate for mathematics in South Africa was 49,5% in 2004 , dropping to 46,3% in 2005 and to 42,1% in 2006 (Pretroia News, II July, 2007 . In the case of Iranian students, Kiamanesh (2005) found that factors responsible for variance in mathematics included home background of the students (2,5%). In the Nigerian context, Ojimba (2000) had found that the governments, parents, guardians, teachers and the general public have continued to show concern about the standard of mathematics and the consequent poor performance in mathematics of our primary and secondary school pupils. Corroborating this view, Adegboye (2001) posited that the general poor trend of performance by students in mathematics at the secondary school level is no longer debatable. Though, Adeniye (2003) had associated the poor performance of students in mathematics to poor teaching methods, the literature on home background factors and achievement in mathematics are scanty.\nRe-echoing the relevance of the home to science achievement in general, Ahiakwo (2006) harped that home science experience, are useful to formal school science. He stated that if a good teacher should teach a lesson beginning from the known to the unknown, a good starting point is the previous knowledge arising from what the learner knows. A careful perusal of these statements suggest a likely relationship between home background factors and students' achievement in mathematics. The question now comes -to what extent does home background factors relate to students' achievement in mathematics at the senior secondary II level in Rivers State, Nigeria?"}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Background", "text": "Valdez (2006) stated that \"there is a huge risk of educators' neglect or overlooks of cultural values and family engagement in the learning process\". Many educators focus on effective instruction in the mathematics and science learning without paying much attention to the idea of home support for education. Researchers often argue that learning in the home is crucial in helping all children become and remain motivated learners.\nIn his views, Schaverien (2001) stated that \"the freedom felt in a familiar non-threatening environment of one's home encourages scientific and mathematical exploration that, in a formal school setting may be intimidating\". Furthermore, at home, parents engagement in their children's learning strengthens children's capabilities for intellectual growth and allows them to make sense out to everyday activities, thereby deepening their understanding of mathematics, science and technology. Secada (2001) noted that \"children who are deeply involved with their families tend to \"persistently ask questions\" to continually observe and participate in the mature activities of the communities. They tend to adopt strategies such as looking, reading and manipulating to repeatedly explore exhibits. In other words, do all students encounter a wealth of home practices that contain mathematical content? If the students engage in all of these activities or practices, are they likely to increase students' achievement in mathematics at the secondary school level?\nSupporting the importance of home education for students' achievement in mathematics, Hall (2002) stated that \"central to learning at home are partners of learning with understanding\". He observed that many approaches parents (especially mothers or caretakers of young children) use to facilitate a child's understanding should be used in classroom based teaching. However, researchers have documented many difficulties experienced by the parents on the education of their children especially in mathematics. McCollum and Russo (2003) outlined the following four concerns:\n1. Parents do not necessarily see structured time together as beneficial to their children, nor do they always see the learning value of play. 2. Parents may unwittingly subvert the purpose of the time together by taking over the tasks themselves to make sure that they are done properly. 3. Creating activities that all participants can carry out together is difficult. Older children are often more proficient in English than their parents, which can complicate group dynamics. 4. Many parents look at parent -child time as simply the price they must pay to have access to the adult instruction. As evident from these concerns, is it not complicated to develop students' achievement in mathematics if home support for education is ignored? What is the situation on the international scene? Let us proceed to examine some studies on home background with special reference to home support for students' achievement in mathematics. Halpern and Myess (2003) found that pre-school experience has a modest but positive influence on initial achievement of primary school in developing countries. The trends in international mathematics and science study (TIMSS) and progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) are the largest and most comprehensive international studies that Iran has ever participated in. In these international studies, students' achievement in mathematics, science and reading comprehension have been subjected to comprehensive analysis. In addition, numerous background variables affecting students' achievement have been investigated using background questionnaires.\nPISA (2005) carried out an investigation on students' achievement in mathematics. The December 2006 issue of education mathematics reported on the latest results from the programme for international student assessment (PISA) for students' achievement in mathematics. It found out that among the 41 participating countries, students in only two -Hong Kong China and Finland performed better than Canadian students in mathematics. Students in seven other countries performed as well as Canadian students, while students in the remaining countries performed less well. In fact, students in three provinces -Alberta, Quebec and British Columbia ranked among the best in the world.\nDrawing from the analysis of PISA (2005) results, two sets of factors affected student achievement in mathematics. The first consists of the role played by student attitudes to and perceptions of mathematics. The second consists of the relationship between parent education and occupation and students' mathematics performance.\nFurthermore, socio-economic status (SES) is a term used to summarize a variety of actors including parental education and occupations that influence student performance. Simich-Dudgeon and Weinstern-shor (2004) found that other socio-economic characteristics (e.g. parents' education, income, median age, home ownership, number of children) taken into consideration, students are more likely to succeed academically if their parents actively support their learning. They outlined the socio-economic roles of parents in students' achievement as below: a) Provide \"a home environment that supports children's learning needs b) Volunteer in schools as aides or in other roles c) Monitor children's progress and communicate with other personnel d) Tutor children at home to reinforce work done in school. In addition, Sticht and Weinstein-shr (2005) found that children's achievement in school was directly correlated with the mother's level of education as mother is usually the first teacher. Furthermore, constructing conversations, talking about books and pictures in those books, telling bedtime stories, reading aloud, and asking questions are important steps towards developing the children's literacy skills. Weinstein-shr (2005) cites research that shows how parent-child interaction affects students learning and how such interaction is especially valuable where literacy in a foreign language is new to both parent(s) and child. Arguably, because the family is a crucial resource for making sense of a new life in a new setting, its basic economic, social and psychological needs should be reflected in designing ways to help learners achieve mathematical and scientific proficiency and power.\nHowever, in PISA (2003), SES is measured by an index that includes information describing family structure, parental education and occupation, parental labour market participation, and whether a students' family has specific educational and cultural possessions at home. An earlier analysis of PISA (2000) results, which focused mainly on literacy, found that students from higher socio-economic families tended to show stronger literacy skills. The same result was found in PISA (2002) in which students from families with higher socioeconomic status also tended to perform better in students' achievement in mathematics.\nComparing Canada with other countries, differences in socio-economic status had a smaller impact on students' achievement. Furthermore, differences in socio-economic status among Canadian students also were smaller than in most countries. In the same vein, parental occupation may also influence how students perceive the value of mathematics learning, their beliefs about the usefulness of mathematics and the learning environment at home. Examining this further, if occupation is considered, as an indicator of parental skill use, it appears that students whose parents worked in occupations with greater skill requirements also performed better in mathematics.\nCritically examining the PISA (2002) results, students whose parents were in professional or managerial occupations were found to have higher mathematics achievement than others. In other words, students who parents had occupations that specifically required strong mathematical skills -that is, physical mathematical and engineering science professionals tended to have higher mathematical scores than other students. It was also observed that students whose officials executives occupational category that includes legislators, senior officials, executives and managers in fact performed almost one proficiency level lower than students whose parents worked in the mathematics intensive occupational group. Mburza (2003) , said that parents of Nigerian secondary school students being largely illiterates are scarcely capable of reading well informed decisions about the future of their youths. Thus ever-so-often, it is the parents own misconceptions of the nature of work rather than the demand on the employment market that provides many youths with the prime stimulus to select occupation. Earlier, Bojuwoye (2000) affirmed that Nigerian parents (especially the educated ones) are known to be in the habit of dictating career choices to the students. These parents, he stressed, need assistance of a counseling nature in developing appropriate skills in parent-child interaction. Sjogen (2002) found that parental formal education is another factor influencing occupational choice of the student. He harped that youths from poorly education parents are sensitive to economic incentives since they are to a greater extent attracted to occupations with high wage rates and high returns to education. Adesemowo and Adenuga (1998) earlier noted that educated parents were more concerned about their children than the uneducated ones. This might be as a result of their level of education which have exposed them to series of information about life generally. Echebe (2000) noted that, development of interest in occupation starts from the home. He stressed that the occupation of the individual's parents and other key figures in his/her family influences the occupational choice of such an individual. Smith and Cheung (2004) conducted a study on the Philippines primary school children and found that home support for education from the parents had shaped the school attainment of their children. Several studies have explored the relationship between home background of students and their achievement in mathematics in China, India, Kenya, Nepal, the Philippines and Thailand. Could this be true for Nigeria and RiversState in particular? There is a yawning gap in literature concerning home background and students achievement in mathematics, besides the literature available are scanty hence the need to investigate this relationship and its extent."}, {"section_title": "The Method", "text": "The ex-post factor research design was adopted for this study because it seeks to investigate an existing phenomenon regarding students' achievement in mathematics. The population of the study consisted of 10,120 senior secondary II students in Rivers State, Nigeria. However, the sample size of 4510 was selected for the study, using the Yarrow Yamen's formula. The research instrument is the home background and students' achievement in mathematics questionnaire (HBSAMQ) divided into five sections. To elicit data from the respondents, the instrument was constructed using the following scale: The respondents were free to indicate (v) in the column against each of the items as it applied to them (see appendix). A decision cut off point of 2.50 was adopted. Any item or component in which the respondents have a mean score of 2.50 and above was regarded as \"a high extent\"; while a mean score below 2.50 was regarded as \"a low extent\".\nDescriptive and inferential statistics were adopted for this study. In the descriptive statistics, means ( ) X , variance (\u03b4 2 ) and standard deviations (\u03b4) were computed and tables constructed. Deductions made from results on these tables formed the answers to the research questions (1, 2). To test the hypotheses (1 and 2), the z-test statistic was applied to compare the means of the various variables and those of achievement in mathematics.
