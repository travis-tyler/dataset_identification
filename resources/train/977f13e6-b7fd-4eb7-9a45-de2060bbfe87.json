[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The iconic Chesapeake Bay, one of the largest and historically productive estuaries in the world, recognized by Native Americans as Tschiswapeki -great shellfish bay -is approaching potentially unprecedented landscape changes due to compounded effects of increased coastal erosion, storm intensity and frequency, and sea level rise associated with climate change. Maryland has over 4,000 miles of coastline with the majority of the coastal zone 1 experiencing naturally occurring land subsidence. Current estimates suggest that relative sea level rise is impacting coastal lands at twice the global average rate. Over the last century relative sea level in the Bay has risen one-foot due primarily to land subsidence and global sea level rise. Rising waters have contributed to the disappearance of 13 Bay islands. The low lying, sinking coastal areas make Maryland uniquely vulnerable to the effects of sea level rise. The sea level rise exhibited in the Chesapeake Bay over the past century is not purely eustatic rise but rather a result of land subsidence. Land subsidence is caused by a variety of factors including: compression of surface sediment layers, isostatic rebound from the last glaciation, tectonic plate movement, groundwater extraction causing subsurface compaction, and depression of continental margin by weight of sediment and seawater (Maryland Commission on Climate Change 2008a, Figure 1). Relative sea-level rise is a result of a combination of factors. Sea-level rise is the combination of the increase in volume of water as a result of global warming and decrease in size of the ocean basins due to mid-ocean ridge spreading. Land subsidence is a consequence of various factors which result in the land surface sinking, reducing elevation. Sea-level rise and land subsidence combine to result in relative sea-level rise. Many of the islands lost played a role in Maryland's maritime culture as year-round residences for Chesapeake Bay watermen communities. Like island communities, many coastal communities in today's landscape are being threatened by encroaching waters. Today there is only one inhabited island left in Maryland's portion of the Bay-Smith Island. The effects of sea level rise have not only contributed to the loss of bay islands but also pose a threat to Maryland's coastal systems. Research by the University of Maryland indicates that sea level rise may cause the loss or degradation of up to 70% of the state's tidal emergent marsh systems within the century (Kearney et. al., 2002). Noticeable losses may even become evident within 10 years. Currently the State of Maryland is losing 580 acres a year due to shoreline erosion, which will only continue to exacerbate with projected sea level rise and extreme storms. Over the past century, coastal erosion contributed to a loss total of 18,000 hectares of coastal lands in the Chesapeake Bay (Wray et al., 1995). The effects of sea level rise on the landscape will likely vary throughout the Chesapeake Bay depending on wetland habitat, elevation, sediment capture and accretion rates. The most vulnerable areas are on the eastern shore of Maryland where land has limited elevation relief and current wetland degradation is already being witnessed. An example of this is the vast marshes of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge (Figure 2). Recognizing this problem, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) released the report A Sea Level Rise Response Strategy for the State of Maryland (Johnson, 2000). This preliminary report reviewed the sea level rise literature and associated research, identified Maryland's vulnerability, and assessed Maryland's existing response capabilities.  (Hennessee et al. 2004). In 2008, Maryland released another strategy to address the impacts of sea level rise and coastal storms. The Comprehensive Strategy for Reducing Maryland's Vulnerability to Climate Change was a key component of Maryland's Climate Action Plan (2008). Among other many other recommendations, the Strategy lays out key policy recommendations to proactively identify and protect coastal habitat that will help mitigate interim impacts and provide long-term adaptation potential. In response to these key policy recommendations the Maryland DNR completed a targeting project that assessed the future location wetlands under predictive sea level rise modeling. From this modeling key conservation targeting criteria were developed that focused on size, location and diversity of future wetland classes within Maryland's coastal zone. Through this effort Maryland may be better able to protect coastal land and preserve distinct habitat, facilitate shoreline habitat retreat, mitigate coastal hazards, and reduce storm surge impacts. Developing these new criteria to target land acquisitions and conservation easements is a critical adaptation strategy for Maryland. In order to address these impacts, the Maryland DNR has been developing new land conservation strategies to help preserve the long-term survival of coastal wetlands that provide storm surge buffering to communities as well as critical habitat for aquatic and terrestrial species."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "In April, 2007 the Governor of Maryland signed the Executive Order 01. 01.2007.07 that established the Maryland Commission on Climate Change. The Commission was tasked to develop a climate change action plan that assessed the regional drivers of climate change, likely impacts in Maryland, and adaptation options and goals. In August 2008, the Commission released the \"Climate Action Plan\". The Commission's Adaptation and Response Working Group was charged with developing strategies and policy recommendations to reduce the vulnerability and increase the state's resilience to climate change. The chapter details Maryland's acute vulnerability to rising sea-levels and proposed 19 policies that would enhance the state's resilience to climate change. In the natural resource section of this chapter, guidance was given to \"protect and restore the State's natural shoreline and its resources, including its tidal wetlands and marshes, vegetated buffers, and Bay islands, that inherently shield MD's shoreline and interior\". A suite of priority policy recommendations were set forth to address this goal, two of which were used to directly guide this project: \uf0b7 Identify high priority protection areas and strategically and cost-effectively direct protection and restoration activities; and \uf0b7 Develop and implement a package of appropriate regulations, financial incentives, and educational, outreach, and enforcement approaches to retain and expand forests and wetlands in areas suitable for long-term survival. Recommendations from Maryland's Climate Action Plan were the key drivers of this project and were further supported by a previous wetland assessment report on Chesapeake and Delaware Bays by the National Wildlife Federation. This report was based on the outcomes of SLAMM version 5 modeling. The report outlined responses by government and non-government decision makers to: \uf0b7 Prioritize project sites based one ecological importance as well as vulnerability to sealevel rise; \uf0b7 Expand restoration areas and coastal protection strategies to accommodate for habitat migration; and \uf0b7 Restore and protect a diverse array of habitat types to better support ecosystem functions and improve resiliency of fish and wildlife species. In the Climate Action Plan, the Scientific and Technical Working Group reviewed the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (2007) along with additional global sea-level rise models, such as Rahmstorf (2007) and set forth sea level rise scenarios for the Chesapeake Bay. The projections for Maryland are as follows: under a lower emissions scenario Maryland may experience up to 1.3 foot of rise by the year 2050 and 2.7 feet by 2100 and under a higher emission scenario it was estimated that 1.7 feet by 2050 and 3.4 feet by 2100 ( Figures 3 & 4). : Sea level rise projections for the Chesapeake Bay based on greenhouse gas emission scenarios. By mid-century Maryland may experience up to 1.3 ft and, by the end of the century under accelerated melting relative sea-level may rise 2.7 ft under lower emission scenario to 3.4 ft under the higher emission scenario (MCCC, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Figure 4:", "text": "Rates of sea-level rise in Chesapeake and Delaware Bays region. Data are from tide gauges and the period of time they cover is in parentheses (MCCC, 2008). With these guiding policy recommendations and sea-level rise projections, Maryland DNR undertook a 2-year project to develop geospatial-based evaluation criteria to help identify and target coastal lands that could help the State of Maryland adapt to climate change. As Maryland endeavors to adapt to climate change, the Climate Action Plan recommended that new data on climate change vulnerability and adaptation opportunities, be added to the GreenPrint targeting tool. In December of 2008, Maryland launched a mapping tool called \"GreenPrint\" to prioritize lands for conservation across the state based on ecological data. GreenPrint uses geospatial software to create color-coded maps of information layers and aerial photographs to help land managers implement conservation strategies and identify land acquisition priorities. The GreenPrint tool has allowed the DNR to select ecologically valuable lands through the designation of Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs) for conservation priority. By updating the designation of TEAs with climate change priority areas, GreenPrint will help Maryland make long-term conservation plans with future coastal conditions in mind. As a component of the project, the climate change priority areas were added to the parcel-level scorecard that systematically quantifies the adaptive benefits of a parcel of land relative to others."}, {"section_title": "Implementation Overview", "text": "Maryland has been a leader in planning for the effects of climate change as evident by the 2000 report on climate change response strategies (Johnson). When the Governor signed the Executive Order creating the Commission on Climate Change, many agencies within Maryland were already incorporating climate change into their work, easing the transition into the Climate Action Plan. In early 2010, during the planning stages of the targeting model, Maryland's Board of Public Works, including the Governor, Comptroller and Treasurer requested that all parcels being pursued for state conservation funding through Program Open Space be reviewed for climate change vulnerability before the Board's approval. To meet this request, a parcel-level evaluation form was developed to aid in the review of all pending state conservation easements and acquisitions within the coastal zone. The evaluation form was developed to enable the DNR Chesapeake and Coastal Service (CCS) to review all State conservation easements and acquisitions by evaluating site-level attributes that support climate change adaptation, including storm surge abatement and resiliency; mitigation and restoration opportunities that would increase the viability of coastal ecosystems and/or the carbon sequestration of the site; and future human ecology 2 attributes. Reviews were completed on a project-by-project basis using spatial data and geospatial mapping tools, including ArcGIS 9.2 and Maryland's Coastal Atlas. The original evaluation form was updated after the completion of the climate change adaptation model to incorporate key components of the identified wetland adaptation areas and wetland migration corridors. The evaluation form continues to be used for stewardship review-an interagency review process required for any parcel of land being considered for state conservation funds. A working version of the Climate Change evaluation form and supporting data guide can be downloaded from DNR's Chesapeake and Coastal Service's project webpage. 3 In addition, Maryland DNR Coastal Program developed training materials to help other agencies and non-governmental organizations incorporate climate change into their land conservation and restoration targeting and review processes. A pilot training was held with Maryland Environmental Trust (MET) regional planners on January 13, 2011. Following the initial screening and feedback from MET, DNR CP co-hosted a training with MET and Defenders of Wildlife on June 30, 2011 which focused on the application of DNR's new climate change data and use of Coastal Atlas as a tool for land trusts working in Maryland's coastal zone."}, {"section_title": "Developing the Targeting Model", "text": "Prior to developing the targeting model, a literature review was carried out to select a suite of existing recommendations on climate change adaptation strategies for coastal areas. Specific adaptation strategies were identified to help address climate change responses for the following resource sectors: Aquatic & Terrestrial Ecosystems, Transportation & Land Use, Human Habitat & Health, Resource Based Industries, and Agriculture. These strategies were presented during a December 2009 workshop entitled, \"Coastal Land Conservation and Climate Change\" organized and co-hosted by NOAA Fisheries Office of Habitat Conservation, NOAA Coastal Services Center and Maryland DNR. The goals of the workshop were to: identify and prioritize climate change adaptation strategies in the context of coastal land conservation; develop criteria for evaluating and targeting on-the-ground implementation of climate change adaptation strategies through coastal land conservation practices; and, identify data sources supportive of the identified criteria. The recommended adaptation strategies and criteria from the workshop were further developed and added to the project as new evaluation criteria for land acquisitions. All of the workshop materials, including the recommended criteria are available for download on Maryland's Chesapeake and Coastal Service website. 4 One of the most important criteria identified at the December workshop was to identify a means in which to help facilitate landward movement of coastal wetlands subject to dislocation by sea level rise. This was identified as cross-cutting criteria that would benefit all sectors having application for adaptation responses to sea level rise. The potential loss of ecological functions coastal wetlands provide would affect all sectors through the loss of storm surge abatement, wildlife habitat, flood management and control, water quality, to name a few. "}, {"section_title": "Why Wetlands?", "text": "Wetlands provide critical ecosystem benefits around the world and play a significant role in Maryland's coastal ecosystem. Maryland's rich maritime culture is dependent on the nursery and rearing habitat wetlands provide, not to mention, wetlands help create the aesthetic beauty that makes the Chesapeake Bay unique. Wetlands provide valuable benefits that, if given the opportunity may continue to be provided into the future under sea level rise conditions. In order to maintain coastal wetlands under sea level rise conditions, wetlands must accrete at a faster or equal rate of sea level rise, have a positive elevation gradient inland, and have limited barriers such as hardened shorelines or other impervious surfaces inland from their current existence. Wetland migration corridors make up some of the most important areas for coastal adaptation in response to sea level rise. These areas are designated by forecasting where wetlands may establish inland as sea levels rise, often in areas currently designated as nonwetland hydric soils. Maintaining areas for wetland migration may provide opportunity for inland retreat of Maryland's coastal and nearshore wetlands that provide a variety of ecosystem services such as, wildlife habitat, water quality improvement, storm surge abatement, flood mitigation, aquifer recharge, carbon sequestration, erosion control, recreation and potentially groundwater recharge. Maryland has roughly 600,000 acres of vegetated wetlands (9.5% of state's land surface) of which palustrine or freshwater wetlands make up 342,626 acres (88.7% are non-tidal) and 251,542 acres of estuarine wetlands or salt and brackish wetlands (Clearwater, et al. 2000). Maryland's coastal wetlands provide important habitat, shoreline stabilization, carbon storage, storm surge buffers, and nutrient filtration, among many other benefits. \"\u2026tidal freshwater marshes are critical buffers protecting estuarine and coastal waters from sediments, nutrients, and toxics derived from deleterious upland human activities and land use\" (Pasternack & Brush, 1998) As sea levels rise, coastal marshes may be able to migrate inland through the trapping of sediment and the buildup of organic matter. Coastal wetlands form in areas of sedimentation, and in Maryland many of the vast wetland networks have developed along tidal rivers and estuarine embayments, such as the Choptank, Chester, Patuxent, Potomac, and Nanticoke Rivers (Tiner, R.W. and D.G. Burke, 1995). As mentioned, wetland migration is dependent on multiple factors including a positive elevation gradient or slope inland, sediment supply, limited impervious barriers and intact habitat corridors to name a few. Preserving intact coastal corridors for marsh migration is an adaptive approach to address the environmental impacts of sea level rise associated with climate change. It has been estimated that almost 60% of the lowlying land along the U.S. Atlantic coastline is expected to be developed and thus unavailable for the inland migration of coastal wetlands ."}, {"section_title": "Historic and Projected Wetland Response", "text": "During the end of the last glacial period, the Pleistocene epoch that occurred more then 15,000 years ago, there was a period of rapid eustatic sea level rise that lasted around 4,000-5,000 years as the Pleistocene glaciers melted. The northern ice sheet called the Laurentide came down to 37 degrees latitude, around Pennsylvania border and reached thickness in some areas as much as 8-10,000 feet or more. The weight and mass of the glacier was \"sufficient to deform the earth's crust. The mantle material beneath that part of the crust was forced to move outwards forming a bulge around the periphery of the ice sheet\" (NOAA CSC, 2000). After the retreat of the glaciers, the land started a post glacial rebound adding to the rate of relative sea level rise in Maryland and around the Chesapeake Bay. This gradual sinking or land subsidence, in addition to global sea level rise is called relative sea level rise. After the last glacial period and \"sea level rise slowed to near zero, but has continued gradually throughout, creating conditions favorable for marsh development and long-term accretion at rates equaling or exceeding sea level rise\" (Titus, 1987 cited Emery andUchupi 1972;Redfield 1972;Davis 1985). Around 3,000 to 4,000 years ago, coastal wetlands stabilized with sea level (Tiner, R.W. and D.G. Burke, 1995). As sea levels rise in response to global climate change, coastal wetlands will likely be threatened by submergence in the coastal zone. Non-tidal wetlands may become tidally influenced and freshwater systems may convert in to a more saline environment. Forest vegetation will slowly be replaced by salt-tolerant marsh plants. Though the timeframe for this soil conversion is estimated at 180 \u00b1 35 years, and with the current rate of sea level rise this timeframe is reduced by 63% (Hussein, 2009) there may still be a chance for wetlands to respond if conditions are right. Coastal marsh soils may be maintained as low-lying forest soils (ultisols) become inundated by rising water, they may convert to marsh soils over time (histosols) (Hussein, 2009). The inland wetlands established during the Pleistocene epoch will be critical areas for the retreat and establishment of coastal wetlands (Titus, 1987). Rising water tables associated with sea level rise will likely expand existing freshwater systems, further establishing a migration corridor and suitable soils for the inland migration of coastal wetlands. In response, long-term planning for coastal adaptation should include the protection of wetland corridors to help facilitate the movement of important coastal wetlands inland as they attempt to keep pace with rising waters. In order to proactively respond, wetland modeling with sea level rise was a major component of this project. Predictive results were used to identify areas with the most potential for wetland migration corridors and new wetland areas that can be used to target wetland restoration and conservation activities."}, {"section_title": "Review of Wetland Models", "text": "In order to address the adaptation responses identified by the December workshop and develop a new targeting model for wetland corridors, wetland models were examined for the development of data that could help indicate where wetland migration, loss, and transition may occur in the future under sea level rise conditions. For decades researchers have studied and modeled wetland response to sea level rise to assess long-term and short-term vulnerability of our dynamic coastal systems. To be able to assess the likelihood of future wetland migration corridors, DNR explored the marsh models available for landscape scale projections. There are additional hydrodynamic models that can be used at the site scale with site specific data, but the extensive data needed for this, and the time intensity of completing a site specific study around the Chesapeake Bay were limiting factors for a two-year study. As a result the fellow researched reviewed two landscape scale wetland models for addressing the project criterion -to help facilitate landward movement of coastal wetlands subject to dislocation by sea level rise. One model was developed by the NOAA Coastal Services Center (CSC) called Marsh Migration Model and the other model was originally developed with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) funding in the mid-1980's and is currently being updated and maintained by Warren Pinnacle Consulting, Inc. called Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM). Both models are driven by the same elevation rule-set but differences were found in how the freshwater and upland areas broke out. The charts below provide a quick comparison of the two model parameters ( Figure 5). The NOAA Coastal Services Center's model estimated wetland conversion and movement inland as sea-level rises using the same elevation and wetland principles as SLAMM. However, there are a number of differences between the models. One of which is the number of model parameters offered by the CSC model. Fewer parameters may lead to less error as figures are extrapolated to the landscape scale, requiring less technical data, and cutting down the run-time for regional or state scale projects. The model can use either Light Detecting and Ranging (LiDAR) or lower resolution elevation data and wetland data from either the Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) or National Wetland Inventory (NWI)."}, {"section_title": "NOAA Coastal Services Center", "text": "However, there were limitations to the CSC model in that it did not break up accretion rates for wetland types. A single wetland accretion rate was input for the model. In addition, the model did not factor in the following parameters: subsidence, erosion, backwash, overwash, and diked wetlands. These parameters were found as part of SLAMM v5. The SLAMM v5 primary process was to simulate wetland conversions and shoreline modifications during long-term sea level rise. There were five primary processes used by the model that affect the wetland change under the sealevel rise scenario. They are listed in the following: The rise of water levels and the salt boundary are tracked by reducing elevations of each cell as sea levels rise, thus keeping mean tide level (MTL) constant at zero. Spatially variable effects of land subsidence or isostatic rebound are included in these elevation calculations. The effects on each cell are calculated based on the minimum elevation and slope of that cell. Erosion: Erosion is triggered based on a threshold of maximum fetch and the proximity of the marsh to estuarine water or open-ocean. When these conditions are met, horizontal erosion occurs at a rate based on site-specific data. Overwash: Barrier islands of under 500 meters width are assumed to undergo overwash at a user-specified interval. Beach migration and transport of sediments are calculated. Saturation: Coastal swamps and fresh marshes can migrate onto adjacent uplands as a response of the fresh water table to rising sea level close to the coast. Accretion: Sea level rise is offset by sedimentation and vertical accretion using average or sitespecific values for each wetland category. Accretion rates may be spatially variable within a given model domain. 5 Along with model parameters, DNR reviewed the best available vegetation cover data to use for model application. For county wide coverage, Maryland is limited to lower resolution data, since site-level vegetation exists only in select areas. The options reviewed and available for all of Maryland's coastal counties and municipalities were National Wetland Inventory (NWI) and Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) datasets. A comparison of wetland classes from the NWI SLAMM and C-CAP breakouts was conducted with results compared in Figure 6. The NWI wetland class breakout was more specific with discrete habitat types then the C-CAP wetland data and could be compared to the previous SLAMM study by NWF, thus it was chosen for this mapping project. It was important to ensure the best breakdown of wetland classes so that key groupings could be selected as priority under future wetland conditions, since some wetlands are more vulnerable then others and are relied on by threatened species for habitat (e.g. high marsh habitat is extremely important to black rail). After comparing the two models, DNR took a further look at an updated beta version of SLAMM. The National Wildlife Federation (NWF) completed a SLAMM version 5 study in 2008 that included areas in Chesapeake and Coastal Bays and Delaware Bay. The NWF study focused on large-scale extents both in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia using National Elevation Data (NED). During the model review process, Warren Pinnacle Consulting, Inc. released a beta version for SLAMM 6 that allowed the user to plug in additional parameters; including high resolution elevation data (see Figure 7). Maryland had recently acquired statewide high resolution elevation data or LiDAR and there was interest in re-running SLAMM catered specifically to available county level data for all of Maryland's coastal counties and Baltimore City. Since SLAMM v5 had been run by NWF, DNR was able to do a quick comparison of version v5 model outputs with the latest beta version v6 using the higher resolution elevation data. A case study was run in Dorchester County Maryland to assess the difference between model projections for wetland migration at the county extent."}, {"section_title": "National Wetland Inventory (NWI) Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "SLAMM 5 classification breakouts", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Breakdown of SLAMM v6 Updated Parameters", "text": "\uf0b7 Newer more robust accretion formula \uf0b7 Site-specific high resolution elevation data compatible \uf0b7 New salinity model \uf0b7 Site-specific data can be specified \uf0b7 OpenGL 3D Rendering of SLAMM landscapes \uf0b7 Backwards compatibility to SLAMM v5 files SLAMM v6 was run in Dorchester County to compare the newly updated parameters, including high resolution elevation data with the results from SLAMM v5.

See Figures 8 & 9, on the following page, as they visually compare the A1B scenario results using National Elevation Data (NED) for SLAMM v5 and LiDAR for SLAMM v6.

The dike wetland feature of the model assumes that all wetlands classified as diked, impounded or impeded have a berm height of 2 meters and are not allowed to accrete under the model's scenario. Since 2 meters is above most sea level rise scenarios, it is assumed the dikes would remain intact and thus wetlands within the dike would not migrate inland. After reviewing the model parameter with a variety of wetland scientists the consensus was that the feature under estimates the impact of erosion and the breakdown of berm walls, not to mention the varying dike height. Under future climate change conditions dikes would likely breakdown with increased storm surges and wave action and thus should not be treated as impenetrable islands. Another approach was to query the NWI h modifier dataset for diked wetlands to extract only major dams and mill dams (average mill dams in Lancaster and Chester Counties Pennsylvania is 2.4 meters in height (Pazzaglia, Frank J., et al. 2006)) throughout the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. These dams range from 6 to 105 feet in height and would likely still act as a barrier to further inland migration of wetlands. However, with further investigation there was no easy way to query out the larger mill and hydrologic dams based on available datasets. The existing datasets were lacking a sufficient amount of dam height data that would have allowed this initial query to happen. As a result we re-evaluated the NWI dike data and decided that running the SLAMM with the diked data would at the very least help identify areas to target restoration projects. The caveat of this is that diked areas will remain intact regardless of sea level rise due to the model parameters, thus there may be some island creation or isolated pockets of fresh wetlands in future brackish areas. These areas are easily identified in each county extent using the diked dataset and/or through the examination of the initial wetland distribution with the projected wetland distribution for year 2100. LiDAR data was used for 15 of the 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City. Due to the incomplete LiDAR data for Harford County the most recent 2009 National Elevation Data (NED) was used for this county. The resolution for the Harford NED was 10-meters in comparison to the other county extents with LiDAR at 2-foot contours. Due to the resolution and the type of data used for Harford County, there is an additional level of error associated with the courser dataset used to run SLAMM. SLAMM was run for two time periods, years 2050 and 2100. These timeframes provided data that can be used for short and long-term planning for adaptation and response to changing coastal habitat. Each of the dataset inputs were catered as much as possible to the available data for the county extents. Where data gaps existed for county extents, the closest available data was used to fill those gaps. This included wetland accretion, sedimentation, historic sea level rise, and erosion. The best available data was used for all of the SLAMM inputs. The model inputs for all study extents can be found by region in Appendix A of this document.

As part of the SLAMM run, the soil saturation feature of the model was turned on to add a water table component to the predictive out comes for the study. As a result, the upland swamps were expanded as a response to increased soil moisture levels. These areas are visible streaked due to this feature. After debating the usefulness of the feature, it was decided it was better to keep the soil saturation turned on and note the caveat of the unnatural appearance of elongated and streaking wetlands (see Figure 10).

The datasets and analysis steps of the model matrix can be found in Appendix C. The following is a summary of the thought process that went into each step of the model matrix. There were nine separate objectives within the model matrix that the DNR advisory team helped brainstorm and link to existing spatial data for analysis. All of the objectives were in line with the goal of preserving the opportunity for coastal habitats, primarily wetlands, to move inland as sea levels rise. By doing so, a corridor network and inland targeting was necessary to help pin point areas most suitable for this adaptive response to rising waters. Objective #1: Using the SLAMM products for all coastal counties, the first objective was to give value to any wetland class that was projected by the year 2100. 6 All wetland classes for year 2100 projections were selected for all of the coastal counties. These wetland classes included: swamp, cypress swamp, inland freshwater marsh, tidal freshwater marsh, transitional marsh, regularly flooded marsh, irregularly flooded marsh, and tidal swamp, though not all wetland classes were represented in each county. As part of the model matrix methods, points were added to each data layer relative to their importance in the overall project objective to identify high priority coastal wetlands that provide adaptation opportunities under sea level rise projection of 1.04 meters by year 2100. A value of five points was awarded to all wetlands present by year 2100 SLAMM. Objective #2: The second objective was to identify areas that were previously identified as nonwetland uplands that converted to a wetland class by year 2100 based on the SLAMM initial wetland status and the projected future wetland areas 7 . All of these projected future wetland areas were extracted from the year 2100 projections and a separate spatial data layer was created. These wetlands were deemed high priority areas that may be considered wetland corridors and thus given 20 points (See Figure 12). : New wetland areas were identified using SLAMM results for years 2050 (orange) and 2100 (green). These areas were identified using spatial analysis of areas that converted from non-wetland uplands to a wetland class during the two time steps. The screen capture is of Worcester County, Maryland that can be visualized on the Coastal Atlas. Objective #3: To incorporate the common conservation protocol of protecting and preserving species biodiversity, a third objective was created to ensure that a diversity of wetland types were preserved under future climate change conditions. The third objective was created to maintain a diversity of wetland types and was calculated based on percent loss of wetland class cover from the initial wetland to projected year 2100. A quartile approach was used to assign point values based on the range of loss. Below is a quick summary of the ranges and associated point value: Quartile Breakout % Loss: For a full summary of points award to each wetland type within the county study areas please see Appendix D. Objective #4: The fourth objective was developed to protect the largest intact and continuous wetland areas. This objective was created to allow for species shifts and movements within large designated areas that may provide more adaptive responses verses smaller unconnected areas. A size threshold of 1 acre or more was established for all study areas. Jenks Natural Breaks was used within each study extent (county) to classify five point categories for each size range (see Figure 13). Since wetland sized varied greatly from one region (i.e. eastern shore to western shore) to another, size breakouts were established for each study extent. Objective #5: The fifth objective was created to identify those wetlands that may be inhibited from migrating inland with sea level rise and to reduce their ranking value. This included wetland areas that fell within a sea level rise of 0-2 feet based on statewide high resolution LiDAR data, areas that were either no longer wetlands due to development or would be prohibited from moving into uplands due to impervious surface, and wetlands that were highly modified by dikes and impoundments that SLAMM predicted would not move due to the dike parameter used to run the model. Each of these layers was given a value of negative 40 and overlaid in the prioritizing process to lower priority of those wetlands that will be less likely to adaptively respond to climate change (see Appendix C for more details on the data used). Objective #6: Objective six was developed in order to incorporate habitat constraints into the model prioritization. Several species of breeding birds are dependent on high marsh for their nesting habitat, particularly the black rail and salt marsh sharp-tailed sparrow. Additional nesting species include American black duck, least bittern, northern harrier, king rail, common moorhen, seaside sparrow, and the coastal subspecies of swamp sparrow which are all supported by Maryland's salt marsh habitat according to Maryland Audubon Society. Keeping these species in mind, two priorities were developed in attempt to identify areas suitable for breeding bird activity. One priority selection was made specific to high marsh areas that are extremely vulnerable to sea level rise. A priority data layer was created for each coastal county based on two wetland classes, irregularly flooded and transitional marsh at year 2100. A total of 15+ points was given to all high marsh areas for overall prioritization to help ensure future habitat would be available for the high marsh-dependent birds. In addition to these size priorities for high marsh classes, the second priority was for all the emergent wetland classes, critical habitat size for emergent wetland-dependent breeding birds. Based on the size of emergent wetland areas using year 2100 projections, values were assigned to 150 acres or more (10+ points) and for areas 650 acres or more (10+points). The habitat size thresholds were based on what most breeding birds require (150 acres or more) and on the requirements of the larger falcon species of the northern harriers (650 acres or more). Objective #7: In addition to the new wetland data created from SLAMM projections, priorities were also set using existing priorities areas. Objective seven included Maryland's high priority Blue Infrastructure (BI) watersheds. These are nearshore habitat priorities based on fish spawning and rearing, terrapin nesting, high priority wetlands, submerged aquatic vegetation and a variety of other important habitat components (For more details visit http://dnr.maryland.gov/ccp/bi.asp). The thought process behind this priority objective was that where existing high priority nearshore habitat currently exists, it may also exist in the future if conditions are such that the habitat is able to establish, maintain and move inland. Watershed priorities were used for this purpose. Nearshore BI priority areas were extrapolated to 12-digit watershed priorities for the overlay prioritization of future wetland areas. Objective #8: Objective eight was developed to identify high priority inland wetlands based on their alignment with existing high quality forest tracts identified through Maryland's Green Infrastructure (GI) Assessment and Forest Interior Dwellers (FIDs) assessment (For more information see http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gi.html). Presence of future SLAMM year 2100 wetlands within the GI Network were given 10+ points and those that fell into the FIDs network outside of the GI network were given an additional 10+ points. The FIDs dataset includes smaller tracts of forest that were not included in the GI Assessment, but were felt appropriate and necessary to add into this prioritization for more habitat coverage that may help facilitate the establishment of forested wetlands. Objective #9: The last priority, objective nine, included increased value for SLAMM wetlands that fell within suitable non-wetland hydric soils. Hydric soils have been defined as \"a soil that is saturated, flooded, or ponded long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part\" (Tiner, R.W. and D.G. Burke, 1995). These are water saturated soils that are one of the main components that make a wetland, a wetland. Areas that were drained by agricultural or other land-based practices, but still contain hydric soils suitable for future wetland establishment were targeted and prioritized. The breakout for this priority was taken from the Watershed Resource Registry (WRR) priority hydric soils. Soils that were 'somewhat poorly drained' (SPD) were given 5+ points, soils that were 'poorly drained' (PD) were given 10+ points and those soils that were classed as 'very poorly drained' (VPD) were awarded 15+ points. This objective help to identify suitable areas where wetlands may establish based on appropriate water retention of the soil. The water table or soil saturation function was turned on during the SLAMM runs but this objective helps to further indicate present hydric soils that may be suitable for the inland establishment of wetland areas. Each objective represents criteria that were given priority for land conservation targeting in light of climate change affects of sea level rise in Maryland's coastal counties. The data layers were summed together to find the highest priority areas that would allow for future wetland establishment, wildlife habitat, and wetland diversity. The totals were calculated by county extent, or in the case of Baltimore City by city extent, to come up with a range (low, medium and high) of priority; Maryland's Wetland Adaptation Areas. The top two tiers (medium and high priority areas) were then selected as the best-of-the-best for Maryland's Greenprint Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs). These were incorporated into the TEAs that make up Maryland's GreenPrint application for the targeting of the state's land conservation dollars. This update process occurred from January 2011 to spring of 2012, during which a team of experts from DNR's Wildlife and Heritage, Fisheries, Chesapeake and Coastal Service, Forestry, Office for a Sustainable Future, and Land Acquisition and Planning put forth new priority areas to update Maryland's GreenPrint TEAs. The final outcome will be described on the GreenPrint website. A sample of the full (low, medium and high) priority Wetland Adaptation Areas can be visualized on Maryland's Coastal Atlas (Figure 14). For additional information on the GIS analysis of the model matrix please see the technical documentation. Figure 14: Final outcome of the model matrix prioritization are the Wetland Adaptation Areas. As seen in the screen capture from the Coastal Atlas. Dorchester County high priority areas, like many of the coastal extents, exclude extremely low-lying vulnerable areas that were projected to be open water or tidal flats by the SLAMM at year 2100. The high priority Wetland Adaptation Areas include a range from high to low based on the values given to each of the targeting criteria."}, {"section_title": "Model outcome: Wetland Adaptation Areas", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "State Conservation Targeting", "text": "As mentioned previously, the final implementation of this product was completed in 2012, when the Wetland Priority Areas were incorporated into Maryland's GreenPrint. The incorporation of the new climate change priorities into GreenPrint occurred during a year-and-half update exercise. The process focused on updating Greenprint Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs) with new statewide priorities for land conservation. TEAs are used by the Department of Natural Resources Stateside Program Open Space program to target conservation dollars in the most ecologically valuable areas, the best-of-the-best, to ensure these areas continue to provide high quality habitat and ecological services for future generations to enjoy and benefit from. The wetland adaptation data that was used to identify TEAs represents the highest two priority subsets of wetland adaptation areas that would help to facilitate landward movement of coastal wetlands subject to dislocation by sea level rise. To prioritize for conservation value, only medium and high value areas that would help maintain or avoid certain features were selected as GreenPrint TEAs. These include particular wetland classes, upland areas suitable for future wetlands, a diversity of wetland types, and intact or continuous natural habitats. These areas would generally avoid features (e.g. impervious surface or hardened shorelines) that would constrain landward movement). These decision criteria are outlined above. In addition to updating GreenPrint TEAs with wetland adaptation priorities, coastal lands that occur within a 1-2 foot elevation zone were removed from the map to avoid spending limited funds in areas likely to be submerged by sea level rise within a 50-year timeframe. The incorporation of this data as a new element in the State's GreenPrint land conservation targeting system will influence how Maryland's Program Open Space, Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP), Maryland Environmental Trust and other state and local land conservation programs address climate change considerations in the coastal zone [1] . This approach to climate change adaptation using future wetland projections and vulnerability to sea-level rise is a unique and innovative way to address climate change in land conservation practices. This model approach can be adopted in different regions with existing comparable national, state and local datasets."}, {"section_title": "Moving Forward", "text": "As new models and data are developed to better understand climate change effects on ecological systems, the Maryland DNR will continue to update and refine conservation targeting to incorporate the best available science. Maryland DNR will continue to review all of Maryland's land conservation easements and acquisitions in light of climate change vulnerability, mitigation and adaptation potentials. Evaluation criteria are currently being used in addition to targeting conservation dollars in the newly updated Targeted Ecological Areas to better inform the state's conservation efforts. DNR reviews every parcel of land that is considered for land conservation for potential climate adaptation benefits before seeking funding approval for land acquisition by the Maryland Board of Public Works. To learn more about this review process see Appendix E & F for the full evaluation form and companion data guide. DNR's climate change evaluation form and companion data guide can be used and adapted by other conservation programs. The evaluation form provides a foundation for how to incorporate climate change project reviews into conservation decision making, highlighting the available statewide climate change data, and resources for acquiring or using the data online or on your desktop ArcGIS program. Impact U.S. Fish & Wildlife, Audubon, The Conservation Fund, Maryland Environmental Trust and other coastal land trusts are also incorporating the resulting high-priority areas into land conservation planning, targeting, and parcel-level reviews to aid in climate change adaptation. Conserving these high-priority areas will allow habitats to shift inland naturally, protect developed areas, and allow places for wildlife to seek refuge as conditions change in the future.
