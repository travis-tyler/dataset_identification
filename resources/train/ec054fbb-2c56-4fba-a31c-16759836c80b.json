[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "Numerous studies have examined the employment benefits of earning a bachelor's degree, concluding that higher levels of education sharply increase one's earning potential and employment opportunities (Cappelli et al. 1997). In particular, several studies have demonstrated the labor market advantage that students who concentrate in applied fields, such as business and engineering, experience with respect to higher salaries and full-time employment (e.g., Grogger and Eide 1995;Pascarella and Terenzini 1991;Rumberger and Thomas 1993). However, today's labor market does not necessarily guarantee a college graduate a traditional 9 to 5 job, nor is this type of employment the only option. Bachelor's degree recipients are well-represented in the contingent (short-term) workforce (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2001;Hipple 1998), but there is little research that examines the experiences of bachelor's degree recipients who are not full-time professional employees, but instead have alternative employment. Although alternative employment is defined differently in various studies, this analysis examines both alternative working arrangements and occupation types. Alternative working arrangements examined here include selfemployment, part-time employment, and employment in multiple jobs. An aggregate variable indicating whether or not the respondent was in any of these three employment situations is also included. In addition, this analysis explores the occupation type of the respondents: clerical and support occupations and field professions' are both considered alternative employment for this study because they include jobs historically filled by workers without bachelor's degrees (Decker, Rice, and Moore 1997). This study uses data from the 1993/97 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/97), representing college graduates who received their bachelor's degrees in academic year 1992-93. Survey participants were sampled from the 1992-93 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93) and were first surveyed in their final year of college, with follow-ups conducted in 1994 and 1997, approximately 1 year and 4 years after graduation. The analysis focuses primarily on employment in 1997 and includes those who were employed and not enrolled for further study at that time. The data are used to address the following questions: How prevalent is alternative employment among bachelor's degree recipients who are not enrolled? Which bachelor's degree recipients are most likely to work in alternative employment, by various demographic, family, and academic characteristics, particularly by gender? What are the differences between patterns of alternative employment when graduates are 1 year out of college and when they are 4 years out of college?

BEST COPY AVAILABLE iv bachelor's degree recipients who were employed but not enrolled in 1997, women were more likely than men to have some type of alternative working arrangement (16 vs. 14 percent). However, the gender differences varied with the specific type of alternative working arrangement considered. Women were more likely than men to have parttime employment (7 vs. 3 percent) or multiple jobs (8 vs. 5 percent), while men were more likely than women to be self-employed (8 vs. 3 percent). Women were also more likely than men to work in clerical or support occupations (16 vs. 9 percent), while men were more likely than women to work in field professions (13 vs. 5 percent). Except for working in multiple jobs, these differences in alternative employment remained even after controlling for other variables. Family characteristics were related to various alternative working arrangements among women, but few differences by family characteristics were detected among men. For example, among women, having dependents was associated with a greater likelihood of having some type of alternative working arrangement (24 vs. 13 percent), specifically, self-employment (5 vs. 3 percent) or part-time employment (15 vs. 4 percent). However, these differences were not detected among men. Among both men and women, marital status was related to working part time. However, while married women were more likely than single women to work part time (10 vs. 4 percent), married men were less likely than their single counterparts to work part time (2 vs. 4 percent). Some aspects of the academic experiences of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were associated with various types of alternative employment in 1997,4 years after college completion. Undergraduate grade-point average (GPA) was associated with the likelihood of working part time, having a clerical or support occupation, and having a field profession. As GPA increased, so did the prospect of having part-time employment. In contrast, as GPA increased, the likelihood of having a clerical and support or field occupation decreased. Several studies have shown that students who concentrate in applied fields such as business and engineering are more likely to be employed full time (Grogger and Eide 1995;Pascarella and Terenzini 1991;Rumberger and Thomas 1993). Consistent with these studies, this analysis shows that business and engineering majors were less likely than average to report having a part-time job (2 percent each vs. 5 percent). Undergraduate major was also associated with type of occupation. Nineteen percent of social science majors reported working in clerical and support occupations. In contrast, education, engineering, and health majors were less likely than average to work in clerical and support occupations (7, 2, and 6 vs. 13 percent). And health majors were less likely than average to work in field professions (2 vs. 8 percent). Because education, engineering, and health are applied fields in which students are preparing for specific professional careers, students who major in these fields are particularly likely to be employed in them after completing college (Horn and Zahn 2001). By definition, the areas for which they have prepared (teaching, medical professions, and engineering) are included in the professional occupations."}, {"section_title": "Alternative Employment 1 and 4 Years After College Completion", "text": "This analysis also examines how the alternative employment experiences of college graduates differed when they were 1 year and 4 years out of college (figure B).

Specifically, in 1997 compared with 1994, they were more likely to have multiple jobs (7 vs. 3 percent) or to be selfemployed (5 vs. 1 percent). Conversely, in 1997, they were less likely to work part time or to have clerical and support occupations or field professions. Many gender differences in alternative employment persisted from 1 year to 4 years out of college. In both 1994 and 1997, women were more likely than men to have some type of alternative working arrangement (13 vs. 10 percent in 1994; 16 vs. 14 percent in 1997). In 1994, women were more likely than men to work part time (9 vs. 6 percent) or to have clerical and support jobs (23 vs. 14 percent), while men were more likely than women to work in field professions (16 vs. 7 percent) or to be self-employed (2 vs. 1 percent). These patterns were consistent with the differences found for 1997, as described in the previous section. Working in alternative employment in 1994 was associated with a greater likelihood of doing so in 1997. Specifically, 45 percent of those who were self-employed in 1994 were also selfemployed in 1997, compared with 5 percent of those who were not self-employed in 1994. About half (51 percent) of those who had multiple jobs in 1994 also did in 1997, compared with 5 percent of those who did not have multiple jobs in 1994. In addition, part-time workers in 1994 were more vi likely than their full-time counterparts to be working part time in 1997 as well (18 vs. 4 percent). Finally, one-third (36 percent) of those who had clerical and support jobs in 1994 also had clerical and support jobs in 1997, compared with 7-10 percent of those with other types of jobs in 1994. Similarly, 43 percent of those with field professions in 1994 were still in positions of this type in 1997, compared with 4-5 percent of those with other occupations in 1994.\nHow do college graduates' experiences of alternative employment differ 1 year after completing college compared with 4 years after college? This analysis examines the alternative employment experiences of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients for both points in time. Three kinds of analyses were conducted. The first analysis estimates the overall rates of graduates' participation in alternative employment in 1994 and 1997 ( figure 5 and table 6). That is, those who were employed and not enrolled in 1994 were used to produce the estimates for 1994; those who were employed and not enrolled in 1997 were used to produce the estimates for 1997. The second analysis examines how these two groups overlap; that is, it looks at how employment and enrollment status in 1994 was related to employment and enrollment status in 1997 (table 7). In addition, it looks at how the alternative employment of workers in 1994 was related to their   employment and enrollment status in 1997. Finally, the third analysis presents the relationship between alternative employment in 1994 and alternative employment in 1997 (table 8).8 Overall rates of participation in alternative employment differed between 1994 and 1997 (figure 5). In 1997, employed graduates who were not enrolled were more likely to have some type of alternative working arrangement than they were in 1994 (15 vs. 11 percent), but the differences between the 2 years varied according to the type of alternative employment held. Workers were more likely to have multiple jobs in 1997 than in 1994 (7 vs. 3 percent). This increase might relate to lifestyle changes such as marriage and children that create a greater need for additional income (Lester 1996). Alternatively, these workers might be making or investigating career transitions. The rate of self-employment also increased between 1994 and 1997 (1 vs. 5 percent). Gaining work experience, or accumulating the necessary capital, may account for more graduates becoming entrepreneurs. On the other hand, 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were less likely to work part time in 1997 than in 1994 (5 vs. 8 percent) and to have clerical (13 vs. 19 percent) or a field profession (8 vs. 11 percent). "}, {"section_title": "Alternative Employment and Other Labor Market Experiences", "text": "Workers have a range of reasons for voluntarily or involuntarily working in alternative employment, balancing the disadvantages and benefits associated with particular jobs. Studies suggest a number of reasons why a worker may not have a traditional job. For example, a worker may not be able to find permanent work, or he or she may choose alternative employment to obtain flexible hours, to make a transition into a new job or field, or to earn more money (Lester 1996;Rothstein 1996). Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were employed but not enrolled in 1997, those with some type of alternative working arrangement were more likely than others to report having the freedom to make decisions as a reason for taking their job (10 vs. 4 percent; figure C). Part-time workers were more likely than those working full time to cite convenience (12 vs. 8 vii Executive Summary percent) or having time for non-work-related activities (5 vs. 2 percent) as a reason for choosing their job. Also, those who were self-employed were more likely to cite income potential as a reason for choosing their job (17 vs. 10 percent). On the other hand, those with some type of alternative working arrangement were less likely to report interesting work (15 vs. 19 percent), advancement opportunities (9 vs. 18 percent), good starting salary (8 vs. 12 percent), or good job security (4 vs. 6 percent) as a reason for taking their job. Part-time workers were less likely than fulltime workers to receive each of the benefits examinedhealth insurance benefits (41 vs. 91 percent), paid sick leave (39 vs. 88 percent), paid vacation (39 vs. 90 percent), retirement benefits (44 vs. 82 percent), family-related benefits (31 vs. 70 percent), and job training (29 vs. 47 percent). Among full-time workers, those with some type of alternative working arrangement were less likely than others to receive each benefit examined. Fulltime workers who were self-employed or had multiple jobs were less likely than others to receive benefits. In addition, full-time workers employed in field professions were generally less likely than those employed in professional occupations or clerical and support occupations to receive benefits. Fewer differences in benefits were detected among part-time workers. Among graduates who worked full time, several differences in income were detected by alternative employment. Those who were selfemployed had a higher income than their counterparts who worked for someone else, while those with multiple jobs had a lower income than those with only one job. Those with professional occupations earned more than those with clerical and support occupations or field professions. In contrast, no income differences were found among part-time workers by self-employment, number of jobs worked, or type of occupation. Gender differences were also observed in the relationship between income and some types of alternative employment. Among full-time male workers, self-employment was associated with higher income and working in multiple jobs was associated with lower income. These results did not apply to their female counterparts. Also, even among the alternatively employed, there were gender differences in income. For example, fulltime self-employed men earned more than their female counterparts ($43,600 vs. $29,800). And within each occupation type, men earned more than their female counterparts. Clearly, a gender gap in earnings persists even among those with various types of employment. While the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients in alternative employment generally had fewer benefits and often had lower incomes, the analysis also shows that they often gave different reasons for choosing their jobs. Therefore, their satisfaction with their work might depend on which job characteristics are being considered. For example, part-time workers were less likely than full-time workers to be very satisfied with their job security (55 vs. 65 percent), fringe benefits (36 vs. 56 percent), and promotion opportunities (28 vs. 40 percent). However, there were no differences found between full-time and part-time workers' satisfaction with pay, job challenge, working conditions, and relationships with coworkers. viii 0\nWorkers have a range of reasons for voluntarily or involuntarily working in alternative employment, balancing the disadvantages and benefits associated with particular jobs. As discussed in the introduction, about one-half of contingent workers indicate that they would prefer a more traditional, permanent job (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2001). But alternative employment is not limited to contingent work, and some workers may choose these arrangements or occupations because of the advantages they offer. Studies suggest a number of reasons why a worker may not have a traditional job. For example, a worker may not be able to find full-time work, or he or she may choose alternative employment because of flexible hours, increased income potential, or opportunity to make a transition into a new job or field (Lester 1996;Rothstein 1996). In this section, several aspects of the working conditions of employed 1992-93 college graduates who were not enrolled are assessed, comparing workers in alternative employment to those with traditional jobs. First, workers' reasons for taking their jobs are considered, followed by an examination of job benefits, salary, and job satisfaction."}, {"section_title": "Foreword", "text": "This report describes the employment experiences of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients in spring 1997, focusing on part-time employment, self-employment, employment in multiple jobs, employment in clerical and support occupations, and employment in field professions. Background characteristics associated with these types of alternative employment are explored, including an examination of differential participation in these types of arrangements by gender. In addition, the report examines differences in other employment characteristics, benefits, and satisfaction by alternative employment. This report uses data from the 1992/93 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/97). The B&B:93/97 study is the longitudinal component of the 1993 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93), a nationally representative sample that includes students enrolled in all types of postsecondary institutions, ranging from 4-year colleges and universities to less-than-2-year vocational institutions. The B&B:93/97 cohort consists of students who received bachelor's degrees during the 1992-93 academic year. The cohort was followed up in spring 1994 and again in spring 1997. This and other reports using this data set can be accessed and downloaded from the NCES Web Site (nces.ed.gov). The estimates presented in the report were produced using the NCES Data Analysis System (DAS), a microcomputer application that allows users to specify and generate tables, for the B&B:93/97 study. The DAS produces the design-adjusted standard errors necessary for testing the statistical significance of differences among estimates. Researchers are encouraged to use the B&B:93/97 data for their own analysis as well. For more information on the DAS and analysis with B&B:93/97, readers should consult appendix B of this report.

As the United States economy has evolved and companies increasingly compete in a global marketplace, employers are seeking a more flexible workforce. \"Individuals are now less likely to stay with one company for the duration of their career and employers are investing less in maintaining a stable workforce\" (Callaghan and Hartmann 1991, p. 1;Cappelli et al. 1997). Instead, these individuals are finding alternative employment arrangements, some of which have been described as the contingent or alternative workforce. These terms have been used to describe temporary, part-time, on-call, contract, or selfemployment, with \"contingent work\" referring specifically to those workers who respond to the expansion or contraction of the labor force (Cohany 1998;Hipp le 1998;Mangan 2000). According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2001), contingent workers currently make up approximately 4 percent of total employment in the United States. Callaghan and Hartmann (1991) estimate that almost one in five U.S. employees are part-time workers. However, precise estimates of the number of alternative workers in the United States may vary according to the particular study, partly because different studies look at different types of alternative employment.\nStudies have explored the various reasons that employees choose alternative working arrangements. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2001), about one-half (52 percent) of the contingent workforce would have preferred to be in a more traditional job. This statistic suggests that the other half did not prefer a more traditional job. In addition, about 90 percent of part-time workers are classified as working part time for noneconomic reasons (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2002). Thus, some individuals work in alternative employment voluntarily, while others do not. There are many reasons why workers might choose an alternative job, including having a flexible work schedule, receiving supplemental income, and having an opportunity to explore different jobs or fields (Rothstein 1996). However, workers may also take an alternative position because they were unable to find full-time traditional work. These alternative jobs often have fewer benefits such as health insurance, opportunities for promotion, and job stability (Lester 1996). How do college graduates fit into this picture of the alternative workforce? Numerous studies have examined the employment benefits of earning a bachelor's degree, and concluded that higher levels of education sharply increase an individual's earning potential and employment opportunities (Cappelli et al. 1997). The relationship of education to employment outcomes is largely mediated through the types of occupations for which a college degree qualifies a worker. For example, in 1992, 71 percent of workers ages 22 through 65 who had a bachelor's degree or higher were employed in professional, managerial, or technical jobs, while 6 percent of college graduates worked in service, laborer, or farm occupations (Decker, Rice, and Moore 1997). Even among college graduates, who constitute about one-quarter of the adult labor force (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2001), several studies have demonstrated the labor market advantage that students who concentrate in applied fields, such as business and engineering, experience with respect to higher salaries and full-time employment (Grogger and Eide 1995;Pascarella and Terenzini 1991;Rumberger and Thomas 1993). Yet 40 percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients in 1997 indicated that a bachelor's degree was not required for their job (Horn and Zahn 2001).1 In 1997, bachelor's degree recipients made up the largest percentage of the contingent workforce (Hipple 1998), and according to the 2001 Current Population Survey, they continue to represent a large proportion of these workers (25 percent; Bureau of Labor Statistics 2001). In addition, more and more bachelor's degree recipients are working in occupations that historically were not held by college graduates (Decker, Rice, and Moore 1997). The fact that the number of bachelor's degree recipients in nontraditional positions is substantial raises important questions. For example, what Introduction employment benefits are available to these employees, and how do they differ from those among traditional workers?"}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "The data set used for this study is the 1992/93 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study Second Follow-up (B&B:93/97), representing college graduates who received their bachelor's degrees in academic year 1992-93.2 Survey participants were sampled from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:93) and were first surveyed in their senior year of college. They were subsequently followed up in 1994 and 1997, approximately 1 year and 4 years after graduation. The data from B&B:93/97 are particularly appropriate for this report because this data set monitors the progress of a sample of all bachelor's degree recipients from 1992-93, not just those in a particular age cohort, and has follow-ups timed to describe their transitions into the labor force or other activities following graduation. The data include information on the 1994 and 1997 employment status of these college graduates, including the extent to which they participate in various types of alternative employment. In addition, respondents reported on various aspects of their job satisfaction, job security, working conditions, and salary. However, employment situations in the first year after college may not yet be stable because recent graduates are deciding whether to pursue graduate study, a particular career, or other activities. Therefore, although one section of the analysis does compare alternative employment in 1994 and 1997, the focus of this report is on graduates' employment experiences 4 years after completing college. The analysis is generally restricted to those sample members who were employed in April 1997, approximately 4 years after they completed their bachelor's degrees, and who were not enrolled in graduate school in 1997 (although they could have had some post-baccalaureate education between college completion and 1997). Various types of alternative employment, especially part-time employment, are likely to be prevalent among bachelor's degree recipients who are enrolled for further study. In this report, they are eliminated so as not to confound the differences in graduates' employment experiences with enrollment. The analysis also pays particular attention to gender differences associated with alternative employment and discusses such differences when they are relevant. Finally, because the data set includes only bachelor's degree recipients, it is not possible to compare those who worked in alternative employment arrangements and occupations with workers in the general population. 2While college completion rates are higher for younger cohorts, this sample still represents a small proportion of the labor force. Information about several types of alternative employment are available in B&B:93/97. Drawing upon these data, this analysis examines both working arrangements and occupation types. Alternative working arrangements are distinct from alternative occupation types, but both are considered alternative employment. Alternative working arrangements include selfemployment, part-time employment, and employment in multiple jobs. Because these three types of working arrangements are not mutually exclusive, an aggregate variable indicating whether or not the respondent was in any of these three working arrangements is also included. In addition, the analysis addresses respondents' occupation type, exploring the extent to which bachelor's degree recipients work in fields other than traditional professional occupations. Occupations considered \"alternative\" compared to the experiences of the majority of bachelor's degree recipients were those with characteristics that were not typical, such as those with lower levels of responsibility, involving long or unusual working hours, or taking place outside of a conventional office setting. Two categories of occupations are considered to be alternative employment for the purposes of this report: clerical and support occupations, and field professions.3 Workers can be in only one of these two occupation groups. However, they may also have the other alternative working arrangements in their jobs. For example, someone working in'a field profession may also work part time. The terms \"alternative employment\" or \"nontraditional employment\" are used interchangeably in this report to refer to the three types of working arrangements as well as the two types of occupations."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "The first section of this report explores the prevalence of alternative employment among employed bachelor's degree recipients who are not enrolled in postsecondary education. This section looks at which bachelor's degree recipients were most likely to work in alternative jobs with respect to student demographic characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, age, family income, and dependency status. In addition, it assesses whether working in alternative employment is related to various types of family and academic characteristics, such as marital status, single parenthood, the type of institution at which the bachelor's degree was awarded, undergraduate major, and cumulative grade-point average (GPA). It then investigates differences in the patterns of alternative employment between 4 years after college and 1 year after college. Finally, because some of the variables discussed here may be interrelated, multiple linear 3The specific occupational categorization available in the data as well as the aggregated groups used in this report are likely to contain some variation, so that all respondents in the alternative occupation groups may not have alternative characteristics in their jobs. For the purposes of this report, \"clerical and support\" occupations include such jobs as secretarial work and other clerical or support services work. \"Field professions\" include jobs such as those in farming and forestry, protective services, or health and recreation services, professions which are likely to involve long or nontraditional hours or work outside of a conventional office setting.

Older women were more likely to work part time than younger women; for example, 12 percent of women age 30 or older worked part time, compared with 5 percent of women age 22 or younger. Previous research has found that contingent workers tend to be younger (Callaghan and Hartmann 1991;Polivka 1996b). However, the population described in those studies includes workers who did not graduate college as well as current students, two groups that were excluded from this analysis. Thus, the differences between the results of the current Percent 'Includes self-employment, part-time employment, and employment in multiple jobs. These categories do not sum to the total because they are not mutually exclusive. 2Detail may not sum to total due to rounding. 3 These include such fields as farming and forestry, protective services, and health and recreational services. See the glossary for further details. study and those of previous studies may be due to differences in the samples and definitions used. Among bachelor's degree recipients who are not enrolled, recent female college graduates who are older may have more difficulty finding full-time work or, because they are more likely than their younger peers to be married and have children,5 may choose to work part time for family reasons (Reskin and Padavic 1994). In addition, White women were more likely than Black women to have some type of alternative working arrangement (18 vs. 10 percent) or, more specifically, to work part time (8 vs. 2 percent). Again, these differences were not detected among men. Within gender groups, there were few differences in occupation types by demographic characteristics. Asian/Pacific Islander men were less likely than White men to work in a field profession (4 vs. 14 percent). However, this result was not detected among women. This report also examined the dependency status of bachelor's degree recipients and, for dependent students, their family income in their final year of college. Women who were independent students as seniors were more likely than those who were dependent to be selfemployed (5 vs. 2 percent), to work part time (11 vs. 5 percent), or to work in multiple jobs (9 vs. 7 percent) after graduation, but these patterns were not detected among men. Among dependent students, women from lower-income families were more likely than women from families with higher incomes to hold clerical positions, but this difference was not detected among men. On the other hand, men whose parents had more education were more likely than those whose parents had less education to work part time, but this relationship was not observed for women."}, {"section_title": "Family Characteristics", "text": "Family characteristicsmarital status, dependents, and single parenthoodwere related to many types of alternative working arrangements among female bachelor's degree recipients, but few such associations were detected among their male counterparts (table 2). Among both men and women, marital status was related to working part time (figure 3). However, while married women were more likely than single women to work part time (10 vs. 4 percent), married men were less likely to work part time than their single counterparts (2 vs. 4 percent). In addition, single women were more likely than married women to have multiple jobs (9 vs. 7 percent), but this association was not detected among men. Women with dependents were more likely than women without dependents to have some type of alternative working arrangement (24 vs. 13 percent), specifically part-time work (15 vs. 4 percent) or self-employment (5 vs. 3 percent). In contrast, among men, having dependents was not found to be associated with alternative working arrangements. When family characteristics were considered, there were relatively few differences in the types of occupations held by college graduates. Married men and male single parents were less likely than other men to have clerical positions (8 vs. 10 percent and 2 vs. 9 percent, respectively), but this pattern was not detected among women. Single women were more likely than married women to have field professions (6 vs. 3 percent), but this difference was not detected among men."}, {"section_title": "Institutional and Academic Characteristics", "text": "Many aspects of the academic experiences of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were considered, including the sector of the bachelor's degree-granting institution, whether the respondent attended multiple institutions, the graduation rate of the bachelor's degree-granting institution, time to degree, undergraduate major, grade-point average (GPA), and additional education (table 3). Several of these factors were associated with various types of alternative employment. The time it took to complete the bachelor's degree, undergraduate major, GPA, and further enrollment were all associated with some types of alternative employment. Among  1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, the longer it took to complete a bachelor's degree, the more likely they were to have some type of alternative working arrangement. Specifically, those who took 6 years or more to complete the degree were more likely than those who took 5 years or less to report working part time (7 vs. 4 percent).  Several studies have shown that students who concentrate in applied fields such as business and engineering are more likely to work full time (Grogger and Eide 1995; Rumberger and Thomas 1993; Pascarella and Terenzini 1991). Consistent with the literature, this analysis found that bachelor's degree recipients who had majored in business or engineering were less likely than average to report having a part-time job (2 percent each vs. 5 percent). These groups were also less likely than average to report working in multiple jobs (2-3 percent vs. 7 percent overall), while education majors (15 percent) were more likely than average to have multiple jobs. Because the fields of education, engineering, and health are applied fields in which students are preparing for specific professional careers, students with majors in these fields are particularly likely to be employed in them after completing college (Horn and Zahn 2001). By definition, the fields for which they have prepared (teaching, engineering, and medical professions) are included in the professional occupations. Consistent with this expectation, graduates who had majored in education, engineering, and health were less likely than average to work in clerical and support occupations (7, 2, and 6 percent, respectively, vs. 13 percent overall), while 19 percent of those with majors in social science reported working in these jobs (figure 4). In addition, health majors were also less likely than average to work in field  professions (2 vs. 8 percent). Furthermore, many graduates who majored in public affairs or social services have trained specifically for protective services (Horn and Zahn 2001), which are included in the field professions; those who had majored in public affairs or social services were indeed more likely than average to work in field professions (26 percent). Among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients in 1997, as GPA increased, so did the prospect of having part-time employment. Because GPA is associated with attending graduate school (Clune, Nutiez, and Choy 2001), those students who work part time in the short term may be less attached to the labor force than others because they anticipate pursuing more education in the future. Alternatively, this relationship may result from the fact that female students, who had higher GPAs,6 were also more likely to work part time (figure 2). In contrast, as GPA increased, the likelihood of having a clerical and support or field profession decreased. Enrolling for more education after completing a bachelor's degree was associated with certain types of alternative employment. Those who had not enrolled in postbaccalaureate study were more likely than those who had some postbaccalaureate enrollment (but less than a master's degree) to be self-employed (6 vs. 3 percent). Those with no postbaccalaureate enrollment were less likely than those with any such enrollment to be working in multiple jobs (6 vs. 10-11 percent). Finally, those who had completed a master's degree or higher were less likely than others to be employed in clerical and support occupations (6 vs. 13 percent). When taking other institutional and academic characteristics into account, there were relatively few differences in the working arrangements and occupation types of college graduates. Those who attended public doctorate-granting institutions were less likely than those attending private not-for-profit nondoctorate-granting institutions to have some type of alternative working arrangement (14 vs. 18 percent). In addition, those who cited attending multiple institutions were more likely to report such arrangements (17 vs. 14 percent). No differences were detected in the likelihood of bachelor's degree recipients having some type of alternative working arrangement by the overall graduation rate of their degree-granting institution."}, {"section_title": "Relationships Among Types of Alternative Employment", "text": "Several types of alternative employment were associated with each other (table 4). Parttime employment was positively associated with working in multiple jobs and being selfemployed among 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients. While 17 percent of those with multiple jobs were employed part time, 4 percent of those with only one job had part-time jobs. In addition, 12 percent of those who were self-employed worked part time, compared with 5 percent of others. Having some type of alternative working arrangement was also associated with the types of occupations in which employed college graduates worked. Those in a field profession were more likely than professionals (or clerical and support workers) to report having some alternative working arrangement (23 vs. 15 percent each). In particular, workers in field professions were more likely than those in professional occupations to be self-employed (10 vs. 5 percent) or to work part time (8 vs. 5 percent).7 When men and women were considered separately, some of the same relationships were present (table 5). For both men and women, working part time was associated with having multiple jobs and with being self-employed. Also, for both groups, being employed part time was associated with a higher likelihood of being in a field profession. 7Workers in field professions were also more likely than those in clerical and support occupations to be self-employed (10 vs. 4 percent). However, women with multiple jobs were less likely than women with one job to report having a clerical job (11 vs. 16 percent). In addition, self-employed women were more likely than women who were not self-employed to be working in field professions (13 vs. 4 percent), a pattern that was not detected among men."}, {"section_title": "Participation in Alternative Employment", "text": "Many of the gender differences in alternative employment that were present 1 year out of college persisted to 4 years after college (table 6). In 1994, women were more likely than men to have some type of alternative working arrangement, and particularly to work part time (9 vs. 6 percent) or to have clerical jobs (23 vs. 14 percent). On the other hand, men were more likely than women to have field professions (16 vs. 7 percent) or to be self-employed (2 vs. 0.6 percent). These findings all parallel the results for 1997 reported above. While women were more likely than men to have multiple jobs in 1997, no difference was detected in 1994. The next part of the analysis looks at the relationship between employment and enrollment status of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients in 1994 and 1997. Table 7 shows graduates' employment and enrollment status in 1997 in terms of their 1994 status. The data show that employment and enrollment status in 1994 was related to their status in 1997; in general, graduates with a given combination of enrollment and employment arrangements in 1994 were more likely than others to be in the same category in 1997. For example, those who were employed and not enrolled in 1994 were more likely than other groups to also be in that category in 1997 (80 percent vs. 60-65 percent). However, regardless of 1994 status, 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients were more likely to be employed and not enrolled in 1997 than to have any other status. In addition, for those who were employed and not enrolled in 1994, their 1997 status is shown by their working arrangements and occupation types in 1994. Among respondents who were employed and not enrolled in 1994, those who had some type of alternative working arrangement in 1994 were less likely to be still employed and not enrolled in 1997 than those who were not employed in such arrangements (75 vs. 81 percent). However, the relationship varied depending on the type of alternative employment. Those who were self-employed in 1994 were more likely than others to be employed and not enrolled in 1997 (92 vs. 80 percent), while those who were employed part time were less likely to be in the same situation (72 vs. 81 percent). This may have occurred because they had plans to enter graduate school or pursue other interests, and therefore chose part-time employment shortly after graduation because they viewed their job as temporary. Alternatively, among those for whom part-time employment was involuntary in 1994, their lack of success in obtaining full-time work may have encouraged them to enroll for further education or to leave the labor market altogether. In fact, those who had some alternative working arrangement in 1994 were more likely than those who did not to be neither employed nor enrolled in 1997 (8 vs. 4 percent). In particular, those who were employed part time in 1994 were more likely than full-time workers to be neither employed nor enrolled in 1997 (9 vs. 4 percent). A third explanation is that women in particular who were employed part time may have left the labor force to focus on childrearing and other family responsibilities (Reskin and Padavic 1994). Finally, the relationship of alternative employment in 1994 to alternative employment in 1997 was explored. Table 8 shows alternative employment status in 1997 by alternative employment status in 1994, for those graduates who were employed and not enrolled in 1997. Among those who were employed and not enrolled in 1997, having an alternative working arrangement in 1994 was associated with a greater likelihood of having such an arrangement in 1997. Forty-two percent of those with some type of alternative working arrangement in 1994 were in the same situation in 1997, compared with 11 percent of those without such arrangements in 1994. This pattern persisted for all types of alternative employment: 45 percent of those who were self-employed in 1994 also had this kind of work arrangement in 1997, compared with 5 percent of those who were not self-employed in 1994. About half (51 percent) of those who had multiple jobs in 1994 also did so in 1997, compared with 5 percent of those who did not have multiple jobs in 1994. In addition, part-time workers in 1994 were more likely than full-time workers to be working part time in 1997 (18 vs. 4 percent). About one-third (36 percent) of those who had clerical jobs in 1994 also did so in 1997, compared with 7-10 percent of those with other types of jobs. Also, 43 percent of those in a field profession in 1994 were still in these types of positions in 1997, compared with 4-5 percent of those in other occupations."}, {"section_title": "Participation in Alternative Employment After Controlling for Covariation", "text": "In previous sections, this report has shown several associations between alternative employment and demographic, family, and academic characteristics. In addition, this report has illustrated how some types of alternative employment are related to each other. For example, in the bivariate analyses, gender was associated with each type of alternative employment, while working part time was related to working multiple jobs and being self-employed. Nevertheless, some of these variables may be interrelated. To discern the unique relationships between the background variables and alternative employment while controlling for the relationships among the variables themselves, multiple linear regression techniques were used. For more information about this methodology, see appendix B. Five analyses were conducted, one for each type of alternative employment (selfemployment, part-time employment, multiple jobs, clerical and support occupations, and field professions). For each analysis, only variables that were associated with that type of alternative employment in the bivariate tables above were included in the model.9 Therefore, the specific variables differ slightly across the five regression analyses. 91n cases where the analyses above were conducted separately for women and men, variables that were associated with a given type of alternative employment for either women or men were included in the multiple regression model for that type. Tables 9-13 present the results of the regression analyses on alternative working arrangements and occupation types. The first column of each table contains the unadjusted percentagesthat is, the percentages before taking into account the other variables, as shown above.10 Regression coefficients were used to produce the adjusted percentages shown in the second column (holding the other variables constant). For each row variable in each table, the category in italics is the reference category for comparisons and tests of statistical significance. Numbers with asterisks in the first and second columns indicate that the percentage of workers in that category is significantly different from the percentage for the reference category. Rows containing asterisks in only one of the columns indicate cases in which the adjustment procedure leads to a different conclusion than one would reach based on the unadjusted percentages. Table 9 shows the analysis of self-employment. After adjusting for the other variables in the table, women were still less likely than men to be self-employed. While education majors were less likely than social science majors to be self-employed both before and after taking other variables into consideration, the difference between majoring in health fields and majoring in social science was not detected once covariation was controlled. Part-time employees were still more likely to be self-employed than full-time workers, even after accounting for the relationships between part-time employment and other variables in the model. However, the relationships of race/ethnicity, postbaccalaureate educational attainment, and occupation type to self-employment were no longer detected after taking the other variables into consideration. Women were also more likely to be employed part time than men both before and after adjusting for the interrelationships among the variables (table 10). In addition, workers with dependents were still more likely than those without dependents to be employed part time. Other types of alternative employment were also related to part-time employment both before and after the adjustment procedure: graduates who were self-employed or who worked in multiple jobs were still more likely to work part time, as were those in field professions compared with those in professional occupations. However, race/ethnicity, age, marital status, time to degree, and GPA were no longer associated with part-time employment. The regression analysis of working multiple jobs revealed a unique result (table 11). Parttime workers remained more likely than full-time workers to have multiple jobs after taking other variables into account, consistent with the converse relationship described in the previous table. However, other variables that were associated with working multiple jobs in the cross tabulations discussed above had no detectable association with this type of alternative employment in the regression analysis. mBecause some of the ways in which these variables were related to alternative employment differed according to gender, the unadjusted percentages reported in tables 9-13 may not reflect the relationships described in the preceding section.  Both before and after the adjustment procedure, women were more likely than men to work in clerical or support occupations (table 12). In addition, graduates who had majored in education, engineering, health fields, and psychology were less likely than social science majors to work in these jobs both before and after taking other factors into consideration. Those with no postbaccalaureate education continued to be more likely than those who had obtained a master's degree or more education to have a clerical position in this model as well. Finally, in the adjusted model, no relationship of family income and dependency status, institutional graduation rate, or time to degree with the likelihood of working in clerical and support occupations was detected. Women remained less likely than men to work in field professions in the regression analysis (table 13). Workers who had majored in public affairs or social services were more likely than social science majors to be employed in field professions both before and after the adjustment procedure, as were students with low cumulative undergraduate GPAs (below 2.5) compared with those with high GPAs (3.5 or above). Part-time employees were more likely than full-time employees to work in field professions both before and after taking other factors into consideration. However, race/ethnicity, institutional graduation rate, and self-employment status were not found to be associated with field professions in the adjusted model.    In summary, gender was related to most types of alternative employment arrangements and occupation types after controlling for other variables, with the exception of working in multiple jobs. Women were more likely than men to work part time or to work in a clerical position, while men were more likely to have work in a field profession or to be self-employed. In addition, undergraduate major was related to all types of alternative employment except for working in multiple jobs in the regression models. Some of the associations between types of alternative employment, such as the relationship between working part time and working in multiple jobs, also remained. In fact, employment status was related to self-employment, working in multiple jobs, and field professions both before and after the adjustment procedure.    "}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Taking a Job", "text": "Those with some type of alternative working arrangement were more likely than others to report having the freedom to make decisions as a reason for taking their job (10 vs. 4 percent; figure 6 and table 14). Specifically, self-employed workers were more likely than those who were not self-employed to cite this reason (21 vs. 4 percent) and were also more likely than others to report income potential as a reason for their choice (17 vs. 10 percent). Part-time workers were more likely than full-time employees to cite convenience and time for activities that were not related to work as reasons for choosing their job (12 vs. 8 percent). In contrast to the above advantages, those with some type of alternative working arrangement were less likely than others to report that interesting work (15 vs. 19 percent), advancement opportunity (9 vs. 18 percent), good starting salary (8 vs. 12 percent), or good job security (4 vs. 6 percent) were reasons for taking their jobs. In general, the same patterns were observed when comparing self-employed workers with others, those with multiple jobs with those with one job, and part-time workers with full-time workers. Furthermore, while selfemployed workers were more likely than others to say their jobs had good income potential, workers with multiple jobs and part-time workers were less likely than their counterparts in traditional jobs to cite this reason. Some of these reasons also varied according to type of occupation in which a worker was employed. Employees in professional jobs were more likely than those in field professions to report advancement opportunity (18 vs. 8 percent) and good income potential (11 vs. 7 percent) as reasons for taking their jobs. In addition, clerical and support workers were less likely than those in other occupations to say they took the job because of having the freedom to make decisions. However, no differences by occupation type were found in citing interesting work, good starting salary, or job security as reasons for taking a job. "}, {"section_title": "Job Benefits", "text": "Employee benefits differed by alternative employment as well (table 15). Part-time workers were less likely than full-time workers to receive any of the benefits examined-health insurance benefits (41 vs. 91 percent), paid sick leave (39 vs. 88 percent), paid vacation (39 vs. 90 percent), 41 5 6 retirement benefits (44 vs. 82 percent), family-related benefits (31 vs. 70 percent), and job training (29 vs. 47 percent). This pattern is consistent with the findings for part-time workers in the labor market in general (Tilly 1991). Because these differences in the benefits of full-and part-time workers are so pervasive, analyses of benefits with regard to other types of alternative employment were conducted separately for the two groups. Among full-time workers, those with some type of alternative working arrangement were less likely than others to receive each benefit examined (figure 7). For example, 73 percent of full-time workers with alternative working arrangements had health insurance, compared with 93 percent of those in traditional jobs. Those who were self-employed were less likely to have all types of benefits examined than those employed by others, and those with multiple jobs were generally less likely than workers with just one job to receive these benefits as well.\" \"No difference in the percentage receiving job training in the past 12 months was detected between those working in multiple jobs and those working in only one job."}, {"section_title": "5 8", "text": "There were also differences in receipt of benefits by occupation type. Full-time employees in professional positions were more likely than those in field professions to report receiving the benefits examined. Except for job training, full-time employees in clerical jobs were also more likely than those in field occupations to receive these benefits. Among part-time workers, some similar patterns were present. For example, self-employed workers were less likely to receive the various types of benefits considered. However, unlike the pattern among full-time workers, part-time workers with multiple jobs differed significantly from those with one job only in the extent to which they received family-related benefits (20 vs. 34 percent). Part-time workers in professional jobs were more likely than those in a field profession to receive paid sick leave (43 vs. 23 percent) or retirement benefits (50 vs. 26 percent) and were more likely than clerical workers to receive family-related benefits (35 vs. 16 percent). These findings are consistent with those cited in the literature on this topic (Lester 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Income", "text": "In addition to the benefits described above, differences in incomeboth from all jobs and all sourceswere also examined in this analysis separately for full-and part-time workers (table  16). When comparing full-time workers to part-time workers, full-time workers earned higher income both overall and within each type of alternative employment. Among full-time workers, mean income from all sources was higher than that from job income alone ($34,200 vs. $32,700). While it appears that this pattern held for part-time workers as well, the standard errors were large and a statistically significant difference could not be detected. This study revealed several differences in income by alternative employment status. Fulltime self-employed workers had higher income (both from their job and from all sources) than other full-time workers ($39,600 vs. $32,400 for job income, and $42,500 vs. $33,900 for income from all sources). In contrast, full-time workers with multiple jobs had lower income than those with only one job ($29,000 vs. $32,900 for job income, and $30,800 vs. $34,400 for all income). Occupation type was also associated with differences in both job income and all income among full-time workers. Those in professional positions had higher income than others, while those in clerical jobs had lower income than those in other jobs. However, among parttime workers, no differences in income were detected by self-employment, working in multiple jobs, or occupation type. The relationships between income and some types of alternative employment also differed by gender (table 17). Among both male and female full-time workers, those in professional occupations earned more from their jobs and overall than those in clerical and support or field  professions. However, while men with alternative working arrangements differed in their job income, these differences were not detected among women. That is, while being self-employed was associated with higher income and working in multiple jobs was associated with lower income among full-time male workers, this pattern was not found for their female counterparts. In addition, among both full-and part-time workers, men had a higher job income than women ($36,700 vs. $29,100 for full-time employees, and $23,800 vs. $17,000 for part-time workers). Likewise, among full-time workers, men received greater income from all sources than women ($38,300 vs. $30,600). These results are consistent with evidence from other studies exploring the relationship between gender and earnings from various types of work (Kemp 1994). Among those with alternative working arrangements, there were gender differences in income. For example, consistent with the results for all self-employed workers (not just college graduates; Cohany 1998), full-time self-employed men earned more than their female counterparts ($43,600 vs. $29,800). Clearly, a gender gap in earnings persists even among those with various types of employment arrangements."}, {"section_title": "Job Satisfaction", "text": "While those with alternative employment generally had fewer benefits and often had lower incomes, the results reported above also showed that they often gave different reasons for choosing their jobs. Therefore, their satisfaction with their work might depend on which job characteristics are being considered. Because of the differences in benefits and income for fulltime and part-time workers, their satisfaction with various aspects of their worksalary, job security, job challenge, fringe benefits, promotion opportunity, relationship with coworkers, and working environmentwas also analyzed separately (table 18). Consistent with the differences in benefits, part-time workers were less likely than full-time workers to report being very satisfied with their fringe benefits (36 vs. 56 percent), job security (55 vs. 65 percent), and promotion opportunities (28 vs. 40 percent). However, no differences were detected between full-time and part-time workers' satisfaction with their pay, job challenge, working conditions, and relationships with co-workers. The level of satisfaction part-time workers report may reflect other advantages these jobs offer. For example, flexibility and time for activities other than work may outweigh the benefits of additional income. Alternatively, part-time workers may assess their satisfaction with their pay in terms of the rate of pay for their time, rather than the total income for the year. Among full-time workers, the patterns of job satisfaction among alternative employees compared with traditional employees depended on the type of alternative employment being considered. Self-employed workers were more likely than those who worked for someone else to report being very satisfied with the challenge of their jobs, their working conditions, their pay, their promotion opportunities, and their job security (figure 8). Because these individuals were self-employed, many of these characteristics were directly under their control, which is consistent with the finding that self-employed workers were more likely than others to cite having the freedom to make decisions as a reason for taking their job. In contrast, consistent with the differences in their employment conditions described above, workers with multiple jobs were less satisfied than those with only one job with their fringe benefits, pay, promotion opportunities, and job security. Satisfaction with various aspects of work was also related to occupation type. Full-time workers in professional jobs were more likely than others to indicate that they were very satisfied with the challenge of their jobs and their promotion opportunities. Consistent with the fewer benefits they received, workers in field professions were less likely than professionals or clerical workers to be very satisfied with their benefits (47 vs. 57 percent each). In addition, these workers were less likely than others to say they were very satisfied with their working conditions (44 vs. 56-57 percent). Some of these relationships were also detected among part-time employees. Those who were self-employed were more likely to be very satisfied with the challenge of their work, their promotion opportunities, their working conditions, and their fringe benefits. Among part-time workers, those with multiple jobs were less likely to report being very satisfied with their fringe benefits or their level of job security. Professional workers were more likely than those with a field profession to be very satisfied with their pay and their job challenges. However, those in clerical and support occupations were more likely than both professionals and field professionals to report being very satisfied with their job security (79 vs. 51 and 47 percent, respectively)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Today's labor market does not necessarily guarantee a college graduate a traditional 9 to 5 professional job, nor is this type of employment the preference of all bachelor's degree recipients. Instead, some graduates are voluntarily or involuntarily taking alternative employment. Overall, 68 percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who were employed but not enrolled in postbaccalaureate education worked in jobs considered traditional for college graduatesthat is, they worked full time for someone else in one professional job. However, 15 percent reported having at least one of three types of alternative working arrangements in 1997: 5 percent were self-employed, 5 percent were employed part time, and 7 percent worked in multiple jobs. Also, 13 percent were employed in clerical and support occupations, and an additional 8 percent worked in field professions. These employment patterns differ somewhat from those that graduates encountered in their first year after college. For example, they were more likely to have multiple jobs or to be self-employed in 1997 than in 1994. On the other hand, they were less likely to work part time in 1997 than in 1994. Among the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients, gender was associated with various types of alternative employment experiences. Women were more likely than men to work part time, have multiple jobs, and be in a clerical position, while men were more likely than women to be self-employed or work in a field profession. Most of these differences were detected in both 1994 and 1997. Within gender groups, demographic and family characteristics were related to many types of alternative working arrangements among women, but few among men. Marital status was related to working part time for both men and women, but in different ways: married women were more likely than single women to work part time, while married men were less likely than their single counterparts to do so. The results of the multivariate analysis show that gender was related to most types of alternative employment after taking other variables into account, with the exception of working in multiple jobs. Also, in the regression models, undergraduate major was related to all types of alternative employment except for working in multiple jobs. There were also some associations among various types of alternative employment. In particular, employment status was related to self-employment, working in multiple jobs, and field professions both before and after the adjustment procedure. Workers have a range of reasons for voluntarily or involuntarily working in alternative employment, balancing the disadvantages and benefits associated with a particular job. For instance, part-time workers cited convenience and time for activities that were not related to work as reasons for choosing their jobs. Those who were self-employed were more likely to report income potential and having the freedom to make their own decisions as reasons for taking their jobs. However, those reporting some type of alternative working arrangement were less likely to report interesting work, advancement opportunity, good starting salary, or good job security as reasons for taking their jobs. In addition, workers with several types of alternative employment were less likely to report receiving benefits, for all benefits examined, and they often reported lower salaries. Among the 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients who worked full time, those who were self-employed earned more than their counterparts, while those with multiple jobs earned less than those with only one job. Those with professional occupations earned more than those in clerical or field professions. However, no income differences were detected among part-time workers according to self-employment or multiple job status. Gender differences were also observed in the relationship between income and various types of alternative employment. For example, while being self-employed was associated with higher income and working in multiple jobs was associated with lower income among full-time male workers, these results were not detected among their female counterparts."}, {"section_title": "Life sciences DAS Variable", "text": "Natural resources, forestry, biological science (including zoology), biophysics, geography, interdisciplinary studies, including biopsychology environmental studies."}, {"section_title": "Physical sciences", "text": "Physical sciences including chemistry, physics.

Panel weight for NPSAS and B&B BNBPANEL Panel weight for NPSAS, B&B93/94, and B&B93/97 response. This weight was used for all analyses in this report. Family income and dependency status DEPEND This is one of two variables used to display information in this report for family income and dependency status. This variable is used to create separate estimates for dependent and independent students. Students were considered independent if 1) the institution reported that they were independent, or 2) they met one of the following seven criteria: a) Twenty-four or older as of 12/31/92; b) Student was a veteran; c) Student was an orphan or ward of the court; d) Student had legal dependents, other than spouse; e) Student was married, and not claimed by parents on 1992 tax returns; f) Student was a graduate student and not claimed as a dependent by parents on 1992 tax returns; g) Student was a single undergraduate, not claimed as a dependent by parents on either 1990 or 1991 tax returns, and was self sufficient for 2 years prior to receiving any federal aid.

Once institutions were organized by zip code and state, they were further stratified by control (i.e., public; private, notfor-profit; or private, for-profit) and degree offering (less-than-2-year, 2-to 3-year, 4-year nondoctorate-granting, and 4-year doctorate-granting),I3 For more information about the NPSAS:93 survey, refer to the Methodology Report for the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, 1992-93 (NCES 95-211, Washington, DC: U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1995.

Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling errors. Sampling errors occur because observations are made only on samples of populations rather than entire populations. Nonsampling errors occur not only in sample surveys but also in complete censuses of entire populations. Nonsampling errors can be attributed to a number of sources: inability to obtain complete information about all sample members (e.g., some students or institutions refused to participate, or students participated but answered only certain items); ambiguous definitions; differences in interpreting questions; inability or unwillingness to give correct information; mistakes in recording or coding data; and other errors of collecting, processing, sampling, and imputing missing data. \"The NPSAS universe excludes institutions offering only correspondence courses, institutions enrolling only their own employees, and U.S. service academies. For this B&B cohort, institutions were further stratified by the number of degrees in education they had awarded in the past. "}, {"section_title": "Adjustment of Means to Control for Background Variation", "text": "Many of the independent variables included in the analyses in this report are related, and to some extent the pattern of differences found in the descriptive analyses reflect this covariation. For example, when examining the propensity to have an alternative working arrangement by gender, it is possible that some of the observed relationship is due to differences in other factors related to gender, such as marital status, age at degree completion, and so on. However, if nested tables were used to isolate the influence of these other factors, cell sizes would become too small to identify the significant differences in patterns. When the sample size becomes too small to support controls for another level of variation, other methods must be used to take such variation into account. The method used in this report estimates adjusted means with regression models, an approach sometimes referred to as communality analysis. For the multivariate analyses reported here, multiple linear regression was used to obtain means that were adjusted for covariation among a list of control variables.18 Each independent variable is divided into several discrete categories. To find an estimated mean value on the dependent variable for each category of an independent variable, while adjusting for its covariation with other independent variables in the equation, substitute the following in the equation: (1) a one in the category's term in the equation, (2) zeroes for the other categories of this variable, and (3) the mean proportions for all other independent variables. This procedure holds the impact of all remaining independent variables constant, and differences between adjusted means of categories of an independent variable represent hypothetical groups that are balanced or proportionately equal on all other characteristics included in the model as independent variables. For example, consider a hypothetical case in which two variables, age and gender, are used to describe an outcome, Y (such as having an alternative working arrangement). The variables age and gender are recoded into a dummy variable representing age, A, and a dummy variable representing gender, G: "}]
