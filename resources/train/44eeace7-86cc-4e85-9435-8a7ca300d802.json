Although numerous studies of this type have documented a higher subsequent incidence of clinically significant coronary events (angina pectoris, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or cardiac death) in those individuals demonstrating exercise-induced ST segment depression than in those without such depression, the predictive value of this electrocardiographic finding has generally been low.1-14 Thus, the percentage of asymptomatic individuals with exercise-induced ST segment depression who subsequently developed angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or experienced cardiac death averaged only 21% in a pooled series of eight studies comprising over 7,000 subjects.

The longitudinal character of this study allows for the assessment of the effect of exercise ST segment response at a particular time point on subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as well as the effect of a change in ST segment response on these end points. In addition, we sought to confirm and perhaps generalize the recent observation that in asymptomatic men with an abnormal ST segment response to exercise, the first clinical manifestation of coronary artery disease is usually angina pectoris, whereas in those with a normal ST segment response, the presenting coronary event is more often myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death. "}, {"section_title": "Follow-up", "text": "The status of study subjects was assessed during subsequent biennial longitudinal visits to the Gerontology Research Center. Follow-up information on subjects who failed to return was obtained by telephone interview, contact with the subject's family, or contact with the subject's personal physician. Followup data were complete in 97% of the subjects. The subsequent development of angina pectoris was determined from the subjects' response to a standard questionnaire and individual clinical assessment by a specially trained cardiopulmonary technologist and a cardiologist, and was made independent of exercise test results. Myocardial infarction was diagnosed by conventional clinical criteria during a subsequent hospitalization or by the development of diagnostic Q waves on the resting electrocardiogram (codes, 1:1 or 1: 2). For deceased individuals, the cause of death was determined by the consensus of three BLSA physicians after review of the death certificate, hospital records, autopsy data, and communications with the subject's family and personal physician. In those subjects who developed more than one cardiac event (n =6), only the initial event was used for analysis."}, {"section_title": "Groups", "text": "For each individual who demonstrated an ischemic ST segment response to treadmill exercise, whether on initial testing (group 1) or on repeat testing after an initially negative test (group 2), a control subject was selected from among the 548 subjects who manifested only negative exercise electrocardiographic responses to at least 85% of age-predicted maximum heart rate without the development of anginal pain (group 3). These age-and sex-matched controls constituted group 3A. All group 3A subjects were successfully matched to within 2 years of subjects in groups 1 and 2. Follow-up duration for individuals in groups 1 and 2 was calculated from the time of the first positive exercise test; follow-up duration for subjects in groups 3 and 3A was calculated from the time of their second normal exercise test."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "The following baseline characteristics of individuals with initially positive exercise electrocardiograms (group 1) were compared with those of converters (group 2): age, gender, current smoking status (smokers were defined as those smoking at least five cigarettes daily), presence of hypertension (defined as a resting blood pressure .160/95 mm Hg or treatment with antihypertensive drug therapy), and total serum cholesterol. The rates and distribution of coronary events (angina, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiac death) and the latency from the first positive exercise electrocardiogram to the time of the event were compared in subjects with a positive exercise electrocardiogram (groups 1 and 2 com- vs. 18.5%), age at event (74\u00b18 vs. 70\u00b18 years), and distribution of events (11 cases of angina, four nonfatal infarctions, and two cardiac deaths vs. nine cases of angina, two nonfatal infarctions, and six cardiac deaths) were nearly identical between groups 1 and 2, respectively. In particular, angina pectoris comprised 59% of the initial events among all individuals with a positive exercise electrocardiogram and did not differ significantly between group 1 (65%) and group 2 (53%).\nAge-and sex-matched individuals who demonstrated only negative exercise electrocardiograms (group 3A) were approximately one half as likely to experience a coronary event as individuals in groups 1 and 2 ( Table 2) . Although the overall event rate of group 3A subjects was lower than in groups 1 and 2, their mean age at event, gender distribution, and mode of presentation were similar, with angina pectoris comprising 44% of all initial events. Among the entire set of 548 subjects with persistently negative ST segment responses (group 3), a total of 30 events occurred: 15 cases of angina pectoris, seven nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and eight cardiac deaths. The latency period to an event in group 3 subjects was 6.4\u00b13.9 years after their second exercise test and 3.4\u00b12.7 years after their most recent test, with 26 of 30 events occurring within 5 years of the most recent test.\nThe results of the proportional hazards regression analyses for the entire population are shown in Table  3 . Most noteworthy is the nearly identical augmented risk of a coronary event in groups 1 and 2, relative to group 3 controls. As anticipated, older age, male sex, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and elevated total cholesterol were also significant independent risk factors for a future cardiac event in this asymptomatic population. Although only four of the 64 total coronary events occurred in women, such events developed in three of the 32 women in group 1, none of the 2 women in group 2, and only one of the 123 women in group 3 (p<0.02). Survival analysis for groups 1, 2, and 3 after adjustment for standard coronary risk factors is shown in Figure 1 . As anticipated from Table 3 , an abnormal ST segment response to exercise (groups 1 and 2) portends a diminished event-free survival. Furthermore, the survival curves for groups 1 and 2 are quite similar, confirming the results in Tables 2 and 3 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In asymptomatic populations, an abnormal ST segment response to exercise has generally proven disappointing as a predictor of future coronary events. The positive predictive value of such an ST segment response in this study was 19%, which is within the range previously reported.1-13,15 The positive predictive value for a \"hard end point\" (myocardial infarction or cardiac death) as the presenting event was even lower (7.9%), consistent with a recent analysis of several large studies.21 Such low predictive value is in accord with Bayes' theorem when a test of less than 100% specificity is used in a population with a low prevalence of significant coronary artery disease.

Although a positive ST segment response, whether on initial or serial testing, was associated with a doubling of the risk for a future coronary event, 81% of such subjects did not experience an event during the mean follow-up interval of 6.4 years.\nIt has been postulated that in an asymptomatic individual, conversion from a normal to an abnormal ST segment exercise response might be more predictive of significant coronary artery disease or a future cardiac event than an initially abnormal test.31116 According to this hypothesis, a serial change in the ST segment response is presumed to represent an interim reduction in coronary artery luminal diameter sufficient to produce silent myocardial ischemia. Such a distinction between true positive and false positive tests based on a change from previous test results is theoretically attractive. Unfortunately, our longitudinal data do not support such an assumption.\nIn this study, the incidence of subsequent coronary events (i.e., angina pectoris, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or cardiac death) was nearly identical between the 86 asymptomatic group 1 subjects whose initial exercise test was abnormal and the 92 group 2 subjects who converted from a negative (normal) "}]
