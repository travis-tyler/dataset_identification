There was a time when teachers and textbooks were the communicators and filters of knowledge, but now much of the world's knowledge is accessible to any student who can turn on a computer and log in to the internet (Renzulli, 2007) . The role of technology in early childhood environments has been and is still under debate. The National Center for Education Statistics (2003) conducted an early childhood longitudinal study on computer access at home and at school. Results indicate that in only one year, from 1999 to 2000, Internet access increased from developments were predicted to be damaged due to lack of social interactions with humans. Another concern from this report claims that the decreasing face-to-face interaction with humans will damage societal interactions causing an increase in crime and decrease in empathy. An increased use of computers for instruction may create an imbalance among the traditional components of child development which early childhood professionals believe are necessary for mental health. Claims that intellectual and creative development will be damaged by use of computers with young children are supported in this report.\nThis report paints an ominous picture of negative effects in all areas of child development and implies that technology use for instruction and assessment may actually hurt children's development. A question exemplifying the Alliance's concerns and stance is, \"Must five-year-olds be trained on computers today to get the high-paying jobs of tomorrow?\" which is later answered by the assertion that \"the technology in schools today will be obsolete long "}, {"section_title": "Research Question", "text": "What technology tools are considered age appropriate for very young and young children?"}, {"section_title": "Theoretical Framework", "text": "The framework used for our approach incorporates Figure 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Procedures", "text": "A survey identifying types of popular technology was sent to professional groups in both IDT and ECE that requested a selection of popular technology tools by age grouping of child that included 5 options about technology and education.

However, for children from ages 2-8 and children ages 13-15, a higher percentage of IDT professionals agree that this technology is appropriate (Tables 3 and 4) .

It would, therefore, be beneficial to consider ECE and IDT professionals' judgments for certain types of technology from the above list.
