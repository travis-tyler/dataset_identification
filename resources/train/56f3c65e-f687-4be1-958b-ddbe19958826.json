[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Barrier islands are thin stretches of land located parallel to the mainland. They occupy between 6.5 to 12 percent of the world's shorelines (Brenner, Moore, & Murray, 2015;Moore, Patsch, List, & Williams, 2014;Stutz & Pilkey, 2001). Barrier islands are densely populated and provide a number of ecosystem services, including protection of the mainland against storm surges (Grzegorzewski, Cialone, & Wamsley, 2010). Storms have a big impact on barrier islands, as they change sediment volumes. Breaches and washovers are important for longer term change in response to sea-level rise because they generate landward-directed sediment fluxes. On short term however, these are hazards for densely populated places. Both breaches and washovers are very different outcomes and hazards (figure 1). The response to storms is variable alongshore. Sometimes sand deposits in the lagoon, at the back of the island. On other locations island breach and inlets are formed. We still cannot predict when these occur. Detailed numerical models exist that can simulate barrier response (e.g. XBeach). But general formative conditions for breaches and overwash deposits are not yet known. For example, the effect of island width, island height, water level difference between the ocean and the back barrier lagoon, and degree of island development. The island population on barrier islands is growing (Miselis & Lorenzo-Trueba, 2017), and the frequency of storms increases as well (Landsea, Vecchi, Bengtsson, & Knutson, 2010). It is therefore important to improve the understanding of variability in barrier island response to storms. Here we develop a simplified Delft3D-FLOW model of a barrier island to test different storm conditions and island morphologies and allows for comparison against observed storm impact. Our results will also be valuable as they can be used to parameterize the morphologic impact of storms for long-term models."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Hydrodynamic impacts on barrier island during storms", "text": "Storms initiate changes in hydrodynamics, as the surge level rises. The impacts of storms on barrier islands are categorized by Sallenger (2000). This classification is widely used in research on morphological changes of barrier islands (Plant & Stockdon, 2012;Roelvink, Kessel, Alfageme, & Canizares, 2003). Sallenger (2000) scaled the storm-induced patterns and net erosion/deposition rates into three different regimes. From low to high impact: collision-, overwash-, and inundationregime (figure 2). This study only looks at the storm impact during the inundation regime. During this regime the low run up elevation (Rlow) exceeds the dune crest (Dhigh) (figure 2a). The entire island is inundated, including the subaerial part (Sallenger, 2000). In the inundation regime water flows over the dune crest. This water has a potential energy as there is a difference in hydraulic head between the ocean and the lagoon. This forces the water to flow in the direction of the lagoon. A channel can cut through the island if the flow is channeled and if energy loss due to friction is nihil (Pierce, 1970). A large slope, and therefore a strong flow is created by a large difference in water level and a narrow island width. This water level difference is caused by a time lag between the storm surge at the ocean and the lagoon (McCall et al., 2010;Pirrello, 1992). The duration of the storm determines the period this water level difference will last. The inundation time is also influenced by the barrier island height. High elevated islands experience shorter inundation time than low elevated islands, with the same storm duration (Pilkey Jr.,Neal,Figure 2b: Delineation of four different regimes categorizing storm impacts (Sallenger, 2000) Figure 2a: Definition sketch describing variables used in scaling the impact of storms on barrier islands (Sallenger, 2000) Monteiro, & Dias, 1989). McCall et al., (2010) showed that storms with a short duration had less volume change than long lasting storms."}, {"section_title": "Morphological impacts on barrier island during the inundation regime", "text": "The cross barrier water flow during the inundation regime carries sediment from the island towards the back barrier lagoon. This can result in inlet formation or the deposition of sediment as washover fans (Pierce, 1970). When the flow erodes the dune crest to a height below sea level, the island breaches and an inlet is formed. The ocean and the lagoon are now connected (Oertel, 1985). When the water and sediment flow over the crest of a beach system is more depositional, washover fans are formed (Nienhuis & Lorenzo-Trueba, 2019). When the flow velocity and therefore the carrying capacity is strongly decreased, the sediment deposits. It was seen, by research of Donnelly (2008), that the strongest decrease in overwash flow velocity occurs at the lagoon water level interface. Washovers are therefore often connected to the rear of the island. The thickness of the washover deposit is positively controlled by the accommodation space. This relation causes fan shaped deposits in the back barrier lagoon (Wang & Horwitz, 2006;Matias et al., 2007). When the crossshore flow is erosional, the breaching potential is increased. If deposition is more dominant the breaching potential is decreased. Variations in erosion and deposition of barrier island during storms is widely recognized (Elko et al., 2000;Houser, Hapke, & Hamilton, 2008;Stallins, Albert & Parker, 2003). XBEACH is a commonly used model to understand the driving factors causing this variation (Harter & Figlus, 2017;McCall et al., 2010;Van Der Lugt, Quataert, Van Dongeren, Van Ormondt, & Sherwood, 2019;Wesselman et al., 2018). This model is specifically made to simulate dune erosion during extreme wave conditions including wave breaking, surf and swash zone processes. McCall et al. (2010b) found that the water level gradient is one of the most important driving factors for along shore variation in back barrier deposition. Also research by Wesselman et al. (2018) showed that the magnitude of the storm has a high impact on the cross-shore sediment transport. Barrier island characteristics can also force along shore variation in storm response. If an island is high and wide the chance of inlet formation is minimized (Claudino-Sales, Wang, & Horwitz, 2008;Clinch, Russ, Oliver, Mitasova, & Overton, 2012;Kraus, Militello, & Todoroff, 2002;Stone, Liu, Pepper, & Wang, 2004). The influence of island cover differences on barrier island response was investigated by Rogers et al. (2015). A comparison of prestorm and poststorm Lidar images showed that areas with a high building density experienced limited erosion and deposition compared to natural areas. McCall et al. (2010) found that resistance to erosion of the island cover had larger impacts on the sediment transport during storms, than hydraulic forces as water level difference and wave height.  (Hapke et al., 2013)."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Model setup", "text": "The model used in this research is DELFT3D-FLOW. This model combines hydrodynamic and morphodynamic equations to simulate shallow water flow and sediment transport in three dimensions.

The bathymetry updates every time step (Deltares, 2014;Lesser, Roelvink, van Kester, & Stelling, 2004). The DELFT3D module is a commonly used tool to simulate flow in shallow waters. Examples of research areas are: water levels in coastal areas (Stockdon, Sallenger, Holman, & Howd, 2007), barrier islands (Roelvink et al., 2003), rivers (Nienhuis, T\u00f6rnqvist, & Esposito, 2018), and shallow seas (Luijendijk, 2001).

For the category 'sand' we use non-cohesive sediment with a median sediment diameter of 200 \u00b5m. To simulate the asphalt cover, a layer of 0.1 m cohesive sediment is added to the initial grid (figure 4). For this layer the critical bed shear stress for erosion is set to 1.0e+1 [N m -2 ].

The volumetric difference results in deposition and erosion cells. The Delft3D output is classified as inlet when the summed erosion exceeds the summed deposition. We have classified a model result as overwash when the total deposition is larger than the erosion. The erosion and deposition volumes are obtained from the lagoon area directly connected to the backbarrier. When an inlet is formed still a lot of sediments can be deposited in the back of the lagoon, without connection to the island. This can disrupt the storm output classification. Therefore, the sediment volumes are measured from a lagoon area directly connected to the island and with a limited extend into the lagoon (appendix 1.1). \nWe ran 144 simulations for different island geometries and storm characteristics (table 2) erosion, based on the area above sea level.

With this comparison the model performance could be estimated. From NOAA Rapid Response Imagery (NOAA, 2012) we have found 6 breaches and 24 overwash fans along the New Jersey coast and Fire Island, New York (appendix 3). We have used pre-storm Google Earth images and topography to extract island width for these locations. The pre-storm island height has been extracted from the Scenario-based coastal change forecasts: Elevation of the dune crest dataset. This dataset provides the height of the dune crest (DHIGH in m, NAVD88) for the East coast of the United States. The elevation has been extracted from LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) topography with a resolution of 10 m along shore and 2.5 m cross-shore, and averaged into 1 km bins. The data was collected between May and June 2010, by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE, 2010). The prestorm island height of the analyzed locations is 5m on average. We have retrieved hurricane Sandy ocean and lagoon water levels from an ADCIRC hindcast model simulation via the Coastal Emergency Risk Assessment (Coastal Emergency Risks Assessment, n.d.). This simulation show that the water level differences between the ocean and lagoon ranged from 0 to 3.7m for the different locations. Because ADCIRC model results exist up Island cover sand asphalt to the peak of the storm, we extract storm duration from measurements of the nearest NOAA tide gauge stations (Forbes, Rhome, Mattocks, & Taylor, 2014). The length of the peak storm surge is taken as the storm duration.

The simulations with a 2m elevation ended in for 7.5% in net erosion. We also see that the summed displaced sediment volume (D-E) with an island elevation of 2m, is less extreme than in the lower situation. The standard deviation of the 1m simulations (3.7e+04) is much higher than the standard deviation of the 2m simulations (1.7e+04).

It can be seen from figure 7, that the boxplot for inlet is positive skewed and for washover almost normal distributed. The boxes have an overlap, which means that between slopes of 0.008-0.0125m both inlets and washovers form."}, {"section_title": "Impact of the storm duration", "text": "The relation between the summed displaced sediment volume and the storm duration can be seen in figure 8.

Also the storm duration shows no clear relation with fan size. However, the island cover does show a negative relation.

When we look at the modeled fan sizes in figure 10, the deposited area is 100 times as large as the observed ones. The relation between the island height and the fan size of the model shows the same pattern as the Sandy observations. Low elevated islands more often result in large overwash fans, than high elevated islands. Also the water slope has no clear relation with the fan size, as the observations show.

For example, the average island height was 5m, so below 5m was classified as low elevated and above 5m as high. It can be seen that high islands more often resulted in a washover than an inlet, than low elevated island. The influence of high water level slope on storm output is less visible, as these percentages do not differ much. Also, no relation be found between the storm duration and storm output. The island cover, on the other hand shows a strong influence. The asphalt covered islands show less inlets than island with a sand cover. When we compare these observed outcomes to the modeled storm outputs, we see similar relations. The simulations with a low island height resulted more often in inlets, compared to the low island high islands. The difference in storm output between low and high water slopes is larger in the model than from the observations, but both have a positive relation with breaching potential. For the storm duration there is a difference in storm output visible, in contrast to the Sandy observations.

"}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Although the model is a highly simplified version of reality, it gives an indication of the importance of certain variables in barrier island response to storms. The results show that with an increase in island elevation barrier island breaching is less likely than washover formation. This is in line with the outcomes of prior research (Claudino-Sales et al., 2008;Clinch, Russ, Oliver, Mitasova, & Overton, 2012;Kraus et al., 2002;Stone et al., 2004). The decrease of breaching potential can be explained by the larger volume of sediment that has to be eroded. Higher islands contain a larger sediment volume than low elevated islands. The expected positive influence of island height on washover potential can also be seen from the results. The modeled net D-E volumes are smaller both in the negative and positive side. This can be declared by the fact that high elevated islands experience shorter inundation times than low elevated islands, when the storm duration is the same. The influence of the water slope is less clear from the results than was hypothesized. This can be caused by the fact that only a small amount of runs with a large water level difference ended up being stable. The unstable runs mainly contain 3.5m water level difference and higher (appendix 2.2). Therefore, this group is not well represented in the analysis which creates a negative bias on the breach potential from the model. The model output is in line with the Sandy observations. From the storm duration model output no clear relation can be seen. This doesn't fit the hypnotized positive effect. This may be caused by time scale on which morphological responses to storms take place. When they inlets and washovers form in the first few hours of the storm, increasing the duration of the storm doesn't have an influence anymore. Changing the island cover doesn't show differences on both the breaching and washover potential. This is against expectations and not in line with the observations from Sandy, as these indicated that the amount of inlets would reduce with an asphalt cover. This can be caused by the absence of many sand cover simulations, as they are dominant in the unstable runs. Both the negative and positive D-E values were strongly reduced. This can be declared by the increase in resistance to erosion when an asphalt layer is added. The modeled fan sizes and sediment volumes cannot be used for predictions, as these seem unrealistically large, when comparing it to the Sandy data. On the other hand, the influence of the different variables on the fan size does show same patterns between the model and Sandy observations. Which indicates that the model can be used to get a better understanding of the controlling factors of barrier island response to storms. The difference in fan size could be reduced by changing the island cover in the model, as this has a large effect on the net changes in sediment volumes. From the Landsat images (Google Earth Engine, n.d.) it can be seen that these covers are much more complex and variable than was assumed in this research. For the comparison with hurricane Sandy the storm duration was obtained from NOAA tide gauges. As the distance between these stations is quite large in the study area, the storm duration could differ from reality at some transects. The validation with the Sandy data can also be influenced by the determination of the island cover. The island cover at the transact location is visually categorized from satellite images. In this classification only two categories were used, but at many locations it wasn't just one category. The most dominant cover type was chosen. In future research more types could be added, to be able to also include the influence of vegetation and mixed island covers. In addition, other, more storm specific variables could be added, such as distance to landfall, wave and wind characteristics. According to Billson, Russell, & Davidson (2019), infragravity waves are the main cause of beach and dune erosion. Therefore, it would be good to include these in further research. To include these variables another model should be used."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this study we looked at the controlling factors behind difference in barrier island response to storms. We used an Delft3D-FLOW model to simulate inlet and washover formations and compared these to Hurricane Sandy observations. We simulated different storms and pre-storm barrier island conditions, the island height, width and cover, even as the water level difference and storm duration. The model and Sandy results show resemblance. From both the model simulations and the Sandy observations we found that an increase in island height reduces the breaching potential. Also the island cover has influence on the breaching potential. When asphalt is added to the island surface we see reduction of inlets formation from the Sandy observations and a decrease in the amount of eroded and deposited sediment in the model.
