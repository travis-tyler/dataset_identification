[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Understanding the sequence of biological and clinical events along the course of Alzheimer's disease provides insights into dementia pathophysiology and can help participant selection in clinical trials. Our objective is to train two data-driven computational models for sequencing these events, the Event Based Model (EBM) and discriminative-EBM (DEBM), on the basis of well-characterized research data, then validate the trained models on subjects from clinical cohorts characterized by less-structured data-acquisition protocols.\nSeven independent data cohorts were considered totalling 2389 cognitively normal (CN), 1424 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 743 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data set was used as training set for the constriction of disease models while a collection of multi-centric data cohorts was used as test set for validation. Cross-sectional information related to clinical, cognitive, imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers was used.\nEvent sequences obtained with EBM and DEBM showed differences in the ordering of single biomarkers but according to both the first biomarkers to become abnormal were those related to CSF, followed by cognitive scores, while structural imaging showed significant volumetric decreases at later stages of the disease progression. Staging of test set subjects based on sequences obtained with both models showed good linear correlation with the Mini Mental State Examination score (R 2 EBM = 0.866; R 2 DEBM = 0.906). In discriminant analyses, significant differences (p-value \u2264 0.05) between the staging of subjects from training and test sets were observed in both models. No significant difference between the staging of subjects from the training and test was observed (p-value > 0.05) when considering a subset composed by 562 subjects for which all biomarker families (cognitive, imaging and CSF) are available. T Event sequence obtained with DEBM recapitulates the heuristic models in a data-driven fashion and is clinically plausible. We demonstrated inter-cohort transferability of two disease progression models and their robustness in detecting AD phases.

While progression of the disease invariably results in dementia, it has been estimated that clinically-overt manifestations are preceded by a latent phase with no measurable cognitive dysfunction lasting approximately 15-20 years (Sperling et al., 2011) . As AD onset remains insidious in terms of clinical manifestations, biomarkers are the most accurate approach to track disease onset and progression (Sperling et al., 2011) .\nA variety of biomarkers have been proposed to describe the different phases of the disease, each mirroring different biochemical, functional, or structural changes as the disease develops and progresses. The correct sequence of biomarker transitions to abnormality would allow an appropriate characterization of the different clinical and preclinical disease stages. In addition, this approach could inform the development of individualized treatments in the context of precision medicine or the identification of individuals at-risk of dementia for secondary prevention strategies (Ten Kate et al., 2018a,b) .\nWhile the recently published research criteria (Albert et al., 2011; Dubois et al., 2014) for the definition of AD stages outlined robust principles (Jack et al., , 2013 (Jack et al., , 2016 , their operationalization in mathematical models and out-of-the-box algorithms has recently begun.\nThe event-based model (EBM) (Fonteijn et al., 2012; Young et al., 2014) and the discriminative event-based model (DEBM) (Venkatragahvan et al., 2019) are two among an increasing number (Oxtoby and Alexander, 2017) of probabilistic data-driven methods developed to understand evolution of biomarkers as disease develops and progresses Jedynak et al., 2012; Donohue et al., 2014; Lorenzi et al., 2017) . Their assumption is that the disease is characterized by an irreversible and monotonic change of biomarkers towards abnormality, which might track disease progression. Both algorithms are cross-sectional statistical models that use no strong a priori assumptions regarding the relationship among the different biomarkers or pre-defined cut-offs separating their normal and abnormal values. Both models estimate disease progression as a single average sequence, albeit in slightly different ways: the EBM estimates the maximum-likelihood sequence over all individuals, whereas the DEBM calculates the optimal event sequence as an average of estimations of patient-specific orderings.\nPrevious works demonstrated the EBM's capability to order biomarkers and stage subjects with a fine-grained ability in classification of Cognitively normal (CN) and AD subjects as well as to predict conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD or from CN to MCI (Fonteijn et al., 2012; Young et al., 2014) .\nSo far, statistical models have been tested and validated exclusively on a few well-characterized research data sets, such as: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (Fonteijn et al., 2012; Young et al., 2014; Venkatragahvan et al., 2019) , Magnetic Resonance in Multiple Sclerosis (MAGNIMS) (Eshaghi et al., 2018) , GENetic Frontotemporal dementia Initiative (GENFI) and TRACK-HD study of Huntington's disease (Wijeratne et al., 2018) , or on synthetic data. This work focusses on transferability of the models to clinical data in AD and provides new evidence that supports widespread clinical adoption of the EBM and DEBM.\nKey steps in the validation for the adoption of this kind of models are: (i) ability to build robust disease models on the basis of wellphenotyped research data sets, such as ADNI; (ii) consistency of the disease models on less well-phenotyped clinical data sets in terms of model stability and subjects' staging; (iii) clear end-user interfaces to make model results accessible by clinicians.\nIn the next sections, we addressed the aforementioned points towards the definition of two valid models for disease progression. Our goal was to assess the transferability of EBM and DEBM's optimal sequence of biomarkers on independent clinical data coming from six different multi-centric initiatives spanning the entire AD spectrum."}, {"section_title": "Material and methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "A total of 4556 subjects (CN = 2389; MCI = 1424; AD = 743) from different cohorts were selected for this study.

Each study was approved by the local medical ethics committee. Participants for our study were selected using of the following criteria: 1) availability of information on syndromic diagnosis at baseline; 2) availability of T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans obtained by either 1.5 T or 3 T scanners at baseline; 3) absence of any other major neurological, psychiatric or somatic disorders that could cause cognitive impairment at baseline.\nSubjects were divided in two subsets (Table 2) : training set, used to define the event sequences that serve as disease model, and test set, used for the validation of the disease models ( Table 2 ). The training set was composed of 1488 subjects from the ADNI data set of which 468 were CN, 753 were MCI and 267 were AD. The test set was formed by 3068 subjects from six independent data sets of which 1921 were CN, 671 were MCI and 476 were AD.

The selected imaging biomarkers were: volumetric measures of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, fusiform gyrus, middle-temporal gyrus and precuneus, together with whole brain volume and ventricles (Vemuri and Jack, 2010; Frisoni et al., 2010) . Imaging biomarkers were estimated from MRI 3D-T1 sequences analysed with FreeSurfer software v5.3 cross-sectional stream (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) and outputs were visually checked. We assumed a symmetric pattern of atrophy in AD and selected imaging biomarkers were averaged between the left and right hemisphere.\nImaging biomarkers and cognitive scores were available for the totality of subjects from the training set, while CSF biomarkers were available for 72% of these individuals. Imaging biomarkers were available for the totality of test subjects while cognitive scores were available for 84% of test subjects. Within the test set, ADAS-Cog and RAVLT scores were available only for subjects from the PharmaCog data set. CSF biomarkers were available for 18% of test subjects. See Table 2 for full information on biomarker availability. CSF biomarkers were obtained with different assays across different cohorts, i.e. Multiplex xMAP Luminex platform with Innogenetic immunoassay kit-based reagents (Kang et al., 2012) for ADNI subjects and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) (Butler, 2000) for subjects from all other cohorts, which led to different CSF biomarkers distributions. In order to tackle this issue and to correct for possible acquisition-related differences across datasets, all biomarkers (cognitive scores, CSF, imaging) from subjects from ADC, ARWiBo (Alzheimer's disease Repository Without Borders), EDSD (European DTI Study on Dementia), OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies), PharmaCog and ViTA (Vienna Transdanube Aging) cohorts were rescaled to match the mean and standard deviation of biomarkers distribution of ADNI subjects. In order to ensure Gaussianity, we performed a log-transformation of p-tau and t-tau as their values were nonnormally distributed.\nAll biomarkers from the training and test sets were regressed against age, education and sex and the effects of these factors were corrected to compensate inter cohort demographic variability (Gale et al., 2007) ; imaging biomarkers were additionally regressed and corrected against eTIV (Kiraly et al., 2016; Gur et al., 1991) to compensate for head size. Correction of biomarkers was performed separately for training set and test set.\nThe comparison of the selected biomarkers in this study among the three clinical groups and the seven data cohorts considered in this study are shown in Supplementary Material SF1."}, {"section_title": "Mathematical modelling", "text": "Development of EBM and DEBM was based on the fundamental work of Fonteijn et al. (Fonteijn et al., 2012) . According to these approaches, each biomarker is considered as either normal or abnormal and its probabilistic transition from the normal to the abnormal state is defined as event. The aim is to define in a data-driven manner the sequence of events that describe the most probable ordered cascade that characterizes the transition of a subject from the healthy state to the full-blown disease spectrum (Young et al., 2014) . For this work, we employed python module pyebm (https://github.com/EuroPOND/ pyebm), where both algorithms are implemented.\nIn the EBM (Fonteijn et al., 2012; Young et al., 2014) possible event sequences are sampled via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process aimed at finding the sequence that best fits the biomarker observations from all subjects. At each Monte Carlo step a new sequence is The number of cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and total subjects is reported for each data set. Biomarker availability is expressed as percentage related to the total subjects in each data set. No CSF biomarker is available for OASIS and ViTA data sets.\nD. Archetti, et al. NeuroImage: Clinical 24 (2019) 101954 sampled as a random swap between two biomarkers of the current benchmark sequence. If the new sequence is a better fit than the benchmark sequence, which is determined mathematically by the likelihood, then the new sequence is considered as the benchmark sequence for the following MCMC step. The probability of an event for each biomarker is determined by a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) where the normal and abnormal components are modelled by Gaussian distributions. In EBM (Young et al., 2014) , distributions of normal and abnormal biomarkers are initialized as the distributions of biomarkers from the CN and AD subjects, respectively. The mixture model distribution for each biomarker is then found as the sum, weighted on the mixing parameters, of the two aforementioned distributions that best fits to biomarker values from all subjects. Optimization of the GMM function is performed along the Gaussian parameters and the mixing parameters and in order to avoid the possibility that biomarkers will not show a clear bimodal distribution, the standard deviations for normal and abnormal components in the GMM are constrained to be no greater than the standard deviations of CN and AD subjects, respectively.\nThe approach of DEBM model (Venkatraghavan et al., 2017 (Venkatraghavan et al., , 2019 for the calculation of the central ordering, on the other hand, is a twostep process where first (i) a specific ordering is calculated for each subject by sorting the posterior probability that each biomarker has become abnormal and then (ii) the central ordering is calculated as the event sequence that minimizes the sum of probabilistic Kendall's tau distances between itself and all the subject-wise orderings. As the posterior probability is influenced by the physiological variability of biomarkers, DEBM assumes that single subject orderings are noisy estimates of the central ordering (Venkatragahvan et al., 2019) .\nThe original formulation of DEBM (Venkatragahvan et al., 2019 ) also contains a specific mixture model, for which an initial estimate of the distributions of non-diseased and diseased subjects for each biomarker is performed using values from subjects at the opposite ends of the disease spectrum, as defined by a Bayesian classifier which is trained to remove outliers and wrongly labelled data. This allows efficient separation of the two Gaussian distributions of normal and abnormal values for each biomarker. The biased distributions are then refined including data from all subjects via a GMM that has constraints based on the aforementioned relationships between the expected and the biased distributions. The same objective GMM function as for EBM is optimized alternatively along the Gaussian parameters and the mixing parameters until the latter converge.\nOptimal sequences were calculated as averages of orderings obtained from 50 bootstrapped iterations for both EBM and DEBM. Furthermore, in EBM the number of MCMC steps was set to 50.000 to ensure convergence of the likelihood. In practice convergence was typically observed before the 15.000-th MCMC step.\nSee Supplementary Material SS1 for detailed mathematical modelling."}, {"section_title": "Model validation & statistical analysis", "text": "Validation of the models is performed by staging subjects from the training and test sets on the basis of the event sequences built on the basis of biomarkers from subjects from the training set. Specific methods for staging subjects are available in the original works for both the EBM (Young et al., 2014) and DEBM (Venkatragahvan et al., 2019) . For the sake of simplicity, and in order to have a common staging system for both models, the method from Young et al. (2014) was employed in this work. This method assigns each subject a position of the central event sequence, resulting in a number of stages that is equal to the number of biomarkers considered for the sequence plus one, as it is necessary to add stage 0 where no biomarker is abnormal. The stage of each subject is calculated as the k-th step of the event sequence that maximizes the probability that all events up to k have already occurred and events from k + 1 to the end of the sequence are yet to occur. In case of missing biomarkers, the probability of the biomarkers to be abnormal was set to 0.5 (Young et al., 2015) . Assuming that clinical diagnoses of all subjects are made through a biomarker-based assessment, it is expected that each subject, either from the training or test set, is staged at the earlier positions of the event sequences if CN and at the later positions if AD.\nMeasures of area under curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy at optimal threshold k T were calculated for all pairwise comparisons among clinical groups, i.e. (i) AD vs. CN, (ii) AD vs. MCI, and (iii) MCI vs. CN. In order to assess significant differences between receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the DeLong test (DeLong et al., 1988) was performed.\nTo assess the validity of the EBM and DEBM central orderings we explored the linear correlation between subjects' model stages and MMSE scores. The MMSE is the most widely used screening tool to assess cognitive functions in both routine clinical practice and research settings and its score correlates with the different phases of AD progression (Tombaugh and McIntyre, 1992) . In order to avoid circularity MMSE scores were excluded from the initial calculation of the event sequences. Moreover, in order to mitigate the ceiling effect typical of MMSE (Hoops et al., 2009) , the lower limit for the linear regression analysis was set as the model stage that provides the optimal threshold for separating CN and MCI subjects.\nTo explore how much the missing biomarkers of test subjects (Table 2 ) affected the classification performances in both models, staging was also performed for a special subset of test subjects having at least one CSF measurement, MMSE score and imaging biomarkers. These restriction criteria reduced the original test subjects from 3068 to 562 (104 CN,331 MCI, 127 AD) and the number of events considered in our original simulation from 13 to 12 as ADAS-Cog and RAVLT were excluded since they were available only for the PharmaCog data set, while MMSE was included.\nStatistical analysis was performed with R version 3.5.1."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Events ordering", "text": "Central event sequences and their variances were generated from biomarkers of training subjects for both EBM and DEBM and were plotted as positional variance diagrams (Fig. 1) .\nThe event sequence obtained with the DEBM algorithm showed that amyloid related biomarkers became abnormal first. The abnormalities of A\u03b2 1,42 protein and A\u03b2 1,42 /p-Tau ratio are at the very first positions followed by cognitive scores, Tau protein-related biomarkers, and finally imaging markers of AD-relevant brain regions. Averaged volumes between left and right hemisphere of hippocampus and precuneus are respectively the first and the last brain areas to become abnormal while the medial temporal lobe is in between. The enlargement of the ventricles and the atrophy of the whole brain were in the last two positions.\nIn EBM, CSF biomarkers are the first to show abnormality, although with a different pattern with respect to DEBM. Tau related biomarkers became abnormal earlier and often before amyloid-related biomarkers. The sequence obtained with EBM followed a similar ordering for the cognitive scores although the specific order of RAVLT and ADAS scores is swapped.\nThe enlargement of the ventricles is placed at the fourth position of the ordering although the positional variance showed that this event has nonzero probability of occurring in the first or last position of the sequence. Volumetric measures of the grey matter of the fusiform gyrus and precuneus are placed at the very last positions of the EBM benchmark sequence. Both EBM and DEBM showed good positional stability (see Fig. 1) , and in the case of DEBM no event occurs far from the diagonal.\nD. Archetti, et al.

Similarly, the majority of AD were staged at positions 12-13 (of 13 total) of both sequences. Most of the remaining CN subjects were spread across stages 1-6 in EBM and 1-4 in DEBM.

MCI subjects staged at position 0 had an average MMSE score of 28.2 \u00b1 2.1 for training set and 27.0 \u00b1 2.1 for test set.\nStaging of the subjects from each data set on the basis of EBM and DEBM sequences shows a good separation between CN and AD subjects in each case, and generally few subjects are staged at positions 1-7 for EBM and 1-5 for DEBM as these stages correspond to CSF and cognitive biomarkers (see Supplementary material SF2).

For AD vs. MCI subjects, balanced accuracy and AUC in both training and test sets were always > 0.71. No significant differences were registered between the AUC of EBM and DEBM.

The maximum balanced accuracy threshold (k T ) used in the classification increases across the disease spectrum in both models with the exception of DEBM on ADNI subjects where the threshold is constant for all classifications. This is compatible with the idea that EBM and DEBM produce event sequences that track disease progression. To fully explore the capabilities of the two models and to perform a fair head to head comparison we run similar analyses in the training and test sets considering all the 14 biomarkers (see Supplementary Material SF4, SF5). On average, the general performance in discriminating subjects from the test set improved by 2 and 4 percentage points respectively for DEBM and EBM (see Supplementary Material ST2).

This is also the first cross-cohort assessment of the models' validity on cross-sectional multimodal biomarkers. Previous literature focused only on well characterized research datasets and synthetic data (Young et al., 2014; Venkatraghavan et al., 2017 Venkatraghavan et al., , 2019 Iturria-Medina et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014; Koval et al., 2018; Schiratti et al., 2015) but this kind of approach does not take into consideration the aspects of real clinical data. We investigated and compared the performance of EBM and DEBM when applied to the same training and test data sets which included subjects across the entire disease spectrum, accounting for missing data. EBM and DEBM rely on different estimates of the Gaussian mixture models and in the definition of the optimal sequence of biomarkers. As highlighted in literature (Venkatragahvan et al., 2019) , the optimization technique adopted in DEBM, for which Gaussian parameters and mixing parameters are optimized alternatively, prevents the abrupt change of the mixing parameter for small changes in the Gaussian parameters that was observed in EBM.\nWe observed differences between EBM and DEBM optimal event sequences. The DEBM sequence is closer to Jack's model (Vemuri and Jack, 2010) and also mirrors stages V and VI of cortical degeneration due to neurofibrillary tangles deposition as described in Braak's Model (Braak et al., 1993) . The DEBM sequence starts with A\u03b2 1,42 and A\u03b2 1,42 / p-Tau ratio, while the EBM sequences suggests p-Tau as the first biomarker to become abnormal. Although in literature it is not completely understood which is triggering the other (if at all), much evidence suggests A\u03b2 1,42 deposition to be upstream of Tau deposition. The deposition of amyloid plaques presumably triggers the conversion of Tau protein to toxic state, while less evidence suggests that toxic Tau can enhance A\u03b2 1,42 toxicity via a feedback loop. Soluble toxic aggregates of A\u03b2 1,42 and p-Tau can self-propagate and spread throughout the entire brain, perhaps enhancing other destructive biochemical pathways (Bloom, 2014) and triggering the abnormality cascade of the other biomarkers. It is important to consider, however, that the transition to abnormality of a biomarker may not correspond to its pathological change, since no a priori thresholds are set. Fig. 4 . Positional variance diagrams of event sequences computed from training set (left) and test set (right) using EBM (a) and DEBM (b) algorithms. In the case of DEBM green lines divide the sequences into homogeneous blocks between the training and test sets. Orange boxes represent biomarker exceptions not conserved in the same block comparing the training vs. test positional variance diagrams. Clear event blocks cannot be identified for EBM sequences.

In particular, EBM ordering of cognitive results seems slightly more plausible, ordering the RAVLT before ADAS13, as RAVLT has been reported to be more sensitive to detect abnormal changes in pre-dementia condition (EstevezGonzalez et al., 2003) while ADAS is more specific to detect moderate AD conditions (Rosen et al., 1984) . According to both methods, cognitive tests were positioned before group-level neurodegeneration events in the benchmark sequences. This fact might be in contrast with literature Mormino et al., 2009 ) for which memory impairment occurs after volumetric decrease of brain regions. This difference can be explained by the fact that population-level volume changes may affect the event sequence (Young et al., 2014) . The earlier position of cognitive scores with respect to imaging biomarkers could be explained partially by the different GMMs used in the two algorithms and partially because of specific inclusion criteria for the ADNI training subjects. In ADNI, no subjects with severe cognitive impairments were included since one of the inclusion criteria was to have MMSE score at least equal to 18. This may affect the position in which cognitive test scores were considered abnormal because the threshold that separates normal from abnormal values might be overestimated by the models, considering that no a priori assumptions are made in EBM and DEBM.\nAs far as the MRI biomarkers are concerned, DEBM showed an expected pattern of grey matter atrophy with AD progression. Abnormalities were ordered throughout the temporal lobes as follows: hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, fusiform and mid temporal regions. Precuneus was affected subsequently, in agreement with model of cortical atrophy progression proposed by ten Kate et al. (2017) , where atrophy of parietal regions is associated with progression from MCI to dementia. The DEBM sequence presented the whole brain and subcortical abnormalities as end-sequence events. EBM did not capture the expected atrophic evolution of the grey matter and the main anomaly was represented by ventricles. Their abnormality was reported in the fourth position of the optimal sequence and their variability is spanning from the first to the last position. Two different local likelihood maxima due to different subtypes of AD in the EBM sequence space could be one possible reason. Also, this issue is not observable in DEBM, where normally the variance of an event is distributed continuously around its specific position, that means around the positional variance diagram bisector. The difference between the two models can be attributed to the smoothing effect intrinsic to the DEBM algorithm and, as highlighted in Venkatragahvan et al. (2019) , to the specific mixture model used in EBM. The sequences generated by EBM and DEBM models, however, represent a general event ordering for the progression of the disease and individual trajectories may show variability with respect to the optimal sequences.\nWe demonstrated, using data from ADNI and 6 other independent clinical cohorts, the performances of EBM and DEBM across the entire Alzheimer's time course. Staging of subjects in both the training and test sets showed separation between AD and CN in the two methods. This meant that the algorithms were effective at distinguishing subjects having only a few abnormal biomarkers from those having only a few normal biomarkers. As expected, the majority of CN subjects from the training set were staged at position 0, where no abnormality manifested yet, and a large number of AD subjects was at end-sequence stages 11-13. Staging of the test subjects followed the same general trend as ADNI, although subjects with a lack of CSF values or cognitive assessments and with normal imaging biomarker values were staged in proximity of non-symptomatic stage 0. The large number of CN subjects in the test sets that were staged in the last positions for both models, can be partly explained considering that a significant portion of these individuals are CN elderlies with volumetric anomalies and no other biomarker available, thus contributing to subjects' misclassification although MMSE score showed no abnormalities. Another portion of misclassified CN subjects is formed by individuals with abnormal imaging biomarkers but here the misclassification is due to the linear regression correction since the average eTIV of test subjects is significantly lower than the average eTIV of training subjects, thus, the imaging biomarkers of test subjects are artificially considered as atrophic with respect to the imaging biomarkers from the training set subjects.\nSome concerns may arise from the large number of MCI subjects staged at stage 0. The CSF and cognitive scores for the majority of these individuals were close but not yet over the probabilistic threshold values, therefore they were still in the normal ranges, and the models considered those subjects as normal. Despite this, staging evidences give comparable results to state-of-the-art classification techniques for prediction of conversion from MCI to dementia (Young et al., 2015; Willette et al., 2014) .\nEBM and DEBM showed good linear correlation with MMSE scores, fairly consistent with the clinical and regional biomarkers, thus producing an indirect validation of models with respect to the disease evolution. Both methods, after an initial plateau due to the ceiling effect typical for MMSE test (Hoops et al., 2009) , showed an expected linear decline (Perneczky et al., 2006) . Although it was a rather trivial approach, we tried to validate the EBM and DEBM event sequences even in absence of a validated pathological gold-standard across the data cohorts.\nWhen all test subjects are considered, we detected a significant drop of performance in classifying AD vs CN as well as in MCI vs CN subjects from ADNI to the test cohorts. This is probably due to missing data (CSF biomarkers and cognitive scores), which is known to increase uncertainty in subject staging (Young et al., 2014) . Indeed, when considering a reduced set of test subjects for which all biomarkers were available, the performances became much closer to those obtained from the training set and no more significant differences between training and test data sets were observable for both EBM and DEBM (p-values > 0.05). This reinforces the importance to collect an adequate set of biomarkers for an accurate staging of single subjects into the correct diagnostic class.\nAs far as the test set is concerned, the classification of AD vs CN subjects was significantly better in EBM than in DEBM (p-values\u22640.05). In classifying AD vs MCI, EBM was slightly better with higher sensitivity, balanced accuracy and AUC. In MCI vs CN, DEBM reached higher sensitivity and balanced accuracy while EBM reached higher specificity. This evidence might represent specific hints to guide the usage of EBM and DEBM for physicians according to the initial diagnostic hypothesis they want to test in their clinical practice.\nAn interesting consideration for future works is the possibility to use such methods to follow MCI in specific sub-classes, namely: amnestic MCI, non-amnestic MCI and MCI due to AD. Additional studies with extended age range of subject, larger and additional groups and additional biomarkers such as other brain regions will be helpful to achieve a more accurate description of AD via event-based models. Clinically relevant information related to patients' staging, together with the models' robustness as well as progressive tracking capabilities along the CN-to-AD course, might be implemented into a clinical decision support tool, to aid diagnosis and prognostic assessment of AD at early stages.\nAdditional efforts will be needed to understand the capabilities of staging subjects during clinical routine by means of EBM and DEBM in: (I) reducing the number of patients needed for future clinical trials, (II) monitoring the efficacy of disease modifying drugs, (III) personalized medicine.\nSo far, EBM and DEBM have been validated against well-characterized research datasets, synthetic data and, in the present study, multicentric clinical cohorts, but none of them has been yet compared against different stages of the AD pathology. In the next future, we would have to focus on further validation of both models against databases of population of normal and abnormal post-mortem studies on subjects assessed with as many biomarkers as possible, such as those collected in the Religious Orders Study (Bennett et al., 2012a) , Rush Memory and Aging Project (Bennett et al., 2012b) , the Adult Changes in Thought study (Kukull et al., 2002) , and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data set (Beekly et al., 2007) .\nSome limitations of the current results should be considered in future validations of event-based models. First, the tools here described need to be further compared with other complementary techniques based on longitudinal data sets, such as: temporal continuous models and spatiotemporal models -see (Oxtoby and Alexander, 2017) for a recent review of the field. Second, as clinicians are the potential beneficiaries of the tools based on such models, independent evaluators should rate the diagnostic added value and accuracy of EBM and DEBM. Third, the greatest limitations in the methods applied is the assumption of a common or average disease trajectory across individuals, while AD is highly heterogeneous and clearly violates this assumption. In this perspective single subject orderings already available in DEBM, and data-driven subtype progression patterns estimated using SuStaIn (Subtype and Stage Inference) could play a central role in the description of AD progression at the level of the single subject. Finally, computational time is worth considering: the extensive use of EBM or DEBM to analyse large volumes of data that must be preprocessed and that require large computational resources, such as: HPC, Grid, or Cloud (Redolfi et al., 2013 (Redolfi et al., , 2015 Frisoni et al., 2011) , indeed the models can be trained a priori and then they should be used in the clinical practice only to evaluate new subjects on the basis of the preferred model within an acceptable time frame.\nThe state of the art of these data driven models is represented by research tools (https://github.com/EuroPOND), that should be implemented in more user-friendly interfaces compatible with the clinical routine. Efforts towards the opportunities for clinical adoption and perceived importance of such a tool in clinical setting has started to appear (https://icometrix.com, n.d.) (see Supplementary material SF6)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We have performed an inter-cohort model transferability study and model performance comparison via external validation approach for event-based models. In the field of healthcare, the importance of data driven models will grow in the coming years, and the results presented here represent the first viability and generalizability proof of principle to train such models on research data and apply them clinically: on cross-sectional, less-well-characterized cohorts. We trained data-driven disease progression models with the ADNI data set and compared patients' ordering, staging and performance through ADC, ARWiBo, EDSD, OASIS, PharmaCog and ViTA data sets. Overall, we tested both models on 4556 subjects and 14 multimodal biomarkers. Both EBM and DEBM demonstrated similar and good classification performances especially when all biomarkers were available for test subjects. Orderings obtained from both models agreed with previous heuristic models. The event sequence generated through DEBM returned a more reasonable description of the course of AD, while EBM showed better classification performances, which are important considerations for future applications."}, {"section_title": "Declarations of Competing Interests", "text": "None.
