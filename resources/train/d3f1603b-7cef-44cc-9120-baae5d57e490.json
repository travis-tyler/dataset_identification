[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "This methodology monograph addresses the use of the HS&B first follow-up and NELS :88 second follow-up databases to draw comparisons between dropouts in 1982 and dropouts in 1992. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is mandated to \"collect and disseminate statistics and other data related to education in the United States\" and to \"conduct and publish reports on specific analyses of the meaning and significance of such statistics\" (Education Amendments of 1974-Public Law 93-380, Title V, Section 501, amending Part A of the General Education Provisions Act). The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988. The base year of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) represented the first stage of a major longitudinal effort designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by students as they leave elementary school and progress through high school and into postsecondary institutions or the work force. The base year study, conducted in the spring term of the 1987-88 school year, selected 26,432 potential eighth grade participants, of whom 24,599 were successfully surveyed in 1,052 public and private schools. Additional data were gathered from eighth graders' parents, teachers, and principals. The first follow-up in 1990 provided the first opportunity for longitudinal measurement of the 1988 baseline sample. It alsoafter sample freshening' provided a comparison point to high school sophomores ten years before, as studied in HS&B. One of the chief goals of the NELS:88 design has been to capture in a longitudinal data set the entire subpopulation of school dropouts from within a high school entry cohort.' Unlike HS&B, the NELS:88 first follow-up captured the population of early dropouts (those who leave school between the end of eighth grade and the end of tenth grade), while monitoring the transition of the student population into secondary schooling. The second follow-up took place in 1992, when most sample members entered the second term of their senior year. The second follow-up provides a culminating measurement of learning in the course of secondary school, and also collects information that will facilitate investigation of the transition into the labor force and postsecondary education after high school. Freshening the NELS:88 sample to represent the twelfth grade class of 1992 makes trend comparisons with the senior cohorts that were studied in NLS-72 and HS&B possible. The NELS:88 second follow-up resurveyed students who were identified as dropouts in 1990, and identified and surveyed those additional students who left school after the first follow-up. The NELS:88 third follow-up is taking place in 1994, with most sample members in postsecondary education or in the labor force. A major goal of the 1994 round is to provide data for trend comparisons with NLS-72 and HS&B, and to continue cross-wave comparisons with previous 2 The process of \"freshening\" added spring term 1990 sophomores who were not in the base year sampling frame, either because they were not in the country or because they were not in eighth grade in the spring term of 1988. The 1990 freshening process that provided a representative NELS:88 sophomore cohort was repeated in 1992 in order to provide a NELS:88 senior cohort, that is, a nationally representative sample of students enrolled in twelfth grade in the spring term of 1992. An important implication of this is that 1992 NELS:88 dropouts who left school before the spring term of the 1990 school year or who were eighth grade cohort members who were in a grade other than grade 10 at that time, cannot be compared to HS&B dropouts. (The NLSY sample, drawn from individuals 14-21 years of age on January 1, 1979, does provide a comparable sample of early dropouts.) It is uncertain what proportion HS&B was able to capture of the dropouts within age or grade cohorts entering secondary school at the time. However, it can be said how NELS:88 dropout statistics would differ, had the study begun, as did HS&B, with spring term sophomores. Using a definition of a dropout as an individual who is out of high school and receiving no alternative instruction, the proportion of the 1988 eighth grade cohort that was out of school in the spring term of 1992 was 11.6 percent. Using the same definition of 1992 enrollment status, and looking at the NELS:88 1990 sophomore cohort (that is, including 1990 freshened sophomores and excluding 1988 eighth graders who were not sophomores two years later), the dropout rate is 6.2 percent. (For details, see McMillen, Kaufman, Hausken and Bradby, 1993, Tables 19 and 21.) ix NELS:88 rounds. The 1994 survey will provide a basis for assessing how many dropouts have returned to school and by what route, and will measure the access of dropouts to vocational training programs and to other postsecondary institutions. A fourth follow-up is scheduled for 1998. The three NELS data seriesNLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88offer a number of possible time points for comparison. The possible comparison points, and the considerations of content and design which may affect the comparability of data across the cohorts, are summarized below. Subsequent to this summary, the focal question of this monographuse of HS&B and NELS:88 data for cross-cohort dropout comparisonsis addressed. An appendix documents specific comparison items that appear on the 1982 and 1992 dropout questionnaires. x 1' Comparing HS&B and NELS:88 Sophomore Cohort Dropouts There are special considerations in comparing the NELS:88 and HS&B dropout and early graduate populations. Dropoutsparticularly in the sense of who was assigned a dropout questionnaire were somewhat differently defined in the two studies. For example, in the NELS:88 second follow-up, dropouts who had obtained alternative credentials such as a GED were administered the student rather than the dropout questionnaire, along with the early graduate supplement. In HS&B such alternative completers were administered the dropout questionnaire and were not included in the early graduate supplement. Questionnaire assignment in the two studies is summarized in Table 1 below:   Table 1: Dropout and Student Questionnaire Assignment, HS&B (1982) and NELS:88 (1992) HS&B (1982) questionnaire NELS:88 (1992)  Use of appropriate subgroup membership flags permits the analyst to define dropouts in the same way in both HS&B and NELS:88; however, for respondents such as GED holders, some items that otherwise would be available cannot be compared because members of this group were treated as dropouts in HS&B. Some further alternatives and complexities in comparing HS&B and NELS:88 dropouts are worth noting. One issue is the comparability of the HS&B and NELS:88 tenth grade samples. In order to understand the NELS:88 tenth-grade sample, one must first look at the eighth-grade sample. Because NELS:88 began with eighth graders, care was taken to ascertain which eighth graders two years later had remained in modal grade sequence, and which had not. Out-of-sequence eighth graders were not accorded sophomore cohort status. Nevertheless, because of the broad way that NELS:88 first follow-up defined a studentas anyone receiving any form of instructionno doubt some individuals included in 1 1) NELS:88 would not have appeared in the HS&B sophomore sampling frame. For example, a handful of 1988 eighth graders were in a home study situation by 1990, but may still have been doing tenth-grade course work (1990 home study students are, however, identifiable, through the enrollment status flag F1F2DOST). Some individuals were also receiving academic or vocational instruction outside regular high schools. In part, this situation is comparable to HS&B, which included sophomores in alternative schools (defined as a school \"in which a significant portion of a student's time is spent in non-classroom activities\") as a base year sampling stratum. In part, it is not comparable, since non-diploma alternative instruction outside a regular or alternative high school fell outside the HS&B sampling frame. A further possible difference between the sophomore sampling frames in 1980 and 1990 might appear to be eligibility differences, insofar as such statuses can change and some eighth-grade ineligibles might have been tenth grade eligibles. However, this potential difficulty was addressed by the base year ineligibles study in the first follow-up, which inducted into the 1990 round excluded 1988 eighth graders who had since become eligible (for example, through becoming sufficiently versant with the English language to complete the survey forms). To compare HS&B and NELS:88 sophomore cohort dropouts, one must select participants from the NELS:88 sophomore cohort (G1OCOHRT = 1), employ the correct weights (FUWT for HS&B [called FU1WT in later files] and F2QWT for NELS:88), and define the dropout population according to one of the options described below.' The importance of choosing with care the dropout definition most clearly aligned with one's analysis questions is underlined by the fact that different dropout definitions may underwrite different conclusions. For example, HS&B data suggest, when dropouts and alternative completers are lumped together, that males are more likely than females to drop out. However, if alternative completers are excluded from the analysis, males are no more likely to drop out than females.' There are three basic options for defining sophomore cohort dropouts in NELS:88. We will sketch these three options, beginning with the most inclusive, and ending with the least inclusive. Definition 1the most inclusiveis as follows: 3 This example employs the cross-sectional (1982 and 1992) sophomore weights. Note that for HS&B, the sophomore cross-sectional weight, FUWT, was created in the first follow-up, and that FU1WT is a version of the 1982 cross-sectional weight that is adjusted for the sample retained in the HS&B second follow-up (1984). Which weight will be appropriate depends upon whether one is using the full 1982 file (FUWT) or the 1984 subsample (FU1WT). In addition, 1980-82 longitudinal findings may be compared to 1990-92 findings. The 1980-82 sophomore cohort weight created in the first follow-up is PANELWT; the 1990-92 sophomore cohort longitudinal weight is F2F1PNVVT. 4 McMillen, Kaufman, Hausken and Bradby, 1993. 2 14 Definition 1 A dropout is an individual who has left a regular high school diploma program and meets any of the following three defining conditions: has obtained an alternative credential (usually, the GED); b. is taking classes in preparation for the GED exam or receiving instruction for other alternative credentialling; c. holds neither diploma nor equivalency certification, and is receiving no academic instructionneither regular nor alternative. Definition 1 is essentially the HS&B definition of a dropout. Although it had not been anticipated at the time of the HS&B first follow-up that there would be individuals who fell in category \"a\", 302 of the 2,289 dropout questionnaire completers reported that they already had obtained their GED or high school equivalency certification.' In working with the HS&B files, the analyst would take all cases identified in the first follow-up as dropouts, that is, FUSTTYPE = 2, amounting to 13.6 percent, weighted, of the HS&B sophomore cohort. In NELS:88, this same population can be identified through the enrollment status indicator F2DOSTAT)6, and amounts to 10.1 percent of the NELS:88 sophomore cohort two years later. However, NELS:88 used a modified version of this definition to determine who would be administered a dropout questionnaire (in NELS:88, those meeting condition \"a\" above were regarded as completers and administered a student questionnaire; sophomore cohort dropouts who had already completed a GED are a rare population in both studies, though larger numbers of NELS:88 eighth-grade cohort 1990 status dropouts had earned a GED by 1992). Even though members of group \"a\" above 5 6 Barro and Kolstad (1987) note that \"to have completed a GED by spring 1982 is to have done so in less time than would have been required to graduate from regular high school\"; some of these reports may be inaccurate, but we know that some dropouts do achieve this paradoxical result. To capture this definition, NELS:88 sophomore cohort members with F2DOSTAT = 3, 4, or 5 should be included. Some individuals with F2DOSTAT = 3 will have completed the student questionnaire (GED recipients) while others will have completed the dropout questionnaire (receiving alternative instruction but have not received a GED or other equivalency certification). F2DOSTAT permits identification of dropouts according to either the NELS:88 first follow-up definition of a dropout (i.e., dropouts only: use values 4 and 5) and the HS&B definition. F2DOSTAT values are as follows: 0 = student (sample member was not a school dropout or a stopout in the second follow-up) 1 = enrollment status was not determined (includes out-of-country, deceased, and enrollment status unknown cases) 2 = stopout (sample member dropped out of school at one time in second follow-up, but subsequently returned to school) 3 = alternative completer (passed HS equivalency exam or enrolled in or completed a non-traditional HS program) 4 = dropoutschool confirmed (sample member was reported by the school to be a dropout but status was not also confirmed by sample member and/or family). 5 = dropoutdoubled confirmed (sample member dropped out of schoolconfirmed by sample member and/or family). were not administered the dropout questionnaire in NELS:88, a more limited set of comparisons is possible using this definition, based on student questionnaire items that overlap with the dropout questionnaire on NELS:88 and were also asked in HS&B. Dropout definition 2 drops condition \"a\" from definition 1 (has received GED or equivalent) above: Definition 2 A dropout is an individual who has left a regular high school diploma program and meets either of the following two defining conditions: a. is taking classes in preparation for the GED exam or receiving instruction for other alternative credentialling; b. holds neither diploma nor equivalency certification, and is receiving no academic instructionneither regular nor alternative. This definition was used in the NELS:88 second follow-up to determine who would be administered a dropout questionnaire. Using this definition, one can compare HS&B and NELS:88 dropouts by selecting all NELS:88 sophomore cohort dropout questionnaire completers (F2QFLG = 2 and F2DOSTAT = 3, 4 or 5), and then GED completers. In HS&B, GED completers were assigned the dropout questionnaire. In general, GED completers in NELS:88 were assigned the student questionnaire; however, some sample members who did not report having the GED at the time of screening did report having a GED or other equivalency certification when they completed a dropout questionnaire. To exclude HS&B GED completers, select FD16 = 4 for cases where FUSITYPE = 2. To exclude the NELS:88 GED completers who completed a dropout questionnaire, exclude cases where F2DOSTAT = 3 and F2D31 = 1.7 Conceptually, the analyst in this case must be committed to viewing students enrolled in high school diploma programs as categorically distinct from students preparing for an alternative credential, who in turn would be regarded as essentially similar to dropouts. However, for many research purposes, one might want to isolate school leavers who are not receiving alternative instruction. Definition 3, which is essentially the definition of dropping out employed in the NELS:88 first follow-up, permits investigation of this group. The NELS:88 cohort dropout definition is based on enrollment status in the spring term of 1992. Nevertheless, data collection continued into the summer. There are, therefore, some sample members who were surveyed after the end of the spring term and reported having received a GED in the summer of 1992. These individuals should be regarded as dropouts under definition 2, because the HS&B and NELS:88 cohort dropout definitions are temporally bound by the spring term. Therefore, where F2D31 = 1 but F2D32 = June 1992 or later, these cases (N= 5) should be classified as spring cohort dropouts."}, {"section_title": "Definition 3", "text": "A dropout is an individual who has left a regular high school diploma program and meets the following defining condition: that individual has not received a diploma or an alternative credential and is currently receiving no academic instructionneither regular nor alternative. NELS :88 second follow-up gathered information that permits this definition to be used in the 1992 study. This group is clearly identified on the NELS:88 data files (F2DOSTAT = 4 or 5), and can be approximated within the HS&B data set. In both HS&B and NELS:88, assignment of the dropout questionnaire was based on a data collection screener; for both screeners, the essential distinction was whether one was enrolled in a high school diploma program or not.' For HS&B, while there are questionnaire items that inquire into alternative program status, there are three reasons why questionnaire responses cannot be mapped to the screener definitions with absolute precision: a) not everyone who was screened for enrollment status participated (2,601 dropouts were identified according to the screener criteria, and 2,289 completed a dropout questionnaire); b) there may be inconsistency or error in either screener or questionnaire; and c) the questionnaire data allow GED enrollees to be removed but not enrollees in other equivalency programs However, given use of weighted data that reflect high response rates, given the normally trivial level of inconsistency between screener and questionnaire data, and given that the overwhelming majority of alternative completers travel the GED route, these considerations should not pose an obstacle to deriving a workable approximation of definition 3 from the HS&B data. Two suggestions for this operationalization appear below. Each gives slightly different results. The first suggestion for making the HS&B definition equivalent to the NELS:88 definition is as follows. Modify FUSTTYPE = 2 by subtracting from the result two classes of cases: a. If HS&B FD16 (plans to go back to high school for a diploma or GED) was coded as a 4 (already have GED or equivalent) then the respondent is regarded as a school completer, not a dropout; and, b. If FD36AA (\"Between the time you left high school and February 1982, have you participated in a GED program\") is coded as Yes (= 1) then the respondent is regarded as a student, not a dropout."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "Status assigned from the screener and questionnaire data cannot be unambiguously compared for NELS:88 second follow-up. For example, a student may have answered the program type question (F2S12A) by indicating \"alternative, stay-in-school, or dropout prevention program\". This response is consistent with screener classification as a student (as opposed to an alternative completer), since the screener definition restricted alternative completer status to sample members enrolled in a program that did not lead to a high school diploma. Cameron and Heckman (1993) indicate that in 1987, 84.5 percent of all new high school credentials were issued through traditional course attendance high school programs, 14 percent through equivalency certification on a standardized examination for high school dropouts, and the remainder (between one and two percent) through night schools or other formal adult education programs (p.4). Of exam-certified dropouts, they indicate (p.5) that GED certified \"well in excess of 90 percent of all exam-certified high school graduates over the period 1970-87\". Of course, the bulk of individuals in HS&B and NELS:88 attempting to complete high school through an alternative route had not yet (in 1982 or 1992) accomplished their goal. This scheme (employed in McMillen, Kaufman, Hausken, and Bradby, 1993) yields an HS&B dropout rate of 10.9 percent, compared to the 13.6 percent reported in Barro and Kolstad (1987) and reflecting definition 1 above. An alternative approach offers a similar result but is slightly more conservative.' Because some individuals who answered yes to FD36AA (have participated in a GED program) may have dropped out of the program without obtaining a credential, or may have completed the program but not taken the GED test or have failed the GED test, further refinements in the HS&B specifications may be desirable. Hence one may wish to remove from the HS&B dropout pool only those alternative students/completers who report either that they already have a GED or equivalent (FD16 = 4), or are currently participating in a GED preparatory program (FD36AA =1 and FD36F =3). When one follows these more restrictive specifications, the resulting dropout rate is 11.4 percent. There will be a very small difference in the number of HS&B cases that contribute to a dropout comparison with NELS:88, based on which of these two operationalizations the analyst chooses. Table 2 further illustrates the issues involved in choosing a dropout definition for HS&B and NELS:88 comparisons. Table 2 shows that for the HS&B first follow-up (1982), a 13.6 percent cohort dropout rate was reported.' That is, 13.6 percent of spring term 1980 high school sophomores were found to be out of school (for reasons other than early graduation) in the spring term of 1982.12 A decade later, the comparable rate derivable from NELS:88 second follow-upcalculated based on the eligible sample of questionnaire completers using an HS&B-comparable definition of dropouts (including those following an alternative high school completion route, and those who already had obtained a GED or other equivalency certification)is 10.1 percent. On the other hand, if a NELS :88 first follow-up definition of student and dropout is enforced on HS&B that is, dropouts are regarded as those individuals who have 1) left high school and 2) are receiving no academic instruction--then dropout rates and sample numbers are lower. Specifically, the HS&B sophomore cohort dropout rate falls to 10.9 (or to 11.4) percent and the NELS:88 sophomore cohort dropout rate is reduced to 6.2 percent. This discussion has stressed the cohort dropout rate (enrollment status of the HS&B and NELS:88 sophomore cohorts in the spring terms of 1982 and 1992 respectively) since status at this time point determined whether individuals would be administered a dropout questionnaire. Some individuals who may have been enrolled in spring term had prior dropout events (as captured, for example, by NELS:88 F2DOSTAT = 2 or HS&B TRSTYPE = 3). Additional event and spring status dropout indicators are available in the data sets. For example, both HS&B and NELS:88 collected high school transcripts. School records information may confirm, supplement, or even contradict other sources of enrollment status information. The TRSTYPE variable on the HS&B third follow-up (1986) sophomore cohort release indicates who was a dropout according to school records at the time of the first follow-up survey, who was not a dropout at the time of being surveyed but nevertheless dropped out prior to the end of the term, and who stopped out, that is, attendance gaps registered in academic transcripts). On the NELS:88 high school transcript file, two variables give school-reported exit status, and thus identify dropouts: F2RTROUT, and F2REASL. Because school records contradict other sources of enrollment status, the \" This approach is based on a suggestion offered by Phil Kaufman."}, {"section_title": "12", "text": "The very small number of Spanish-language questionnaire completers were excluded from calculation of this rate.

Questionnaire Overlap. The following appendix summarizes questionnaire items that overlap across the two dropout cohorts. There are many topics that are covered in one study but not the others, or that are covered by questions that are substantially (or subtly) different. Nonetheless, a core of items is comparable across HS&B and NELS:88. Some items are repeated in identical form. Others are essentially similar despite small differences in wording or response categories; analysts must exercise their own judgments about comparability in such cases. For a number of items with like question wording, dissimilar response categories were employed. In many such cases, comparability can be achieved by recoding the response categories so that they are compatible. Cognitive Test Comparability. There are common items in the HS&B and NELS:88 mathematics tests that provide a basis for equating 1980-1990 and 1982-1992 NAEP (1987NAEP ( , 1990 and NELS:88 high school transcript studies were designed to support comparisons. The HS&B and NELS:88 studies include transcripts for the dropout sample; the NAEP transcript studies do not. Need for Caution in Comparing Data Across Cohorts. Though the studies were designed to be as comparable as possible, caution must nonetheless be exercised in comparing HS&B and NELS:88 data. Response rates differed in the surveys (though for dropouts quite comparable response rates were achieved) and the characteristics of the nonrespondents may differ somewhat across the studies as well. While nonresponse adjustments in the weights serve to compensate for nonresponse, no adjustment procedure can do so perfectly. Item response rates for questions that appear in both surveys differ as well though item nonresponse is lower in the HS&B and NELS:88 dropout questionnaires than in the student instruments. Differences in context and question order for trend items in the questionnaires, and other factors such as differences in data collection methodology, may also influence the accuracy of intercohort comparisons.\" For example, while data collection procedures in NELS:88 were closely modelled on 13 Cognitive test. data (from the ASVAB/AFQT) are also available for the NLSY sample of school completers and dropouts (see Bock and Moore, 1986); HS&B dropout test results are discussed in Alexander, Natriello and Pallas, 1985. 14 The difficulty of introducing content or procedural innovations while maintaining comparability for trend measurement purposes is richly illustrated by the NAEP experiencesee especially Beaton, A.E., and Zwick, R.

Suppose a sample member was absent on survey day and was not then a dropout according to the twenty consecutive absences definition. Suppose that same individual met the conditions of the dropout definition at the time a second attempt was made to survey them. HS&B always considered the respondent to be the same status he or she was on the school's survey day. However, in NELS:88, if an absent-on-survey-day individual met the official dropout definition by the date of the make-up attempt, that individual was surveyed as a dropout.
