The study was carried out in more than 50 education systems, including the United States. The student population sampled in TIMSS is defined as all students in each country or other education system who were enrolled in the grade that represents four and eight years of schooling, counting from the first year of ISCED Level 1, provided that the mean age at the time of testing is at least 9.5 and 13.5 years. In most participating nations, including the United States, this corresponds to all fourth-graders and eighth-graders. The U.S. TIMSS 2015 study, supported by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), utilized a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design. The first stage made use of a systematic probabilityproportionate-to-size technique to select schools. Though efforts were made to secure the participation of all schools selected in the first stage, it was anticipated that not all schools would choose to participate. Therefore, as each school was selected in the sample, the two neighboring schools in the sorted sampling frame (immediately preceding and following it) were designated as replacement schools. The sampling frame was sorted by explicit strata and secondarily by implicit strata, so the replacement schools were within the same strata as the original school. If an original school refused to participate, the first replacement was then contacted. If that school also refused to participate, the second school was then contacted. The second stage of sampling consisted of selecting classrooms within sampled schools. At the classroom level, TIMSS sampled intact mathematics classes that were available to students in the target grades. Where feasible, two classrooms were selected per school in the United States. In schools containing only one class, this class was selected. The TIMSS 2015 national data collection was fielded in March, April, and May 2015. There were 300 schools in the original sample at grade 4 (hereafter referred to as TIMSS-4). Of these 300 sampled schools, 295 were determined to be eligible 1 (the eligible original school sample) containing at least one fourth-grade class, and of these, 228 participated (the participating original sample) for an initial weighted response rate of 77.5 percent. An additional 22 replacement schools participated for a total of 250 participating schools after replacement (the participating final sample). The weighted response rate increased to 84.6 percent. The school participation rates for this report are summarized in table F-1. There were 300 schools in the original sample at grade 8 (hereafter referred to as TIMSS-8). Of these 300 sampled schools, 293 were determined to be eligible 2 (the eligible original school sample) containing at least one eighth-grade class, and of these, 229 participated (the participating original sample) for an initial weighted response rate of 78.4 percent. An additional 17 substitute schools participated for a total of 246 participating schools after replacement (the participating final sample). The weighted response rate increased to 84.0 percent. The weighted student response rate for TIMSS-4 was 95.8 percent. The weighted student response rate for TIMSS-8 was 94.0 percent. \nThe Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) Advanced is an international comparative study of the knowledge, skills, and competencies of advanced math and physics students in the domains of mathematics and science. The study was carried out in 9 education systems, including the United States. The target population for advanced mathematics is \"students in the final year of secondary schooling who have taken or were taking courses in advanced mathematics.\" The target population for physics is \"students in the final year of secondary schooling who have taken or were taking courses in physics.\" The courses that define the target populations have to cover most, if not all, of the advanced mathematics and physics topics that were outlined in the TIMSS Advanced 2015 Assessment Frameworks (Mullis and Martin 2014). The U.S. TIMSS Advanced 2015 study, supported by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), utilized a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design. The first stage made use of a systematic probability-proportionate-to-size technique to select schools. Though efforts were made to secure the participation of all schools selected in the first stage, it was anticipated that not all schools would choose to participate. Therefore, as each school was selected in the sample, the two neighboring schools in the sorted sampling frame (immediately preceding and following it) were designated as replacement schools. The sampling frame was sorted by explicit strata and secondarily by implicit strata, so the replacement schools were within the same strata as the original school. If an original school refused to participate, the first replacement was then contacted. If that school also refused to participate, the second school was then contacted. The second stage of sampling consisted of selecting students rather than classrooms within sampled schools. The methodology was designed specifically for the United States target population and to meet international guidelines The TIMSS Advanced 2015 national data collection was fielded in March, April, and May 2015. There were 348 schools in the original sample for advanced math (hereafter referred to as TIMSS-M). Of these 348 sampled schools, 316 were determined to be eligible 1 (the eligible original school sample) containing at least one advanced math student, and of these, 230 participated (the participating original sample) for an initial weighted response rate of 72.2 percent. An additional 11 replacement schools participated for a total of 241 participating schools after replacement (the participating final sample). The weighted response rate increased to 75.6 percent. The school participation rates for this report are summarized in table G-1. There were 348 schools in the original sample for advanced physics (hereafter referred to as TIMSS-P). Of these 348 sampled schools, 237 were determined to be eligible 2 (the eligible original school sample) containing at least one advanced physics student, and of these, 156 participated (the participating original sample) for an initial weighted response rate of 64.9 percent. An additional 9 substitute schools participated for a total of 165 participating schools after replacement (the participating final sample). The weighted response rate increased to 69.6 percent. The weighted student response rate for TIMSS-M was 86.8 percent. The weighted student response rate for TIMSS-P was 85.4 percent. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) standards for assessment surveys stipulate that a nonresponse bias analysis is required at any stage of data collection when the weighted unit response rate is less than 85 percent (before replacement). Since the U.S. TIMSS Advanced 2015 weighted school response rates for both advanced math and physics before replacement are below 85 percent, NCES requires an investigation into the potential magnitude of nonresponse bias at the school level in the U.S. sample. Since the U.S. TIMSS 2015 weighted student response rates are above 85 percent, a nonresponse bias analysis at the student level is not required. The methodology used to investigate nonresponse bias in the TIMSS-M and TIMSS-P U.S. samples is provided in chapter 2 of this appendix, and the results are provided in chapters 3 and 4."}, {"section_title": "METHODOLOGY", "text": "To measure the potential nonresponse bias at the school level, the characteristics of participating schools were compared to those of the total eligible sample of schools.

The distribution for TIMSS-8 of the participating final school sample (N=246), which includes 17 participating substitutes that were used as replacements for nonresponding schools from the eligible original sample, was compared to the total eligible final school sample (N=293). The total eligible final sample includes the participating final sample plus those original nonrespondents that were not replaced by substitutes. Again, schools were weighted by their school base weights and their estimated grade 4 or 8 enrollment for both the eligible sample and the participating schools. The base weight for each substitute school is set to the base weight of the original school that it replaced.\nAnalysis of the nonresponse adjusted final sample with substitutes: The same sets of schools were compared as in the second analysis, but this time, when analyzing the participating final schools alone, schools were weighted by their school base weights and their estimated grade 4 or 8 enrollment with school nonresponse adjustments applied. The international weighting procedures form nonresponse adjustment classes by cross-classifying the explicit and implicit stratification variables. The first analysis indicates the potential for nonresponse bias that was introduced through school nonresponse. The second analysis suggests the remaining potential for nonresponse bias after the mitigating effects of substitution have been accounted for. The third analysis indicates the potential for bias after accounting for the mitigating effects of both substitution and nonresponse weight adjustments. Both the second and third analyses, however, may provide an overly optimistic scenario, resulting from the fact that substitution and nonresponse adjustments may correct somewhat for deficiencies in the characteristics examined here, but there is no guarantee that they are equally as effective for other characteristics and, in particular, for student achievement. Participating TIMSS schools and the total eligible TIMSS school sample were compared on as many school sampling frame characteristics as possible that might provide information about the presence of nonresponse bias. Comparing frame characteristics between participating schools and the total eligible school sample is not an ideal measure of nonresponse bias if the characteristics are unrelated or weakly related to more substantive items in the survey; however, often it is the only approach available since other data are not available for nonparticipating schools. While the school-level characteristics used in these analyses are limited to those available in the sampling frame, each of the variables had a demonstrated relationship to achievement in previous TIMSS cycles. Frame characteristics for public schools were from the 2012-13 Common Core of Data (CCD) and, for private schools, from the 2011-12 Private School Universe Survey (PSS). The following categorical variables were available in the sampling frame for all schools: \uf06e School control-indicates whether the school is under public control (operated by publicly elected or appointed officials) or private control (operated by privately elected or appointed officials and derives its major source of funds from private sources); Poverty level 3 -for public schools, a high poverty school is defined as one in which 50 percent or more of the students are eligible for participation in the national free and reduced-price lunch (FRPL) program, and a low poverty school is defined as one in which fewer than 50 percent are eligible. The following continuous variables were available in the sampling frame for all schools: Percentage of students in seven race/ethnicity categories (White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Asian; American Indian or Alaska Native; Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and two or more races). 4 An additional continuous variable, the percentage of students eligible to participate in the FRPL program, was available only for public schools. The poverty level variable mentioned among the categorical variable is the recoded version of this continuous variable. 5 For categorical variables, the distribution of frame characteristics for participating schools was compared with the distribution for all eligible schools. The hypothesis of independence between the characteristic and participation status was tested using a Rao-Scott modified Chi-square statistic at the 5 percent level . For continuous variables, summary means were calculated and the difference between means was tested using a t test. The p values for the tests are presented in the tables that follow. The statistical significance of differences between participants and the total eligible sample is identical to that which would result from comparing participants and nonparticipants, since all significance tests account for the fact that the participants are a subset of the full sample. The bias and relative bias are also shown in each table. The bias is calculated as the difference between the respective estimates for the participants and the eligible sample. The relative bias is calculated as the bias divided by the estimate from the eligible sample. The relative bias is a measure of the size of the bias compared to the eligible sample estimate. In addition to these tests, logistic regression models were used to provide a multivariate analysis that examined the conditional independence of these school characteristics as predictors of participation. The logistic regression compared frame characteristics for participating schools with non-participating schools which is effectively the same as comparing to the eligible same as in the bivariate analysis. It may be that only one or two variables are actually related to participation status. However, if these variables are also related to the other variables examined in the analyses, then other variables, which are not related to participation status, will appear as significant in simple bivariate tables. Dummy variables were created for each component of the categorical variables so that each component was included separately. The last component of each categorical variable is used as the reference category. The p value of a dummy variable indicates whether there is a significant difference at the 5 percent level from the effect of the (omitted) reference category. It is not possible to include all the frame characteristics in a single model because the seven race/ethnicity variables are linearly dependent (i.e., they sum up to 100 percent for every school). Therefore, two models were used. In the first model, six race/ethnicities (Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Asian; American Indian or Alaska Native; Hawaiian/Pacific Islander; and two or more races) were included in the model with \"percentage White, non-Hispanic\" as the omitted category. In addition, an F test was used to determine whether the parameter estimates of these six characteristics were simultaneously equal to zero. In the second model, the summed percentage of the six race/ethnicities (Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Asian; American Indian or Alaska Native; Hawaiian/Pacific Islander; and two or more races) replaced the six race/ethnicity variables with \"percentage White, non-Hispanic\" again as the omitted category. The second model permits the analysis of differences in the percentages of White, non-Hispanic students, which is not possible in the first model. All other frame characteristics were included in both models. The logistic regression was performed using WesVar \u00ae  and replicate weights to properly account for the complex sample design. The JK2 method was used to create the replicate weights ).\nCentral city consists of a large territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population of 250,000 or more, midsize territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000, or small territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a population less than 100,000. \uf06e Suburb consists of a large territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with population of 250,000 or more, midsize territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with a population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000, or small territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with a population less than 100,000. \uf06e Town consists of a fringe territory inside an urban cluster that is less than or equal to 10 miles from an urbanized area, distant territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 10 miles and less than or equal to 35 miles from an urbanized area, or remote territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 35 miles from an urbanized area.\nRural consists of a fringe census-defined rural territory that is less than or equal to 5 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is less than or equal to 2.5 miles from an urban cluster, distant census-defined rural territory that is more than 5 miles but less than or equal to 25 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is more than 2.5 miles but less than or equal to 10 miles from an urban cluster, or remote census-defined rural territory that is more than 25 miles from an urbanized area and is also more than 10 miles from an urban cluster.\nAnalysis of the participating final sample with substitutes: The distribution for TIMSS-M of the participating final school sample (N=241), which includes 11 participating substitutes that were used as replacements for nonresponding schools from the eligible original sample, was compared to the total eligible final school sample (N=316).

Standard errors and tests of hypotheses for the full model parameter estimates are presented in table F-6 (with six race/ethnicity variables) and table F-7 (with summed race/ethnicity percentage). Private schools are treated as low poverty for the categorical variable poverty level. Private schools, South region and fourth grade enrollment were significant predictors of school participation in table F-6. The negative parameter estimates indicate that relative to public schools, private schools were somewhat underrepresented among the participating schools, and the fourth grade enrollment in participating schools was smaller than in all eligible schools. The positive parameter estimate indicates that relative to schools in the West region, schools in the South region were somewhat overrepresented among the participating schools. The F test statistic to determine whether the race/ethnicity characteristics are simultaneously equal to 0 was 0.55 with a p value of 0.738, which indicates that no significant relationship with participation was detected. Private schools, Northeast region, and South region were significant predictors of school participation in table F-7. The negative parameter estimate indicates that relative to schools in the West region, schools in the Northeast region were somewhat underrepresented among the participating schools. Because the percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch was not included in the main logistic regression analysis, a separate analysis with public schools only was conducted. To include free or reduced-price lunch eligibility in a model, public schools were modeled separately using a model with the summed race/ethnicity percentage and adding the percentage of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch.

Comparing frame characteristics between participating schools and the total eligible school sample is not an ideal measure of nonresponse bias if the characteristics are unrelated or weakly related to more substantive items in the survey; however, often it is the only approach available since other data are not available for nonparticipating schools. While the school-level characteristics used in these analyses are limited to those available in the sampling frame, each of the variables had a demonstrated relationship to achievement in previous TIMSS cycles. Frame characteristics for public schools were from the 2012-13 Common Core of Data (CCD) and, for private schools, from the 2011-12 Private School Universe Survey (PSS). The following categorical variables were available in the sampling frame for all schools: \uf06e AP status-indicates whether or not the school had students who took a calculus, physics, or both calculus and physics AP test in 2013; \uf06e School control-indicates whether the school is under public control (operated by publicly elected or appointed officials) or private control (operated by privately elected or appointed officials and derives its major source of funds from private sources); Poverty level 3 -for public schools, a high poverty school is defined as one in which 50 percent or more of the students are eligible for participation in the national free and reduced-price lunch (FRPL) program, and a low poverty school is defined as one in which fewer than 50 percent are eligible. The following continuous variables were available in the sampling frame for all schools: \uf06e Estimated number of advanced math or physics students enrolled; \uf06e Total number of students; and \uf06e Percentage of students in seven race/ethnicity categories (White, non-Hispanic; Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Asian; American Indian or Alaska Native; Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and two or more races). 4 An additional continuous variable, the percentage of students eligible to participate in the FRPL program, was available only for public schools. The poverty level variable mentioned among the categorical variable is the recoded version of this continuous variable. 5 For categorical variables, the distribution of frame characteristics for participating schools was compared with the distribution for all eligible schools. The hypothesis of independence between the characteristic and participation status was tested using a Rao-Scott modified Chi-square statistic at the 5 percent level . For continuous variables, summary means were calculated and the difference between means was tested using a t test. The p values for the tests are presented in the tables that follow. The statistical significance of differences between participants and the total eligible sample is identical to that which would result from comparing participants and nonparticipants, since all significance tests account for the fact that the participants are a subset of the full sample. The bias and relative bias are also shown in each table. The bias is calculated as the difference between the respective estimates for the participants and the eligible sample. The relative bias is calculated as the bias divided by the estimate from the eligible sample. The relative bias is a measure of the size of the bias compared to the eligible sample estimate. In addition to these tests, logistic regression models were used to provide a multivariate analysis that examined the conditional independence of these school characteristics as predictors of participation. The logistic regression compared frame characteristics for participating schools with non-participating schools which is effectively the same as comparing to the eligible sample as in the bivariate analysis. It may be that only one or two variables are actually related to participation status. However, if these variables are also related to the other variables examined in the analyses, then other variables, which are not related to participation status, will appear as significant in simple bivariate tables. Dummy variables were created for each component of the categorical variables so that each component was included separately. The last component of each categorical variable is used as the reference category. The p value of a dummy variable indicates whether there is a significant difference at the 5 percent level from the effect of the (omitted) reference category. It is not possible to include all the frame characteristics in a single model because the seven race/ethnicity variables are linearly dependent (i.e., they sum up to 100 percent for every school). Therefore, two models were used. In the first model, six race/ethnicities (Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Asian; American Indian or Alaska Native; Hawaiian/Pacific Islander; and two or more races) were included in the model with \"percentage White, non-Hispanic\" as the omitted category. In addition, an F test was used to determine whether the parameter estimates of these six characteristics were simultaneously equal to zero. In the second model, the summed percentage of the six race/ethnicities (Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Asian; American Indian or Alaska Native; Hawaiian/Pacific Islander; and two or more races) replaced the six race/ethnicity variables with \"percentage White, non-Hispanic\" again as the omitted category. The second model permits the analysis of differences in the percentages of White, non-Hispanic students, which is not possible in the first model. All other frame characteristics were included in both models. The logistic regression was performed using WesVar \u00ae  and replicate weights to properly account for the complex sample design.

To include free or reduced-price lunch eligibility in a model, public schools were modeled separately using a model with the summed race/ethnicity percentage and adding the percentage of students eligible for free or reducedprice lunch.

Additionally, the estimated advanced math and physics enrollments (used as the measure of school size for conducting these nonresponse bias analyses) were not always a good measure of the true number of advanced students. These results suggest that there is some potential for nonresponse bias in the U.S. TIMSS-P original sample based on the characteristics studied. It also suggests that, while there is some evidence that the use of substitute schools reduced the potential for bias, it has not reduced it substantially. Moreover, after the application of school nonresponse adjustments, there is some evidence of resulting potential bias in the available frame variables and correlated variables in the final sample with the largest bias in locale. It is important to note that the relative bias for private and non-AP schools is much higher than for public and AP schools, respectively, due to the binary nature of the variable as the absolute bias is the same for both categories. Also, the relative bias is potentially misleading for the American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and multiracial categories, as the absolute bias is small in each case. Given there is limited statistical power due to larger standard errors as mentioned above, the possibility of meaningful bias cannot be ruled out by the lack of statistically significant results."}]
