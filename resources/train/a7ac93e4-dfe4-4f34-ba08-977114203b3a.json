These biomarkers are correlated with each other and altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but no study has directly compared their diagnostic performance. Methods: We examined healthy controls (CN, N = 169) versus AD dementia patients (N = 118), and stable (sMCI; no dementia, followed up for at least 2 years, N = 165) versus progressive MCI (pMCI; conversion to AD dementia, N = 59). All subjects had florbetapir PET (global and regional; temporal, frontal, parietal, and cingulate) and CSF Ab42 measurements at baseline. We compared area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity (testing a priori and optimized cutoffs). Clinical diagnosis was the reference standard. Results: CSF Ab42 and (global or regional) PET florbetapir did not differ in AUC (CN vs. AD, CSF 84.4%; global PET 86.9%; difference [95% confidence interval] \u00c06.7 to 1.5). CSF Ab42 and global PET florbetapir did not differ in sensitivity, but PET had greater specificity than CSF in most comparisons. Sixteen CN progressed to MCI and AD (six Ab negative, seven Ab positive, and three PET positive but CSF negative). Interpretation: The overall diagnostic accuracies of CSF Ab42 and PET florbetapir were similar, but PET had greater specificity. This was because some CN and sMCI subjects appear pathological using CSF but not using PET, suggesting that low CSF Ab42 not always translates to cognitive decline or brain Ab accumulation.

[10] [11] [12] In vivo identification of brain Ab has become increasingly important due to the development of novel AD drugscite ref 3 here, which are likely to be effective only in patients with Ab pathology, and maybe only in early disease stage, when a correct clinical diagnosis of AD is difficult to make.\nUltimately, the choice of whether to use CSF or PET for Ab quantification in research, drug trials, and clinical investigations will depend on many factors, including the methods' costs, availabilities, side effects, and diagnostic performance. Studies that have included both CSF and PET Ab measurements have suggested strong correlations between them, 7, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] but no study has directly compared their diagnostic performance for the clinical diagnosis of AD. When examining Ab biomarkers in AD, it is possible to either use the clinical diagnosis or the presence of biomarker positivity (suggesting possible brain Ab pathology) as reference standard. In this study, we used clinical diagnosis as the reference standard. Our goal was to compare CSF Ab42 and PET Ab to identify clinical AD. We hypothesized that CSF and PET would have equal diagnostic performance, both when testing healthy controls versus AD dementia patients, and when testing stable MCI patients versus MCI patients who later progressed to AD dementia."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu).

The sample size and demographic characteristics of the subjects are listed in Table 1 . Inclusion/exclusion criteria for ADNI-2 subjects are described in detail at http://www. adni-info.org. Briefly, all subjects included in ADNI-2 were between the ages of 55 and 90 years, had completed at least 6 years of education, were fluent in Spanish or English, and were free of any significant neurologic disease other than AD. Cognitively normal (CN) subjects had Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score \u226524 and clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) score 0. MCI subjects (including both so-called \"early\" and \"late\" MCI) had MMSE score \u226524, objective memory loss as shown on scores on delayed recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II (>0.5 standard deviations below the normal mean), CDR 0.5, preserved activities of daily living, and absence of dementia. AD dementia subjects fulfilled the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-AD-RDA) criteria for probable AD, and had MMSE scores between 20 and 26 and a CDR of 0.5 or 1.0.\nThe original data set consisted of 185 CN, 435 MCI, and 118 AD subjects. We inspected the clinical follow-up data (using up to 3-year follow-up) to assess conversion between diagnostic groups. Among CN, 14 subjects converted to MCI and 2 to AD. These 16 progressive CN were excluded from all comparisons, to keep the control group as AD free as possible (but we report CSF and PET data on these subjects in the result section, see below). Among MCI, 59 subjects converted to AD and were labeled progressive MCI (pMCI), while 165 subjects did not convert to AD (during at least 2-year follow-up) and were labeled stable MCI (sMCI; these also included five subjects who reverted from MCI to CN). The remaining MCI patients, who did not convert to AD but who had less than 2-year clinical follow-up, were excluded, since their long-term clinical status was uncertain, and to have groups balanced on follow-up time. No AD subjects reverted to MCI or CN during follow-up. Thus, the comparisons in this study were done on the diagnostic groups CN (N = 169) versus AD (N = 118), sMCI (N = 165) versus pMCI (N = 59)."}, {"section_title": "Florbetapir PET", "text": "ADNI PET image data were acquired at baseline.

The primary analysis was a comparison of diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve, AUC), which was done for CSF versus global or regional (temporal, frontal, parietal, and cingulate) PET.\nSecondarily, we compared sensitivities and specificities for CSF and global PET. These were first compared at a priori cutoffs, using previously established cutoffs for AD (CSF Ab42 192 ng/L and global PET florbetapir SUVr 1.11, normalized to whole cerebellum). Since these cutoffs were generated from different samples (only partly based on pathological diagnosis), 20 ,22-24 they may not be comparable. We therefore also compared sensitivities and specificities at cutoffs that were optimized for this study. Optimized cutoffs were defined using logistic regression models, where diagnosis was the response variable and a binary classifier (biomarker < cutoff) was the predicting variable (models adjusted for age and sex). The cutoff that resulted in the logistic regression model with highest AUC (mean of 10 cross-validation samples) was defined as the optimized cutoff.\nFor all measurements of diagnostic performance (AUC, sensitivity, and specificity) we used bootstrap (N = 1000 iterations) to estimate 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the difference of CSF and PET (mean difference AE 1.96 9 SD). All analyses were adjusted for age and sex.

The AUCs of CSF and PET (using either global or regional PET) were not significantly different, either for CN vs. AD or sMCI vs. pMCI (Table 2 and Fig. 2) .\nWhen tested at a priori cutoffs (CSF < 192 ng/L, PET > 1.11), the sensitivities of CSF and PET were not significantly different, either for CN versus AD (CSF 92.4%; PET 89.0%; difference CSF-PET [95% CI] \u00c00.46% to 7.6%) or for sMCI versus pMCI (CSF 91.5%, PET 91.5%; difference CSF-PET [95% CI] \u00c04.6% to 4.6%).

We compared the biomarkers both at optimized cutoff levels and (to avoid overfitting problems), at a priori defined cutoffs, established in independent study populations. We found that (1) the overall diagnostic accuracy, measured by AUC, was similar between CSF Ab42 and (global or regional) PET florbetapir both for CN versus AD and sMCI versus pMCI, (2) the diagnostic sensitivity of the methods was similar, both when using a priori defined cutoffs and when optimizing cutoffs for this study sample, (3) the diagnostic specificity of the methods was often slightly higher for PET specificity (when using a priori cutoffs and optimized cutoffs), Figure 1 . CSF Ab42 and PET florbetapir. CSF Ab42 (A) and global PET florbetapir SUVr (B) in different diagnostic groups, and matched CSF and PET data (C) in all diagnostic groups. All data were adjusted (residualized) for age and sex. In statistical comparisons (linear regressions with Ab42 or SUVr as response and group [CN vs. AD, and sMCI vs. pMCI] as predictor, adjusted for age and sex), AD did always differ significantly from CN, and sMCI did always differ significantly from pMCI (all P < 0.0001). CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; PET, positron emission tomography; SUVr, standardized uptake value ratio; sMCI, stable mild cognitive impairment; pMCI, progressive mild cognitive impairment. AUC were calculated using logistic regression models. Differences between AUC for CSF and PET were calculated using bootstrap. PET measurements were SUVr. For global PET, measurements were averaged from temporal, frontal, parietal, and cingulate regions, and divided by the measurement in whole cerebellum. For regional PET, measurement in respective region was divided with the measurement in whole cerebellum. All analyses were adjusted for age and sex. AUC, area under the curve; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; PET, positron emission tomography; SUVr, standardized uptake value ratio.\n(4) the progressive CN group consists of both Ab positive and Ab negative subjects, where CSF and PET modalities were most often in agreement. The finding that the overall accuracy was similar between CSF and PET is in line with previous studies showing strong correlations between the two biomarker modalities. 7, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] This indicates that CSF and PET Ab biomarkers are overall equally associated with clinical AD, both at the dementia stage and at the MCI stage. The similar accuracy of CSF and regional PET is in agreement with previous data showing similar associations between CSF Ab42 and PET Ab in different brain regions. 7, 19 Likewise, the finding that the methods' sensitivities were similar confirms the widely held but not previously tested belief that CSF Ab42 and PET Ab have similar capability to identify AD patients, both at dementia stage and at the early clinical stage, in MCI patients who later convert to AD.\nThe diagnostic specificities of the methods differed for most comparisons, with greater specificity for PET. This was caused by some CN and sMCI subjects who appear pathological using CSF Ab42 but not using PET, which is consistent with previous observations. 13, 15 This indicates that low CSF Ab42 does not always translate to accumulation of fibrillar amyloid in the brain (or to subsequent cognitive decline). Another possibility, which has been suggested previously, is that low CSF Ab42 in the absence of a positive PET scan may reflect the presence of diffuse Ab deposits that bind amyloid ligands poorly. 15, 25 Since diffuse Ab deposits may not have a central role in the neuropathological changes of AD, 26 it is logical that a biomarker which partly reflects diffuse deposits (possibly CSF Ab42) has lower specificity but equal sensitivity compared to a biomarker that mainly reflects fibrillar deposits (PET Ab). Other causes of isolated low CSF Ab42 are also possible, including increased peptide degradation, altered transport over the blood-brain barrier, and differences in the species of Ab measured by PET versus ELISA or other immunoassays, although it is not known if this is important for the development of AD. Diseases that are associated with low CSF Ab42 in the absence of Ab plaque pathology include cerebrovascular disease, and neuroinflammatory and neuroinfectious conditions such as bacterial meningitis, HIV-associated dementia, and multiple sclerosis. 27, 28 In these conditions, C-terminally truncated CSF Ab peptides (e.g., Ab38 and Ab40) are also reduced, which is not the case in AD, and a ratio between CSF Ab42 to Ab40 may help to resolve this issue. Finally, it is also possible that preanalytical or analytical factors affecting the Ab42 measurement may result in false low measurements. Ongoing development of novel measurement procedures may be useful to overcome this. 29, 30 In sum, the existence of subjects who are CSF Ab42 positive but PET Ab negative warrants further study, especially long-term longitudinal studies with repeated biomarker assessments, to learn whether the lowering of CSF Ab42 precedes PET positivity, or whether other factors underlie this discrepancy in amyloid biomarker outcome. Further comparative studies are also needed to determine the possible clinical implications of the greater specificity of PET Ab seen here.\nThe ultimate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depend on the choice of cutoff. The optimized CSF cutoffs (157 ng/L for CN vs. AD and 174 ng/L for sMCI vs. Table 2 . CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; SUVr, standardized uptake value ratio; sMCI, stable mild cognitive impairment; pMCI, progressive mild cognitive impairment; AD, Alzheimer's disease. pMCI) were lower than the a priori cutoff (192 ng/L), and the optimized PET cutoff (1.24 SUVr for both CN vs. AD and sMCI vs. pMCI) were higher than the a priori cutoff (1.11), indicating that that the optimized cutoffs represented more severe Ab pathology. Important confounders for study differences in cutoffs include age differences and delays between lumbar puncture and autopsy. The CSF Ab42 192 ng/L cutoff was originally defined to maximize the accuracy in a cohort including 56 autopsy-confirmed AD cases and 52 age-matched living healthy controls. 22 The AD subjects in that study were on average 71 (SD 10) and the healthy controls were on average 70 (SD 10) years old at lumbar puncture, and the AD patients died at an average age of 77 (SD 10) years (L. M. Shaw, pers. commun. 2014). The time gap between lumbar puncture and death may have confounded the relationship between CSF Ab42 and autopsy findings in AD (some subjects with brain Ab plaques on autopsy may have lacked brain Ab and corresponding low CSF Ab42 at time of lumbar puncture). The PET florbetapir 1.11 cutoff was defined differently, using the confidence limit for the upper 5% of the distribution in 21 controls younger than 55 years. 23 This cutoff (originally 1.10, but later modified to 1.11 20 ) also divided patients with \"low likelihood AD\" and \"high likelihood AD\" based on histopathology in an independent study of 35 subjects. 24 Since the subjects in this study were older than the subjects in the derivation studies, and since the prevalence of Ab pathology increases rapidly with age, 31 the non-AD subjects in this study likely had higher prevalence of Ab pathology than the controls in the derivation studies. This may have lowered the cutoff for CSF Ab42 and increased the cutoff for PET Ab to identify clinical AD. The main effect of changing from the a priori to the (more pathological) optimized cutoffs was improvement of diagnostic specificity, which was likely caused by greater prevalence of Ab pathology among the controls in the present sample than in the derivation samples.\nWhen comparing the diagnostic performance of CSF and PET we excluded 16 CN subjects who progressed clinically to MCI or AD during follow-up, in order to keep the CN group as AD free as possible. However, in an exploratory analysis, we found no clear preference for Ab positivity in these subjects ( Fig. 4 ; note that three subjects were CSF-PET discordant, and were PET positive, which argues against the notion that CSF positivity precedes PET positivity). Thus, controls that develop cognitive impairment within a few years may be Ab negative at baseline, independent of biomarker modality. This finding does not necessarily contradict previous findings that Ab positivity is associated with future cognitive impairment in healthy controls, since the proportion of Ab positive people who decline cognitively may still be larger than the proportion of Ab negative people who decline cognitively. 8, 9, 32, 33 However, it does support the notion that Ab positivity is not a necessary requirement for development of amnestic cognitive impairment. 34 At this point, it is not certain to what degree this impairment is related to AD, since the CN who progressed to MCI may have other underlying neurodegenerative diseases. Two CN subjects progressed to AD dementia, one of them was Ab positive at baseline and the other was Ab negative.\nThe main limitation of this study was the lack of autopsy confirmation of Ab pathology. We only tested the associations between the biomarkers and clinical AD diagnosis, and it is possible that some of the AD subjects were clinically misdiagnosed with AD, and that some of the controls had nonsymptomatic AD pathology. Another limitation of this study was the short clinical follow-up time.\nAlthough we established that the overall diagnostic accuracies of CSF and PET Ab were similar, especially regarding sensitivity for clinical AD, it remains difficult to interpret Ab positivity among the CN and sMCI subjects. Although these subjects are \"falsely positive\" with regard to the currently available clinical information, several studies have shown that Ab-positive healthy controls have increased risk of future cognitive impairment and development of AD, compared to Ab negative subjects. 8, 9, 32, 33 Thus, we believe it is likely that Ab positivity among CN and sMCI in this study is an early biomarker sign of AD, and somebut not necessarily all -of these subjects may go on to develop clinical signs of AD if followed up for several more years. 35, 36 It would be interesting to perform longitudinal studies comparing the performance of CSF and PET to predict development of MCI or AD in people who are cognitively healthy at baseline. This would test the novel proposed research criteria for preclinical AD, [10] [11] [12] 37 which are not taken into account with this study design. This study only included CSF Ab42, and it is likely that the diagnostic performance of CSF biomarkers increases by including also CSF tau measures (the diagnostic performance of imaging measures is likely also increased by combining PET imaging with other imaging modalities, such as structural MRI). Future studies could also test the importance of APOE e4 genotype on these comparisons.\nTo conclude, the overall diagnostic performance of CSF Ab42 and PET Ab to identify clinical AD is similar, but PET has greater specificity in several settings. Other factors than diagnostic performance, including costs, side effects, training and willingness among clinicians to perform lumbar punctures, availability of cyclotrons and PET scanners, and willingness of payers to reimburse different procedures, should also be considered when determining the optimal modality for research, drug trials, and clinical diagnostics.\nAssociation and Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation, with participation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
