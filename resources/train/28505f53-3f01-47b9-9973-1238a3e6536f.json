Underlying this trend are two major factors: Increased demand for U.S. training to meet foreign needs for skilled S/E workers; and increased recruitment by U.S. institutions to-augment domestic enrollment, which has been growing less iapidly in recent years and which is expected to decrease as a result of Projected age-specific population declines."}, {"section_title": "Graduate Training", "text": "Enrollment of foreign students doubled during the seventies at both the undergraduate and the graduate levels, to almost 290,000 in 1979. Proportionately, foreign enrollment at the undergraduate level remained relatively stable at around 2 percent; at the graduate level it oscillated bet weer 7 percent and 9 percent, reaching a peak of 12 percent in 1974. The proportion of foreign full-time graduate students in S/E fields rose from 18 percent in 1974 to 20 percent in 1979. Their share of the 1979 graduate enrollment total in S/E fields was twice that of their graduate enrollment in all fields. The foreign share of all full-time S/E graduate students in doctorate-granting institutions increased in almost all S/E fields between 1974 and 1979, but the growth was most dramatic in engineering and mathematical/computer sciences. Over 40 percent (18,200) of the 1979 graduate enrollment in engineering and over 30 percent (4,300) of the enrollment in mathematical /computer, sciences consisted of foreign students."}, {"section_title": "Doctorate Production", "text": "About 3,800, or one of every five S/E doctorates granted by U.S. universities was awarded to foreign citizens in 1979.

The number of foreign citizens granted /E doctorates more than quadrupled from 1960 to 1974 and then fell by 14 percent from 1974 to 1975. These trends roughly parallel those in S/E doctorates granted fo U.S. citizens.

The short-term impact of foreign citizens on the domestic S/E doctorate labor supply, is trivialless than 1 percent. The long-run impact, however, could he significant in some fields if trends continue. About 1 of every 10 foreign citizens awarded S/E doctorates in 1979 planned to remain in the United States. In engineering almost one of every three Ph.D. recipients had such plans. If these patterns were to continue throughout the eighties as much as one-sixth of the 1990 U.S. doctorate engineering labor force might be foreign citizens. In 1979 roughly 12 percent of all engineering doctorates in the United States were foreign citizens. The prevalence of foreign citizens in domestic doctorate production can indicate foreign interest in high technology training in U:S. institutions. The field of agricultural science where almost all foreign doctorate recipients hold temporary visas seems to typify this interest. Foreign participation has been substantial (over 30 percent in the seventies) and growing, but relatively few a these doctorate holders have remained in this country upon completing their degrees.

Regarding admissions policies, the 1972 study found that decisions were usually made by chairmen or directors of graduate studies; the faculty were seldom involved in the process. Deans' offices rarely exertee any decisive influence other than aosuring confol.nity to minimum requirements. Departmental decisions were mole often based on availability of adequate financial support and the ratio of foreign to U.S: students. The study also found that: In a few universities, some departments admit a disproportionate number of well qualified foreign students as a means of maintaining the size of the department without sacrificing its quality. However, most departments do not admit foreign students in order to avoid ',admitting some academically less qualified,U.S. students.7 Several years later this tendency to \"o Tr-admit\" was also tound to exist in State-supported institutions. In 1975, CGS held a workshop in which foreign student selection procedures were discussed. One of the conclusions drawn was that: One suspects at times that some departments in some State-supported institutions actually use the backlog of foreign applicants to top off the tank of graduate admissions in order to meet 'full-time-equivalent' student enrollment goals, which in turn, justify continuation of financial support for expensive doctoral progams.6 At another CGS workshop, held in 1378, the panelists cautioned the membership that there continued to be a serious problem of \"recruiting and headhunting.\" and that \" . . . tit\" challenge to you and your institutions is to be responsive to the educational needs of countries, but 'to be responsive in a way that your action is responsible for the long-term needs of the students and the countries, and that the standards by which you are responsive are of the highest order.\"9 Any future rise in the proportion of foreign students within the total student population undoubtedly will intensify the search for better ways to determine and defray the real costs of educating these students and the future role of public financing in their acquisition of technical skills. In just a few short years, from 1976 to 1979, the percentage of all foreign students in U.S. institutions of higher education that relied on their own or their governments' resources 'for financial assistance rose from,74 percent to 81 percent.10 Unfortunately, the extent of the U.S. public's financial aid to foreign students at the graduate level, and particularly S/E programs, cannot 4 drawbacks in sending their students to U.S. institutions: \" . inappropriate training for Lime country needs; heavy costs in terms of time and resources; specializations especially at the disFertafion level, that reflect the interest of the host country rather than those of the Middle Eastern state; and the brain drain.\"11 This last issue, the matter of the draining off of scientific and technological skills, is particularly acute for developing countries attempting to achieve social and economic goals. A 1978 UN-sponsored survey of professional personnel who studied abroad found that \" . . . a country will lose more of its citizens who study abroad if it educates mere persons than the economy can absorb, and if the foreigntrained feel their prospects are insecure after return. Improved manpower planning and closer 'coordination between' educational and economic sectors can improve the balance.\"12 foreign graduate s/ e students in doctorategranting institutions Bata from the GSSP survey show that (1) the growth in the number of foreign full-time graduate S/F students outpaced that of their domestic counterparts dufing the latter part of the seventies, and  By fall 1979, nearly 45,000 foreign graduate students were enrolled full time in our Nation's doctorate institutions in programs leading to an advanced degree in an S/E field (table B-3.)
