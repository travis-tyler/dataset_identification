[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Brazil Current (BC) is the Western Boundary Current that closes the South Atlantic subtropical gyre. The formation of the BC occurs between 10\u00b0S and 15\u00b0S ( Figure 1a) from the southern branch of the South Equatorial Current bifurcation (e.g., Peterson & Stramma, 1991;Rodrigues et al., 2007). The BC flows southward from its formation region as a weak surface current, intensifying along its path by central and intermediate water contributions. At approximately 38\u00b0S, the BC encounters the Malvinas Current, forming one of the most energetic regions in the world's ocean (Garzoli and Garrafo, 1989;Goni et al., 1996;Piola et al., 2008). Near Cabo Frio (~23\u00b0S, 42\u00b0W), the BC is characterized by intense meandering and occasional eddy shedding (da Silveira et al., 2008;Pilo et al., 2015), and these features of the BC dynamics have been associated to modulations in coastal upwelling (e.g., Calado et al., 2006;Campos et al., 2000). The Cabo Frio upwelling, which is stronger during the austral summer, creates a strong sea surface temperature (SST) front by bringing cold central waters to the surface, enhancing the local biological productivity (Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al., 1992), decreasing the coastal sea level via Ekman divergence, and forcing the marine boundary layer and surface turbulent fluxes, with potential impact on the weather patterns in the Southeast South America (e.g., Chelton et al., 2007;Pezzi et al., 2016;Ribeiro et al., 2011). Evans and Signorini (1985) described the BC near 23\u00b0S as a 400-to 500-m-deep surface boundary current with a southward volume transport offshore of the shelf break of approximately 6 Sv (1 Sv = 10 6 m 3 /s). In a recent paper, Schmid and Majumder (2018) summarized the previous literature of BC transport between 19\u00b0S and 22.5\u00b0S ranging from 1 to 7 Sv. The variability of the BC can be at least partially determined by the Sverdrup balance, in which the largescale distribution of wind stress curl (WSC) determines the gyre patterns of ocean circulation. The relatively low magnitude of the BC transport compared to its North Atlantic counterpart, the Gulf Stream, is a result of the compensating influence of the wind-driven and thermohaline components of the general circulation (Stommel, 1965, p. 170). The variability of the BC modulates the thermohaline circulation and distribution of heat across the South Atlantic (Dong et al., 2014), and the convergence of heat in the South Atlantic can potentially lead to local and global climate impacts (Lopez et al., 2016). Climate models predict a strengthening of several global Western Boundary Current systems as consequence of an increase of WSC within the subtropical gyres (Pontes et al., 2016;Wu et al., 2012), in addition to a poleward expansion of the tropical and subtropical regions due to global warming (Goni et al., 2011;Waugh et al., 2015). Challenges to understand long-term variability of boundary currents come from the scarcity of observations across the boundaries, regions that often present variability stronger than their mean value (Vianna & Menezes, 2011). The physical processes affecting boundary currents are not generally coherent across different latitudes, which can include from interaction of the flow with bottom topography, thermohaline circulation, and recirculation components (Deser et al., 1999;Wunsch & Roemmich, 1985). Previous studies on the BC focused primarily on its unique mesoscale variability using for this regional ocean models and short-term synoptic hydrographic surveys (e.g., Bilo et al., 2014, Rocha et al., 2014. Recent efforts to understand the interannual-to-decadal variability of the BC are mostly focused near the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence or using numerical models (Artana et al., 2018;Assad et al., 2015;Combes & Matano, 2014). However, little is still known about the interannual variability of the BC Figure 1.

Within the last two decades, the inclusion of repeat highdensity expendable bathythermograph (XBT) transects across the BC in two latitudes (AX97 at 22\u00b0S and AX18 at 34.5\u00b0S) has provided the longest continuous observational system in place to monitor the variability of the BC. The objective of this paper is to examine the seasonal and interannual variability of the BC and to quantify the main drivers of this variability. For this, we introduce two methodologies to estimate the absolute geostrophic velocity of the BC across 22\u00b0S and use them to produce daily, long-term time series of the BC volume transport. This latitude is important because it is close to the Cabo Frio upwelling system and is the region where the South Atlantic Convergence Zone summertime rain belt has a strong oceanic signature (Carvalho et al., 2004). Moreover, the region lies close to the Vitoria-Trindade submarine ridge (Figure 1b), a feature that exerts a strong influence in the South Atlantic intermediate circulation via eddy-topography interaction (Costa et al., 2017;Schmid et al., 1995). This paper is structured as follows: in section 2, we introduce the main data sets used and the methodologies to reconstruct the BC velocity and derived volume transport using altimetry; section 3 examines the temporal variability of the BC and its impact on the unusually warm summer of 2009-2010 event in the western South Atlantic; section 4 concludes this study and provides recommendations for future work."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": "In this study, we focus on the variability of the BC across 22\u00b0S. To estimate relevant parameters of the BC variability at 22\u00b0S, we use 62 realizations of the AX97 repeat high-density XBT transect for the period spanning from 2004 to 2017. The AX97 samples the upper ocean temperature from Rio de Janeiro to Trindade Island approximately five times a year, which allows at least 10 transects per season, therefore producing little seasonal sampling bias ( Figure 1c). Each transect has an average spacing between samplings of approximately 27 km, with increasing resolution to 18 km near the coast and near Trindade Island. Salinity is estimated using historical T-S relationships for the region, according to the method of Goes et al. (2018). The temperature and salinity fields of each transect realization are interpolated along track onto a regular 0.2\u00b0longitudinal spacing (approximately 25 km) using a Lowess filtering with halfpower points of 2\u00b0and 0.8\u00b0. Gridded multimission altimetric sea surface height (SSH) data used in this study are from the delayed time, daily Ssalto/Duacs product, produced by the Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data and distributed by the Copernicus Marine and Environment Monitoring Service (www.marine.copernicus.eu). Among others, corrections for ocean tides (Carrere et al., 2016) and barometric pressure effects (Carrere, & Lyard, 2003) are applied to the SSH data.

The absolute dynamic height (DH(z)) is calculated by imposing at the reference depth the respective monthly climatology value of absolute dynamic topography (ADT). The climatological ADT values are from the International Pacific Research Center gridded merged altimetry and Argo product (e.g., Yu"}, {"section_title": "10.1029/2018JC014809", "text": "Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans et al., 2006).

To integrate T SSH considering only southward velocities, only the dSSH > 0 values are maintained in equation 2. The parameter value h = 117 m is calibrated by regressing (g/f)\u0394SSH = T AX97 /h. The resulting transport derived using only surface velocity is in a good agreement with the observed one, with a correlation of 0.64 between T \u0394SSH and T AX97 , which is significant at 95% ( Figure 4b). iii Sverdrup method. We use the classic linear Sverdrup transport stream function to analyze the influence of the basin-wide WSC on the geostrophic variability of the BC at 22\u00b0S. The geostrophic transport stream function \u03a8 is determined by integrating the Sverdrup relationship zonally, starting from the eastern boundary x E and is given by where \u03b2 is the latitudinal gradient of f, \u03c1 0 = 1,025 kg/m 3 is the reference density of the ocean, and \u03c4 is the wind stress. The BC closes the interior Sverdrup gyre and is defined as the maximum cumulative transport along the latitude of interest. iv Ekman transport. The component of coastal upwelling due to Ekman transport is given by W ek = \u03c4 || /(f.\u03c1 0 ), where \u03c4 || is the component of the wind stress parallel to the coast, and its sign is defined as positive (upwelling) when the coast is on the right-hand side of the winds. The total upwelling volume transport is calculated by first dividing by the cross-shore distance and then integrating W ek over the area encompassed within 200 km offshore the South American coast.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans\n\n\n\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans reconstructed BC transport with those from the XBT realizations (Figure 10a). This reinforces the idea that the seasonal cycle of the BC transport derived from XBT data has still not converged to a true mean value due to weak signal-to-noise ratio. Between the two reconstructed daily time series, the correlation is above 0.95, which suggests that both methods can reproduce the variability of the BC transport. It is noteworthy to mention that these two methods use different calibration and different ways to define the eastern limit of the BC used in the integration of the volume transport (see section 2.2.3). The two methods have their advantages, the \u0394SSH is easier to apply, and SYNTH gives velocity structure information over depth. The fact that these transport values are so similar shows that these estimates are robust. The wavelet spectrum analysis (Liu et al., 2007) is used to decompose the variability of the synthetic BC transport time series. The SYNTH time series shows significant variability from mesoscale to decadal timescales (Figure 10b), since it is reconstructed from 25 years of daily altimetry data. Note, however, that the mean effective spatial and temporal resolutions of the DUACS product are estimated to be~200 km and 28 days period, respectively (Ballarotta et al., 2019). The most prominent timescales are the annual and semiannual cycles (e.g., Figure 6), in addition to large amplitude eddy variability below 100 days. A statistically significant interannual variability of the order of 2-4 years can also be identified. No significant trend is observed in the reconstructed time series of the BC at this latitude since 1993. To determine if and how the interannual variability of the BC is driven by the Sverdrup dynamics, we compute the lag correlation between the anomalies of the synthetic BC transport time series and the anomalies of the western boundary transport derived from the linear Sverdrup balance. Both time series were previously smoothed with a 7-month rectangular filtering to focus on interannual variability. The maximum correlation of r = 0.32 is reached when the BC transport lags the Sverdrup transport by 19 months (Figures 11a  and 11b). Although modest, this correlation is statistically significant at the 95% level, calculated using a two-tailed Student's t distribution and a reduced number of degrees of freedom approximated from its sample autocorrelation function. The baroclinic adjustment of the ocean circulation to WSC forcing is determined primarily by the westward propagation of first baroclinic mode Rossby waves (Chelton & Schlax, 1996). Using the method of Barron et al. (2009), we estimate an optimal propagation speed of 5.3 \u00b1 0.8 cm/s \nJournal of Geophysical Research: Oceans of the unfiltered SSHA data along 22.5\u00b0S. This estimate is consistent with a first baroclinic Rossby wave radius of about 50 km, as well as with previously estimated westward phase speeds for this latitude between 3 and 6 cm/s (Chelton & Schlax, 1996). However, this would provide a timescale for westward propagation across the approximate 6,000 km width of the basin of 4-5 years, which is much longer than the 20-month period shown in Figure 11a. Similar to the work of DiNezio et al. (2009) for the Florida Current, we breakup the Sverdrup transport into contributions from the west (SvW, 40-18\u00b0W) and east (SvE, 0-15\u00b0E) parts of the basin (Figures 11d and 11f). Following the same methodology, a lagged correlation is applied between the BC and the Sverdrup contributions (Figures 11c and 11e). The maximum correlation between the BC transport and SvE is r = 0.30 at 38-month lag, which is expected given the larger distance traveled from the eastern WSC source to the western boundary. Despite the fact that the time lag response of the BC to the WSC forcing is more consistent with the baroclinic Rossby adjustment, the correlation between SvE and the BC is reduced and is not statistically significant. As opposed to SvE, the correlation from the western contribution of the WSC increased to r = 0.43 (Figures 11e and 11f), and the lag remained approximately the same (19 months) as the correlation to the basin-wide WSC. These results suggest that the western part of the basin dominates the Sverdrup response to the BC. In addition, the unequivocal agreement between the interannual variability of the BC transport and the WSC in the western side of the basin (Figure 11f) can partially explain the phase difference to the observed seasonal cycle of the BC in Figure 6. However, it still does not explain much of the intraannual variability such as the strong transport anomaly in the summer of 2009/2010. The lifting of the thermocline along the coast by upwelling favorable winds is associated with a trough in sea level near the coast and increase in sea level offshore (Gill & Clarke, 1974;Csanady, 1982) in scales of \napproximately 1 month (Thompson, 1986), potentially increasing the BC transport by enhancing the cross stream pressure gradient. We reconstruct the time series of anomalies of coastal Ekman transport divergence along the western boundary region and compare it to the synthetic reconstruction of the BC transport ( Figure 12). The anomalous time series are filtered with a 3-month rectangular window to reduce noise and eddy variability. The lagged correlation between the Wek and BC transport time series (Figure 12b) reaches its maximum upstream of the BC path, between 15\u00b0S and 21\u00b0S. Aguiar et al. (2014) showed that W ek controls most of the upwelling events between 17\u00b0S and 21\u00b0S, and W pump plays a secondary role. Thus, an index for the coastal upwelling near AX97 is constructed by averaging Wek between 17\u00b0S and 21\u00b0S, from which a correlation of r = 0.37 (significant at 95%) is found with the BC when the wind leads by 2 months (Figure 12a). These results suggest that the upwelling associated with the alongshore winds upstream of the BC path cause a baroclinic response, leading the BC flow within 2 months. The two strongest upwelling events are for December 2009 and January 2016. One such event was captured by the XBT data during December 2009, when an upwelling response is associated with a stronger BC (Figure 12b). This is perhaps the strongest event recorded with this data. It is observed that the strong upwelling lowers the temperatures, salinity, and sea level along the coast (Figures 5g-5i). Next, the summer 2009/2010 event is investigated in more detail. Figure 13 shows that during the austral summer of 2009/2010, there was a strong anomaly of the BC, in which the BC transport increased to~11 Sv (green dot in Figure 10), approximately 2.5 times its average value. The AX97 section from December 2009 (Figure 5i) shows the BC core speed of 70 cm/s, 40 cm/s stronger relative to the austral summer average of 30 cm/s (Figure 5f). At this time, anomalous upwelling in the Cabo Frio region is also visible from the XBT data, and the isothermal depths are much shallower than the seasonal average close to the boundary (Figure 5d), producing a cooling of up to 4\u00b0C (Figure 5g). The anomalous event of summer 2009/2010 was characterized by SST anomalies in the western South Atlantic that reached 3\u00b0C (Figure 13), which in the study period is the strongest marine heat wave in the AX97 location. \n"}, {"section_title": "Extrapolation to the Shelf", "text": "Using ocean reanalysis data, Lima et al. (2016) estimated that approximately 30% of the BC flows along the shelf across 22.5\u00b0S. The shelf contribution is often not captured by the AX97 transect, because several of its realizations end/start offshore of the 200-m isobath. Therefore, an extrapolation method can be used as a resort to overcome this operational issue. Tools for extrapolating a hydrographic section to the shelf have long been proposed. For instance, this could be achieved by extending the closest horizontal gradients of temperature and dynamic height onto the shelf (Montgomery, 1941;Reid & Mantyla, 1976). Given the importance of the shelf contribution to the BC transport, we developed a method to use satellite altimetry data to extrapolate the AX97 dynamic height data toward the shelf. With this aim, the first step is to interpolate altimetric SSH data to the same day and location of each XBT profile. Next, from the XBT profile location closest to the shore, SSH data are resampled westward at 0.2\u00b0intervals of longitude. Then, the XBTderived surface absolute dynamic heights (DH i (z = 0)), where the subscript i indicates the longitudinal location and increases offshore, are extrapolated toward the shelf using the local gradients of SSH. Mathematically, the equation to derive the extrapolation to the next location closer to the shelf (i-1) from the DH i (z) data at the longitudinal location (i) and depth (z) is the following: In equation 1, pa(z) = 1/exp(z/300); thus, the surface dynamic height information is extrapolated in depth using an exponential decay with an e-folding depth scale of 300 m, which was chosen from several sensitivity tests in that particular region, and agrees with previously estimated decay of eddy variance of dynamic height near the boundary (e.g., Hautala et al., 1994). Additional extrapolation of DH below 300 m onto the boundary is performed at each depth using a seventh-order autoregressive method. The application of this methodology is possible because there is generally a good agreement between SSH and the surface DH referenced to the International Pacific Research Center ADT climatology at 500 m in all sections (Figure 2, upper panels). This method generates smooth transitions between the shelf and interior velocities ( Figure 2), and the original velocities remain practically unchanged."}, {"section_title": "Transport Calculations", "text": "The absolute geostrophic BC transport estimated for the AX97 XBT data (T AX97 ) is calculated by integrating the cross-section velocities in the top 500 m from 41\u00b0W and the location of the minimum cumulative transport between 41\u00b0W and 36\u00b0W. After the eastern limit of the BC is found, the transport is calculated between these two locations taking into account only the southward velocities, which represent the BC flow. To extend the BC transport across 22.5\u00b0S in time from January 1993 to December 2017, two methods are used applying daily SSH maps along a reference transect estimated as the average location of all considered transects ( Figure 1). In addition, the BC transport will be compared to the integrated Sverdrup transport and the upwelling near 22.5\u00b0S. These methods are defined as follows. i Synthetic method (SYNTH). Here we use the methodology described in Goes et al. (2013) to estimate synthetic transports of the BC. For this, DH(0) is regressed onto the DH(z) values at each depth and longitude. Correlation values between the regressed DH(0) and DH(z) are typically above 0.9 in the whole depth of the section. DH(0) is then regressed to SSH, with both fields detrended and demeaned, establishing the link between altimetric and hydrographic quantities. The agreement between DH(0) and SSH is very good along the AX97 section ( Figure 3), with local differences typically below 3 cm and an overall R 2 = 0.71 for the regression between these two quantities. Geostrophic velocities are then estimated from the synthetic DH using the thermal wind relationship, and transport is calculated from the velocity fields similarly to the AX97 data. The BC core velocities estimated using this method show strong agreement with the ones estimated with XBTs ( Figure 4a). ii SSH gradient method (\u0394SSH). This method uses the SSH gradients to estimate the BC transport. Previous studies have used similar methodology to calculate the transport of other Western Boundary Currents (Imawaki et al., 2001;Park & Sweet, 2015;Wunsch et al., 1969). Using a one 1/2 layer geostrophic approximation, we calculated the transport according to the following equation:"}, {"section_title": "Error Estimation of the BC Volume Transport", "text": "The velocity computation using XBT data is subject to uncertainties. According to Goes et al., (2015), the two largest uncertainties are associated with the salinity inference and the choice of reference level. We assess these two sources of uncertainty in the supporting information. This is performed using a bootstrap method. According to Figure S1, salinity uncertainties near 23\u00b0S generate a surface dynamic height uncertainty (standard error) of~1 cm and velocity uncertainties going from zero at the reference level, where velocities are prescribed, to~6.4 cm at the surface. The geostrophic reference level uncertainty is assessed by varying the reference depth from 300 m to 700 m at 50-m increments. The Argo/altimetry mean ADT is added to each selected depth, following the same methodology of section 2, producing a velocity standard error of 1.33 cm/s using all sections. Using both uncertainties, the derived AX97 transport errors have a median value of 0.72 Sv. This value is added to the uncertainty of 0.92 Sv derived from the regression in Figure 4, for a total uncertainty of 1.64 Sv of the reconstructed transports.

On average, the core velocity of the BC is \u221222 cm/s, and the BC is confined in the upper 550 m between 39\u00b0W and 41.5\u00b0W (Figures 5c and  5f). Below 550 m the signature of the Intermediate Western Boundary Current can be observed with approximate velocity of 5 cm/s. The mean (\u00b11\u03c3) transport of the BC east of 40.9\u00b0W is 4.7 \u00b1 1.9 Sv southward, similar to the earlier estimates ranging from 4.4 to 5.3 Sv (Evans et al., 1983). The transport standard deviation (\u00b11.9 Sv) is approximately half of the mean, showing the strong contribution from eddy variability to the BC (e.g., Lima et al., 2016;Soutelino et al., 2011). The shelf contribution, defined here as the region west of 40.9\u00b0W and shallower than 300 m, is of 0.9 \u00b1 0.9 Sv, giving a total southward transport of 5.5 \u00b1 1.7 Sv. The mean temperature of the BC ranges from 22 to 24\u00b0C (Figures 5a and  5d) and salinity from 36.8 to 37.2 psu in the top 75 m (Figures 5b and 5e), a signature of the salty and warm surface tropical waters. At the 75-to 450m layer, a temperature of 13 to 22\u00b0C and salinity of 35 to 36.7 psu characterize an almost linear T/S relationship of the South Atlantic Central Water ( Figure S1), which is located between \u03c3 \u03b8 = 25.8 and 26.9 kg/m 3 (M\u00e9mery et al., 2000). During the summer months, the signature of intensified upwelling is clear near the coastal area by the increased upward slope of isothermals/isohalines (Figures 5d and 5e). Due to the intensified summer upwelling, the BC core is shown further offshore (~40.5\u00b0W; Figure 5f) relative to the winter average (~39.5\u00b0W; Figure 5c). As the BC flows southward, more intense contributions of central and intermediate waters increase considerably its total transport. To quantify this contribution, we estimate the BC transport using the data from the AX18 XBT transect across the nominal latitude of 34.5\u00b0S (not shown; see companion paper Majumder et al., 2019). We apply the same methodology described in section 2.2 for inner shelf extrapolation and Argo absolute dynamic height referencing at a 1,000 m. The mean BC transport across 34.5\u00b0S in the upper 1,000 m is 12.4 \u00b1 3.5 Sv along 34.5\u00b0S, which is similar to the values calculated using other data and methods (Schmid & Majumder, 2018), which implies that the BC gains approximately 7-8 Sv of central and intermediate waters between 22\u00b0S and 34.5\u00b0S."}, {"section_title": "The Monthly Climatology of the BC Transport", "text": "As described in the previous section, the amplitude of variability (\u00b11\u03c3) of the BC is comparable to the mean, due to its intense mesoscale activity along the western boundary. This implies that the seasonal cycle of the BC may be masked by the mesoscale variability, which constitutes a challenge to define its transport seasonal cycle (e.g., Vianna & Menezes, 2011). Figure 6 shows the monthly means of the BC transport using the AX97 data, as well as the transport derived from the two altimetry/XBT methods for the 2004-2017 period. Although there is indication that the BC transport is higher during the austral summer/fall (5.5 to 7 Sv) and weaker (2.5 to 4.0 Sv) in winter/spring, the seasonal cycle derived from the AX97 is noisy. The altimetry/XBT-derived methods provide a much smoother and well-defined seasonal cycle. The BC transport generated from these methods has similar means of 4.1 \u00b1 1.7 Sv for the SSH gradient method and 4.6 \u00b1 1.6 Sv for the synthetic method, which is also a feature of the higher temporal sampling. The seasonal cycle of the BC transport estimated by the Sverdrup balance at 22.5\u00b0S shows a minimum of~3 Sv during February-March and a maximum of~8 Sv during June-September. Therefore, it is out of phase with the observed BC transport. The average Sverdrup stream function between 1992 and 2017 is negative (cyclonic) north of approximately 15\u00b0S, following the sign of the WSC, and becomes positive (anticyclonic) southward (Figure 7).

During the winter (June-July-August), this WSC band migrates farther north, creating a maximum Sverdrup gyre response between 30\u00b0S and 38\u00b0S ( Figure 7). Consequently, the difference between winter and summer (June-July-August-DJF) shows a weakening of the WSC south of 35\u00b0S during winter and WSC strengthening between 35\u00b0S and 15\u00b0S, resulting in a stronger winter Sverdrup transport across 22.5\u00b0S ( Figure 6). The incompatibility between the seasonal cycle of the stationary linear Sverdrup model and upperocean western boundary currents can be explained by two main causes: (i) the time lag of the baroclinic adjustment via Rossby wave propagation and (ii) remote versus local wind forcing. To further investigate the seasonal oceanic variability of along 22.5\u00b0S, Figure 8 displays the longitude-time diagrams of SST, SSH, WSC, and meridional wind stress (TAUY) monthly climatologies. SST and SSH (Figures 8a  and 8b) show similar behavior along 22.5\u00b0S, with maximum values of SST and SSH from February to April, intensification west of 20\u00b0W, and minimum values from August to October. Beal et al. (2013) described a semiannual Rossby wave propagation across the Arabian Sea, which would be potentially responsible for a seasonal phase shift along the western boundary. In Figure 8b, no SSH propagation is visible throughout the year, from which we can infer that the annual large-scale adjustment is not the cause of the shift between the integrated WSC and the BC.

No AX97 observations are available in September (blue dashed line). All monthly climatology values are calculated for the period between 2004 and 2017. BC = Brazil Current; SSH = sea surface height.\nwaves are also found in the South Atlantic (Polito & Liu, 2003), but as in the Indian Ocean, they often have the largest amplitudes in the tropics. At this latitude, the WSC is indeed stronger in the basin interior from June to September (Figure 8c), with its maximum located between 20\u00b0W and 5\u00b0E. West of 30\u00b0W, it is the southward component of the wind stress that is most intense during the summer (DJF) months (Figure 8d), whose alongshore component is associated with the increased summer coastal upwelling in Cabo Frio. Therefore, the local component of the wind may be the strongest forcing of the seasonality of the BC. Using a reduced gravity model, Rodrigues et al. (2007) suggested that it is the local WSC and not the remote forcing (i.e., westward propagation of anomalies) that impacts the seasonal variability of upper thermocline flow along the western boundary and on the South Equatorial Current bifurcation (~10-15\u00b0S).  \nThe effect of the seasonality of the alongshore wind and near coastal WSC on the upwelling is shown in Figure 9. Similar to what was shown in Castelao and Barth (2006), due to the prevailing southwestward direction of the winds, coastal upwelling and Ekman pumping occur all year-round but are stronger during summer months. The vertical transport associated to Ekman transport is approximately 3 times stronger than the Ekman pumping calculated within 200 km of the coast. The seasonality of the coastal upwelling and Ekman pumping near the western boundary (Figure 9e) follows the same seasonality of the BC transport. The dynamic relation between the BC variability and the coastal upwelling will be explored in the next section.\nThe SST anomalies were located in the center of the basin between 20\u00b0S and 22\u00b0S in November, which according to Rodrigues et al. (2015) were generated as a response in the South Atlantic to a moderate to strong Central Ni\u00f1o event in the Pacific. From 20\u00b0S to 22\u00b0S, these anomalies appeared to migrate further south in February toward 30-32\u00b0S. Strong anticyclonic wind stress anomalies were observed around the maximum of the warm SST anomaly, whose alongshore component favors an increased upwelling response, first around 15-18\u00b0S and further south in February. Offshore SSH was also increased during the event (Figures 13c and 13), following the regions of increased SST. From the SSHA maps in Figures 13c and  13d, it is observed a stationary eddy near 40\u00b0W along the XBT transect, generating a trough in sea level of more than 10 cm throughout the 3-month period. This is the so-called Sao Tome eddy, a semipermanent cyclonic feature that develops in the region and can be originated from a detachment of a BC meandering (Calado et al., 2008;Campos et al., 2000;Lima et al., 2016). Therefore, our results suggest that in the summer 2009/2010, a mix of positive SSH anomalies propagated westward, anticyclonic wind anomalies facilitating the coastal upwelling and decreasing the coastal sea level, and a stationary eddy near 40\u00b0W along the XBT transect contributed for the strong BC anomaly in that period. Figure 14 shows the contribution of the sea level anomalies to the BC transport separated into inshore [41\u00b0W, 40\u00b0W] and offshore [40\u00b0W, 38\u00b0W] regions. Near the coast (Figure 14a), the SSH (DH) anomalies reached between 15 and 20 cm in late 2009, which characterizes the highest sea level anomaly in the whole time series, and it is linked to the strong coastal upwelling anomaly and also the influence of the stationary eddy attached to it. Offshore (Figure 14b), the AX97 time series does not show strong anomalies in 2009/2010, which corroborates with the pattern shown in Figure 5 of the compensation of warm upper 100-m depth anomalies by a cooling underneath. A strong positive anomaly of~15 cm is, however, detected by the daily altimetry data along the reference transect (thin gray line) during early February 2010, which is associated to a thermosteric response to the warm anomaly approaching the coast. Similar offshore warm 10.1029/2018JC014809 Figure 14. Comparison between altimetric SSH (black) and DH(0) from XBT data (red) time series calculated along the AX97 sections. The thin gray line is the daily SSH with a 61-day low-pass Hanning filter, along the mean AX97 transect for the entire altimetric period. SSH and DH are averaged in two regions: (a) near the coast (41\u00b0W to 40\u00b0W) and (b) offshore (40\u00b0W to 38\u00b0W). SSH = sea surface height; DH = dynamic height.  To investigate how the SST and SSH anomalies propagate toward and along the coast during the 2009/2010 event, a Hovmoller plot is produced following the interior path toward the coast along 22\u00b0S and continuing along the BC path from 22\u00b0S to 37\u00b0S (Figure 15). Positive SSH anomalies propagate 1,000 km from 30\u00b0W of the basin toward the coast along 22\u00b0S for about 3 months (Figure 15b), whereas SST anomalies do not show the same propagation pattern as SSH (Figure 15a). This is expected, since SST anomalies in the WSSA region are strongly influenced by atmospheric features both locally and remotely (e.g., Rodrigues & Woollings, 2017). After reaching the BC, a southward propagation path of SSH anomalies is also visible, although aliased by strong mesoscale variability typical of the region. These results suggest that the increased heat transport along the BC and its propagation timescales during this event were mostly driven by velocity anomalies rather than temperature anomalies. Effects of planetary Rossby wave propagation at different latitudes (Majumder et al., 2019;Polito & Liu, 2003) and convergence associated with the meridional overturning circulation (Lopez et al., 2016) may also play an important role for the increased heat anomaly within the subtropical gyre, but this is beyond the scope of this study."}, {"section_title": "The Interannual Variability of the BC and Associated Forcings", "text": "Although there are substantial differences between the seasonal cycles of the transports calculated using altimetry-based and the XBT estimates, there is strong agreement between the daily time series of the "}, {"section_title": "The 2009-2010 Warm Event and Regional Impacts", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In the present study, the AX97 high-density XBT data are used along with satellite altimetry and Argo-based absolute dynamic topography to reconstruct the geostrophic velocity of the BC across 22\u00b0S. The reconstructed velocity includes the shelf and mesoscale components. A time series of the BC transport is reconstructed since 1993 using two methods, one using synthetic velocities (Goes et al., 2013) and the other using only surface velocity from altimetry calibrated to the transport from the XBT data. The two methods show very strong agreement and correlation above 0.9. The reconstructed BC shows a well-defined seasonal cycle with a stronger transport (5-7 Sv) from January to March and a weaker transport (2 Sv) during August-September. The seasonal variability was reasonably well captured by the 62 transects of the XBT data, although still subject to some noise due to strong eddy variability of the BC. The integrated WSC across the basin is out-of-phase with the seasonal cycle of the BC transport. The WSC is stronger during the austral winter and in the central and western part of the basin. This suggests that there is delayed adjustment time to the WSC via baroclinic adjustment, and also contributions from the coastal upwelling to the BC variability, which is stronger during summer. At interannual timescales, the variability of the BC agrees with the variability of the large-scale WSC in the western side of the basin, with a correlation of 0.43 when the winds lead the BC by 19 months. Therefore, it can be linked to the baroclinic adjustment of the subtropical gyre via Rossby wave mechanisms (e.g., Majumder et al., 2019;H\u00e4kkinen et al., 2013). In addition, the BC interannual variability shows a statistically significant (r = 0.37) relationship with the upwelling north of the AX97 transect (15\u00b0S to 21\u00b0S), and with a 2month delay, which can be associated to the advection of anomalies downstream (e.g., Enfield & Allen, 1980), as detected by the cooling of 4\u00b0C the BC down to 400 m in December 2009. Other processes may influence the variability of the BC transport, such as mesoscale eddies, coastally trapped waves, and interaction of the bathymetry with the flow. During the event of summer 2009/2010, the BC transport increased threefold, reaching~11 Sv for 3 months. This event was concomitant with the 2009-2010 central Ni\u00f1o event (Xue et al., 2011), which influences the South Atlantic variability via atmospheric Rossby wave teleconnections, which follows primarily to the Pacific-South American pattern (e.g., Ashok et al., 2007;Mo & Paegle, 2001), and the development of a positive phase of the South Atlantic dipole (Rodrigues et al., 2015). Therefore, strong positive SST anomalies of 3\u00b0C, the highest in the region for the period of study, developed in the center of the basin in October/November 2009 and propagated westward along~20\u00b0S. Positive SSH anomalies were detected offshore of the AX97 transect in early February 2010. The SST anomalies were associated with an anomalous anticyclonic wind pattern, resulting in increased coastal upwelling north of 22\u00b0S. The increased upwelling decreased the coastal sea level by 15 to 20 cm, partly driven by the cooling of the water column detected by the XBT data in December of 2009, which also increased the SSH gradient across the AX97 section and the meandering of the BC. The increased BC meandering may have caused a stationary eddy growth, as suggested by previous studies (e.g., Aguiar et al., 2014;Calado et al., 2010), which occupied the AX97 location for nearly 3 months and also contributed for the decreased sea level near the coast. SSH anomalies were advected to and along the BC path, setting the timescale of approximately 2 months for the propagation of the SST anomalies reaching the so-called western subtropical South Atlantic region (henceforth WSSA; 50\u00b0W-20\u00b0W and 25\u00b0S-35\u00b0S). The BC defines the pathway of the warm waters southward in the South Atlantic and therefore is an important part of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. In addition, positive SST anomalies in the WSSA region are associated with weaker South Atlantic Convergence zone and potentially droughts in the Southeast Brazilian coast, a highly populated region. Further investigation using numerical models may be necessary to ascertain the proper mechanisms that relate the role of the BC on the regional climate and extreme events. Significant long-term trends were not detected in the reconstructed BC transport. Recent studies using model outputs show a tendency for the Southern Hemisphere boundary currents to strengthen due to the tropical expansion and stronger winds (e.g., Pontes et al., 2016, Yang et al., 2016. Further south, there are indications of a southward migration of the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence but can be driven by a weakening of the Malvinas Current and a southward shift of the westerly winds (Combes & Matano, 2014;Wu et al., 2012). In this case, it is possible that there is low latitudinal coherence of the BC, or a deepening of the BC instead of strengthening, and it may have not been detected by the present methodology."}]
