[{"section_title": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic manifesting respiratory illness and first reported in", "text": "Wuhan, Hubei province of China in December 2019. The death toll rose to more than 68,000 among 1,250,000 confirmed cases around the Globe (until April 4, 2020) [1] . The virus causing COVID-19 is named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Based on the phylogenetic studies, the SARS-CoV-2 is categorized as a member of the genus Betacoronavirus, the same lineage that includes SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] that caused SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in China during 2002 [3] . Recent studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a close relationship with bat SARS-like CoVs [4, 5] [7] ].\nInterestingly, S glycoprotein is characterized as the critical determinant for viral entry into host cells which consists of two functional subunits namely S1 and S2. The S1 subunit recognizes and binds to the host receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) whereas S2 is responsible for fusion with the host cell membrane [ [8] , [9] , [10] ]. MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) as entry receptor [11] whereas SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilize ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme-2) [12] , abundantly available in lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes, suggesting S glycoprotein as a potential drug target to halt the entry of SARS-CoV-2 [13] .\nAccording to recent reports, neutralizing antibodies are generated in response to the entry and fusion of surface-exposed S protein (mainly RBD domain) which is predicted to be an 4 important target for vaccine candidates [ [10] , [14] , [15] ]. However, SARS-CoV-2 has emerged with remarkable properties like glutamine-rich 42 aa long exclusive molecular signature (DSQQTVGQQDGSEDNQTTTIQTIVEVQPQLEMELTPVVQTIE) in position 983-1024 of polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) [16] , diversified receptor-binding domain (RBD), unique furin cleavage site (PRRAR\u2193SV) at S1/S2 boundary in S glycoprotein which could play roles in viral pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [17] . To date, few genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2 are reported [ [18] , [19] ]. There is growing evidence that spike protein, a 1273 amino acid long glycoprotein having multiple domains, possibly plays a major role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Viral entry to the host cell is initiated by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 head. Upon receptor-binding, proteolytic cleavage occurs at S1/S2 cleavage site and two heptad repeats (HR) of S2 stalk form a six-helix bundle structure triggering the release of the fusion peptide.\nAs it comes into close proximity to the transmembrane anchor (TM), the TM domain facilitates membrane destabilization required for fusion between virus-host membranes [ [20] , [21] ]. Insights into the sequence variations of S glycoprotein among available genomes are key to understanding the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection, developing antiviral treatments and vaccines. In this study, we have analyzed 320 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to identify mutations between the available genomes followed by the amino acid variations in the glycoprotein S to foresee their impact on the viral entry to host cell from structural biology viewpoint."}, {"section_title": "Dataset", "text": "All available sequences (320 whole genome and surface glycoprotein sequences of SARS-CoV-2) related to the COVID-19 pandemic were retrieved from NCBI Virus Variation Resource repository (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/) [22] . In addition, all 40 S glycoprotein sequences from different coronavirus families were retrieved for phylogenetic 5 analysis. The NCBI reference sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, accession number YP_009724390 was used as the canonical sequence for the analyses of spike protein variants."}, {"section_title": "Phylogenetic analysis", "text": "Variant analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genomes were performed in the Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool Version 1.13 which is specially designed for this virus (https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/cov/) [23] . For multiple sequence alignment (MSA), Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool uses a reference dataset of 431 whole genome sequences (WGS) where 386 WGS were from known nine coronavirus species.\nThe dataset was then aligned with MUSCLE [24] . Entropy (H(x)) plot of nucleotide variations in SARS-CoV-2 genome was constructed using BioEdit [25] . MEGA X (version 10.1.7) was used to construct the MSAs and the phylogenetic tree using pairwise alignment and neighborjoining methods in ClustalW [26, 27] .

Among the 483 variations, 40 variations (14 synonymous, 25 non-synonymous mutations and one deletion) were observed in the region of ORF S that encodes S glycoprotein which is responsible for viral fusion and entry into the host cell [34] . Notable that, most of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were deposited from the USA (250) and China (50) (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Positional variability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was calculated from the MSA of 320 SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes as a measure of Entropy value (H(x)) [35] . Excluding 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR, ten hotspot of hypervariable position were identified, of which seven were located at ORF1ab (1059C>T, 3037C>T, 8782C>T, 14408C>T, 17747C>T, 17858A>G, 18060C>T) and one at ORF S (23403A>G), ORF3a (25563G>T), and ORF8 (28144T>C) respectively.

In other clades, the clusters were speculated through different hosts which may describe the evolutionary changes of surface glycoprotein due to cross species transmission. Viral hosts reported from different spots at different times is indicative of possible recombination."}, {"section_title": "SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Variation Analysis", "text": "The S glycoprotein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from the NCBI Virus Fig. 2 ). 8 Alterations of amino acid residual charge from positive to neutral (H49Y, R408I, H519Q), negative to neutral (D111N, D614G, D936Y), negative to positive (D1168H, D1259H), and neutral to positive (N74K, S247R) were seen in variants QHW06059, QHS34546, QIS61422, QIS61338, QIK50427, QIS30615, QIS60978, QIS60582, QIO04367, and QHR84449 respectively due to substitution of amino acid that differ in charge. The remaining 15 variants were mutated with the amino acids that are similar in charge (Fig. 4 A) . The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants were superposed with the cryo-electron microscopic structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [8] . L5F, N74K, E96D, F157L, G181V, S247R, G476S, V483A, D1168H, and D1259H variants were excluded from superposition due to absence of respective residues in the 3D structure of template (PDB: 6VSB). The superposition showed that most of the residual change were causing incorporation of bulky amino acid residues (T29I, H49Y, L54F, S221W, A348T, H519Q, A520S, A930V, D936Y, and A1078V) in place of smaller size residue except Y28N, D111N, R408I, D614G, and F797C (Fig. 4 B-P) . Fig. 3) . The S2 subunit of spike protein, especially the heptad repeat region 2, fusion peptide domain, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic tail were found to be highly conserved in the SARS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2 variants while the S1 subunit was more diverse, specifically the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "COVID 19 is one of the most contagious pandemics the world has ever had with 1,250,000 confirmed cases to date (April 4, 2020) and the cases have increased as high as 5 times in less than a month [1] . Phylogenetic analysis showed that the SARS-CoV-2 is a unique coronavirus presumably related to Bat coronavirus (BM48-31, Hp-betacoronavirus). During this study, we [15] , [38] , [39] , [40] ]. Likewise, a number of studies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been undertaken for the therapeutic measures [41] , but the unique structural and functional details of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are still under scrutiny. We also found a variant (R408I) at receptor binding domain (RBD) that mutated from positively charged Arginine residue to neutral and smaller sized Isoleucine residue (Fig. 4 I) . This change might alter the interaction of viral RBD with the host receptor because the R408 residue of SARS-CoV-2 is known to interact with the ACE2 receptor for viral entry [42] . Similarly, alterations of RBD (G476S, V483A, H519Q, and A520S) also could affect the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with other molecules which require further investigations. QIA98583 and QIS30615 variants were found to have an alteration of Alanine to Valine (A930V), and Aspartic acid to Tyrosine (D936Y) respectively in the alpha helix of the HR1 domain. Previous reports have indicated that HR1 domain plays a significant role in viral fusion and entry by forming helical bundles with HR2, and mutations including alanine substitution by valine (A1168V) in HR1 region are predominantly responsible for conferring resistance to mouse hepatitis coronaviruses against HR2 derived peptide entry inhibitors [43] . This study hypothesizes the mutation (A930V) found in that of SARS-CoV-2 might also have a role in the emergence of drug-resistance virus strains. Also, the mutation (D1168H) found in the heptad repeat 2 (HR) SARS-CoV-2 could play a vital role in viral pathogenesis.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 S protein contains additional furin protease cleavage site, PRRARS, in S1/S2 domain which is conserved among all 320 sequences as revealed during this study ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). This unique signature is thought to make the SARS-CoV-2 more virulent than SARS-CoV and regarded as novel features of the viral pathogenesis (ref 11).\nAccording to previous reports the more the host cell protease can process the coronavirus S can accelerate viral tropism accordingly in influenza virus [[9] , [44] , [45] , [46] ]. Apart from that, this could also promote viruses to escape antiviral therapies targeting transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04321096) which is well reported protease to cleave at S1/S2 of S glycoprotein [47] . Comparative analyses between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein showed 77% similarity between them where the most diverse region was ."}]
