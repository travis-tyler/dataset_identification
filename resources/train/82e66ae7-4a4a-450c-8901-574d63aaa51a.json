Map "}, {"section_title": "Breeding Range", "text": "Horned Larks breed throughout North America except in portions of central Canada and the southeastern United States (National Geographic Society, 2011) . The Horned Lark may be a year-round resident in all but the most northern parts of its breeding range (Beason, 1995) . Twenty-one subspecies of Horned Lark are recognized in North America (Beason, 1995) . Several other subspecies also are present in Europe, Asia, and Colombia in South America. This account deals primarily with those subspecies associated with the North American Great Plains (Dickerman, 1964; Beason, 1995) , which include E. a. enthymia, E. a. leucolaema, and E. a. praticola. The relative densities of Horned Larks in the United States and southern Canada, based on North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data (Sauer and others, 2014) , are shown in figure U1 (not all geographic places mentioned in report are shown on figure). "}, {"section_title": "Suitable Habitat", "text": "Horned Larks prefer sparsely vegetated grasslands, deserts, and agricultural lands with little or no woody vegetation (Beason, 1970 (Beason, , 1995 Wiens, 1973; Creighton, 1974; Skinner, 1974 Skinner, , 1975 Rotenberry and Wiens, 1980; Dale, 1983; Renken, 1983; Sample, 1989; Camp and Best, 1993; Prescott and Murphy, 1996; Davis and Duncan, 1999; Martin and Forsyth, 2003) . The species breeds in a variety of grassland habitats that have been recently burned, hayed, or grazed, including shortgrass, mixed-grass, tallgrass, bunchgrass, and restored prairies and tame grasslands (Strong, 1971; Porter and Ryder, 1974; Ryder, 1980; Kantrud, 1981; Bock and Webb, 1984; Greer, 1988; Lueders and others, 2006; Kennedy and others, 2009; Olechnowski and others, 2009; White, 2009; Earnst and Holmes, 2012; Johnson and others, 2012; Richardson, 2012; Roberts and others, 2012; Sliwinski and Koper, 2012) . Horned Larks also nest in shrubsteppe and sagebrush (Artemisia species [spp.]) habitats and alpine meadows (Cassel, 1952; Earnst and others, 2009; Gilbert and Chalfoun, 2011) . The species commonly nests in cropland, such as wheat (Triticum spp.) and other small grains, soybeans (Glycine spp.), corn (Zea mays), bare fields, fallow fields, and crop stubble (Bent, 1942; Graber and Graber, 1963; Beason, 1970; Stewart, 1975; Ducey and Miller, 1980; Castrale, 1985; Kahl and others, 1985; Faanes and Lingle, 1995; DeJong and others, 2004) . Horned Larks occasionally inhabit planted cover, such as Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields, dense nesting cover (DNC), and Permanent Cover Program (PCP) fields, but Horned Larks prefer newly seeded fields to those with well-established vegetation (Best and others, 1990; Schwartz, 1993a, 1993b; Hartley, 1994a Hartley, , 1994b King and Savidge, 1995; Patterson and Best, 1996; Davis, 1998, 2001; Herkert, 2009; Ribic and others, 2009; Riffell and others, 2010) . Horned Larks also use herbaceous fencerows, road rights-of-way, and grassed waterways in agricultural areas (Best and Hill, 1983; Bryan and Best, 1991; Camp and Best, 1993; Best, 2001) . In Missouri, Skinner (1974) observed Horned Larks in disturbed areas created by livestock and American bison (Bison bison)."}, {"section_title": "Suitable Habitat 3", "text": "Horned Larks have been reported in colonies of whitetailed (Cynomys leucurus), black-tailed (Cynomys ludovicianus), and Gunnison's (Cynomys gunnisoni) prairie dogs (Campbell and Clark, 1981; Clark and others, 1982; Agnew and others, 1986; Tyler and Shackford, 2002; Augustine and Baker, 2013) . In Oklahoma, Horned Larks were positively associated with black-tailed prairie dog towns, but Horned Larks also used shortgrass prairies in the absence of prairie dogs, fallow crop fields, sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia) plains, and CRP fields (Smith and Lomolino, 2004) . In South Dakota, Horned Larks were more abundant on blacktailed prairie dog towns during the growing season than on adjacent mixed-grass prairie sites in the absence of prairie dogs (Agnew and others, 1986) . Kotliar and others (1999) considered the Horned Lark as weakly facultative in their dependence on prairie dogs (that is, a species that would likely decline locally following a decline in prairie dogs if alternative habitat was unavailable or limited).\nHorned Larks occupy areas with short, sparse herbaceous vegetation; occupied areas typically are characterized by moderate bare ground cover (Speirs and Orenstein, 1967; Skinner, 1974; Dale, 1983; Greer, 1988; Sample, 1989; Davis and Duncan, 1999; Bleho, 2009; . Numerous studies have evaluated the effects of vegetation structure and composition on Horned Lark distribution and abundance. Summaries of the results from those studies are presented below, beginning with studies in the northern and western portions of the species' breeding range. In aspen parkland areas of Alberta, the species preferred short grass that was uniform in height (Prescott and Murphy, 1996) . In mixed-grass prairies in southeastern Alberta, Horned Lark abundance declined at higher percentages of live grasses and forbs; abundance increased at small percentages (less than [<] 10 percent) of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) cover but declined at intermediate and larger percentages (Rodgers and Koper, 2017) . In southern Alberta mixed-grass prairies, Horned Lark densities were negatively related to vegetation height, vegetation density, and litter depth and positively related to percentage of bare ground (Koper and Schmiegelow, 2006) . In Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, Horned Lark presence was positively associated with the amount of bare ground and the number of forb contacts in the fifth and sixth decimeter above ground, depending on ecoregion (that is, mixed grassland, moist-mixed grassland, and aspen parkland; McMaster and Davis, 2001) . Presence was negatively associated with the number of broad-leaved grass contacts in the first centimeter above ground, contacts of dead vegetation in the third decimeter above ground, forb contacts in the first decimeter above ground, degree of latitude, and vegetation height.\nIn grazed and ungrazed grasslands in southern Saskatchewan, Horned Larks occupied areas having little or no vegetation or litter (Dale, 1983) . In native and seeded pastures in southern Saskatchewan, Horned Lark occurrence was positively associated with bare ground and fringed sagewort (Artemisia frigida) and negatively associated with vegetation height, litter depth, thickspike wheatgrass (Elymus macrourus), and western snowberry (Symphoricarpos occidentalis; Davis and Duncan, 1999) . In a 2-year study in mixed-grass prairies in southern Saskatchewan, Horned Lark response to vegetation varied by year (Davis, 2003 (Davis, , 2004 . In 1 of the 2 years, Horned Lark occurrence was positively related to the density of live grasses 0-10 cm above the ground and negatively related to the density of live grasses and standing dead vegetation 10-20 cm above the ground. In the second year, lark occurrence was positively related to the density of live grasses 0-10 cm above the ground and negatively related to the density of standing dead vegetation 0-10 cm above the ground and distance to the nearest shrub. In another mixed-grass prairie study in southern Saskatchewan, Bleho (2009) evaluated the relationship between Horned Lark abundance and vegetation structure at the plot and pasture levels, whereby plots were circular areas of 100-meter (m) radii within pastures that were grazed seasonlong (June to October) at moderate grazing intensity (that is, about 43 percent utilization). Two measures of vegetation patchiness (that is, heterogeneity) were evaluated: standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV). At the plot level, Horned Lark abundance was positively associated with percentage cover of bare ground and shrubs, the SD-derived measure for patchiness of bare ground coverage, and the CV-derived measure for patchiness of vegetation heightdensity and litter coverage. Abundance at the plot level was negatively associated with vegetation height-density and the CV-derived measure for patchiness of bare ground and exposed moss and lichen (no species provided) coverage. At the pasture level, Horned Lark abundance was positively associated with percent coverage of bare ground and the SD-derived measure for patchiness of bare ground coverage. Within that same study area, White (2009) evaluated songbird response to burning on grazed and ungrazed mixed-grass prairies. In the first-year postburn, Horned Lark abundance was positively associated with visual obstruction and negatively associated with litter depth. In the second-year postburn, Horned Lark abundance was positively associated with percentage of exposed bare ground and percentage of forb cover and negatively associated with maximum vegetation height and visual obstruction. Also in southern Saskatchewan, Horned Lark abundance was negatively associated with shrubs and dead vegetation 20-100 cm tall (Anstey and others, 1995) . In mixed-grass prairies in southwestern Saskatchewan, Gaudet (2013) reported that Horned Lark densities increased with an increase in cover of lichen (no species provided) and small clubmoss (Selaginella densa). In grazed mixed-grass prairies in southwestern Saskatchewan, Henderson and Davis (2014) reported that Horned Lark abundance increased with increasing cover of bare ground, and abundance decreased with increasing litter mass and increasing vegetation height-density. In mixed-grass prairies in south-central Saskatchewan, Horned Lark abundance increased in areas where vegetation was characterized by poor vigor and greater variation in standing dead vegetation and decreased in areas with increased frequency of standing dead vegetation and forbs (Davis and others, 2014).\nIn native grasslands in Saskatchewan, Horned Lark occurrence was related to vegetation at nest sites; occurrence was positively associated with number of contacts of narrow-leaved (<5 millimeters [mm] wide) grasses \u226410 cm tall and was negatively associated with vegetation height (Saskatchewan Wetland Conservation Corporation, 1997) .\nIn north-central North Dakota, mixed-grass prairies occupied by Horned Larks had lower litter depth, taller vegetation, and less coverage of shrubs than unoccupied prairies; occurrence was not related to total live vegetation cover (Grant and others, 2004) . In mixed-grass prairies in western North Dakota, Horned Lark densities declined with increasing litter depth (Chepulis, 2016) . In south-central North Dakota, DNC grasslands occupied by Horned Larks had less grass and forb coverage than unoccupied DNC grasslands (Renken, 1983) . In mixed-grass prairies in south-central North Dakota, Horned Larks preferred silty range sites that were characterized by loamy soils, 1-15 percent slope, moderate grass coverage, less shrub cover, and moderate-to-high litter cover (Messmer, 1990) . Horned Larks also were present at sites that were characterized by shallow, coarse-textured soil, sparse cover, and reduced litter. In another study in mixed-grass prairies in south-central North Dakota, Horned Lark densities were higher in pastures with <10 percent coverage of western snowberry and silverberry (Elaeagnus commutata) than in pastures with 30-80 percent coverage of these shrubs (Arnold and Higgins, 1986) . The largest densities of Horned Larks were on survey transects with the lowest height and density of vegetation, regardless of the presence or absence of shrubs. In South Dakota mixed-grass prairies, Horned Larks were more abundant in early than in late seral stages, and densities were negatively related to litter depth (Fritcher and others, 2004) . In South Dakota, Montana, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas, Horned Larks preferred sites with short grass, emergent vegetation, and moderate vegetation heterogeneity (Wiens, 1973) . At the Colorado site, the species occupied areas where forbs and woody vegetation were sparse and where vertical aspect of vegetation was not very well-developed. In Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming, Horned Lark abundance was negatively correlated with percentage of forb cover, maximum vegetation height, height of emergent forb and shrub cover, horizontal variation in forb and shrub height, and variation in the distance to the nearest forb or shrub (Rotenberry and Wiens, 1980) . In Colorado, Horned Larks were significantly more abundant on plots of upland mixed-grass prairies than in plots of lowland tallgrass prairies or irrigated tame hayland (Bock and others, 1999) . In shortgrass prairies in Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma, Horned Lark occurrence was greatest where <25 percent of the grass was taller than 15 cm and where shrub cover was <1 percent (McLachlan, 2007) . In sagebrush habitats in eastern Washington, Horned Larks were most likely to be at sites with shorter shrub height and higher coverage of perennial grasses (Vander Haegen and others, 2000) . In an Illinois study, Horned Larks only used pastures and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) hayland in early spring (before May 5), when vegetation was short and sparse (Gremaud, 1983) . In Iowa, Horned Lark abundance in road rights-of-way increased with forb coverage (Camp and Best, 1993) .\nHorned Larks use cropland with bare ground; crop residue or stubble; or short, sparse vegetation. In Alberta, vegetation height in cropland was negatively correlated with Horned Lark abundance; stubble count (total number of cut plant stems) and percentage of bare ground were positively correlated with Horned Lark abundance (Martin and Forsyth, 2003) . In Wisconsin agricultural areas, Horned Lark densities were negatively associated with percentage cover of woody cover 0-3 m tall, total percentage of woody cover, number of dead stems 0-3 m tall, total number of dead stems, maximum vegetation height, percentage cover of standing residual vegetation, percentage cover of prostrate residual vegetation, high density of prostrate residual vegetation (that is, proportion of quadrats with high density of prostrate residual vegetation was 0.1), and plant species richness (Sample, 1989) . Densities were positively associated with percentage cover of low-density prostrate residual vegetation (that is, proportion of quadrats with low-density prostrate residual was 0.5) and bare ground. In Iowa, Horned Larks were common in strip-intercropped fields (that is, planting rowcrops, legumes, and small grains in a series of adjacent, narrow strips) (Stallman and , and their use of rowcrop fields significantly increased as the proximity to woody habitats decreased (Gremaud, 1983) . In Wisconsin, Horned Larks were recorded in strip-crop fields (that is, areas subject to erosion that were planted in contour strips such that the rows were approximately perpendicular to the slope to reduce erosion) more than in CRP grasslands, remnant prairie, pasture, and hay fields; Horned Larks were considered an indicator species for stripcrop habitat based on the species' abundance and presence in this habitat (Ribic and others, 2009 ). In Nebraska, however, Horned Larks were absent from areas of extensive corn production, possibly because the timing of planting disrupted nesting activity (Faanes and Lingle, 1995) .\nHorned Larks use native and tame grasslands but have shown no clear preference for either of the two grassland types. Anstey and others (1995) in Saskatchewan and Prescott (1997) and Prescott and Murphy (1996) in Alberta reported that Horned Larks preferred mixed-grass pastures more than tame pastures. In other studies from Saskatchewan and Alberta, however, Horned Larks exhibited no preference between mixed-grass pastures and tame pastures (Sutter and Brigham, 1998; Davis and Duncan, 1999) . In northern mixed-grass prairies in North Dakota, Grant and others (2004) determined that Horned Larks were present in grasslands with lower coverage of tame grasses (Kentucky bluegrass [Poa pratensis], smooth brome [Bromus inermis], and quackgrass [Elymus repens]), and with higher coverage of native grass and forb species than in unoccupied grasslands. Occurrence was not related to coverage of tame legumes. In native pastures in Alberta, ordination analysis indicated that the species used areas with moderate vegetation cover diversity, short grass, and grass moderately uniform in height Area Requirements and Landscape Associations 5 (Prescott and Murphy, 1996) . Principal component analysis indicated that in native pastures the species reached highest abundance in areas of short grass with small forb-to-grass ratios. In tame pastures, highest abundances were in areas with low herbaceous biomass and uniform herbaceous height. In Washington shrubsteppe dominated by sagebrush, Earnst and Holmes (2012) reported Horned Larks were more common in native bunchgrasses and sagebrush-bunchgrass cover types than in cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) associated cover types.\nHorned Larks build nests on the ground and commonly place nests near tufts of grass, cow dung, rocks, small shrubs, mounds of dirt, or other objects in barren areas (Beason and Franks, 1974; Porter and Ryder, 1974; Ryder, 1980; With and Webb, 1993; Hartman and Oring, 2003) . In Colorado, Horned Lark nests were nearly completely exposed to solar radiation during midday and were shaded about 45 percent of the day; most nests had a northeast orientation relative to vegetation or the structure near the nest (With and Webb, 1993) . In California, nests were placed on the north side of objects (for example, tuft of grass, shrub, or rock); nests received shading from the objects, cooling from prevailing northeasterly daytime winds, and protection from prevailing southerly nighttime winds (Hartman and Oring, 2003) . In Colorado, nests were not concealed by vegetation in one study (Creighton, 1974) but were concealed in another study (Boyd, 1976) . In North Dakota, nests typically were in shallow depressions on bare or sparsely vegetated ground (Stewart, 1975) . In a study in Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis)-dominated bunchgrass prairies in Oregon, Kennedy and others (2009) reported no significant relationships between average clutch size or nest concealment and average cover of nonnative vegetation of pastures.\nSeasonal moisture levels, temperature, or extreme weather events may affect the occurrence, abundance, or productivity of Horned Larks. In native mixed-grass prairies of southeastern Alberta, Wiens and others (2008) reported that the best model of Horned Lark occurrence included a negative relationship with conserved soil moisture, which is an estimate of soil moisture on May 1 using a weighted combination of precipitation data from the previous 2 years. In an assessment of BBS data for the conterminous United States, O'Connor and others (1999) reported a negative relationship between Horned Lark abundance and average annual precipitation. Using BBS data from the Badlands and Prairies Bird Conservation Regions, Gorzo and others (2016) reported that Horned Lark abundance did not respond significantly to within-and between-year standardized precipitation and temperature indices. In an assessment of 13 BBS routes in North Dakota, Niemuth and others (2008) examined associations between two indices of regional moisture (that is, the number of prairie potholes containing water during annual May waterfowl surveys and the Palmer Drought Severity Index) and populations of Horned Larks and other grassland birds. Niemuth and others (2008) determined that Horned Lark abundance was negatively associated with the number of prairie potholes containing water in May of the same year. In mixed-grass prairies in western North Dakota, Horned Larks abruptly ended nesting in mid-June during an extreme drought; however, of the eight most common species in this study, the Horned Lark was the only species to increase in abundance during the drought (George and others, 1992) . In shortgrass prairies in northeastern Colorado, nest survival for grassland songbirds that place their nests on the ground in short, sparse vegetation (Horned Lark and McCown's Longspur [Rhynchophanes mccownii] combined) were more strongly and negatively affected by daily storms and the number of dry days than grassland songbirds that place their nests on the ground in taller grasses (Lark Bunting [Calamospiza melanocorys], Chestnut-collared Longspur [Calcarius ornatus], and Western Meadowlark [Sturnella neglecta] combined) (Conrey and others, 2016). Weather also affected clutch sizes, with larger clutches associated with cooler springs and with wet and warmer conditions the week before egg laying. In another study in Colorado shortgrass prairies, overall nest success for Horned Larks was higher in a year of average precipitation than in a year of drought (Skagen and others, 2018) . Horned Larks exhibited greater nesting effort in patch-burned pastures and lesser nesting effort in unburned prairies in the year of average precipitation, whereas the opposite was exhibited during the drought year. In shortgrass prairies in Texas, Horned Lark densities were relatively large during a dry year, nearly doubled in the next year after the drought intensified and became more widespread, and then declined by about onethird of the previous year's densities after the area received more than 6 cm of precipitation and vegetation increased (Wiens, 1974) ."}, {"section_title": "Area Requirements and Landscape Associations", "text": "The male Horned Lark has a multipurpose territory (that is, a defended area in which feeding, mating, and rearing of young occur) (Beason, 1995) . Territory sizes of male Horned Larks are somewhat larger than those of other smaller grassland bird species (for example, wrens and sparrows); size of territories depends on habitat and population densities (Beason, 1995) . In Colorado, Horned Lark territories in lightly grazed shortgrass pastures varied from 0.3 to 1.5 hectares (ha) and averaged 0.7 ha (Boyd, 1976) . Territories in idle and grazed mixed-grass prairies averaged 1.1 and 1.6 ha, respectively (Wiens, 1971) . In another Colorado study, territories in shortgrass pastures that were heavily summer-and wintergrazed varied from 1.0 to 1.7 ha and averaged 1.5 ha (Wiens, , 1971 . In shrubsteppe habitat in Oregon, average male territory sizes were similar in control plots (1.8 ha; range 1.5-2.0 ha) and in manipulated plots that experienced a 31.8percent reduction in shrub coverage (1.9 ha; range 1.3-2.7 ha) (Wiens and others, 1986) . In midwestern cropland, territory sizes varied from 0.6 to 3.1 ha and averaged 1.6 ha (Beason"}, {"section_title": "The Effects of Management Practices on Grassland Birds-Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris)", "text": "and Franks, 1974) . Territories in disked cropland and tame hayland varied in size from 1.0 to 2.5 ha (Beason, 1970) . Bent (1942) reported a Horned Lark territory in Illinois that was only 0.008 ha.\nHorned Larks have shown a variable response to the size of grassland patches; some studies have indicated that the species is area sensitive (that is, preferring large grassland areas over small grassland areas; for example, Riffell and others, 2010) . In Saskatchewan, Horned Lark abundance was not related to grassland patch size (Davis, 2003 (Davis, , 2004 ; however, in 1 of 2 years, Horned Lark occurrence was positively related to the distance to habitat patch edge and negatively related to patch edge-to-area ratio. In Colorado, Horned Larks were more frequently found on interior plots (that is, 200 m from edge) than on edge plots (that is, the interface between suburban development and upland or lowland habitat), but the difference was not significant because of high variation in the numbers of Horned Larks among plots (Bock and others, 1999) . In Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri, Riffell and others (2010) concluded that the Horned Lark was area sensitive and was negatively associated with a fragmentation gradient. In Illinois, Horned Larks were found in small prairie fragments <10 ha in size (Herkert, 1991) . In oak barren and dry sand prairies in Wisconsin, Ribic (2011, 2013) reported Horned Larks and their nests only were on large patches (greater than [>] 45 ha) and were absent from small patches (<10.5 ha).\nGrassland size also may affect Horned Lark productivity. In a Colorado study, Skagen and others (2005) reported that nest survival decreased with increasing grassland patch size; nest survival was not related to distance from an edge or vegetation structure. Of 46 Horned Lark nests, 6 were found within 50 m of an edge between shortgrass prairies and agricultural fields, which were fewer than expected if nest distribution was random or uniform relative to habitat edges. Skagen and others (2005) speculated that these unexpected results reflect the structure of the predator communities in their study area and the ways in which individual predators respond to nests. No studies were identified that investigated a relationship between patch size and rates of brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater).\nLandscape-level habitat characteristics (for example, distance to wetlands, woodland, or cropland) may affect Horned Lark abundance and occurrence. In Saskatchewan, the presence of Horned Larks was negatively related to the number of wetlands within 2.8 square kilometers of point counts and negatively related to the area of woody vegetation; the species was not detected in wetlands or wetland margins (Shutler and others, 2000) . In mixed-grass prairies in southern Alberta, relative abundance of Horned Larks increased as the distance to water increased; abundance was not related to distance to cropland or forage crops (Koper and Schmiegelow, 2006 ). In the same study area, Sliwinski and Koper (2012) reported that Horned Lark abundance increased with distance to water edge and distance to cropland edge. In northern mixed-grass prairies in North Dakota, Grant and others (2004) evaluated Horned Lark response to woody encroachment at both the territory (within 100-m radius) and landscape (within 500-m radius) scales; the species' occurrence declined with increasing coverage of tall shrubs (>1 m in height) and brush (\u22641 m in height) within a 100-m radius. Horned Lark occurrence was not related to the percentage of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) woodland within 500 m of survey points, and Grant and others (2004) concluded that the species was not woodland sensitive. In another North Dakota study, Horned Larks were positively associated with the amount of cropland and negatively associated with the amount of grassland within 200 and 400 m from survey points (Browder and others, 2002) . In shortgrass prairies in Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, Horned Larks responded positively to the amount of grassland within 2,400 m of survey points and negatively to the amount of woodland within 300, 600, 1,200, or 2,400 m of survey points (McLachlan, 2007) . In Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri, Riffell and others (2010) reported that Horned Lark abundance was positively related to the amount of native grass in the surrounding landscape and was negatively related to patch density of CRP habitat, indicating a potential preference for more clumped arrangements of CRP grasslands. In Iowa, Horned Lark abundance was positively correlated with larger amount of rowcrops and small amounts of pasture, alfalfa hayland, and herbaceous fencerows in the landscape (Best and others, 2001) . In Illinois, Horned Larks used more cropland as the amount of cropland in the landscape increased (Graber and Graber, 1963) ."}, {"section_title": "Brood Parasitism by Cowbirds and Other Species", "text": "The Horned Lark is considered an uncommon host of the brood parasitic Brown-headed Cowbird, although Horned Lark nests may be moderately to heavily parasitized by cowbirds in some regions or later in the breeding season (Friedmann, 1963; Hill, 1976) . Shaffer and others (2019) summarized rates of cowbird brood parasitism in grassland bird nests from the literature; rates of cowbird parasitism for Horned Lark nests varied from 0 percent (Maher, 1973; Vander Haegen and Walker, 1999; Gaudet, 2013; Mahoney and Chalfoun, 2016) to 60 percent of 84 nests (Koford and others, 2000) . Horned Lark nests may be multiply parasitized (that is, contain two or more cowbird eggs) by one or more female cowbirds (Peabody, 1899; Robbins, 1949; Friedmann, 1963; Saskatchewan Wetland Conservation Corporation, 1997; Koford and others, 2000; Igl and Johnson, 2007) .\nCowbird parasitism rates of the first clutches of Horned Larks may be smaller than those in subsequent clutches because first Horned Lark clutches may have been laid before the onset of the Brown-headed Cowbird breeding season, which generally extends from early May to late July and peaks from late May to mid-July (Stewart, 1975; Hill, 1976; Igl and Johnson, 1997; Ortega, 1998; Koford and others, 2000) . In North Dakota, no parasitism was observed in 24 clutches laid before May 15, but 60 percent of 84 clutches found after May 15 were parasitized (Koford and others, 2000) . In western Kansas, no parasitism was observed in eight initial clutches laid from mid-March to mid-April, but 64 percent of 22 second clutches were parasitized from mid-May to mid-June (Hill, 1976) ."}, {"section_title": "Breeding-Season Phenology and Site Fidelity", "text": "Migratory Horned Larks begin to arrive on their breeding grounds in large numbers as early as February (later in the northern portions of the species' range) and depart from late October to late November (Maher, 1973; Stewart, 1975; Salt and Salt, 1976; Faanes, 1981; Janssen, 1987) . Peak nesting in North Dakota is from late April to late July (Stewart, 1975) . DuBois (1935) noted two peaks in Horned Lark nesting activity in Montana: one at the end of April and another in early June. Peak nesting activity in Colorado is from April to early May (Creighton, 1974) . Horned Larks raise as many as three broods per season (Peabody, 1899; George, 1952; Maher, 1973 Maher, , 1974 Porter and Ryder, 1974; Boyd, 1976; Salt and Salt, 1976) . In Saskatchewan, the average number of clutches produced per female was estimated at two or three; some individuals produced as many as five clutches (Maher, 1973) . Renesting is common after the failure of an initial nesting attempt (George, 1952; Maher, 1973; Beason, 1995) .\nHorned Larks have exhibited between-year fidelity to mates and to previous breeding areas (George, 1952; Ryder, 1972; Boyd, 1976) . In Colorado, 40 percent of 15 banded adults were recaptured at the banding site the following year (Ryder, 1972) . Two banded males returned to the same study area the year following banding but defended different territories. In another Colorado study, 66 percent of 35 females and 64 percent of 36 males returned the year following banding (Boyd, 1976 ). An additional two males were present on their previous year's territories in February and March but may have perished in a March snowstorm. Only one of the 23 returning males did not use the same territory that was used the previous year. Nearly one-half of the 23 returning females paired with the same mate the year following banding. Six of 136 Horned Larks marked as juveniles returned to breed on the study area (Boyd, 1976) . Also in Colorado, a male Horned Lark was resighted in the same general area in which he was banded 6 years earlier (Clapp and others, 1983) . In Michigan, 50 percent of 12 banded adults returned as breeders the year following banding (George, 1952) ."}, {"section_title": "Species' Response to Management", "text": "Horned Larks typically show a positive response to the early seral stages created or maintained by prescribed and natural fires, which reflects the species' selection of short and sparse vegetative conditions (Knick and others, 2005) . In native rough fescue (Festuca campestris) grasslands in Saskatchewan, Horned Larks were present in small densities (ranging from 0.02 to 0.06 birds per ha) in a plot burned the previous fall and in an unburned plot (Pylypec, 1991) . In a mixed-grass prairie in Saskatchewan that was burned in late summer, peak densities of Horned Larks were recorded 2 years postburn (Maher, 1973) . Also in Saskatchewan mixed-grass prairies, White (2009) reported that Horned Lark abundance was positively affected by burning. During the first year postburn, Horned Lark abundance was smaller in both unburned-grazed and unburned-ungrazed plots than in the burned-grazed pastures. During the second year postburn, Horned Lark abundance was no longer significantly affected by treatment, suggesting that burned pastures became more similar to unburned pastures. Within the same Saskatchewan mixed-grass prairies, Richardson (2012) and Richardson and others (2014) also reported that abundance of Horned Larks was positively associated with burning and grazing; abundance decreased over time in burned-ungrazed pastures. Horned Larks were present in South Dakota mixed-grass areas 1 month postburn but were absent from unburned areas (Huber and Steuter, 1984) . In shortgrass prairies in northeastern Colorado, Horned Lark abundance was unaffected by recent burns or time since burning and did not increase in response to patch-burn grazing (Augustine and Derner, 2015) . In Nebraska, relative abundance of Horned Larks did not differ between an area managed with grazing by American bison and fire and an area managed with grazing by cattle; within a large bison pasture, Horned Lark abundances were not significantly different between burned and unburned areas (Griebel and others, 1998) . In shortgrass prairies in Texas, Horned Lark abundance was almost two times larger on postburned plots than unburned plots; abundance declined through time as burned areas revegetated and litter increased (Roberts and others, 2012) .\nIn Wyoming shrubsteppe, Kerley and Anderson (1995) observed Horned Larks in shrubsteppe that was burned to remove sagebrush. In Oregon shrubsteppe, Horned Lark abundance was higher in postburned areas where shrubs had been removed by prescribed fire (Holmes, 2007) . In Washington shrubsteppe, Horned Lark abundance exhibited no trends before a prescribed fire, but abundance increased significantly and steadily after the fire, indicating a positive effect of fire in this habitat (Earnst and others, 2009 ). In Idaho shrubsteppe, Horned Larks only used experimental plots after these plots had been burned; the species was apparently attracted to the openness or reduced vertical structure of burned patches 8 The Effects of Management Practices on Grassland Birds-Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris) (Petersen and Best, 1987) . In Nevada, Horned Larks were most abundant in recently burned (8-9 years postburn) mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata subspecies [ssp.] vaseyana) communities, and abundance declined with the number of years since a burn (11-20 years postburn) (Holmes and Robinson, 2013) .\nAs with burning, Horned Larks may respond positively to the early seral stages created or maintained by mowing or haying, but this response may be short term and tempered by the regrowth of the vegetation. In Saskatchewan, Horned Larks were common in hayland that was mowed once annually in July; birds were surveyed just before mowing (Dale and others, 1997). Igl and Johnson (2016) assessed the effects of haying on grassland breeding birds in 483 CRP grasslands in 9 counties in 4 States in the northern Great Plains between 1993 and 2008. Horned Larks were recorded in CRP fields in all 9 counties but were most common in the 3 westernmost counties. Compared to breeding densities in CRP grasslands that had been idled for 5 or more years, Horned Lark densities were higher in the first year after haying, but the species' densities returned to idle levels or lower in the second through fourth years after haying. In North Dakota, Horned Larks were absent from mixed-grass prairies that had been hayed during the previous year (Kantrud, 1981) . In Colorado, Horned Larks were not present in hayland that had been flood-irrigated during spring and early summer, mowed during July, and occasionally grazed by cattle during fall and winter others, 1995, 1999) . Horned Larks were the most common breeding bird nesting in mowed and burned plots at a small (260 ha) military airport in Colorado; the species did not nest in unmanaged areas (Carragher and others, 2012). In Minnesota and Wisconsin, Horned Larks were observed in tame hayland (Faanes, 1981) . In Illinois, Horned Larks were present in hayland consisting of a mixture of native and tame vegetation (Graber and Graber, 1963) . In another Illinois study, Horned Larks were common in a tame hayfield (vegetation height was <10 cm) early (March through May) in the breeding season but abandoned the hayfield by early June, presumably because of the growth of vegetation (Beason, 1970) . Horned Larks became abundant in the hayfield after the vegetation was cut (vegetation height after cutting was 10-15 cm) in mid-June, although no territories seemed to have been established. By early July, vegetation in the hayfield had grown to 40 cm tall, and Horned Larks abandoned the field.\nHorned Larks also may respond positively to the changes in vegetation associated with grazing. In Saskatchewan, Horned Lark densities were three times larger in grazed than ungrazed grasslands (Maher, 1973) . In mixed-grass prairies in Saskatchewan, Bleho (2009) reported that Horned Lark abundance was more than twice as large in grazed pastures as in ungrazed pastures. Within these same pastures, Sliwinski (2011) determined that the relative abundance of Horned Larks increased 0.1 bird per plot with an increase in stocking rate. Sliwinski (2011) also reported that Horned Lark abundance was more than twice as large in bison-grazed plots as in cattle-grazed plots, a result that was consistent with Griebel and others (1998) in Nebraska. Conversely, in mixed-grass prairies in southwestern North Dakota, Lueders and others (2006) reported that Horned Larks were common in cattlegrazed plots with moderate stocking rates but were absent from bison-grazed plots with low stocking rates that were sporadically burned. In that same study, Horned Lark densities decreased with distance from cattle water developments (Fontaine and others, 2004) . Vegetation height-density and litter depth increased, and cow-dung coverage and vegetation structural variability decreased with distance from water, presumably because of reduced grazing pressure. In mixedgrass prairie in south-central North Dakota, Horned Larks were found on twice-over rotation pastures (grazing a number of pastures twice per season with about a 2-month rest in between grazing), short-duration pastures (rotating through a grazing schedule of about 1 week grazed and 1 month ungrazed repeated throughout the season), and seasonlong grazing pastures (Messmer, 1990) . Within those same pastures, Salo and others (2004) reported that Horned Larks were observed only in heavily and extremely grazed sites (3.4 animal unit months [AUMs] per ha and 5.8 AUMs per ha, respectively) that were characterized by low visual obstruction, low litter depth, and short vegetation height; the species was not recorded in sites that were lightly or moderately grazed (2.0 AUMs per ha and 2.9 AUMs per ha, respectively). Also in south-central North Dakota, areas grazed by sheep or mowed had fewer shrubs than areas not mowed or grazed; Horned Larks preferred these grazed or mowed areas because of reduced shrub density (Higgins, 1986) . In the northern Great Plains of the United States, Kantrud and Kologiski (1982) reported that Horned Lark densities were highest on heavily grazed mixed-grass prairie on borollic aridisol soils; densities were lowest under light grazing for all soil types. In the Nebraska Sandhills, Horned Lark densities were higher on medium-duration pastures (that is, simple rotation between 7 and 9 pastures) than on short-duration pastures (that is, intensive grazing) and long-duration pastures (that is, continuous grazing) (Kempema, 2007) . In Colorado, Horned Lark nests were observed in moderately to heavily grazed shortgrass prairies (Strong, 1971) . In grazed shortgrass prairies in Colorado, Horned Larks preferred heavily grazed over lightly or moderately grazed pastures (Giezentanner and Ryder, 1969; Ryder and Cobb, 1969; Giezentanner, 1970a Giezentanner, , 1970b Ryder, 1980) . In Colorado, reported that breeding Horned Larks preferred heavily winter-grazed sites more than heavily summer-grazed sites. In Missouri, Horned Larks were most common in heavily grazed native or tame pastures, followed by moderately grazed pastures; the species was absent from idle grasslands and haylands (Skinner, 1974 (Skinner, , 1975 Skinner and others, 1984) . Vegetation that was >30 cm tall was avoided. In bunchgrass prairies in Oregon, Johnson and others (2012) reported that daily nest survival rates for Horned Larks were not related to variation in cattle stocking rates.\nHorned Larks may be present in newly seeded grasslands during the breeding season (Prescott and Murphy, 1999) , but few if any Horned Larks are observed in planted grasslands with well-established vegetation (Renken and Dinsmore, 1987; Dale, 1992 Dale, , 1993 Schwartz, 1993a, 1993b; Hartley 1994a Hartley , 1994b Johnson and Igl, 1995; Patterson and Best, 1996; Best and others, 1997; Herkert, 2009; Igl and others, 2008; Igl, 2009 ). In Alberta, Horned Larks were present in newly seeded DNC grasslands (Prescott and Murphy, 1999) . In Saskatchewan, Horned Larks were absent, or present at smaller densities, in DNC grasslands than in grasslands with short nesting cover (bluegrass-fescue mixture) and idle mixed-grass prairie (Dale, 1992 (Dale, , 1993 Hartley, 1994a Hartley, , 1994b . In Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, Horned Larks were common in PCP grasslands, but occurrence was significantly greater in cropland Davis, 1998, 2001) . The frequency of occurrence of Horned Larks in PCP grasslands was significantly greater in grazed PCP sites than in hayed PCP sites. In North Dakota, Horned Larks were absent from tame DNC grasslands and idle mixedgrass prairies (Renken and Dinsmore, 1987) . In North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Minnesota, Horned Lark densities were significantly higher in CRP grasslands planted to native grasses than those planted to introduced grasses and forbs (Johnson and Schwartz, 1993b) . Horned Larks were absent from wildlife food plots and tree plantings associated with CRP grasslands. In Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, and Nebraska, Horned Larks were not observed in CRP grasslands (Patterson, 1994; Best and others, 1997) . In Iowa, Horned Larks were observed in former cropland that was restored to tallgrass prairie vegetation, but only in the first year after restoration (Olechnowski and others, 2009 ). In CRP grasslands in Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri, Horned Lark abundance was negatively related to vegetation characteristics of CRP grasslands planted to exotic grasses (Riffell and others, 2010) . In Missouri, Horned Larks were present at low densities in CRP fields that were planted to either cool-season or warm-season grasses (McCoy and others, 2001) . Using BBS data from 12 States in the north-central United States, Herkert (2009) reported that Horned Lark populations declined after the establishment of CRP grasslands in the region, indicating that the species did not benefit from planting perennial grassland cover on former cropland. In Kansas, Horned Larks were found in CRP grasslands and grasslands planted to yellow bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum) but were not found in native mixed-grass prairies (Hickman and others, 2006) . In Texas, Horned Larks were 157 percent more abundant in CRP grasslands seeded with mixes of native grasses than in grasslands seeded with monocultures of introduced grasses (Thompson and others, 2009) .\nHorned Larks nest in cultivated fields and commonly use croplands and recently disturbed habitats. In several studies, Horned Larks were more common in cropland than in CRP grasslands (Johnson and Schwartz, 1993a; Patterson, 1994; Johnson and Igl, 1995; Best and others, 1997; Ryan and others, 1998; McLachlan, 2007) . In Alberta, Horned Larks were more abundant in summer fallow fields than in spring cereal or winter wheat (Triticum spp.) crops (Martin and Forsyth, 2003) . The species showed no preference for minimum tilled fields (that is, planting directly into the previous year's stubble) or conventionally tilled fields (that is, multiple cultivations and other mechanical disturbances before planting). In 1 of 2 years, Horned Larks using winter wheat were more productive in minimum than in conventionally tilled fields (Martin and Forsyth, 2003) . In Saskatchewan, Horned Lark occurrence was greater on organic and minimum-tillage cropland fields, followed by conventionally tilled fields; the species was least abundant in DNC grasslands (Shutler and others, 2000) . In North Dakota, Horned Larks were the most common breeding bird nesting in organic, minimum-tillage, and conventional cropland fields (Lokemoen and Beiser, 1997) . Johnson and Igl (1995) estimated that the North Dakota population of Horned Larks would increase by nearly 10 percent if CRP grasslands in North Dakota reverted back to cropland; similarly, Drum and others (2015) reported that Horned Lark populations would increase by 11.5 percent if all CRP is converted to cropland in the Prairie Pothole Region of the United States. In western South Dakota, DeJong and others (2004) reported that Horned Larks were more abundant in cropland fields than in native mixed-grass prairie or fallow cropland fields. In Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma, Horned Lark abundance was largest in dryland agriculture crops, followed by shortgrass prairies and CRP grasslands (McLachlan, 2007) . In Illinois, Horned Lark densities were highest in plowed agricultural fields, followed by fields of alfalfa, red clover (Trifolium pratense), soybeans (Glycine spp.), corn, yellow sweetclover (Melilotus officinalis), small-grain stubble, oats (Avena spp.), ungrazed grassland, fallow, pastures, and hayland (Graber and Graber, 1963) . In another Illinois study, territory densities were higher in hay stubble or corn stubble fields than in plowed fields (Beason and Franks, 1974) ; Beason (1970) reported that Horned Lark territories were densest in disked cropland and recently cut hayfields with vegetation heights of about 10 cm. In Indiana, Horned Larks preferred conventionally tilled corn and soybean fields (that is, fields tilled in the spring before planting) over no-tillage corn and soybean fields (that is, fields untilled between harvests with seeds planted directly into crop residue) (Castrale, 1985) . Tews and others (2013) estimated the annual incidental take of young birds resulting from mechanically induced agricultural operations (including seeding, tillage, harvest, and mowing) in agriculture-dominated Bird Conservation Areas in Canada. Horned Larks were considered the species least likely to be killed by farming operations among the five species examined; the total annual estimated incidental take of young Horned Larks was about 43,000 birds.\nSome pesticides may have deleterious effects on Horned Lark abundance or productivity. In Ontario corn fields, Horned Lark abundance did not differ between pre-and post-applications of the granular insecticides fonofos and terbufos, which were used to control corn rootworm (Diabrotica spp.), or between treated fields and control fields (Knapton and Mineau, 1995) . In Canadian canola (Brassica napus and Brassica rapa) fields, Mineau and others (2005) determined that Horned Lark abundance was negatively correlated with the use of granular insecticides carbofuran and terbufos to control flea beetles (Phyllotreta spp.); Mineau and others (2005) found evidence to suggest that Horned Larks were experiencing regional population-level effects from applications of granular insecticides. In Montana, applications of chlorpyrifos (applied at rates of 0.56 and 1.0 kilogram [kg] in 18.9 liters [L] of water per ha) to control cutworms (Noctuidae) in wheat fields resulted in reduced cholinesterase activity in the brains of Horned Larks compared to a control group (McEwen and others, 1986) . In Wyoming, Horned Lark mortality was observed after fenthion, a chemical used to control mosquitoes (Culicidae), was aerially applied at a rate of 47 grams (g) per ha to an irrigated meadow (DeWeese and others, 1983) . In Colorado, Idaho, North Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming, Horned Lark densities were not affected by the use of malathion, carbaryl applied in oil formulation, and carbaryl bait for grasshopper (Acrididae) control (George and others, 1995) . At the Pawnee National Grassland in Colorado, malathion and toxaphene were applied at rates of 0.6 kg per ha and 1.1 kg per ha, respectively (McEwen and Ells, 1975) . Horned Lark densities on toxaphene plots were about 1 pair per ha before application of insecticides and declined by about 30 percent 17 days after application; densities remained stable on malathion and untreated plots. Nestlings were killed by toxaphene applications. Average toxaphene level of 13 Horned Larks collected 1-28 days postspray for analysis of residue was 5.4 parts per million (ppm). At 58 days, two birds had toxaphene residues of 4.1 and 4.6 ppm. At 85 days, two birds had toxaphene residues of 2.3 and 2.9 ppm. On malathion plots, only Horned Larks collected within 31 hours of spraying contained measurable (greater than or equal to 0.4 ppm) whole-body residues. Four Horned Larks from the untreated area contained 0.5 to 2.0 ppm toxaphene, indicating insecticide drift. No malathion residues were found in two birds from untreated plots.\nIn a multi-State study, McEwen and others (1972) evaluated the effect of several pesticides used for grasshopper control on Horned Larks and other birds. In Montana, numbers of Horned Larks were unaffected by an application rate of 175 g per ha of BAY 77488 (phenylglyoxylonitrile oxime O,O-diethyl phosphorothioate). Rates of 322 and 651 g per ha caused significant declines in Horned Lark abundance between pre-and post-spray censuses. Horned Lark numbers declined significantly on areas sprayed with fenitrothion at application rates of 441 and 672 g per ha. In Wyoming, diazinon applied at 350-560 g per ha caused Horned Lark mortalities and a significant decline in abundance. No significant declines in Horned Larks were reported for Mobam \u00ae (benzo [b]thien-4-yl methyl-carbamate) applied at a rate of 210 g per ha. In Montana and Wyoming, Horned Lark abundance did not decline significantly with Baygon \u00ae (o-isopropoxyphenyl methyl-carbamate) application rates of 140, 210, or 280 g per ha. In New Mexico, toxaphene applied at 1.1 kg per ha caused mortalities in Horned Larks and a decline in abundance. No effects were observed from applications of 448 g per ha carbaryl or 476 g per ha malathion. Horned Lark numbers declined significantly on plots treated with Guthion \u00ae (O,O-dimethyl S-[(4-oxo-1,2, 3-benzotriazin-3(4H)-yl)methyl] phosphorodithioate) at the application rate of 280 g per ha (McEwen and others, 1972) .\nRepellents have been used to deter Horned Larks from consuming seeds and seedling leaves (that is, cotyledons) and from uprooting seedlings (Werner and others, 2015; Schwillinger and Werner, 2016) . Anthraquinone-based repellents have been tested or used to repel Horned Larks from lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and canola crops in the United States (Werner and others, 2015; Schwillinger and Werner, 2016) . Werner and others (2015) observed 38-100 percent feeding repellency among Horned Larks offered wheat (Triticum spp.) seeds treated with 168-3,010 ppm anthraquinone.\nHerbicides applied to control weed or shrub species can indirectly affect Horned Larks by changing vegetation structure and composition. Numbers of Horned Larks in Wyoming shrubsteppe were significantly larger in areas that were treated 20-22 years earlier with the herbicide 2,4-D to remove sagebrush than in areas that were not burned or treated with herbicides (Kerley and Anderson, 1995) . Untreated areas contained larger shrub densities, higher percentage of shrub cover, and taller shrubs than treated areas. Grazing intensity also was lower on untreated areas. In areas managed for lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium) in Maine, Horned Larks were present only in areas recently sprayed with the herbicide hexazinone at a rate of 4 kg per ha (Vickery, 1993) . Horned Larks preferred the sparse vegetation cover.\nUrbanization may limit the abundance of Horned Larks (Haire and others, 2000) . In Colorado, Horned Lark abundance was significantly and negatively associated with an urban index, which was calculated by summing the percentage of urban vegetation and percentage of buildings and paved area within a landscape consisting of the city of Boulder, Colorado, and 1 km surrounding the Boulder Open Space (Haire and others, 2000) . In a second study around Boulder, Lenth and others (2006) evaluated differences in avian density between clustered and dispersed housing developments; Horned Lark densities were significantly higher in undeveloped areas than in clustered developments or dispersed developments. In Colorado, the Horned Lark is struck by military and civilian aircraft more frequently than any other species (Carragher and others, 2012).\nSeveral studies have evaluated Horned Lark response to roads and trails. In mixed-grass prairies in southern Alberta, Horned Lark abundance was not related to distance to roads (Koper and Schmiegelow, 2006; Sliwinski and Koper, 2012) . In lightly to moderately grazed mixed-grass prairies in Saskatchewan, Horned Lark abundance was not significantly different along trails (that is, single pair of wheel ruts visually indistinct from surrounding habitat in terms of plant structure and composition) than along roads (that is, traveling surfaces with adjacent drainage ditches planted to smooth brome and ending with a fence 11-18 m from the traveling surface) (Sutter and others, 2000) . In Wyoming shrubsteppe, Horned Larks were more abundant within 100 m of gas-well access roads than 100-200 m from the roads, ostensibly because of reduced shrub cover along the road edge (Ingelfinger and Anderson, 2004) . Clark and Karr (1979) studied the effects of roads and interstate highways on the density of Horned Larks in central Illinois. Densities of Horned Larks increased with distance from the road for both county highways and interstate highways; Horned Lark densities were higher along county highways than along interstate highways.\nHorned Larks typically are tolerant of oil and gas development, especially in recently disturbed areas. In mixed-grass prairies in southern Alberta, Horned Lark densities were not significantly affected by shallow gas-well densities or by distance to shallow gas wells, oil wells, or roads (Daniel, 2015) . In Saskatchewan and Alberta, Horned Lark abundance tended to increase near oil and gas development, but the trend was not significant (Linnen, 2008) . In mixed-grass pastures in Saskatchewan, Horned Lark abundance was highest at a northern study site with higher natural gas well densities, shorter vegetation, sparser litter and grass cover, and fewer forbs Kalyn Bogard and Davis, 2014) . Horned Larks did not respond to natural gas well density in a southern study site, apparently because the southern site provided more suitable habitat (that is, short, sparse vegetation with a litter depth of 6 mm) than the northern site. In southeastern Alberta, Horned Lark abundance decreased with an increase in natural gas well density and an increase in the percentage of live grasses and forbs; Horned Lark abundance increased at low percent coverage of crested wheatgrass (Rodgers, 2013; Rodgers and Koper, 2017) . In southwestern Saskatchewan, Gaudet (2013) evaluated the effects of natural gas development on density and productivity of Horned Larks. Horned Lark densities declined as distance to compressor stations increased and as percent plot disturbance increased. Average distance of Horned Lark nests to the nearest gas well was significantly greater than average distance to random points. Horned Larks fledged more young per successful nest closer to compressor stations. In mixed-grass prairies in western North Dakota, Horned Lark densities were not related to densities of unconventional oil wells or roads within 1.6 km of study plot boundaries (Chepulis, 2016) . In shrubsteppe habitat in western Wyoming, Gilbert and Chalfoun (2011) evaluated songbird abundance across gradients of oil and natural gas development at three locations. At the youngest site, Gilbert and Chalfoun (2011) determined that Horned Lark abundance increased with increasing well density. At the oldest site, which contained the least amount of human activity (that is, drilling rigs and vehicle traffic), Horned Larks had the smallest overall abundance.\nOptimal sites for wind-energy development generally overlap with Horned Lark habitat. In Wyoming, Mahoney and Chalfoun (2016) examined reproductive success of Horned Larks at three wind facilities in mixed-grass and shortgrass prairies. Size-adjusted mass of Horned Lark nestlings was weakly negatively related to turbine density. In 1 of 2 years, nest survival decreased 55 percent as turbine density increased from 10 to 39 turbines within 2 km of a nest. In the second year, nest survival was best predicted by a combination of vegetation height, distance to shrub edge, and turbine density. The average number of Horned Lark fledglings from successful nests, however, was slightly larger at wind farms, averaging one additional fledging for every two nests (Mahoney and Chalfoun, 2016) . Erickson and others (2014) summarized data from 116 studies from the United States and Canada on bird fatalities caused by collision with turbines at wind-energy facilities. Horned Larks constituted the largest proportion of small-passerine fatalities, with fatalities being nearly twice as high as any other species. Zimmerling and others (2013) analyzed 43 published and unpublished reports on the impacts from development and operation of wind turbines in Canada; the most frequently reported fatalities were Horned Larks. Most fatalities were in the spring, when male Horned Larks sing during aerial courtship displays as high as 250 m above the ground, potentially bringing them into contact windturbine blades. Loss and others (2013) reviewed published and unpublished reports on collision mortality at monopole wind turbines (that is, with a solid tower rather than a lattice tower) in the contiguous United States; Horned Larks were one of the most common species discovered during bird mortality surveys at monopole wind turbines. At a large wind facility in Washington and Oregon, Erickson and others (2004) reported that Horned Larks were the most commonly observed fatality for an individual bird species, with an estimated fatality rate of 0.89 bird per turbine; Erickson and others (2004) reported no apparent displacement from turbines for this species during the breeding season. Beston and others (2016) developed a prioritization system to identify avian species most likely to experience population declines in the United States from wind facilities based on their current conservation status and their expected risk from wind turbines. The Horned Lark scored a 2.55 out of nine based on 428 species evaluated; 6.18 percent of the Horned Lark breeding population in the United States are exposed to wind facilities."}, {"section_title": "Management Recommendations from the Literature", "text": "Habitat use by Horned Larks is affected by local and landscape features. McLachlan (2007) recommended that natural resource managers should recognize the potential effect of landscape features along with local habitat conditions when developing conservation plans and prescribing management activities. Some studies have indicated that the Horned Lark is an area sensitive species, preferring larger grasslands over smaller ones (for example, McLachlan, 2007; Riffell and others, 2010) . Other studies did not report area sensitivity for this species (for example, Davis, 2003 Davis, , 2004 . Given the Horned Lark's propensity to use sparsely vegetated grasslands and agricultural lands, the amount of cropland in the landscape may have a positive effect on Horned Lark occurrence and abundance in some portions of the species' breeding range (Graber and Graber, 1963; Best and others, 2001) .\nBurning, mowing, grazing, or herbicide applications can be used interchangeably to create or maintain short, sparse vegetation in grasslands that Horned Larks prefer (Skinner, 1974 (Skinner, , 1975 Huber and Steuter, 1984; Skinner and others, 1984; McLachlan, 2007; White, 2009; Richardson, 2012) . The benefits of these management practices may be short term because of the regrowth of the vegetation within the breeding season or in the following breeding season (Beason, 1970; Holmes and Robinson, 2013; Igl and Johnson, 2016) . In Saskatchewan mixed-grass prairies, prescribed fire intervals of 5 years would maintain some habitat suitable for Horned Larks, although annual patch-burns would increase habitat heterogeneity (Richardson, 2012) .\nLivestock grazing intensity may be managed through stocking rates and season of use. In Saskatchewan mixed-grass prairies, Sliwinski (2011) suggested that pastures that are moderately grazed by cattle will create habitat heterogeneity; continuously applied moderate stocking rates will result in habitat similar to that created by high stocking rates favored by Horned Larks. In the same Saskatchewan mixed-grass prairies, Bleho (2009) suggested that light-to-moderate grazing can improve habitat for Horned Larks. In a North Dakota study in mixed-grass prairies, however, Horned Larks were not found in light-to-moderate grazing treatments and were only found in heavily grazed or extremely grazed areas (Salo and others, 2004) . In northeast Oregon, Johnson and others (2012) found no evidence that increased stocking rates increased risk of nest predation, suggesting grasslands managed with livestock grazing may be compatible with grassland bird conservation. In tallgrass prairies and other mesic areas, moderate grazing may increase habitat patchiness and bird diversity (Skinner, 1974 (Skinner, , 1975 Ryder, 1980; Skinner and others, 1984) .\nThe Horned Lark tends to avoid areas with extensive woody vegetation but will tolerate the presence of some woody cover (Sample, 1989) . The proximity to woody vegetation and other habitats within the landscape or the amount of woody vegetation within grasslands may negatively affect Horned Lark occurrence and abundance (Davis, 2003 (Davis, , 2004 Koper and Schmiegelow, 2006; McLachlan, 2007; Sliwinski and Koper, 2012) , and thus limiting the planting of trees and shrubs on the edges of grasslands and limiting the encroachment of woody vegetation into grasslands will benefit Horned Larks. In mixed-grass prairies that have experienced heavy woody encroachment, Grant and others (2004) suggested that managers focus initial restoration efforts on grasslands with <20 percent woodland encroachment because these grasslands would have the most immediate and lasting conservation benefit for grassland birds. Management practices, such as mowing or grazing by sheep, which modify shrub coverage, may benefit Horned Larks (Arnold and Higgins, 1986) . Rosenstock and Van Riper (2001) suggested that removal or reduction of invasive oneseed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) will improve breeding habitat for Horned Larks in northeast Arizona; Horned Larks were most abundant at study sites that had not been invaded by juniper. In shrubsteppe habitats, the removal of shrubs with prescribed fires may increase Horned Lark abundance (Holmes, 2007) . In Missouri tallgrass prairies, Skinner and others (1984) recommended spring burns to reduce coverage of woody vegetation.\nPesticides may indirectly or directly affect Horned Larks. Herbicides applied to control weeds or shrubs may indirectly affect Horned Larks by changing vegetation structure and composition. For example, in a sandplain grassland in southern Maine (Vickery and others, 1999) and shrubsteppe in Wyoming (Kerley and Anderson, 1995) , Horned Lark abundance increased after herbicide use. Insecticides, however, may have deleterious, direct effects (for example, higher mortality or lower productivity) on Horned Larks (McEwen and Ells, 1975; DeWeese and others, 1983; others, 1972, 1986; Mineau and others, 2005) . When invertebrate pest management is required, McEwen and others (1972) highlighted the importance of applying only rapidly degrading chemicals of low toxicity to nontarget organisms at the smallest application rates possible. Pest outbreaks can be avoided by maintaining rangeland in good condition; overgrazed and drought-affected areas tend to be more prone to insect outbreaks.\nStudies on the effects of roads and road development on Horned Larks have shown that the impacts may be either positive or negative for Horned Larks or show no impact (Clark and Karr, 1979; Ingelfinger and Anderson, 2004; Koper and Schmiegelow, 2006; Sliwinski and Koper, 2012) . Bock and others (1999) recommended reducing the amount of grassland edge near suburban interfaces. Clark and Karr (1979) indicated that future road construction programs should consider the effects of roads on Horned Larks and other wildlife in highway rights-of-way and within 500 m from the rights-of-way.\nThe number of Horned Lark fatalities associated with wind-energy developments typically is larger than fatalities of other small passerines at these developments (Loss and others, 2013; Zimmerling and others, 2013; Erickson and others, 2014) .
