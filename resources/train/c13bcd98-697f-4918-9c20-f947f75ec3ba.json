[{"section_title": "Introduction Background", "text": "Sea level rise is one of the most evident and problematic consequences of global climate change. As the earth's climate warms, sea levels increase primarily from thermal expansion of a warmer ocean and melting land ice (NRC, 2012). In California, sea level rise (SLR) will threaten and directly affect vulnerable coastal ecosystems, bays and estuaries, coastal communities and infrastructure due to increased flooding, gradual inundation, and erosion of the coastal shorelines, cliffs, bluffs and dunes (Russell and Griggs, 2012). If sea level continues to rise at present rates, impacts identified in this report could take decades or longer to occur. However, a troublesome aspect of climate change and the rapid warming of the earth's atmosphere and ocean is the potential for SLR to accelerate to high rates over a short period of time, in which case the identified impacts could happen within a much shorter period (years to decades). In 2008, California Governor Schwarzenegger issued Executive Order S-13-08 directing state agencies to plan for SLR and corresponding impacts. Following the executive order, planning for the inevitable effects of SLR to California's communities and regions has become a priority for many local coastal governments and state agencies. Humboldt Bay is located in northernmost California approximately 160 km south of the Oregon border and 420 km north of San Francisco (Figure 1-1). The bay contains numerous aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems that support a diversity of wildlife species, Native American cultures, a number of small towns and communities (e.g. Eureka and Arcata), and an economy dependent on natural resources (Schlosser et al., 2009). Beginning in 2006, with funding from the State Coastal Conservancy (SCC), a group of local scientists, resource managers, and stakeholders established a Science Advisory Team to explore how ecosystem-based management could be applied to Humboldt Bay. In 2008, with funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Advisory Team undertook a formal strategic planning effort in Humboldt Bay. A culmination of these efforts was the Humboldt Bay Strategic Plan and the formation of the Humboldt Bay Initiative (Schlosser et al., 2009). The strategic plan identified climate change and associated SLR as a very high threat to Humboldt Bay, and further noted that these threats were not well understood nor had they been assessed."}, {"section_title": "3", "text": "The project component to identify additional SLR vulnerabilities in Humboldt Bay was led by Northern Hydrology and Engineering (NHE) and consisted of the following work products: 1. SLR hydrodynamic modeling to develop inundation vulnerability maps of areas surrounding Humboldt Bay vulnerable to inundation from existing and future sea levels (described in this report). 2. A seamless topographic/bathymetric digital elevation model (DEM) "}, {"section_title": "Purpose and Scope", "text": "Sea level rise already threatens many areas surrounding Humboldt Bay that are currently protected by the natural shoreline, levees, and road or railroad grades from flooding by extreme high tides and storm events, and many more vulnerable areas will be threatened by SLR within the century. If SLR rates accelerate as projected, these vulnerable areas could see routine flooding within the next few decades, particularly if levees or other shoreline barriers fail. The purpose of this project is to (1) conduct detailed hydrodynamic modeling in Humboldt Bay to determine average high water levels and extreme high water level event probabilities for existing sea levels and SLR scenarios, and (2) develop inundation maps of areas surrounding the bay that are vulnerable to inundation from existing and future sea levels. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide the APWG and general public information on how SLR may affect high water levels in Humboldt Bay, including inundation vulnerability maps in a user-friendly format. For the remainder of this study, the Humboldt Bay shoreline refers to the natural shoreline, and the portions of shoreline consisting of levees, road and railroad grades, and other man-made barriers or structures."}, {"section_title": "Humboldt Bay Physical Description", "text": "Humboldt Bay can best be described as a tidally driven, multi-basin, bar-built, coastal lagoon ( Figure 1-2), and is the second largest enclosed bay in California (Costa, 1982;Costa and Glatzel, 2002;Schlosser and Eicher, 2012). The bay is separated from the Pacific Ocean by two long, narrow sand spits (North Spit and South Spit), and is connected to the ocean by the stabilized, twin-jettied Entrance Channel. The first attempts to stabilize the entrance began in 1889, and dredging of interior harbor channels began as early as 1881 (Costa and Glatzel, 2002). Humboldt Bay contains three distinct bays (Figure 1-2), Entrance Bay, North (or Arcata) Bay, and South Bay (Costa 1982;Costa and Glatzel, 2002). Entrance Bay is connected to the ocean through the Entrance Channel, which is maintenance dredged by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. South Bay is directly connected to Entrance Bay through a natural constriction and the dredged Fields Landing Channel. North Bay is connected to Entrance Bay via the long, narrow dredged North Bay Channel. The North Bay Channel splits into the dredged Samoa and Eureka Channels, just before connecting with North Bay. Humboldt Bay is relatively shallow, with 70% of the bay comprised of tidal mud flats that are exposed during low tide (Costa, 1982). The mud flats are predominately in North and South Bays, and only Entrance Bay and the lower portions of North Bay Channel maintain an  (Costa, 1982). The drainage basin of Humboldt Bay is approximately 578 km 2 , a relatively small basin for a bay of its size. Although a number of small streams flow into the bay, the annual freshwater input to the bay is small, on the order of the tidal prism (Costa, 1982). The tidal prism is approximately 9.63 to 9.91 x 10 7 m 3 during a spring tide range and about 70% less over a mean tide range (Costa and Glatzel, 2002). North Bay contributes approximately 50% of the tidal prism, and about 30% for South Bay. Humboldt Bay tides are mixed semidiurnal, and show tidal amplification and phase lag with distance from the entrance (Costa, 1982;Costa and Glatzel, 2002). Due to the small freshwater inflow, the general circulation of Humboldt Bay is dominated by tidally driven flows modified by the bathymetry (Costa, 1982), with estuarine conditions typically only found within the small stream mouths and slough channels (Costa and Glatzel, 2002). The general circulation patterns can be affected on daily and seasonal time scales by waves entering through Entrance Channel (primarily influencing Entrance Bay), internally generated wind waves, and density differences (Costa, 1982). Humboldt Bay is typically well mixed vertically, and normally consists of unstratified marine water (Costa and Glatzel, 2002)."}, {"section_title": "Previous Humboldt Bay Sea Level Rise Mapping", "text": "A previous study conducted by the Pacific Institute (Herberger et al., 2009) mapped flood and coastal erosion hazard zones along the California coast for year 2000 existing conditions and year 2100 with 1.4 m (55 inches) of SLR based on the Cayan et al. (2009) SLR estimate for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A2 emission scenario. Phillip Williams and Associates Ltd. (2009), now ESA PWA, provided the coastal erosion hazards assessment, and compiled a statewide Base Flood Elevations (BFE) layer to support the flood hazard analysis conducted by Pacific Institute. As defined by FEMA, the BFE is the 1% (100-yr) annual chance flood elevation, and for coastal areas is the 1% total water level (TWL) which consists of the still water elevation (SWL) and wave effects. The BFE layer consisted of published FEMA BFEs for California, with data gaps filled using professional judgment and/or local knowledge and experience. The Pacific Institute flood hazard maps developed for Humboldt Bay used a single water elevation value (bathtub approach) to map flood zones in the bay. Review of the BFE layer (available at http://www2.pacinst.org) indicates that the mapped year 2000 BFE value was 2.90 m (9.5 ft) referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88), and the year 2100 BFE value would have been 4.3 m (2.9 m + 1.4 m SLR). Since the California Coastal DEM was not available until 2012, it was assumed that the flood hazard maps produced by Pacific Institute in 2009 for Humboldt Bay relied on the USGS National Elevation Dataset 10-m resolution topography, which has a stated vertical accuracy of \u00b17. 5 m (Herberger et al., 2009)."}, {"section_title": "General SLR Hydrodynamic Modeling and Inundation Mapping Approach", "text": "The Humboldt Bay SLR modeling and inundation mapping conducted in this study was built from the general approach used by Knowles (2010) for similar work done in San Francisco Bay. A hydrodynamic model was used to predict water levels within the existing shoreline of Humboldt Bay for five SLR scenarios: year 2012 existing sea levels and half-meter SLR increments of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 m. The hydrodynamic model was forced by a 100-yr long stationary hourly sea level height series developed for Crescent City tide gauge. The 100-yr hourly series accounts for astronomical tides, and varying effects including wind, sea level pressure, and El Ni\u00f1o variability. The 100-yr series was incremental adjusted for each halfmeter SLR scenario. Each hydrodynamic model simulation produced 100 years of predicted water levels throughout the bay. Estimates of average high water levels and annual exceedance probabilities of extreme high water levels were determined bay-wide for each of the five SLR scenarios. Using the model results, inundation vulnerability maps of areas surrounding Humboldt Bay vulnerable to inundation from existing and future sea levels were produced for the estimated average water levels and extreme high water level events from the five SLR scenarios. The inundation maps identified areas surrounding Humboldt Bay currently protected from inundation by the shoreline, levees or other barriers, but are vulnerable and at risk to flooding from future sea levels. The inundation vulnerability mapping relied on the recent high resolution California Coastal DEM (PWA, 2014)."}, {"section_title": "Disclaimer", "text": "The sea level rise modeling, analysis, and inundation vulnerability mapping conducted in this study are intended for use as planning-level tools to illustrate the areas surrounding Humboldt Bay vulnerable to existing and future sea levels.

These large tectonic motions along the southern CSZ create the highly variable and opposing sea level trends observed between Humboldt Bay and Crescent City. Recent estimates of land subsidence by Patton et al. (2014) indicate that Humboldt Bay has the highest local sea level rise rate in California, approximately two to three times higher than the long-term global rate. In contrast, the land in Crescent City (109 km north) is uplifting faster than long-term global sea level rise, which causes a negative or decreasing local sea level rise rate. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of global and regional sea level change, with an emphasis on the physical processes locally effecting sea levels in the Humboldt Bay region. This overview relies on the climate and sea level change literature, specifically the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, the 2012 National Resource Council (NRC) Sea Level Rise for the Coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington report, and the scientific and technical literature specific to the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) coast (Northern California (north of Cape Mendocino), Oregon and Washington), and the Humboldt Bay region."}, {"section_title": "General Concepts and Definitions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mean Sea Level", "text": "Mean sea level (MSL) is the average ocean level at a specific location over a known period of time.

Thermosteric refers to density changes from ocean temperature changes, while halosteric defines density changes from changes in ocean salinity. Long-term reconstructions of GMSL change (e.g. Church and White, 2011) generally rely on the longest tide gauge records located on relatively stable land (Zervas, 2013), which are then adjusted for ocean basin changes, such as the land motion associated with the global glacial isostatic adjustment."}, {"section_title": "Regional Mean Sea Level", "text": "Regionally, sea level change may differ from GMSL due to meteorological effects (for example storms) and natural climate variability, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation, which alters surface winds, ocean heating, and ocean currents (NRC, 2012;Church et al., 2013).

Examples of VLM include glacial isostatic adjustment, plate tectonic land-level changes (seismic and interseismic), and land subsidence (e.g. soil compaction and groundwater extraction). Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is the deformation of the earth in response to melting of the large continental ice sheets that covered much of North America and Europe (Peltier, 1990), during the last glacial maximum that occurred about 20,000 years ago (Kominz, 2001). Estimates of GMSL rise trends are generally adjusted for vertical GIA using GIA models. For example, Peltier (2002Peltier ( , 2009 estimates the global average GIA at -0.3 mm/yr (a downward VLM). Regional and local VLM, such as tectonic land-level changes, can be much larger than those associated with GIA models (Zervas, 2013). Researchers have documented interseismic tectonic uplift rates from plate locking along the CSZ that are an order-of-magnitude greater than the global GIA rate (Mitchell et al., 1994;Burgette et al., 2009). Along the PNW coast, the tectonic land-level changes associated with the CSZ strongly affect RSL changes, indicating both submergent and emergent stretches of coast (Komar et al., 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Global Climate System Change", "text": "In 2013, the IPCC completed its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5).

There is high confidence, based on proxy records (e.g. salt marsh sediments) and instrumental sea level data, that GMSL rise increased in the late 19th to early 20th century from relatively low rates over the previous two millennia to higher rates today (Church et al., 2013). As noted earlier, sea levels are increasing globally due to thermal expansion from ocean warming and increases in ocean mass from melting land ice caused by warming of the earth's climate. Reconstructions of late 19th, 20th and early 21st century GMSL rise have been made by numerous investigators (e.g. Jevrejeva et al., 2008;Church and White, 2011;Ray and Douglas, 2011) using tide gauge records, starting in the late 1800s, and the more recent satellite-based radar altimeter measurements since the early 1990s.

ENSO is the dominant cause of sea level variability along the U.S. west coast (Komar et al., 2011;Bromirski et al., 2011;NRC, 2012), with higher sea levels during the warmer El Ni\u00f1o phase, and lower levels during the cooler La Ni\u00f1a phase (Figure 2-7). Strong El Ni\u00f1o events effect wind and ocean circulation, reducing upwelling and producing warmer than normal ocean temperatures along the U.S. west coast, which can raise mean winter water levels by 0.2 to 0.3 m for several months (Komar et al, 2011). This winter seasonal increase is larger than the 20th century GMSL rise of 0.17 m (Table 2-1). El Ni\u00f1o events are generally associated with a more active winter storm period along the U.S. west coast (NRC, 2012). Seasonal coastal current and wind patterns (e.g. upwelling) also produce seasonal variations in sea level heights (known as the average seasonal cycle) due to ocean temperature and density changes (Komar et al., 2011).

The causes of the PDO are not well understood. During the warm (positive) phase the eastern Pacific Ocean warms and the western portion cools, and during the cool (negative) phase the opposite pattern develops. The NRC (2012) report noted that ENSO and PDO are not independent, with ENSO influencing the PDO (e.g. Newman et al., 2003), and the PDO  Vimont et al., 2009). For example, both the 1982-83 and 1997-98 large El Ni\u00f1o events correspond to the late 1970s to late 1990s warm (positive) phase of the PDO (Figure 2-7). The PDO and the corresponding regional and basin-scale wind stress patterns have been associated with decadal to multidecadal sea level variability along the U.S. west coast (e.g. Bromirski et al., 2011;NRC, 2012). Bromirski et al. (2011) attributes suppression of the ReMSL trend along the U.S. west coast since the 1980s (Figure 2 -6) to changes in the wind stress curl associated with the PDO regime shift in the mid-1970s (Figure 2-7). Furthermore, the regime shift from warm to cold phases in the late 1990s and late 2000s (Figure 2-7) may lead to a shift in the wind stress patterns and a resumption of ReMSL rise along the U.S. west coast (Bromirski et al., 2011)."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Fingerprints", "text": "Another process affecting ReMSL is the gravitational pull of the large glacier and ice sheet masses that draws ocean water closer and raises sea levels near the ice masses (NRC, 2012). As the land ice melts, water enters the ocean raising GMSL. However, the melting land ice decreases the gravitational pull on the ocean water due to the decrease in ice mass. The loss of modern land ice also causes land to uplift at the ice masses, but these land-level changes from modern ice melting are too far from the U.S. west coast to have an effect on sea level change (NRC, 2012). In contrast, the loss of the ancient ice sheets during the last glacial maximum caused the entire earth's land and ocean basins to deform (glacial isostatic deformation). The gravitational and deformational responses to land ice melting and mass redistribution in the oceans produce regional patterns of sea level change known as sea level fingerprints (NRC, 2012;Church et al., 2013). The overall net effect of these fingerprints is that ReMSL or RSL will drop near the melting ice masses, and increase proportional to the distance from the ice masses. The NRC (2012) report estimated the sea level fingerprint effects of the Alaska, Greenland, and Antarctica ice mass loss on the U.S. west coast for the 1992-2008 period. The estimated uniform sea level rise, without sea level fingerprints, along the U.S. west coast from the three ice masses was 0.79 mm/yr. Assuming fingerprint effects, the adjusted sea level rise rate at Neah Bay, OR was 0.46 mm/yr (42% reduction), at Eureka, CA was 0.60 mm/yr (24% reduction), and at Santa Barbara, CA was 0.68 mm/yr (14% reduction). The overall effect of the sea level fingerprints was to reduce sea level change from the uniform ice mass loss rate of 0.79 mm/yr along the U.S. west coast in a north to south direction."}, {"section_title": "Regional Sea Level Rise along the Cascadia Subduction Zone", "text": "To better understand the pattern of interseismic locking on the CSZ and quantify uplift rates, Burgette et al. (2009) assessed land elevation changes from benchmark survey records and sea level change at six NOAA tide gauges along the coasts of Oregon and northernmost California. The tide gauges extended from Crescent City, CA to Astoria, OR. To infer tectonic uplift rates (i.e. VLM) from the RSL change determined at each tide gauge site, a ReMSL rise rate was added to each sites RSL rate. Burgette et al. (2009) determined an average sea level rise rate of 2.28 \u00b1 0.20 mm/yr that represents an approximate 20th century ReMSL rise rate for the PNW coast along the CSZ. The ReMSL rate was based on the Seattle tide gauge record, which Burgette et al. (2009) assumed was tectonically stable, and a procedure between the six CSZ tide gauge sites and the Seattle record that generated the single regional value of 2.28 mm/yr over the observation period of the CSZ tide gauge records (~1925 to 2006). As noted by Burgette et al. (2009) "}, {"section_title": "Past and Present Relative Sea Level Rise", "text": "Tide gauges measure RSL change, the combined effects of sea level change and VLM. The measured sea level change includes (1) GMSL change, (2) ocean dynamic processes, natural climate variability, and sea level fingerprint effects that create ReMSL patterns, and other shortterm local climate variability such as storm surge, wind stress effects, and changes in barometric pressure. As noted earlier, the VLM is responsible for most of the differences in RSL trends between regional tide gauge observations (Zervas, 2009). Although the Crescent City and Humboldt Bay (North Spit) tide gauges are only separated by 109 km, the RSL trends for these gauges are in opposing directions (Figure 2-8), with Crescent City RSL having a downward trend while North Spit RSL has an upward trend. The relatively large oscillations in RSL (monthly MSL values) around the RSL trend line are due to short-term weather variability (e.g. storms), natural climate variability (e.g. ENSO and PDO), and the average seasonal cycle as described previously. The downward RSL trend at Crescent City indicates this section of coast is emerging, with an uplift rate greater than the current GMSL and ReMSL rise rates. In contrast, the North Spit RSL trend is greater than the GMSL or ReMSL rise rates, indicating that Humboldt Bay is submergent, and in fact, has the highest RSL rise rate in California.  The average seasonal cycle represents the long-term average repeatable variation in sea levels from the effects of seasonal cycles in climate patterns, ocean circulation, ocean volume density (steric) changes, and river discharge, with the steric density changes from temperature and salinity changes being the dominant factor (Zervas, 2009). In the Humboldt Bay region and PNW, winter ocean temperatures are warmer and thus less dense than summer temperatures and density, primarily due to upwelling that brings the deeper colder ocean water to the surface (Komar et al., 2011). The resulting average seasonal cycle (Figure 2-9) has higher MSL during the winter period and lower levels in the summer. In general, the seasonal cycle for Crescent City and North Spit tide gauges are similar, with a total average seasonal difference in water levels of approximately 17 cm. To demonstrate how El Ni\u00f1o events can affect average sea levels over extended periods, the mean monthly MSL for the 1983 El Ni\u00f1o are included on Figure 2-9, which shows that average monthly winter levels during this large El Ni\u00f1o were about 27 cm higher than normal. Hydrodynamic modeling has shown that horizontal temperature gradients develop in the spring and summer periods in Humboldt Bay (Anderson, 2010). As solar radiation heats the bay water, horizontal gradients in temperature develop between the cold ocean water entering the bay Model results show that North Bay and South Bay can be 4.1\u00b0 C and 2.5\u00b0 C warmer, respectively, than the colder water in Entrance Bay for the spring and summer months ( Figure  2-10). This persistent temperature gradient in Humboldt Bay helps explain the elevated North Spit seasonal cycle values compared to Crescent City for the months of April to October (Figure 2-9). Even though the North Spit tide gauge is located in Entrance Bay and exposed daily to cold ocean water, the warmer less dense water in North and South Bays during the spring and summer still influences the North Spit seasonal cycle compared to Crescent City, whose orientation directly exposes the tide gauge to colder, denser ocean water during this period. The seasonal temperature patterns simulated in North and South Bays appear to be opposite to the PNW Ocean, with warmer temperatures in the late spring, summer, and early fall periods than in the winter. Although not directly assessed in this study, the average seasonal cycle for North Bay and South Bay may be opposite of the North Spit and Crescent City tide gauges, due to the solar heating and warmer water temperatures in the shallow bays where thermal expansion could produce higher water levels during the warmer months.  (Anderson, 2010). Results are for 24-hr low-pass filtered (solid lines) and 30-day low-pass filtered (dashed lines) volume averaged temperatures for each distinct bay.   The analysis approach relied on the long-term Crescent City tide gauge (~81 years), and the general approach of Mitchell et al. (1994) and Burgette et al. (2009) to determine RSL and VLM rates at the Humboldt Bay tide gauges, which all have records less than 40 years in length and are considered too short to directly determine rates. The analysis approach also relied on the 20th century ReMSL rise rate of 2.28 mm/yr (Burgette et al., 2009) for the PNW. Updated estimates of VLM and RSL rates for the Crescent City and Humboldt Bay tide gauges (Patton et al., 2014) are provided in Table 2-3. For a detailed discussion of the tide gauge analysis methods and interpretation of results, reference can be made to the Patton et al. (2014) work. Vertical land motion rates determined from the tide gauge analysis (Table 2-3) generally agreed within 1 mm/yr of the land-level VLM rates derived from the benchmark survey analysis (Patton et al., 2014). The north to south down trending VLM gradient controls the RSL rate variation in Humboldt Bay, with the highest rates of VLM in south Humboldt Bay at the Hookton Slough gauge. Adding the ReMSL of 2.28 mm/yr to the VLM rates in Table 2-3 provide estimates of RSL rise rates for Humboldt Bay. For example, RSL rise rates for Mad River Slough, North Spit, and Hookton Slough are approximately 3.4, 4.6 and 5.8 mm/yr, respectively. The tectonic deformation in Humboldt Bay increases the RSL rates above the ReMSL rate of 2.28 mm/yr, with both the North Spit and Hookton Slough RSL rates being more than twice the regional rate. These higher RSL rise rates indicate that increases in the GMSL and ReMSL will affect Humboldt Bay faster than other parts of U.S. west coast; and within the bay, the south end will be affected sooner than the north end."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Rise Trends at the North Spit and Crescent City Tide Gauges", "text": "Due to the large monthly MSL oscillations inherent in PNW tide gauges caused by natural climate and ocean variability (e.g. Figure 2-8), researches typically attempt to smooth the monthly MSL data prior to assessing decadal trends. One approach is to remove the average seasonal cycle from the monthly MSL values (e.g. Zervas, 2009). However, Komar et al. (2011) demonstrated that using the average summer monthly MSL (average summer MSL) provided the statistically best RSL trends for PNW tide gauges. The average summer MSL value consists of the three-month average, centered on the unadjusted minimum monthly summer value. Figure  2-12 and Figure 2-13 show the RSL trends for the Crescent City and North Spit tide gauge observation record, respectively, for both smoothing approaches described above. The figures clearly show that the average summer MSL approach of Komar et al. (2011) significantly reduces scatter compared to the monthly MSL approach, by removing much of the data with extreme seasonal and natural climate variability. The RSL trends for Crescent City is -0.92 mm/yr for the monthly MSL approach, and -0.97 mm/yr for the average summer MSL approach (Figure 2-12). These similar RSL trends can be attributed to the 81-year observation record length for Crescent City. In contrast, the North Spit tide gauge record is relatively short (~37 years), and differences between the RSL trends (3.85 and 4.70 mm/yr) are much larger (Figure 2-13). However, the RSL trend of 4.70 mm/yr for the average summer MSL is close to the RSL value of 4.61 mm/yr (Table 2-3) determined by Patton et al. (2014), demonstrating that the summer MSL approach of Komar et al. (2011) may be best for estimating sea level change trends, even for tide gauges with shorter records. To provide further insight into decadal trends in sea level rise for the Humboldt Bay region, the estimated VLM rates (Table 2-3) for the Crescent City and North Spit tide gauges were removed from the monthly MSL record, which essentially force both records to the ReMSL rate of 2.28 mm/yr. Figure 2-14 show the average summer MSL series developed from the VLM adjusted records for Crescent City and North Spit, respectively. The average summer MSL values follow the ReMSL trend over the observation record for both tide gauges, although natural climate variability and interannual to multidecadal trends exist in the data scatter. For example, the 1982-83 and 1990s El Ni\u00f1o events (Figure 2-7) generated summer MSL values that were consistently above the ReMSL trend. The average summer MSL values are similar between tide gauges for the period of record overlap (~1977 to 2014), with differences perhaps contributable to the different summer seasonal cycles for Crescent City and North Spit (Figure 2-9). The suppression of sea level rise along the U.S. west coast noted by Bromirski et al. (2011) is visible in the average summer MSL series for Crescent City and North Spit tide gauges ( Figure  2-14) from about 1990 to the mid-2000s, as evidenced by the downward slope of the 5-yr running average (red line) during this period. Furthermore, the effects of the PDO regimes on the multidecadal sea level variation also described by Bromirski et al. (2011) are apparent in the average summer MSL. For example, the 1960s to 1980 period of consistently low summer MSL values coincides with the 1950 to late 1970s cold phase of the PDO (Figure 2-7). Likewise, the period of high summer MSL values during the late 1980s to 2000 is consistent with late 1970s to late 1990s PDO warm phase. Although the average summer MSL series for the Crescent City and North Spit tide gauges show interannual to multidecadal variations due to seasonal atmospheric and ocean circulation processes (e.g. upwelling), and natural climate variability (e.g. ENSO and PDO), the extreme high and low values still follow the ReMSL trend over the observation record. This can be clearly seen as all the summer MSL extremes closely track the trend line envelopes (black dashed lines) shown in Figure 2-14, which consist of the ReMSL trend \u00b1 one standard deviation of the summer MSL values."}, {"section_title": "Sea Level Height Variability", "text": "Sea level heights vary due to astronomical tides, storm surge, wind stress effects, changes in barometric pressure, seasonal cycles, and ENSO phases, which results in water levels reaching higher levels over longer time scales Knowles, 2010). Figure 2-15 shows the hourly water levels for the Crescent City tide gauge for the 1982-83 El Ni\u00f1o years, along with the MSL and mean higher high water (MHHW) tidal datum, the mean monthly maximum water (MMMW), and the 10-and 100-yr extreme high water level events. As noted by , this sea level height variability is superimposed on MSL. Most coastal damage to the U.S. west coast occurs when storm surge and high waves coincide with high astronomical tides and El Ni\u00f1o events NRC, 2012). Extreme sea level heights can occur when these forces coincide, which happened along the U.S. west coast during the large 1982-83 and 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o events. For example, in late January 1983 a large El Ni\u00f1o driven storm coincided with higher than normal astronomical high tides, and produced the highest water level of record at the Crescent City tide gauge on 29 January 1983 which exceeded the 100-year extreme exceedance probability event (Figure 2-15 and Figure 2-16). The peak hourly water level on 29 January 1983 was 66.2 cm higher than the astronomical high tide, and on 26 January 1983, the peak hourly water level was 84.0 cm above the astronomical high tide. As GMSL and ReMSL rise increases over time, the sea level height variability described above will also increase, and the incidence of extreme high water levels will become more common (NRC, 2012).

Projections of future sea level rise, both globally and regionally, are necessary to adequately assess and plan for the effects and impacts to coastal areas from sea level rise. Projections of future sea level rise generally depend on the understanding of contributions to sea level change, the response of key geophysical processes, and assumptions regarding future warming of the climate system (NRC, 2012). This section provides an overview and summarizes recent projections of GMSL rise, estimates of ReMSL rise for the Humboldt Bay region, and adjustments to this regional rate to provide projections of RSL rise for Humboldt Bay."}, {"section_title": "Methods for Projecting Future Sea Level Rise", "text": "Projections of 21st century sea level rise are typically made using process-based or physical models, such as Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs), extrapolating observations, semi-empirical models, or a combination of these approaches (NRC, 2012;Church et al., 2013). These projections rely on the different processes affecting sea level change described previously, such as ocean thermal expansion or VLM, depending if the projection is for global, regional or relative sea level rise. Process-based or physical based projections of sea level rise attempt to describe the contributions from the individual physical components that contribute to sea level rise (Church et al., 2013). The AOGCMs predict the response of the climate system and ocean to future scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. These models can provide reasonable estimates of future sea level rise from ocean volume density change (steric), primarily from thermosteric volume changes due to thermal expansion. However, these models underestimate the ocean volume mass change (barystatic) from melting land ice, as they do not fully account for rapid dynamical changes in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets (NRC, 2012;Church et al., 2013). The 2007 IPCC AR4 (Meehl et al., 2007) projections (Figure 2-17) used a combination of AOGCMs to estimate the global ocean steric volume change, and ice sheet surface mass balance and empirical models to determine ocean volume mass change from melting land ice for six different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. As noted in NRC (2012), at the time the AR4 projections were compiled, observations of rapid land ice transfers at a global scale were just beginning, and these projections did not include rapid dynamical ice sheet contributions or provide an upper bound for sea level rise. Consequently, the 2007 IPCC AR4 sea level rise projections were considered too low by the NRC (2012) and other researchers (e.g. Rahmstorf, 2007;Pfeffer et al., 2008;Vermeer and Rahmstorf;2009;Jevrejeva et al., 2010;Grinsted et al., 2010). Extrapolation of existing or past sea level rise rates can also be used to project future conditions, assuming constant observed rates or specified rules, and has been used by investigators to project the cryosphere (i.e. glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets) contribution to projected future sea level rise (NRC, 2012). The motivation for development of semi-empirical models (e.g. Rahmstorf, 2007;Vermeer and Rahmstorf;2009;Jevrejeva et al., 2010;Grinsted et al., 2010) was primarily due to the limitations described above for the process-based sea level rise projections in the 2007 IPCC AR4 (Meehl et al., 2007;NRC, 2012;Church et al., 2013). The semi-empirical models do not explicitly account for the individual components of sea level rise, but are based on the physical concept that sea level rises as the Earth's climate system gets warmer (NRC, 2012;Church et al., 2013). Semi-empirical models are developed and calibrated to reproduce the observed past sea level record to the temperature record. Consequently, future sea level rise projections assume that the relationship between sea level and temperature change of the past holds in to the future. This relationship may not hold if the nonlinear physical processes, such as rapid dynamical ice sheet contributions, do not scale to the calibration period of the past (NRC, 2012;Church et al., 2013). Semi-empirical projections of sea level rise are generally two or more times greater than the process-based projections in the 2007 IPCC AR4 (NRC, 2012). As noted in the 2013 IPCC AR5, despite the success of semi-empirical models to reproduce the sea level rise observed in the 20th century, consensus in the scientific community does not exist regarding their reliability and confidence is low in their projections (Church et al., 2013). Since completion of the 2007 IPCC AR4, a number of 21st century GMSL rise projections have been developed using modifications to the AR4 process-based estimates or semi-empirical models driven by the AR4 emission scenarios (Figure 2-18). This figure also includes the 2013 IPCC AR5 process-based projections (Church et al., 2013) for the new AR5 emission scenarios. Both the process-based estimates that include the extrapolated cryosphere rates and the semiempirical models generate higher GMSL rise projections for the same AR4 emission scenarios compared to the process-based models. The highest projected range of GMSL rise is derived from a combination of ocean thermal expansion from the 2007 IPCC AR4 and extrapolations of possible glacier and ice sheet loss by year 2100 (Pfeffer et al., 2008). They concluded that a total GMSL rise of 200 cm by 2100 is possible, but requires glacier variables to quickly accelerate to extremely high limits. However, the NRC (2012) concluded that this future scenario is highly unlikely and probably not plausible. Pfeffer et al. (2008) also concluded that a GMSL rise greater than 200 cm by 2100 is physically untenable.

Unlike projections of sea level rise, the scenarios do not attempt to predict future conditions, but describe potential future conditions that support sea level rise vulnerability assessments, planning and decision making under uncertainty. Four scenarios were developed based on a synthesis of future estimates of GMSL rise by 2100 from the scientific literature, consistent with Figure 2-18, that reflect different degrees of ocean warming and melting land ice (Table 2-4). The Highest Scenario of GMSL rise was based on the Pfeffer et al. (2008) estimate of maximum possible glacier and ice sheet loss by 2100, and should be used when there is little tolerance for risk. The Intermediate-High Scenario was based on the average of the upper end of semiempirical model projections, and the Intermediate-Low Scenario was based on the upper end of the 2007 IPCC AR4 projections. The Lowest Scenario was based on a linear extrapolation of the 20th century GMSL rate of ~1.7 mm/yr. Given the range of GMSL rise projections used in developing the scenarios, the authors concluded that they have very high confidence (>9 in 10 chance) that GMSL will rise at least 20 cm and no more than 200 cm by 2100 (Parris et al., 2012). The NRC (2012) GMSL rise projections (Table 2- 5) consisted of the ocean volume density change (steric) component predicted from the AOGCMs in the 2007 IPCC AR4 for the A1B emission scenario, and an extrapolated land ice (cryosphere) component using the best available information for glaciers, ice caps, and ice sheets. The NRC projections did not include reservoir storage and groundwater extraction as recent estimates suggested that these components summed to near zero. The NRC (2012) GMSL rise projection for 2100 ( Figure 2-18) is generally lower than the semi-empirical estimates and higher than the process-based projections.

As part of the 2013 scientific work supporting the AR5, new GMSL rise projections were developed for four new greenhouse gas emission scenarios (Church et al., 2013). The new scenarios, the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), represent future emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases, aerosols, and other climate drivers. The RCPs represent a set of mitigation scenarios, which include implied policy actions, that have different targets in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and radiative forcing at year 2100 (IPCC, 2013b). RCP2.6 represents an emission mitigation scenario leading to very low radiative forcing (2.6 W/m 2 ), RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 represent two stabilization scenarios with intermediate radiative forcing (4.5 and 6.5 W/m 2 , respectively), and RCP8.5 represents a very high greenhouse gas emission scenario with high radiative forcing (8.5 W/m 2 ). Church et al. (2013) noted that confidence in projections of future GMSL rise has increased since the 2007 IPCC AR4, due to the improved understanding of the components driving sea level change, the ability to reproduce observed GMSL change since 1993 from the observed budget (Table 2-2 and Figure 2-5), the improved ability of process-based models to reproduce observations, and the inclusion of ice sheet dynamical changes. Summing the components of ocean thermal expansion predicted by the AOGCMs, glacier mass loss predicted by the global glacier models with AOGCM input, and land water storage accounts for about 65% of the observed GMSL rise for 1901 to 1990 (Church et al., 2013). For the 1993 to 2010 period, the sum of the modeled components accounts for approximately 90% of the observed satellite altimetry rate of 3.2 mm/yr, and is consistent with the 2.8 mm/yr rate for the tide gage reconstruction (Table 2-2). The difference between the observed and total modeled GMSL rise can be attributed to melting ice sheets, and inclusion of the observed Greenland and Antarctica ice sheet contribution (Table 2-2) further improves the agreement with the 3.2 mm/yr altimetry rate (Church et al., 2013). This improved agreement between observations and process-based models provides confidence in the AR5 projections of 21st century GMSL rise. The 2013 IPCC AR5 (Church et al., 2013) projections for 21st century GMSL rise are presented in Table 2-6 and Figure 2-19. The AR5 projections were presented for the periods of 2046 to 2065, 2081 to 2100, and year 2100 relative to the 1986 to 2005 period. To allow comparison with the NRC (2012) projections, estimates for the years 2030 and 2050 were developed using available data downloaded from the IPCC AR5. Table 2-7 compares the estimated AR5 median projection and range to the NRC (2012) projections. The 2013 IPCC AR5 projections of GMSL rise by 2100 ( Figure 2-18) is lower than the semiempirical estimates and the NRC (2012) estimates, but higher than the 2007 IPCC AR4 projection. The larger AR5 projections compared to AR4 are primarily due to improved modeling of the land ice contributions (Church et al., 2013). Projections for years 2030 and 2050 calculated from downloaded data and based on 20-year centered average (Church et al., 2013). AR5 projections are relative to 1986-2005, projections made relative to year 2000 by applying 1993-2010 satellite altimetry GMSL rate of 3.2 mm/yr (Table 2-1) for 5 years.  Projection is median value of the RCP median projections, and range is the lowest and highest range value for each year from Table 2-6. Given the higher confidence in the AR5 projections, the authors concluded that for each RCP emission scenario the 21st century GMSL rise is likely (66 to 100% probability) to be within the range given by the process-based models (Church et al., 2013). The authors further concluded that the only process that could substantially increase GMSL rise above the likely range during the 21st century is the collapse of the marine-based sectors of the Antarctic ice sheet. Although the contribution to GMSL rise from a collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet cannot currently be quantified, due to a lack of consensus in the scientific literature, there is medium confidence that if a collapse were initiated it would not exceed several tenths of a meter during the 21st century (Church et al., 2013). It is worth noting that a 30 cm (0.3 m) increase in GMSL rise from the collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet would essentially make the 2013 IPCC AR5 projections consistent with the NRC (2012) projections by 2100 (Table 2-7). For example, the AR5 projected median value would increase from 52.4 to 82.4 cm, which is essentially the same as the NRC projection value of 82.7 cm. Likewise, the AR5 high range projection would increase 96.4 to 126.4 cm, close to the 140.2 cm NRC high range value."}, {"section_title": "Regional Sea Level Rise Projections for the Humboldt Bay Region", "text": "The NRC (2012) report provided sea level rise projections for California, Oregon and Washington that varied from the GMSL rise projections due to ocean dynamical processes, steric density variations, sea level fingerprint effects of the mass redistribution of melting land ice, and VLM. The NRC determined sea level rise projections for four regions of the U.S. west coast (Seattle, Newport, San Francisco, and Los Angeles) based on the influence of these regional processes, and represent the most comprehensive regional projections to date. To provide estimates of ReMSL rise projections for the Humboldt Bay region, which is defined in this report to not include VLM effects, the NRC (2012) regional projections were modified to remove their VLM component. For example, north of Cape Mendocino, the NRC assumed that all areas had an upward VLM of 1 mm/yr, which is inconsistent with the observed downward VLM in Humboldt Bay (Table 2-3). Modifications consisted of removing the NRC estimates of VLM for Newport (1 mm/yr, upward VLM) and San Francisco (-1.5 mm/yr, downward VLM), and then averaging the resulting values to provide a ReMSL rise projection for the Humboldt Bay region (Table 2-8). The modified ReMSL rise projection for the Humboldt Bay region differ from the NRC (2012) GMSL rise projection due to the effects of regional dynamical ocean and steric volume change, and the mass volume redistribution of the melting land ice due to the sea level fingerprints. These combined processes lower the ReMSL rise projection for the Humboldt Bay region compared to the GMSL projection (Table 2-8), primarily due to the sea level fingerprint effects (NRC, 2012). The percent differences are greatest for the 2030 (~27%) and 2050 (~24%) projections, with the ReMSL projection being approximately 9% less by 2100. The 2013 IPCC AR5 (Church et al., 2013) also provided regional projections of sea level rise for the RCP scenarios for the 2081 to 2100 period that included the effects of regional dynamical ocean and steric volume changes, ice sheet mass redistribution, and atmospheric loading. Although not as detailed and at a coarser resolution than the NRC (2012) regional projections, the AR5 projections also indicate that sea level rise for the Humboldt Bay region will be lower than the GMSL rise projection. The percent differences ranged from 0 to ~11% less than the GMSL rise projection for the 2081 to 2100 period relative to 1986 to 2005, with higher differences for the higher RCP scenarios."}, {"section_title": "Relative Sea Level Rise Projections for the Humboldt Bay Region", "text": "The relative sea level (RSL) rise is what coastal areas experience and is the most important quantity for assessing and planning for the coastal impacts from sea level change (NRC, 2012;Church et al., 2013). The modified ReMSL rise projections for the Humboldt Bay region (Table  2-8) can be made to RSL rise projections for Humboldt Bay by simply adding the VLM estimates for the bay (Table 2-3) to the ReMSL values.   The observed north to south downward VLM gradient in Humboldt Bay (Table 2-3) produces a gradient in the RSL rise projections (Table 2-9), with the south end of the bay having higher RSL projections than the north end. The VLM rates in Humboldt Bay not only create the highest observed RSL rise rates in California, but over the long-term also generate higher RSL rise projections that will affect Humboldt Bay faster than other parts of the U.S. west coast. For example, the large downward VLM for Hookton Slough creates a high RSL rise projection of approximately 174 cm by 2100, which is only 26 cm less than the highest projected GMSL rise of 200 cm due to the maximum possible glacier and ice sheet loss postulated by Pfeffer et al.

Tetra Tech, Inc. continued development of EFDC with support from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In 2007, the EPA released a public domain version of EFDC, EFDC-EPA Version 1.01 (EFDC_EPA), which is part of a suite of models recommended by the EPA for total maximum daily load (TMDL) development. EFDC_EPA is a multifunctional surface water modeling system for simulating three-dimensional (3D) or two-dimensional (2D) flow, transport and biogeochemical processes in surface waters including rivers, lakes, wetlands, estuaries and coastal regions. The EFDC model dynamically couples hydrodynamics and salinity and temperature transport, and can internally link to cohesive and non-cohesive sediment transport, water and sediment toxic contaminant transport and fate, dye transport, and water quality and eutrophication sub-models. Various enhancements to the EFDC hydrodynamic code include hydraulic structure representation, vegetation resistance (Moustafa and Hamrick, 2000), and wetting and drying (Ji et al., 2001). Full documentation of the EFDC model can be found in Hamrick (1992) and Tetra Tech (2007a, 2007band 2007c.

EFDC assumes (Jin, 2000;Ji, 2008): (1) the Boussinesq approximation is appropriate, (2) the hydrostatic pressure assumption describes the vertical pressure distribution, and (3) eddy viscosity concept adequately describes turbulent mixing. To account for realistic boundaries, the hydrodynamic equations are formulated in curvilinear-orthogonal horizontal coordinates and a sigma or stretched vertical coordinate. The transformed hydrodynamic equations for continuity and momentum, and the salinity and temperature transport equations are (Hamrick, 1992;Ji, 2008): And for salinity and temperature transport where t is time, u and v are horizontal velocities in curvilinear-orthogonal horizontal coordinates (x, y), m x and m y are the curvilinear-orthogonal coordinate system metric coefficients and are the square roots of the diagonal components of the metric tensor, and m = m x m y is the Jacobian or square root of the metric tensor determinate. The sigma coordinate (z) uses a time variable mapping or stretching transformation to provide uniform resolution in the vertical given by: where z* is the original physical vertical coordinate, and -h and \u03b6 are the physical vertical coordinates of the bottom topography and free surface, respectively. Total depth (H = h + \u03b6) is the sum of the depth below and the free surface displacement relative to the undisturbed, physical vertical coordinate, z* = 0. The vertical velocity (w) in the sigma coordinate is related to the physical vertical velocity w* by: In the continuity equation 1, Q h represents water gains or losses, such as rainfall, evaporation, groundwater interaction and water withdrawals. In the momentum equations (Eq. 2 and 3), g is gravitational acceleration, f is the Coriolis parameter, A v is vertical turbulent momentum mixing coefficient or eddy viscosity, and Q u and Q v are additional forces or momentum sources/sinks such as subgrid scale horizontal diffusion and vegetation resistance. The physical pressure (p) in excess of the reference density hydrostatic pressure is given by: where \u03c1 0 is the reference density. Buoyancy (b) in equation 4is the normalized deviation of density from the reference value, water density (\u03c1) is a function of temperature (T) and salinity (S) in equation 5, and \u03c4 xz and \u03c4 yz are vertical shear stresses in the horizontal (x,y) direction in equation (6). In the transport equation for salinity (7) and temperature (8), A b is the vertical turbulent mass diffusivity, Q S and Q T include subgrid scale horizontal diffusion and constituent sources and sinks, and R T in the temperature equation represents heating from solar radiation. Solution of the momentum equations (2 and 3) and transport equations (7 and 8) requires specification of the vertical turbulent viscosity (A v ) and mass diffusivity (A b ). The second moment turbulence closure model developed by Mellor and Yamada (1982) and modified by Galperin et al. (1988) and Blumberg et al. (1992) is used in EFDC to provide the A v and A b coefficients. The model relates A v and A b to vertical turbulence intensity and turbulence length scale via transport equations (Hamrick, 1992;Ji, 2008). In EFDC, additional horizontal viscosity or diffusivity, respectively, in the momentum equations (2 and 3) and transport equations (7 and 8) can be calculated using the Smogorinsky subgrid scale formula (Smogorinsky, 1963), which relates horizontal mixing to the model grid size and current shear (Ji, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Vertical Boundary Conditions", "text": "Vertical boundary conditions for the momentum equations are based on specifying the kinematic shear stresses in equation 6at the bed (z = 0) and water surface (z = 1) as (Hamrick, 1992;Hamrick and Mills, 2000;Ji, 2008): where \u03c4 bx and \u03c4 by are bottom shear stresses; \u03c4 sx and \u03c4 sy are surface shear stresses; u bl and v bl are velocities at the midpoint of the bottom layer; U w and V w are wind velocity components at 10 m above the water surface.

Time integration uses a second-order accurate, three-time level or two-time level finite-difference scheme with an external-internal mode splitting procedure which separates the external free surface gravity wave (barotrophic mode) from the internal shear (baroclinic mode). The semi-implicit, external mode solution uses a preconditioned conjugate gradient procedure to compute the 2D water surface elevations, allowing relatively large time steps constrained only by the stability criteria of the high-order upwind advection scheme (Smolarkiewicz and Margolin, 1993) or the explicit central difference approach used for nonlinear accelerations (Jin et al., 2000). The internal mode equations are solved at the external mode time step, and are implicit with respect to vertical diffusion. The transport equations for salinity, temperature, turbulence intensity and length scale, and other constituents are solved using a high order upwind scheme (Smolarkiewicz and Clark, 1986;Smolarkiewicz and Grabowski, 1990) known as the multidimensional positive definite advective transport algorithm (MPDATA), which is first-order accurate in space and second-order accurate in time (Hamrick, 1992).

The Crescent City tide gauge has a much longer record of hourly water level observations than the North Spit gauge. The monthly highest water level observations are derived from the hourly and six-minute tidal observations (NOAA, 2013). Verified six-minute water level observations are available for the North Spit and Crescent City gauges, but cover a much shorter observation period beginning in January 1996.

Nontidal sea levels occur from local weather events such as storm surge, wind stress effects, and changes in barometric pressure; from larger interannual to decadal climate patterns such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); and from decadal or longer climate variability such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation Bromirski et al., 2011;NRC, 2012), all of which can increase or decrease the astronomical tide levels. The recorded water levels do not include wave effects, but may contain a limited amount of wave setup depending on the gauge's exposure to ocean waves (NOAA, 2013). Since the North Spit tide gauge is located inside Humboldt Bay and generally protected from ocean swell, the water level observations probably do not include significant wave effects. However, the Crescent City tide gauge location within the Crescent City Harbor, and the harbor's orientation to the open ocean may allow some wave setup effect in the tidal observations.

The 100-yr HSLH series consists of 639,011 hourly water level observations (Table 4-1) and 246,373 hourly water level predictions with the long-term SLR and VLM signal removed (detrended) from the entire series. The 100-yr HSLH series includes the sea level height variability inherent in the historical Crescent City observed tidal record, and is of adequate length to make reliable estimates of extreme high water levels (e.g. 100-yr extreme high water level). The entire 100-yr HSLH series spanned 101-years (1912 to 2012) with the 1912 tide levels used for model spinup. Hourly water level predictions were based on NOAA hindcast astronomical tide predictions for Crescent City, and a developed nontidal sea level model following the general approach of . This approach uses multi-linear regression to relate nontidal sea level residuals to weather (wind and sea level pressure) and ENSO variability. The general procedure to develop the hourly water level predictions for Crescent City follows. 1. Hourly observations and hindcasted tide predictions for Crescent City were downloaded from the NOAA CO-OPS website (http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/), referenced to the tide gauges station datum (STND). The hourly observations were detrended using leastsquares linear regression to remove the SLR and VLM signal from the data. The regression was on the hourly water level residuals generated by subtracting the NOAA Crescent City mean sea level (MSL) tidal datum value of 225.4 cm (1983( -2001 from the hourly observations. Detrending the hourly data effectively references the data to the middle of the current 1983-2001 NTDE (Flick et al., 2013), which for this work references midnight on 2 July 1992. The NOAA hindcasted tidal predictions generally reproduce NOAA published tidal datum for the current 1983-2001 NTDE. Consequently, it was assumed for this work that the NOAA tide predictions represent detrended astronomical hindcasted tide predictions over the 1913-2012 period referenced to the 1983-2001 NTDE. 2. Hourly detrended nontidal sea level residuals were determined by subtracting the NOAA hindcasted astronomical tide predictions from the detrended water level observations from step 1 above. 3. Nontidal sea level model independent variables collected for analysis include wind velocity, sea level pressure (inverse barometer effect), and ENSO variability extracted from various reanalysis datasets for two time periods: 1912periods: -1949periods: and 1950periods: -2012periods: . For the 1912periods: -1949 and sea level pressure: 20th Century Reanalysis V2 data (Compo et al., 2011) provided by the NOAA Office of Oceanic & Atmospheric Research, Earth System Research Laboratory, Physical Sciences Division (NOAA/OAR/ESRL/PSD).

Seasonal multi-linear regression models were developed for two time periods (1933-1949, and 1950-2012), relating the observed hourly nontidal sea level residuals from step 2 (dependent variable) to the 6-hour wind velocity (u-and v-direction), 6-hour sea level pressure, and monthly ENSO values from step 3 (independent variables). Hourly estimates of the independent variables were determined from the 6-hour and monthly values using linear interpolation. The seasonal periods were September-November (fall), December-February (winter), March-May (spring), and June-August (summer). Seasonal regression models provided better correlations between predicted and observed nontidal residuals than an annual model. 5. The final hourly detrended water level predictions for Crescent City consisted of combining the NOAA hindcasted tide predictions (step 1) with the hourly detrended nontidal sea level predictions (step 4).

Correlation plots are shown in Figure 4-1 for the nontidal sea level predictions. Observations, and statistics are summarized in Table 4-3. Correlation coefficients (R) for the seasonal regression relations range from 53% to 85% with higher values for the winter, fall, and spring seasonal periods (Table 4-2), respectively, when storms and El Ni\u00f1o conditions more significantly affect sea levels. The standard error of the regressions (SE) range from 5.6 to 8.4 cm for the 1933 to 1949 period, and 6.0 to 9.0 cm for the 1950 to 2012 period, with the highest SE occurring in the winter season. The standard deviations of the nontidal sea level predictions are similar to, but smaller than observations, with a correlation coefficient of approximately 79% for both model periods (Table  4-3). These results are consistent with the nontidal sea level model developed by  for Crescent City, which had an R value of 82% between observed and predicted nontidal sea levels. The correlation plots (Figure 4-1) show that predicted nontidal sea levels slightly underestimate and overestimate the higher and lower observations, respectively. One likely explanation for this is the 6-hour wind velocity and sea level pressure Reanalysis data, which are 6-hour averages that would tend to reduce peak values and raise low values that occur over shorter time scales (e.g. hourly). Overall, the developed nontidal sea level models generally appear to reproduce observed nontidal sea level variability using the three independent variables of wind, sea level pressure and ENSO variability (Figure 4-2).

The observed water levels (A in Figure 4-4), prior to detrending, exhibit an overall downward trend in the monthly MSL showing the combined effects of SLR and VLM, and indicates the RSL rise trend for the Crescent City tide gauge. Detrending the hourly observations (B in Figure 4-4) removes the RSL rise trend and creates stationary monthly MSL about the reported NOAA MSL for the 1983-2001 NTDE.

The Crescent City tide gauge reported MSL, mean higher high water (MHHW) and mean lower low water (MLLW) tidal datum for the 1983-2001 NTDE are listed in Table 4-4. These datum were also estimated from the NOAA astronomical tide predictions, detrended hourly observations, and the detrended 100yr HSLH series (Table 4-4). Overall, the 100-yr HSLH series appears relatively stationary around the 1983-2001 NTDE, with a difference of -3 mm between the reported MSL and MHHW and the estimated values from the 100-yr HSLH series. It is worth noting the 2 cm difference between the reported MLLW tidal datum (112.4 cm) and the estimated values from the NOAA tide predictions (114.4 cm), the detrended hourly observations (114.4 cm), and the 100-yr HSLH series (114.0 cm). It is not clear why this discrepancy exists with the MLLW values. A final assessment of the accuracy of the developed 100-yr HSLH series was performed by comparing probabilities of exceedance for annual extreme high water level estimates (e.g. 100-yr event) from the 100-yr HSLH series to reported NOAA highest monthly observations. To develop the NOAA annual maximum water level series, the reported NOAA highest monthly water level observations (Table 4-1) were first detrended to the middle of the 1983-2001 NTDE using the same linear equation used to detrend the hourly observations. A 77-yr annual maximum series was generated from the detrended NOAA highest monthly observations, and the detrended 100-yr HSLH series provided a 100-yr annual maximum series. Exceedance probabilities and return intervals of extreme high water level events were determined for both annual maximum series using a generalized extreme value (GEV) analysis. Results of the GEV analysis for both annual maximum series are summarized in Table 4-5 and the exceedance probability curves are provided in Figure 4-5. The 100-yr annual maximum water level series, estimated from the 100-yr HSLH series, reasonably reproduces the annual extreme high water level estimates generated from the 77-yr NOAA annual maximum series, with differences ranging between -2.2 cm and 2.7 cm.

Predicted and observed water level means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients for the hourly water levels and daily maximum water levels are summarized in Table 5-2 and Table  5-3, respectively. Predicted mean water level was similar to the observed value with a difference of 0.9 cm. The predicted and observed standard deviations were similar with a difference of 1.6 cm, indicating that the 2D model reproduces observed water level variability well. Figure 5-1 illustrates the high correlation coefficients (0.996 and 0.975) for both water level analyses, verifying the good prediction of water levels for the North Spit gauge. The data points that significantly deviate from the 1:1 line in the correlation plots ( Figure 5-1), are associated with tsunami events that have been recorded in the North Spit and Crescent City tidal observations. Table 5-4 summarizes the reported NOAA tidal datum (MSL, MLLW and MHHW) at the North Spit gauge, and estimates from the 100-yr predicted water levels. To compare observed and predicted tidal datum, the NOAA values were adjusted by 4.56 cm to account for a ReMSL rise rate of 2.28 mm/yr over 20 years. The 100-yr predictions reasonably reproduce reported MHHW, MSL and MLLW North Spit tidal datum, with differences of 0.2, 1.0 and 1.6 cm, respectively. Thirty-five years of annual maximum water levels are available for the North Spit gauge from 1978 to 2012. The relatively long period of highest monthly observations at the North Spit gauge (Table 4-1) allowed for a comparison of predicted and observed extreme high water levels. The 1981 annual maximum water level value is approximately 1.4 meters higher than the next highest North Spit water level in 1983. In Crescent City, the highest observed water level for the 77-yr record was in 1983. Consequently, the 1981 North Spit annual maximum water level was considered an outlier and removed from the analysis, resulting in a 34-yr detrended annual maximum observed water level series for the North Spit gauge. The 2D model predictions for North Spit generated a 100-yr long detrended annual maximum water level series. A generalized extreme value (GEV) analysis provided probabilities of exceedance for extreme events for both of the annual maximum series. Results of the GEV analyses are summarized in Table 5-5 and the exceedance probability curves are provided in Figure 5-2. The 100-yr predicted annual maximum series reasonably reproduces, although somewhat over-predicts, the annual extreme high water level estimates from the 34-yr observed annual maximum series.

As noted earlier, the 2D model grid resolution at the Mad River Slough and Hookton Slough tide gauge locations does not capture the full-observed tidal range, and only the daily maximum water levels were assessed at these two gauges. For the Fields Landing, Hookton Slough, Mad River Slough and Samoa tidal gauges, the period of tidal observations is not long enough to detrend the data and remove the SLR and VLM trend. Instead, these tidal observations were compared to predictions from the simulation that used the 100-yr HSLH calibration series boundary condition that was adjusted for the ReMSL rise rate of 2.28 mm/yr. The tidal observations at these four tide gauges include the effects of both SLR and VLM. Although the 100-yr HSLH calibration series accounts for the ReMSL rise rate of 2.28 mm/yr, it does not account for VLM, which increases or decreases the RSL rise at each tide gauge. To compensate for this difference, the appropriate VLM rate estimate (Table 2-3) was added to each of the four tide gauges (Fields Landing, Hookton Slough, Mad River Slough and Samoa) tidal observations by the time before or after midnight on 16 June 1991. The NGS benchmark data sheets (http://www.ngs.noaa.gov) for each tide gauge indicate that June 1991 is the date of the most recent orthometric height adjustment, which for this work was assumed to be midnight on 16 June 1991.

The Humboldt Bay project DEM (PWA, 2014) was input into ArcGIS. 2. A line was created along the 7-m contour and densified with points approximately every 137 m (7-m line). 3. A line representing the model grid boundary was created, and densified with points approximately every 137 m (model-boundary line). 4. The water surface elevation point files generated in Step 6 of the hydrodynamic model post-processing were input into ArcGIS, and a triangulated irregular network (TIN) was created from the points. The TIN was then clipped along the model-boundary line. 5. Water surface elevations were then mapped horizontally to the 7-m line from the closest points within the TIN created in Step 4. 6. A new water surface elevation TIN (inundation TIN) was created from the 7-m line from Step 5 and the original TIN from Step 4. 7.

The resulting polygons represent the areas vulnerable to inundation, landward of the MHW line. 10. The final step was to create the inundation map coverages. Inundation shapefiles and kmz files were created from the final inundation polygons. The horizontal projection of the inundation maps is UTM Zone 10, WGS84.

The inundation vulnerability maps identify areas surrounding Humboldt Bay and its adjoining tributary and slough channels where ground elevations are below the adjacent water surface elevations for MHHW, MMMW, MAMW and the 10-and 100-yr extreme high water level events predicted from the 2D model. The 2D model was driven solely by the 100-yr HSLH series and did not account for internallygenerated wind wave effects on water levels in Humboldt Bay, which could raise or lower predicted water levels. The 2D model did not account for tributary flooding, which could increase predicted water levels in the local vicinity of the tributaries. Furthermore, the hydrodynamics of water flooding across the vulnerable areas, such as a levee breach, were not accounted for in the modeling, which could raise or lower predicted water levels in these areas. Incorporating tributary flooding, wind wave effects, and lateral flooding into the hydrodynamic model was beyond the scope and funding of this project, but could be included in future efforts.

The Crescent City tide gauge had a much longer period of record than the North Spit gauge (Table 4-1). The detrended series represented a stationary 100-yr HSLH series, relative to the middle of the current 1983-2001 NTDE (midnight on 2 July 1992), retaining the sea level height variability observed at the Crescent City tide gauge. Due to the inherent uncertainty in predicting future SLR rates, the 2D modeling, analysis, and resulting inundation mapping conducted for this study did not use a SLR projection for a specified time period (e.g. NRC (2012)), but instead modeled SLR scenarios by adjusting the entire stationary 100-yr HSLH series by fixed elevation increases, or \"steps\". Each modeled SLR scenario created a 100-yr long record of predicted water levels within Humboldt Bay relative to year 2000. Since the 100-yr HSLH series boundary condition accounted for the longterm sea level height variability at the Crescent City tide gauge, and was stationary relative to each SLR scenario, the 100-yr period of predicted water levels could directly be used to estimate average water levels (e.g. MHHW) and extreme high water level events (e.g. 100-yr event) at each model grid cell within Humboldt Bay.

The SLR scenarios developed for this study were relative to year 2000 (Table 4- , so that comparisons could be made with the NRC (2012) SLR projections, or other projections with a year 2000 base date. To adjust the SLR scenarios relative to year 2000, the 100-yr HSLH series was adjusted from the middle of the current 1983-2001 NTDE (midnight on 2 July 1992) to year 2000 by adding 1.82 cm, using the ReMSL rise rate of 2.28 mm/yr (Burgette et al., 2009) applied over 8 years.

Due to the observed downward VLM, Humboldt Bay has the highest reported RSL rise rates (Table 2-3) on the west coast of the United States (Patton et al., 2014). For example, RSL rise rates for Mad River Slough, North Spit, and Hookton Slough are approximately 3.4, 4.6 and 5.8 mm/yr, respectively. The VLM in Humboldt Bay significantly increases the RSL rise rates above the ReMSL rise rate of 2.28 mm/yr, with both the North Spit and Hookton Slough RSL rates being more than twice the ReMSL rate. These higher RSL rise rates indicate that the global rise in sea levels will affect Humboldt Bay faster than other parts of U.S. west coast; and within the bay, the south end will be affected sooner than the north end. Incorporating VLM into the SLR modeling was beyond the scope of this project and may not be currently feasible with the available data. However, the Humboldt Bay project DEM ground elevations used for the SLR modeling and inundation vulnerability mapping remained fixed in time relative to acquisition dates and processing as discussed previously. The predicted water levels and inundation mapping for the SLR scenarios can therefore be considered to represent the combined effect of SLR and VLM. For example, the 0.5-m SLR scenario inundation map represents the inundation footprint of a combined 0.5 m of SLR and VLM. Based on the varying rates of VLM across the bay, the 0.5-m SLR scenario inundation footprint occurs non-uniformly at a point in time due to the different VLM rates in Humboldt Bay. -1 Humboldt Bay SLR scenarios used in this study compared to the modified NRC (2012) SLR projections for Humboldt Bay.

The SLR projections estimate how MSL will change as sea levels increase. However, extreme sea level events are the cause of most damage to the California coast NRC, 2012), making it critical to understand the effects of SLR on extreme events. Figure 7-2 demonstrates the importance of considering extreme events when planning for SLR, compared to using average water levels such as MHHW. For example, the 100-yr extreme event is approximately 2 meters higher than MSL, 1 meter higher than MHHW, and 0.5 meter higher than MAMW. Furthermore, the 2-yr extreme event is approximately equal to MAMW, and the 1-yr event is only slightly greater than MMMW, showing how, on average, the more frequent extreme events are related to average water levels in the bay. Figure 7-3 shows the predicted bay-wide average extreme high water level events for Year 2012 existing sea levels, and the half-meter increment SLR scenarios of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0-m relative to year 2000. Over time, SLR increases the extreme high water level events. Furthermore, as sea levels rise, the frequency of inundation of fixed water levels increases. For example, the 1.1-yr extreme event under the 0.5-m SLR scenario relative to year 2000, is approximately equal to the 100-yr event today, which is consistent with Knowles (2009) SLR study in San Francisco Bay. To put this into perspective for Humboldt Bay, since 1912 the bay has seen approximately 46 cm of sea level rise using the North Spit RSL rise rate of 4.6 mm/yr applied over 100 years. Therefore, what was a 100-yr extreme event in 1912 is today about the 1-yr event, or about the monthly average high tide (Figure 7-2). Using Hookton Slough RSL rise rate of 5.8 mm/yr, it would only take approximately 85 years for the 100-yr event to equal the 1-yr event. This helps to explain why many Humboldt Bay levees are currently so vulnerable to overtopping by high water level events (Laird, 2013), as many of the bay's levees were constructed in the early 1900s.

Figure 7-4 shows the areas vulnerable to inundation from the Year 2012 existing mean monthly maximum water (MMMW) level, and the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey 1870s mapped shoreline (Laird, 2007). The areas vulnerable to inundation from the existing MMMW level coincide well with the historic 1870s shoreline, and likely represent a large portion of the reclaimed former tidelands around Humboldt Bay. It appears that a significant portion of the Elk River delta area, located across from the bay entrance, is outside the historic 1870 shoreline but still vulnerable to inundation from the existing MHHW level. This may be because this area was not mapped consistent with other tributary deltas, such as Freshwater Creek. Many of the former tideland areas are protected by levees and relatively low elevation railroad or road grades, such as Highway 101. Many of the bay levees are actively eroding, unmaintained and at relatively low elevations, and are therefore subject to overtopping by extreme high tides and storm events (Laird, 2013). Although currently protected against typical high tide levels, the poor condition of the bay levee system leaves much of the former reclaimed tideland areas highly vulnerable to inundation if the levees were to be breached or overtopped. Figure 7-5 shows areas vulnerable to inundation from MHHW and the 100-yr extreme high water level for Year 2012 existing sea levels, and Figure 6-4 shows the areas vulnerable to inundation from the 100-yr extreme event for year 2012 and the 2.0-m SLR scenario. If the existing levees or other barriers used to protect these vulnerable areas were to fail or breach, many of these areas would not only flood during extreme events, such as the 100-yr event, but also during typical high tides. Although there is over a 1 m difference in elevation between MHHW and the 100-yr extreme high water level (Figure 7-2), the areas vulnerable to inundation from the 100-yr event do not increase significantly when compared to the MHHW inundation footprint for existing conditions (Figure 7-5), or to the 100-yr event for the 2.0-m SLR scenario ( Figure 6-4). This is the result of two distinct topographic features: the low ground elevations of current vulnerable areas, and the landscape bounding Humboldt Bay and the adjoining tributary and slough channels. Most of the reclaimed former tidelands were not filled, and, on average, were likely at or near MHHW to MMMW elevations at the time they were reclaimed. Humboldt Bay is bounded by sand dunes to the west, coastal mountains to the east, and bluffs to the south, all of which limit the inundation extent of extreme high water events and the effects of sea level rise. The largest change in inundation extent is in the north to north-east end of Humboldt Bay, between Mad River Slough and the Mad River, where no significant bounding topographic barriers exist. The areas west of Eureka along the bay also show increases in the 100-yr inundation ( Figure 6-4 and Figure 7-5), which are composed of reclaimed tideland areas that were filled. Overall, the lateral extent of inundation from existing and future sea levels appears limited by the natural and anthropogenically altered topographic landscape surrounding Humboldt Bay. The greatest threats of tidal flooding to the vulnerable areas are by: (1) levee breaching or failure (Laird, 2013), which would allow water to flood into these areas over a range of water levels, and (2) overtopping the levees and railroad/road grades by extreme high water level events (e.g. 100-yr event). With sea level rise, the threat of levee failure will increase over time, and in addition, the frequency of extreme events overtopping levees and grades will also increase.

Although the inundation maps show areas vulnerable to inundation, not areas currently inundated, the maps can be used to illustrate when specific water levels associated with a SLR scenario may overtop a levee or barrier protecting a vulnerable area, allowing tidal flooding. As an example, Figure 7-6 shows the areas surrounding the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) ponds that are vulnerable to inundation from the 100-yr extreme high water level for Year 2012 existing sea levels and the 0.5-m SLR scenario. The existing 100-yr event water level (A in Figure 7-6) did not show that the outer WWTF levees will be overtopped, since the levee tops are at a higher elevation than the water level, and are visible through the inundation coverage. Consequently, the inside of the WWTF ponds will not flood during the existing 100-yr event, even though the coverage shows them vulnerable to inundation. However, for the 0.5-m SLR scenario the levees would overtop from the 100-yr event at many locations (B in , indicating that the ponds would flood during these conditions. Referring to Figure 7-1, the modified NRC (2012) high and low SLR projections indicate that 0.5 m of SLR are predicted to occur between year 2045 and 2089, respectively. Using the modified NRC projection, 0.5 m of SLR is likely to occur around year 2066. Areas surrounding the Arcata Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) ponds vulnerable to tidal inundation from the 100-yr extreme high water level events for year 2012 existing sea levels (A, blue inundation) and 0.5-m SLR scenario (B, red inundation). The year 2000 100-yr water level (A) would not inundate the top of the outer WWTF levees, indicating that the WWTF ponds would not be inundated; although the inundation map shows that the ponds would be vulnerable to inundation during the 100-yr event. The 100yr event for the 0.5-m SLR scenario (B) shows that the top of the outer WWTF levees would be inundated at many locations, indicating that the ponds would be inundated for the 100-yr event with 0.5-m SLR.

The simulated SLR scenarios consisted of Year 2012 existing sea levels and four half-meter SLR increments of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0-m. Inundation vulnerability maps were produced to identify areas surrounding Humboldt Bay vulnerable to tidal inundation from existing and future sea levels. The results of this study have demonstrated: 1. Sea level rise will affect Humboldt Bay and the surrounding landscape in its existing condition. 2. Humboldt Bay water levels can be modeled in 2D using the EFDC modeling system. 3. The nontidal sea level models developed for the Crescent City tide gauge reproduce observed nontidal sea level heights and variability reasonably well using the three independent variables of wind, sea level pressure and ENSO variability. Predicted total hourly water levels (astronomical tide plus nontidal sea level) compare to tidal observations well. 4. The 100-yr HSLH series developed for the Crescent City tide gauge, which contains 639,011 hourly water level observations and 246,373 hourly predictions, can reproduce the gauge's observed water levels and variability. 5. The 2D hydrodynamic model driven solely by the 100-yr HSLH series developed for the Crescent City tide gauge can reproduce observed hourly water levels at three tide gauges in Humboldt Bay well, and also reproduce the daily maximum water level at five tide gauges. 6. The 100-yr HSLH series developed for the Crescent City tide gauge can be used to represent near shore ocean water levels, or still water levels, for the Humboldt Bay and Crescent City region. 7. Five SLR scenarios were assessed in this study: Year 2012 existing sea level and four half-meter SLR rise scenarios of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0-m. The four half-meter SLR scenarios are not tied to a specific future timeline, inherent to typical SLR projections. 8. The predicted water levels and inundation vulnerability maps for each SLR scenario represent conditions of SLR at any time in the future, assuming ground elevations of the Project DEM do not significantly change. 9. Twenty-five inundation vulnerability maps were produced for predicted Humboldt Bay water levels of MHHW, MMMW, MAMW, and the 10-and 100-yr extreme high water level events for the five SLR scenarios. 10. The tidal inundation maps show areas surrounding Humboldt Bay landward of MHW vulnerable to existing and future sea levels that are currently protected from inundation due to the natural shoreline, levees, railroad and/or road grades, or other such barriers. 11. The inundation vulnerability maps indicate areas vulnerable to inundation, not areas currently inundated. 12. A MHW map of Humboldt Bay was developed to show areas of the bay currently inundated below MHW, which coincides well with the Laird (2013) mapped shoreline. 13. The inundation vulnerability maps and MHW map are provided as kmz files, which can be opened in Google Earth, and shapefiles, which can be imported into GIS software such as ArcGIS. 14. The higher RSL rise rates observed in Humboldt Bay due to down trending VLM indicate that a global rise in sea levels will affect Humboldt Bay faster than other parts of U.S. west coast; and within the bay the southern end will be affected sooner than the northern portions of the bay. 15. The 100-yr extreme event is approximately 2 m higher than MSL, 1 m higher than MHHW, and 0.5 m higher than MAMW. The 2-yr extreme event is approximately equal to MAMW, and the 1-yr event is only slightly greater than MMMW. 16. The 1.1-yr extreme event under the 0.5-m SLR scenario is approximately equal to the existing condition 100-yr event. 17. Humboldt Bay water levels have increased approximately 0.5 m over the last 100 years due to a high RSL rise rate. 18. The reclaimed former tidelands around Humboldt Bay represent the most vulnerable areas to existing and future sea levels. 19. Many of the former tideland areas are protected by relatively low elevation levees and railroad/road grades, such as Highway 101. Many of the bay levees are actively eroding, unmaintained and at elevations subject to overtopping by extreme high tides and storm events (Laird, 2013). 20. If the levees or grades protecting the bay's existing vulnerable areas were to fail or breach, many of the low-lying areas would flood from daily high tides, while higher areas would flood from extreme events. 21. Sea level rise will increase the threat of levee failure, and increase the frequency of extreme events overtopping the levees and road and railroad grades protecting the bay's vulnerable areas."}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "text": "Following are some recommendations regarding future sea level rise work for Humboldt Bay. 1.
