The OFS use these forecast guidance to form their open ocean boundary forcings. To support future development of NOS OFS in the eastern U.S. coastal waters, we assessed the performance of the G-RTOFS forecast guidance for SSH, SST, and SSS, as well as the performance of the ETSS and ESTOFS forecast guidance for SSH. Our intention is to gain insight into the model performance from two perspectives: (1) the model performance across a forecast cycle (FC) and (2) the evolution of performance associated with the forecast hour (FH) of the forecast cycle. Accordingly, we developed a FC based method and a FH based method, which are further described in Chapter 2. We applied the FC based method to estimate the bias, standard deviation, and root-mean-squared error of a forecast cycle over a series of cycles. The FH based method was applied to estimate the root-mean-squared error for each given forecast hour of the forecast cycle over a series of cycles. We conducted model-data comparisons over four separate month long periods: January 2013, April 2013, July 2013, and October 2013. These months roughly correlate to winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. In this way, the analysis covers all four seasons of the year. Table A lists the station averaged bias, standard deviation, and root-mean-squared error. These seasonally averaged values were calculated using the FC based method. As can be seen from the table, these model systems, especially G-RTOFS, produce forecast results with a very large negative bias. Figure A depicts the performance of water level forecast guidance, in terms of RMSE (root mean square error) calculated by the FH based method and averaged over all stations, of the G-RTOFS, ETSS, and ESTOFS model systems through the first 48 hours of their forecast cycles. In general, the forecast guidance of SSH from the three systems demonstrates satisfactory agreement with observations. Though the skill of each model system varies by season, the figure depicts values which are averaged over all four seasons. As can be seen from Figure A, the skill of each model system degrades as the forecast hour progresses through the cycle. The figure also demonstrates that for each of the systems, the rate of skill deterioration is greatest during the initial 24 hours. The rate of deterioration then levels out during the remainder of the forecast cycle. Figure A indicates that on average, ETSS has the highest skill (lowest RMSE) in forecasting water levels. Following ETSS are G-RTOFS, then ESTOFS. The mean values which appear in Table B were obtained by averaging all the hourly values, hours 1 through 48, for each of the model systems. Note that the mean RMSE values which appear in Table B are significantly smaller than the mean RMSE values appearing in Table A. The values appearing in Table B were calculated using the FH based method. The FH based method includes an adjustment (initial model point -initial observed point) added to the entire forecast cycle for each day. This offset effectively removes the bias, resulting in a much smaller RMSE value.  We evaluated the performance of the G-RTOFS SST forecast guidance by comparing the model results with observed data from CO-OPS physical oceanography observation stations, NDBC buoys, and the WOA09 database. As can be seen in Table C, the RMSE from the WOA09 comparison is the largest in magnitude, while the NDBC data fit best. We evaluated the performance of the G-RTOFS SSS forecast guidance by comparing the model results with observed data from NDBC buoys and the WOA09 database. The SSS forecast guidance of G-RTOFS demonstrates poor agreement with data from the nine NDBC buoy stations. The station bias ranges between 0 and 20 psu. The large RMSE values occur at stations 4, 5, and 6 which are located within the estuaries of the mid-Atlantic. The station averaged RMSE is highest during the summer at about 10.5 psu and lowest during the fall at about 7.5 psu. The SSS forecast guidance of G-RTOFS demonstrates a satisfactory agreement with the WOA09 database. The station bias ranges between -4 and 4 psu through all four seasons, including outlier values."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The National Ocean Service of NOAA has been developing operational forecast systems to produce nowcast/forecast guidance of ocean state variables including water levels, sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and three-dimensional (3-D) currents in the estuaries, coastal waters, and shelf waters of the U.S. These operational forecast systems produce valuable information to support the safety of maritime navigation, emergency response, and coastal environment management. The backbone of the various operational forecast systems are the hydrodynamic models. These models are forced with tidal and subtidal water levels, temperature, salinity, and currents on the model domain's open ocean boundary, as well as with meteorological forcing on the surface and with river discharge at the river entrances. Open boundary forcing plays a critical role in the accuracy of the OFS nowcast/forecast guidance. The National Weather Service (NWS) of NOAA has developed the Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (G-RTOFS) and the Extra-Tropical Storm Surge (ETSS) Model. These two operational systems are run at the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) of NOAA. The OFS developed by NOS normally use subtidal water level forecast guidance from G-RTOFS and ETSS and 3-dimensional (3-D) temperature and salinity forecast guidance from G-RTOFS to drive their hydrodynamic model runs. The OFS use the ETSS subtidal water level output as backup when the G-RTOFS water level output is not available. Hence, it is worthwhile to evaluate the performance of the two models. As a first step in model evaluation, this project focuses on assessing the G-RTOFS skill in forecasting subtidal water levels, SST, and SSS, as well as on the skill of ETSS and ESTOFS in forecasting water levels. In the present project, we are assessing the G-RTOFS, ETSS, and ESTOFS skill in the U.S. eastern coastal waters and we focus on four months: January, April, July, and October of 2013. These months roughly correspond to the seasons of winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. We evaluated the model performance by comparing the model results with in-situ observations (for water level and SST) as well as with climatological data from the monthly world ocean database (for SST and SSS). The remainder of Section 1 introduces background information concerning the setups and operations of the G-RTOFS, ETSS, and ESTOFS as well as background information on the observational data sets used in this study. Section 2 describes the technical details of two methods, namely, the forecast cycle (FC) based method and the forecast hour (FH) based method, used to assess the model performance. Sections 3-5 discuss the model performance of SSH (for G-RTOFS, ETSS, and ESTOFS), SST (for G-RTOFS), and SSS (for G-RTOFS) guidance, respectively. Section 6 summarizes the model assessment results and the methods used to attain those results."}, {"section_title": "G-RTOFS, ETSS, and ESTOFS", "text": "This section provides an introduction to the model setup and operations of G-RTOFS, ETSS, and ESTOFS."}, {"section_title": "G-RTOFS", "text": "G-RTOFS is based on the Naval Oceanographic Office's (NAVO) configuration of the 1/12 o resolution eddy resolving global Hybrid Coordinates Ocean Model (HYCOM) (G-RTOFS, 2011). It is initialized daily with NAVO generated initial conditions using the Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (NCODA) system (Metzger, et al., 2014). The system assimilates in situ profiles of temperature and salinity from a variety of sources and remotely sensed SST, SSH and sea-ice concentrations. G-RTOFS is forced with 3-hourly momentum, radiation, and precipitation fluxes from NOAA'S operational Global Forecast System (GFS) fields. The G-RTOFS ocean model has 32 vertical hybrid layers (isopycnal in the deep water, isolevel in the mixed layer, and sigma in shallow water). G-RTOFS has a horizontal grid of dimension 4500\uf0b43298. The grid has an Arctic bi-polar patch north of 47 o N and a Mercator projection south of 47 o N through 78.6 o S (Figure 1). The coastline is fixed at 10-m isobaths with the Bering Straits being open. The potential temperature is referenced to 2000 m depth and the first level is fixed at 1 m depth. G-RTOFS became operational at the NWS NCEP Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) on October 24, 2011. It generates a forecast cycle four times a day at hours 00z, 06z, 12z, and 18z. In this study, we make use of the forecast cycle generated at hour 00z. Each forecast cycle produces, at three hour intervals, forecast output for sea surface values of SSH, SST, and SSS and at six hour intervals, forecast output for full volume parameters including 3-dimensional temperature, salinity, and currents. Each forecast cycle extends from hour 00 to hour 144. The period of operation ran from October 25 2011 through July 25 2013. On this date, the length of the forecast cycle was extended from 144 hours to 192 hours. G-RTOFS has run at NCEP, with this extended forecast cycle, ever since.

It is a variation of the Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model developed by NWS (ETSS, 1992). It is a prognostic, two-dimensional, barotropic model forced by real time output of winds and air pressure from the GFS run at NCEP. ETSS has been applied to the continental shelf and coastal waters of multiple regions off the U.S. coast including Alaska (Arctic Ocean), the west coast (Pacific Ocean), the east coast (Atlantic Ocean), and the Gulf of Mexico. Figure 1.3 displays a map showing ETSS forecast guidance domains located in the Arctic Ocean and the Gulf of Alaska, in the Pacific Ocean off the U.S. west coast, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Atlantic Ocean off the southeast, mid-Atlantic, and northeast coasts of the U.S. ETSS initially ran operationally at NCEP, in their Central Computing System (CCS), one time daily (00z) out to 96 hours producing numerical storm surge guidance (subtidal water levels) for extra-tropical systems. Beginning on August 26, 2012, the ETSS operation was transitioned onto the Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputer Systems (WCOSS). NCEP disseminates the ETSS forecast guidance of subtidal water levels in both point and gridded formats. We used the point guidance outputs for the present study. Figure 1.4 shows the station locations along the U.S. East Coast and along the Gulf of Mexico.

We assessed the model performance from two perspectives: forecast cycle-based (FC) method and forecast hour-based (FH) method. The former evaluates the performance over the forecast cycle as a whole, whereas the latter evaluates the performance at individual hours within the forecast cycle. G-RTOFS generates four forecast cycles, one every six hours (00z, 06z, 12z, 18z), per day. Each cycle produces forecast guidance at 3 hour intervals from hour 00 to hour 144 or hour 192 (Section 1.2). Since all four cycles utilize the same model configuration (grid) and forcing data of the same quality, it is reasonable to believe that the model will perform equally well across all four cycles. For this reason, we focus on evaluating the model performance of the 00 UTC cycle. In the present study, we focus on the forecast through 144 hours. Hence, every forecast cycle produces a 49 point time series of SSH, SST, and SSS corresponding to hours 00, 03, 06, \u2026, 144. The ETSS water level forecast is generated once a day at 00 UTC. This daily forecast cycle produces an hourly forecast from hour 01 through hour 96. So each forecast cycle produces a 96 point time series of SSH corresponding to hours 01, 02, 03, \u2026, 96. ESTOFS generates four forecast cycles at hours 00z, 06z, 12z, and 18z each day. Each cycle produces hourly forecast guidance from hour 01 through hour 180. So each forecast cycle produces a 180 point time series of SSH corresponding to hours 01, 02, 03, \u2026 180. For each variable (SSH, SST, and SSS) at a given station, we first compile two coincident time series. The first is from the model output and the second is from the observed data. Data points in the two time series correspond to the same model forecast guidance hour. For each pair of values, model and observed, we subtract the observed value from the model value to get a time series representing the model-data difference. We then apply the FC and FH methods to this new time series to assess the model performance. Sections 2.2 and 2.3 describe details of the FC and FH methods, respectively. Since the methods used for SSH, SST, and SSS are the same, in the following sections we will designate the variable names only if necessary."}, {"section_title": "Model and Data Time Series", "text": "To compare the forecast with observations, we first identify the model grid cells located closest to the observed data stations. We create the model-data difference time series by subtracting each observed data value from the corresponding model value. Since we utilize one forecast cycle, the forecast cycle generated at hour 00 UTC, we end up with one time series for each day. For G-RTOFS, each time series consists of 49 data points corresponding to the three-hourly forecast guidance from hours 00 through 144 UTC. For ETSS, each time series consists of 96 data points corresponding to the hourly forecast guidance from hours 01 through 96.

This method reveals how the model skill evolves with the increasing of the forecast guidance hour. Figure 2.8 illustrates how this method organizes the model and observed data to estimate the model error statistics. As described in Section 2.1, we compile either 30 or 31 model-data pairs for each given month, with each pair corresponding to a time series from one forecast cycle. This essentially forms a two-dimensional array; one dimension is the forecast guidance hour and the other is the daily forecast cycle. The FH method focuses on contrasting model-data discrepancies at each forecast guidance hour. We therefore subset the 2-D array into multiple 1-D time series according to the forecast guidance hour, i.e., each 1-D series consists of data points corresponding to the same forecast hour, but from multiple forecast cycles. The number of pairs of data points in each time series is either 30 or 31 depending on the number of days (i.e., forecast cycles) in the month under consideration. The FH based method was created to investigate the evolution of model skill with the increasing of forecast hour. To characterize the trend of variation, we offset the model time series SSH by the amount of the first data point minus the first model point. In essence, we adjust the initial forecast point to match the corresponding observed data point. We then apply this same offset to all remaining points in the forecast cycle.

The RMSE values are greatest during April, and are relatively smaller for the remaining months. The RMSE ranges between 30 and 70 cm in January 2013, 35 and 80 cm in April 2013, 25 and 75 cm in July 2013, and between 30 and 65 cm in October 2013. G-RTOFS performed worst in the spring. As can be seen in Table 3.1, April 2013 has a station averaged RMSE of 55.6 cm. In addition, April 2013 has the largest number of stations with RMSE values which approach 80 cm. The maximum RMSE by season is 70 cm, 80 cm, 75 cm, and 65 cm which occur in January 2013, April 2013, July 2013, and October 2013, respectively. The RMSE demonstrates a distinct spatial disparity. It varies in a 40-cm range in January, a 45 cm range in April, a 50-cm range during July, and a 35-cm range in October. Throughout the seasons of the year, the Gulf of Mexico stations appear to outperform the stations of the mid-Atlantic and of the northeast coast. There is a very large negative bias throughout all four seasons. This negative bias appears largest in spring, with a station averaged value of -53.6 cm (Table 3.1), and is relatively smaller for the remaining months. This large negative bias throughout the region, especially in the Gulf of Mexico and along the southern U.S. Atlantic coast, demonstrates the datum problem with the G-RTOFS model/system. This datum issue stems from the fact that G-RTOFS is a global model and that the model domain is the entire ocean surface of the world. In all four seasons, there is one station (Lewisetta, 8635750) in the Chesapeake Bay with a large positive bias ranging between 20 and 35 cm. This one station is a statistical outlier and the elevated values of mean difference should not be considered valid. The range of STD is moderate, from around 5 to 11 cm, with the largest deviations occurring in January (10.2 cm). Standard deviation values appear to be smallest during July (5.6 cm), and they are small during October as well (7.4 cm). Typically, January is subject to more stormy weather while July tends to more placid. The breaks in plot continuity are due to observed data gaps occurring at several stations during these months. \nFigures 3.8(a)-(d) display maps of the model root-mean-square error (RMSE) in January, April, July, and October of 2013. The RMSE typically ranges between 10 and 36 cm with variations in different months. It is around 10 to 22 cm in January, 10 to 24 cm in April, 12 to 29 cm in July, and somewhat larger around 18 to 36 cm in October. In this instance, ETSS performs better in winter and in the spring than it does in the summer and in fall. The RMSE was close to a uniform value of 10 to 22 cm across the region in January with just slightly greater RMSE across the mid-Atlantic region in April. Performance deteriorated across the region in July, most notably across the mid-Atlantic and the eastern Gulf of Mexico. As shown in Table 3.1, the station averaged RMSE value for July was 16.9 cm. Performance deteriorated further in October, most notably across the southern Atlantic coast. The station averaged RMSE was 22.2 cm and RMSE values reached a high in the mid-Atlantic region of around 36 cm.

In all four months, the station averaged bias is below 0 suggesting that the model under predicts the water level. The negative bias is fairly modest in winter and spring at around -8 to -9 cm. This negative bias increases to around -21 by October, however. In January and in April, the STD was moderate, around 6 to 7 cm. For the remaining months, the STD is relatively smaller.

For the majority of stations, the mean bias is below 0 for all four seasons indicating that ESTOFS tends to under-predict subtidal water levels throughout the year. The bias does seem to vary by season. The station averaged bias is as small as -3.3 cm during April and as large as -19.1 cm during October. The magnitude of standard deviation is relatively larger, almost by a factor of 2, for ESTOFS than it is for ETSS. STD values appear to be largest in January at about 5 and 20 cm, with a station averaged deviation of 12.5 cm. The standard deviation decreases slightly to about 5 to 12 cm during April.

From there, the model performance deteriorates markedly by forecast hour 24. As the forecast hour increases, the skill decreases. However, the degree of deterioration varies by month. The G-RTOFS performance was least favorable in January with many stations at 25 cm or above by hour 144. January was followed by April, then October. G-RTOFS performance was most favorable in July with only a couple of stations going over 20 cm RMSE by hour 144. The G-RTOFS forecasts demonstrate spatial variability. In general, the forecasts demonstrate better skill at the stations located on the Gulf of Mexico (especially the southern Florida stations), the east coast south of Virginia, and at stations located to the northeast of Long Island Sound. It is worth noting that the model skill demonstrates the least spatial and temporal variability in the summer season; see Figure 3.13 for the July 2013 result. The RMSE is uniform across the region at hour 6 and there is only slight variability by hour 24. There is one station in the mid-Atlantic region (Oregon Inlet Marina, NC, 8652587) with a problematically high RMSE at all hours throughout the forecast cycle.

The oscillation is due to an alias from the low sampling rate, daily in this case, of the underlying time series."}, {"section_title": "RMSE at Individual Stations", "text": "In the previous passage, we discussed the model skill averaged over all stations. Now, we examine the skill at the individual stations. In general, the model demonstrates evenly satiable skills at hour 12 across all stations and seasons with RMSE generally less than 15 cm. At each station, model skill gradually degrades with increasing forecast hour. Model skill is good within the first 12 hours of the forecast cycle. For instance, for all four months, the RMSE ranges between 6 and 15 cm at hour 12. The plots for all four months clearly demonstrate the rate of RMSE deterioration is fastest from hours 12 through 24 of the forecast cycle. The RMSE increases to as high as 20 cm at hour 24 at mid-Atlantic stations during January and April. The RMSE gradually reaches its peak between hours 48 and 96. However, the degradation varies by month. It was most severe in January and April, less severe in July, and at an immediate level in October. The model performance varies by latitude. The RMSE deterioration is most marked at the midlatitude stations around 38 -40 o and in the region of New York Harbor and Long Island Sound at around 40 -42 o (see Table A.1 for the station meta data). The more problematic stations are in the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay regions, and in the New York Harbor and the Long Island Sound region. The spatial disparity is for the most part evident by hour 24 in the forecast cycle.      \nIn the previous passage, we discussed the model skill averaged over all stations. Now, we will examine the skill at each individual station. The plots for all four months demonstrate that the rate of RMSE deterioration is much more gradual for ESTOFS than for either ETSS or G-RTOFS. There is very little deterioration in model skill during January even by hour 180. Two stations on the southern east coast and two stations in the Gulf of Mexico show measurable deterioration to about 25 cm. April is the month showing the greatest deterioration in model skill with forecast hour. Several stations in the Gulf of Mexico have an RMSE above 30 cm. Skill deterioration subsides somewhat in July, and further still in October. The model performance varies by region and by latitude. The RMSE deterioration is most marked at the mid-latitude east coast stations around 38 -40 o and in the region of New York Harbor and Long Island Sound at around 40 -42 o (see Table A.3 for the station meta data). The more problematic stations are located in the Chesapeake Bay: Cambridge (8571892), Tolchester Beach (8573364), Baltimore (8574680), Annapolis (8575512), Solomons Island (8577330), Kiptopeake (8632200), and Lewisetta (8635750), in the Delaware Bay region: Lewes (8557380), Cape May (8536110), and in the New York Harbor and Long Island Sound region: Sandy Hook (8531680), Kings Point (8516945), and Bridgeport (8467150). There are several stations along the gulf coast which appear to be problematic as well.      \nWe now examine the skill at the individual stations. Figures 4.4-4.7 display RMSE maps for all stations in (a) January 2013, (b) April 2013, (c) July 2013, and October 2013, respectively. Six plots in each figure correspond to forecast hours 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 144, respectively. For the months of January, April, and July, the distinguishing characteristic is the spatial variation of the RMSE. During January, two stations on the Carolina coast, as well as a station to the northeast of the Gulf of Maine, appear to be problematic. During April, the skill at the Carolina stations appears to be improved, but the problematic station appears to be one station to the north on the coast of Virginia. In July, the RMSE at hour six ranges from about 1 o C to around 5 o C (or above). The model skill does not appear to degrade that quickly by hour 144. The rate at which model skill degrades appears to be much slower for temperature than for surface water levels. The RMSE during October appears to be quite a bit smaller than for the other months, never going much over 2.5 o C.   \nWe now examine skill at the individual stations. Figures 4.11 -4.14 display RMSE maps for all stations in (a) January 2013, (b) April 2013, (c) July 2013, and (d) October 2013. Six plots display snap shots of RMSE maps at forecast hours 6, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 144. The RMSE maps for individual forecast hours reveal consistent results across all four months as the RMSE values increase gradually from hour 0 to hour 144 (Figure 4.10). Across all four months, the deterioration of model skill with forecast hour is not that marked. The feature which appears to stand out most is the spatial variability. There is a cluster of stations off the Carolina coast which appear to have an RMSE of 1 to 2 o C higher than for the remainder of the stations, but somewhat less so for October. There is a northeastern station which appears to be problematic as well, but only for January. In both April and July, there is a station off the coast of North Carolina which appears to be problematic. Model skill was highest in October. Skill was moderate for April and July, and least for January.   \n"}, {"section_title": "ESTOFS Forecast", "text": "We now compare the ESTOFS water level forecasts with measurements at 54 CO-OPS water level stations.

For January, July, and October of 2013, the RMSE at the mid-Atlantic stations of the Chesapeake Bay, the Delaware Bay, and Long Island Sound are noticeably greater. The spatial variability is of interest in October.

We applied both the forecast-cycle (FC) based method and the forecast-hour (FH) based method in the analysis (Section 2). Table 3.1 lists the station averaged bias, standard deviation, and root-mean-squared error for the winter, spring, summer, and fall, estimated using the FC based method. G-RTOFS displays a very large negative bias throughout the year with station averaged values of -45.3 cm in the winter, -53.6 cm in the spring, -47.6 cm in the summer, and -49.7 cm in the fall. The size of the negative bias of G-RTOFS indicates a datum issue within the model/system. The negative bias of ETSS starts small but grows more negative through the year. The station averaged bias is -7.6 cm in the winter and -9.1 cm in the spring. It jumps to -16.0 cm in the summer, then to -21.3 cm in the fall. The values of negative ESTOFS bias are much more modest and vary somewhat through the year with a range of -20 to 0 cm in the winter, -5 to 3 cm in the spring, -20 to 0 cm in the summer, and -25 to 0 cm in the fall. The standard deviation of G-RTOFS ranges between 5 and 20 cm. The standard deviation of ETSS is the smallest, ranging between 1 and 9 cm. The STD of ESTOFS is somewhat larger, ranging between 5 and 20 cm over the four seasons. The RMSE for G-RTOFS (RMSEG-RTOFS) peaks during the spring with values at many stations reaching 70 cm or greater and a station averaged value of 55.6 cm. RMSE values drop a bit in summer to a station average of 49.5 cm, and then rise just a bit in fall to an average of 50.9 cm. The RMSE of ETSS is moderately low in both January and in April with station averaged values of 11.9 cm and 11.7 cm, respectively. The RMSE increases in summer to a station averaged value of 16.9 cm. The RMSE peaks during October with values ranging between 20 and 38 cm and a station averaged value of 22.2 cm. The RMSE of ESTOFS is more modest than that of G-RTOFS throughout the year. The RMSE never goes much above 30 cm with seasonal highs of 30, 28, 28, and 30 corresponding to the seasons of winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. Overall, the RMSE for ETSS and ESTOFS are comparable, while the RMSEG-RTOFS is greater by a factor of two or three than that of the other two. \nWe evaluated the performance of the G-RTOFS SST forecast guidance by comparing the model results with observed data from CO-OPS physical oceanography observation stations, NDBC buoys, and the WOA09 database. Overall, the RMSE from the WOA09 comparison reveals the largest magnitudes and seasonal variability of model error. Table 4.1 lists the station averaged bias, standard deviation, and root-mean-squared error for the winter, spring, summer, and fall estimated using the FC based method. The bias of G-RTOFS with respect to the CO-OPS physical oceanography observation stations is variable throughout the year, though it does tend positive. It varies between -2 and 5 o C in the winter, and between -5 and 3 o C in the spring. The bias reaches its most negative station averaged value during the spring at -0.79 o C. The bias varies between -8 and 5 o C in the summer, with one station (number 5) having the anomalous value of -8 o C. The range of bias values is more limited in the fall with the average value at 0.62 o C. G-RTOFS vs. the NDBC buoy data demonstrates similar variability with regard to model bias. The model bias reaches almost 5 o C in the winter, and overall leans slightly positive throughout the year. The model bias with respect to WOA09 locations reaches extreme values of greater than 15 o C at a number of stations during the summer, and as high as 12 o C during the fall. The model bias reaches negative values of less than -10 o C during the winter. These extreme examples of model bias require further investigation. The standard deviations of the G-RTOFS results vs. the CO-OPS physical oceanography observation stations range between 1 and 3 o C, with the larger deviations occurring in the spring and summer. The standard deviations of the G-RTOFS results vs. the NDBC buoy data tend to be small in both winter and spring, but there are a few outliers reaching perhaps 3 o C. In the summer, the standard deviations grow larger with a station average value of 0.79 o C. The standard deviations of the G-RTOFS results vs. the WOA09 climatology are quite small throughout the year, never much larger than 1 o C. The RMSE of G-RTOFS vs. the CO-OPS physical oceanography observation stations displays somewhat greater magnitude and spatial variability in summer than during the other seasons. The RMSE is no higher than 6 o C in January, and ranges from about 1.5 to 7 o C in July. The station averaged value of RMSE is 2.05 o C in July. The RMSE of G-RTOFS vs. the NDBC buoy stations was highest during July as well, with RMSE values at around 1.5 to 5.5 o C. The station averaged RMSEG-RTOFS was 1.53 o C. The RMSE of G-RTOFS vs. the WOA09 climatology displayed spatial variability across all four months. The largest spatial variability occurred in July 2013; many stations along the Atlantic coast and in the Gulf of Mexico had an RMSE approaching 10 o C or more. The range of RMSE values was almost as great for October. In January, the RMSE generally does not go above 6 o C. Overall, when compared with observed data, the RMSE values seem quite large for G-RTOFS vs. the WOA09 climatology. Model skill does not appear to degrade rapidly as the forecast hour projects into the future. This result differs from the case of the G-RTOFS SSH forecast, where model skill gradually degrades with increasing forecast hour (Section 3.2). \nThe SSS forecast guidance of G-RTOFS demonstrates poor agreement with data from the nine NDBC buoy stations. The station bias ranges between 0 and 20 psu. The large RMSE values occur at stations 4,5, and 6. These stations are located within the estuaries of the mid-Atlantic. The station averaged RMSE is highest during the summer at about 10.5 psu and lowest during the fall at about 7.5 psu. The SSS forecast guidance of G-RTOFS demonstrates a satisfactory agreement with the WOA09 database. The station bias ranges between -4 and 4 psu through all four seasons, including outlier values.

Hence, any comparisons with this database reflect the model skill in a climatological sense. Since we are comparing the model results with climatological data sets, it would not make sense scientifically to address details of the forecast hour based model performance. As a result, we will investigate only the FC based method. Figures 5.8(a)-(d) show the maps of the model root-mean-square error in January, April, July, and October of 2013.

In July, the RMSE rose to higher than 10 o C and almost as high in October. The mean RMSE was 8.88 o C for July and 6.35 o C for October. The RMSE displayed spatial variability across all four months. It displayed a large spatial variability in July 2013. The range of RMSE values was almost as great for October. The range of RMSE values was much less, and the RMSE values were quite a bit less as well for January and April of 2013. In January, there appear to be several outlier stations with high RMSE values around 8 o C, but generally, the RMSE does not go above 6 o C. The mean RMSE was 2.63 o C for January. In a climatological sense, the G-RTOFS had much better skill in the winter and spring than in the summer and fall.  Table C.1 lists the geographical locations in longitude and latitude for these data points. The mean model-data difference ranges from -10 to 5 o C in January, and from -5 to 4 o C in April. In both cases, the mean bias is fairly close to 0: -0.80 o C for January and 0.26 o C for April.

This positive bias is again evident in October as all station bias values are over 0 o C. Overall, the range of model bias is much greater when the G-RTOFS results are compared with WOA09 than when compared with either the CO-OPS observations or with the NDBC observations.   \nFigures 5.1(a)-(d) display RMSE maps for January, April, July, and October of 2013, respectively. All four months show a similar range of amplitude and spatial variability of RMSE. The RMSE was around 1 to 10 psu for January and around 1 to 10 psu again in April. The RMSE was highest during July with all but three stations near 10 psu. The RMSE subsided a bit in October especially in the Gulf where the RMSE dropped to around 6 to 7 psu. The station near the entrance to the Chesapeake Bay dropped to about 6 psu as well. The RMSE is huge in the mid-Atlantic region of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Here, the RMSE is 10 psu or greater year round. Figures 5.2(a)-(d) show the mean and standard deviation of model errors at nine NDBC stations in January, April, July, and October of 2013. The typical mean model-data difference ranges between 0 and 20 psu with some variation by month. The large model error occurred at stations 4, 5, and 6 where the model error is near 20 psu year round. The model mean is biased lower than the mean SSS of the observed data. The observed data locations are inside of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Within the body of an estuarine system, the salinity will be lower. The locations of the grid cells do not precisely match the physical locations. The model calculates a value of salinity appropriate for a location outside of the estuarine, a more ocean like value of salinity. The corresponding values of STD display little variation in size. Through all seasons, the STD is very small, except at station 9 where the STD grows to perhaps 5 psu.  Remarkably, RMSE remained at a nearly constant level, or in the case of April, dropped slightly through the forecast cycle. The RMSE averaged around 9.5 psu in January, 9.4 psu in April, 10.5 psu in July, and 7.5 psu in October 2013. For the months of April, July, and October, these plots reveal the familiar sinusoidal, diurnal period, signal. The plot from January 2013 lacks this feature, however. The plotted points depict more of a spread pattern. Figure 5.3 displays the RMSE averaged over all nine stations at each forecast hour in (a) January 2013, (b) April 2013, (c) July 2013, and October 2013. In all four months, the RMSE either remains constant, or counter intuitively, decreases slightly. The RMSE from January 2013, July 2013, as well as from October 2013 remains largely constant. The RMSE from April 2013 seems to decrease slightly with increasing forecast hour. The sinusoidal oscillation is clear in three of the four months as well. The amplitude of the oscillation is around 0.5 in all months except July, where it is closer to 1.0 psu. The RMSE maps for all four seasons reveal consistent results. The deterioration of model skill with forecast hour is not that marked. The feature which stands out most is the spatial variability. There is a cluster of stations in the mid-Atlantic region (Chesapeake and Delaware Bays) which have high RMSE values and two stations along the Gulf coast with high RMSE values. The RMSE values for psu of 5 or greater probably require further investigation.

These forecast outputs are used in preparing open ocean boundary forcing conditions. To support future development of the NOS OFS in eastern U.S. coastal waters, and in the Gulf of Mexico, we assessed the performance of SSH forecasts from the G-RTOFS, ETSS, and ESTOFS and the forecasts of sea-surface temperature and sea-surface salinity from the G-RTOFS. This report summarizes the procedures utilized and the results which were obtained. Chapter 1 describes background information concerning the set up and operation of the G-RTOFS, the ETSS, and the ESTOFS. The chapter also explains how the observed data (water level, SST, and SSS) used in model-data comparisons is obtained and how it is processed. Chapter 2 explains technical details of the two methods used to assess model performance: the forecast cycle (FC) based method and the forecast hour (FH) based method. Chapters 3-5 discuss the model performance of SSH (from G-RTOFS, ETSS, and ESTOFS), SST (from G-RTOFS), and SSS (from G-RTOFS) forecast guidance, respectively. Our intention is to investigate both the temporal (seasonal) variability and the spatial variability of model performance. We chose four monthly periods: January, April, July, and October of 2013. These four months align roughly with the seasons of winter, spring, summer, and fall. We assessed the model performance from two perspectives. The first was to assess the performance across the entire forecast cycle over multiple forecast cycles. The second was to assess performance with respect to a single forecast hour, over multiple forecast cycles. These two perspectives correspond to the methods described in Chapter 2: the forecast cycle (FC) based method and the forecast hour (FH) based method. The FC based method calculates bias and rootmean-squared error (RMSE) across each forecast cycle. The FH based method assesses how the model performance evolves as a forecast cycle progresses through the hours of the forecast cycle. This method calculates bias and RMSE of model results at each forecast hour over multiple forecast cycles. G-RTOFS displays a very large negative water level bias year round reaching a magnitude of 75 cm at one station during the spring. The station averaged bias value for G-RTOFS is highest during the spring at -53.6 cm. The year round negative bias is indicative of the datum issue that G-RTOFS has being a global model. In contrast, the model bias from ETSS is moderate year round. The station averaged bias is -7.6 cm in the winter and -9.1 cm in the fall. That bias value increases to -16.0 cm in the summer, and increases again to -21.3 cm in the fall. The range of bias values that ESTOFS displays through the seasons is of similar magnitude to that of ETSS, and is also negative. The RMSE of ETSS (RMSEETSS) appears to be moderate year round. The RMSEETSS ranges from around 10 to 21 cm in the winter, and from around 18 to 36 cm in the fall. The one station with a value of 36 cm appears to be an outlier. The station averaged value of RMSE is 22.2 cm. The RMSE of G-RTOFS is of an order of magnitude more than double that of ETSS. RMSEG-RTOFS ranges from approximately 25 to 75 cm during July and from around 30 to 65 cm during October. The station averaged RMSE value for G-RTOFS during July is 49.5 cm compared with a value of 16.9 cm for ETSS. The ESTOFS RMSE is comparable to that of ETSS; it ranges from around 16 to 30 cm in the winter and around 18 to 30 cm in the fall. With respect to the forecast hour, the skill of all three models degrades as a forecast progresses into the later hours of the cycle. RMSEETSS increases monotonically from less than 1 cm at the beginning of a forecast cycle to around 8 to 14 cm near the end of the cycle. The RMSE of the G-RTOFS SSH forecast increases monotonically from less than 2 cm at the start of a forecast cycle, to around 12 to 18 cm at the end of the cycle. Model skill exhibits seasonal variability. The maximum RMSEETSS are 14 cm, 12 cm, 8 cm, and 11.5 cm in the winter, spring, summer, and fall, respectively. The maximum RMSEG-RTOFS are 18 cm, 15 cm, 12 cm, and 14 cm which correspond to the winter, spring, summer, and fall. The performance of G-RTOFS SST forecast guidance demonstrates some seasonal variability. The RMSE of G-RTOFS vs. the CO-OPS physical oceanography observation stations displays somewhat greater magnitude and spatial variability in summer than during the other seasons. The RMSE is no higher than 6 o C in January, and ranges from about 1.5 to 7 o C in July. The RMSE of the G-RTOFS vs. NDBC buoy stations was highest during July as well, with RMSE values at around 1.5 to 5.5 o C. The RMSE of G-RTOFS vs. the WOA09 climatology displayed spatial variability across all four months. The largest spatial variability occurred in July 2013 where many stations along the Atlantic coast and in the Gulf of Mexico had an RMSE approaching 10 o C or more. The range of RMSE values was almost as great for October. In January, the RMSE generally does not go above 6 o C. Overall, when compared with observed data, the RMSE values seem rather large for G-RTOFS surface temperature no matter which data source is used for comparison. The performance is more satisfactory in the winter and spring than in the summer and fall. The agreement between model results and WOA09 is very poor, especially during summer and fall. The magnitude of bias of G-RTOFS SST values vs. observed is highest when compared with values from the WOA09 database. The model bias reaches extreme values of greater than 15 o C at a number of stations during the summer, and as high as 12 o C during the fall. The bias reaches negative values of less than -10 o C during the winter. These extreme examples of model bias require further investigation. Aside from the WOA09 comparison, the only anomalous values for bias are from the summer comparison with CO-OPS data which resulted in a bias of -8 to 5 o C. Model skill does not appear to degrade rapidly as the forecast hour projects into the later hours of the cycle as it did in the case of the G-RTOFS SSH forecast, where model skill steadily degrades with increasing forecast hour. The G-RTOFS SSS forecast guidance fares poorly when compared with data from the nine NDBC buoy stations. The station bias ranges between 0 and 20 psu. The large RMSE values occur at the mid-Atlantic stations, numbers 4, 5, and 6. These stations are located within the estuaries of the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. The station averaged RMSE is highest during the summer at about 10.5 psu and lowest during the fall at about 7.5 psu. The G-RTOFS SSS forecast guidance fares relatively better when compared with the WOA09 database, however. The station bias ranges between -4 and 4 psu through all four seasons, including outlier values. The STD is uniformly small. The RMSE is generally within the 1 to 3 psu range.
