INTRODUCTION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "I", "text": "N the current information age, new types of data emerge, and we have to face the new challenging problems associated with the analysis of these data. Among these new types of data, fuzzy number-valued outcomes are more and more used in real-life applications to model data from intrinsically imprecise attributes.\nWhen analyzing fuzzy data from a statistical viewpoint, the interest is often focused on the location (central tendency) of the random mechanism that generated the data. More concretely, fuzzy data can be assumed to be measurements of a random fuzzy number (fuzzy random variable in Puri and Ralescu's sense [1] ), and the statistical analysis may concern the location of the distribution of this fuzzy number-valued random element.\nA well-known measure of the location of the distribution of a random fuzzy number is its Aumann-type mean [1] , which satisfies the following.\n1) It is well defined under quite general conditions.\n2) It extends the mean value of a real-valued random variable.\n3) It preserves the main valuable properties of the real-valued mean (it is a \"linear\" operator-i.e., it is equivariant under fuzzy arithmetic-based linear transformations-it fulfills Fr\u00e9chet's principle w.r.t. most of the L 2 metrics between fuzzy numbers, and it is coherent with the usual fuzzy arithmetic). However, the Aumann-type mean also inherits from the mean of a real-valued random variable its high sensitivity to either the existence of outliers or even small changes in the data. When looking for a more robust location measure, it seems convenient to follow successful approaches that were developed for other types of data. In this respect, this paper focuses on the wellknown M-estimation approach.\nTo adapt the M-estimation approach to the case where the available data are fuzzy number-valued, two methodologies can be considered, namely:\n1) By using a suitable L 2 metric, fuzzy data can be represented as functional data resulting from (a convex cone within) certain Hilbert space-valued random elements (see, for instance, [2] and [3] ). Consequently, we may adopt existing results and methods from functional data analysis (more specifically, Kim and Scott's ideas and results [4] , [5] ) to the fuzzy case. This approach is valid whenever one can guarantee that the resulting measure cannot move out of the cone of fuzzy data. 2) Ad hoc fuzzy-valued M-estimators can be developed by using particular metrics based on specific representations of fuzzy numbers. For these representations, there should exist sets of necessary and sufficient conditions, which guarantee that the representation corresponds to a fuzzy number. Two ad hoc M-estimators have been introduced in [6] and [7] by using convenient L 1 metrics between fuzzy data. The corresponding fuzzy-valued M-estimators are quite easy to compute since their level sets can be expressed in terms of medians of real-valued random variables. It has also been shown that they preserve valuable properties of the median of a real-valued random variable, such as its robustness and strong consistency. This paper aims to approach the problem by using M-estimators, which have been proposed in the area of functional data analysis. Some recent proposals in the context of robust nonparametric density estimation connect ideas from traditional kernel density estimation with standard M-estimation.\nThese proposals can be adapted to Hilbert space-valued random elements, and they can be shown to yield valid estimators when restricted to random fuzzy numbers.\nThe relevant concepts about fuzzy number-valued data and random fuzzy numbers, i.e., 1-D random fuzzy sets, are recalled in Section II. In Section III, M-estimators of location for random fuzzy numbers are formally introduced. Necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing their existence as well as their expression as a weighted mean of the fuzzy-valued sample data are provided. This feature is crucial for fuzzy data to guarantee that the corresponding M-estimators are fuzzy-valued under the considered conditions. Properties of the M-estimators are examined in detail. The weighted mean expression for M-estimators allows us to extend the iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm used in classical M-estimation for the computation of sample location M-estimates for fuzzy data, as is illustrated by means of an example. Although the conditions for the existence of the M-estimators cover the extension of several important classical M-estimators, some recently proposed ad hoc M-estimators do not satisfy these conditions. We recall these proposals here for reasons of comparison. The use of fuzzy-valued M-estimators of location is illustrated by means of a real-life example.\nSection IV presents the results of several simulation studies that have been carried out to empirically compare the robust behavior of the location M-estimators introduced in this paper to the ad hoc proposals. Some concluding remarks are gathered in Section V."}, {"section_title": "II. FUZZY DATA AND RANDOM FUZZY NUMBERS", "text": "Fuzzy data appear in several domains. They are mainly used to describe imprecise human assessments such as ratings, opinions, judgments, or perceptions in a natural and easy-to-handle way. In particular, when conducting quality ratings, satisfaction valuations, and many other surveys, it can often not be expected that responses are expressed as fixed values in a precise scale, since they are essentially imprecise (see, e.g., [8] for a recent detailed discussion about this point).\nFuzzy number-valued data can be interpreted as a \"levelwise\" extension of interval-valued data, where the levels add a certain gradualness to the imprecision of interval-valued data. Formally, they are defined as follows:\nDefinition II.1. F * c (R) is the space of (bounded) fuzzy numbers, that is, the mappings U : R \u2192 [0, 1] such that their \u03b1-levels\nare nonempty compact intervals. U (x) can be interpreted as the \"degree of compatibility\" of \"x with U \" (or \"degree of truth\" of the assertion \" x is U \").\nTo perform statistics with fuzzy data, one of the key tools is given by the arithmetic to operate with these data. Most of the theoretical and practical studies with fuzzy data consider the usual and natural approach corresponding to Zadeh's extension principle, which in this case extends levelwise the usual interval arithmetic.\nDefinition II.2. Let U, V \u2208 F * c (R). The sum of U and V is defined as the fuzzy number\nLet U \u2208 F * c (R) and \u03b3 \u2208 R. The product of U by the scalar \u03b3 is defined as the fuzzy number \u03b3 \u00b7 U \u2208 F * c (R) given for each"}, {"section_title": "A. Distances Between Fuzzy Data", "text": "It is well known that when F * c (R) is endowed with this arithmetic, it determines a semilinear but not a linear space. As a consequence from this fact, there is no \"difference operation\" between these values that is simultaneously well defined and preserves the main properties of the difference between real values in connection with the sum.\nMoreover, it should be pointed out that, although fuzzy numbers are formalized as [0, 1]-valued functions, one cannot treat fuzzy data directly as if they were functional data in the way they are usually handled in functional data analysis. This is due to the fact that the functional arithmetic on F * c (R) can yield elements that lie outside this space, and thus, the meaning of fuzzy data is lost.\nThese concerns have been substantially overcome by developing statistical methods for imprecise data based on suitable distances between fuzzy numbers. On one hand, distances allow us to \"translate\" the equality of fuzzy numbers into the distance between these values being equal to 0. On the other hand, appropriate distances also allow us to \"identify\" fuzzy set-valued data with functional data through their so-called support function (see, for a recent reference, [2] ). Distances between fuzzy data have received a lot of attention in the literature. They have often been considered in connection with studies of similarity between fuzzy numbers, as well as for statistical purposes such as classification of fuzzy data or inferential statistics with fuzzy number-valued random elements.\nIn this paper, a parameterized and versatile family of distances has been chosen, although a few other distances will occasionally be mentioned. This family of distances has been introduced by Bertoluzza et al. [9] (see [10] for a recent review, and [11] for its generalization to fuzzy vector-valued data). It is formalized as follows.\nDefinition II.3. Let \u03b8 \u2208 (0, +\u221e) and let \u03d5 be an absolutely continuous probability measure on \nThe mid/spr-based metric has been shown to be very suitable for the development of statistical methodology for experimental fuzzy set-valued data. For instance, Gonz\u00e1lez-Rodr\u00edguez et al. [2] provide a detailed explanation of an approach to ANOVA with fuzzy data based on the functional data identification. The recent reviews of Blanco-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. [12] - [15] and Gil et al. [16] summarize most of these statistical developments.\nIn these distances, differences in center and shape are taken into account through the mid and spr functions, respectively. The parameter \u03b8 and the measure \u03d5 do not have any stochastic meaning. The parameter \u03b8 weighs the influence of the \"deviation in shape\" between the fuzzy data with respect to the influence of their \"deviation in center.\" Note that the choice \u03b8 = 1 corresponds to a generalization of the well-known distance \u03c1 2 by Diamond and Kloeden [17] , which for any\nAnother interesting choice is associated with the value \u03b8 =1/3, since (see [10] ) it can be equivalently expressed as\nThe mid/spr-based distances are L 2 metrics that, through the support function allow us to embed the space of fuzzy numbers into a convex cone of a Hilbert space by a R\u00e5dstrom-type isometry. More details can be found in [11] and [2] (see also [12] and [16] for recent reviews). This way, despite the fact that fuzzy data should not be treated directly as functional data, they can be treated as functional data by considering the identification via the support function. As one can see later, this identification is crucial for the extension of M-estimators to fuzzy data."}, {"section_title": "B. Random Fuzzy Numbers", "text": "To formalize the statistical analysis of fuzzy data, an essential tool is the adaptation of a suitable model for the random mechanism generating fuzzy data. The notion of random fuzzy number in Puri and Ralescu's sense [1] , [18] is a soundly established and well-supported model within the probabilistic setting. This notion is based on the ideas by Fr\u00e9chet [19] and F\u00e9ron [20] . In this model, fuzziness is assumed to affect the nature of values/data and randomness is assumed to affect their generation. Random fuzzy numbers can be defined as follows.\nDefinition II.4. Let (\u03a9, A, P ) be a probability space modeling a random experiment. A mapping X : \u03a9 \u2192 F * c (R) is said to be a random fuzzy number associated with the random experiment if, and only if, for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] the interval-valued mapping X \u03b1 (where X \u03b1 (\u03c9) = X (\u03c9) \u03b1 for all \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9) is a random compact interval or, equivalently, the real-valued functions inf X \u03b1 and sup X \u03b1 are random variables.\nIt should be highlighted that a random fuzzy number is a Borel-measurable mapping with respect to the Borel \u03c3-field associated with several metrics like, for instance, the mid/sprbased distance (see, for instance, [2] and [16] ). As a consequence from the Borel-measurability, crucial concepts such as the induced distribution of a random fuzzy number or the stochastic independence of random fuzzy numbers can be immediately stated.\nThe best known measure of location of a random fuzzy number is the Aumann-type mean, which is given as follows.\nDefinition II.5. Let X be a random fuzzy number and assume that the expected values of the random variables inf X 0 and sup X 0 are finite. The Aumann-type mean of X is the fuzzy number\nNote that this notion, introduced by Puri and Ralescu [1] , is coherent with the usual fuzzy arithmetic. In particular, if the possible values of a random fuzzy number X are given by\nThat is,\nThe Aumann-type mean of a random fuzzy number is supported by Strong Laws of Large Numbers (see, e.g., [21] ) and also by the Fr\u00e9chet approach [19] , since it is the fuzzy number minimizing the \"mean square error\" of X about a fuzzy number.

LOCATION M-ESTIMATES FROM FUZZY DATA", "text": "M-estimation is a well-established approach that yields robust estimators. M-estimators were first introduced by Huber [22] to estimate the location of real-valued data with the aim of limiting the influence of outliers on methods like least squares and maximum likelihood. For this purpose, the key idea consists of replacing the square of the \"errors\" with a (usually less rapidly increasing) loss function applied to the errors of the data. In this respect, M-estimators were presented as intermediaries between the sample mean and median.\nIn this section, the notion of M-estimators is extended to the case of fuzzy number-valued data. Sufficient conditions on the loss function to guarantee that the M-estimation process leads to well-defined (i.e., fuzzy-valued) estimates are established. Following Huber's ideas [22] , [23] , a location M-estimate in connection with a random fuzzy number is formalized as follows.\nDefinition III.1.

Actually, it is usually assumed to vanish at 0 and to be even, and nondecreasing for positive values.\nIt is very common in practice to fix a bounded referential in R, as is the case for the fuzzy rating scale by Hesketh et al. [37] . When adopting this situation and working on F c ([q, r]), for certain q, r \u2208 R such that q < r, it is possible to prove that the M-estimator of location is Borel measurable and, therefore, a statistic.\nProposition III.1.

Representer Theorem for M-Estimates with Fuzzy Data", "text": "Kim and Scott [4] , [5] recently proposed a robust nonparametric density estimator by combining a traditional kernel density estimator with ideas from standard M-estimation. An interesting contribution of Kim and Scott's work lies in their analysis of the conditions to ensure the existence of sample M-estimates of location. These conditions allow us to express the M-estimates as weighted linear combinations of the sample elements. This feature will be very convenient to assure that the M-estimates are indeed fuzzy number-valued statistics.\nThe novel representer theorem that will be stated in Theorem III-A.1 is an adaptation of Kim and Scott's work [4] , [5] to the fuzzy-valued case by means of the isometrical embedding mentioned before. It expresses the sample location M-estimate for fuzzy number-valued data as a convex linear combination of the sample components, x 1 , . . . , x n .\nTheorem III-A.1. Consider F * c (R) endowed with the metric D \u03d5 \u03b8 . Let x n = ( x 1 , . . . , x n ) be a sample of independent observations from a random fuzzy number X : \u03a9 \u2192 F * c (R) on a probability space (\u03a9, A, P ).

Then, the sample M-estimate of location exists, and it can be expressed as\nwith w i \u2265 0 and\nMany loss functions \u03c1 that are used to compute M-estimators satisfy the aforementioned conditions. One of the most wellknown loss functions which fulfills the required conditions is the Huber loss function [23] , which is given by\nwith a > 0 a tuning parameter. Note that the Huber loss function is convex, but not strictly convex. Huber's loss function yields a hybrid approach between squared and absolute error losses. Indeed, it corresponds to a parabola in the vicinity of 0 and increases linearly from the given level a onwards so that one can put appropriate emphasis on large and small errors. Some discussions on the choice of the tuning parameter a can be found in, e.g., [25] and [26] . Another well-known loss function is the Hampel loss function [27] , which corresponds to\nwhere the nonnegative parameters a < b < c allow us to control the degree of suppression of large errors. The smaller their values, the higher this degree. The performance of M-estimators thus depends on the choice on the tuning parameter(s) that appear in both loss functions. To fix these tuning parameter(s), one can follow the ideas in [5] , that is: 1) Choose as starting solution an easily computable robust centrality measure (to ensure the robustness of the M-estimator unless we can assure that the M-estimator is unique). 2) Compute the distances between the fuzzy observations and this initial solution. 3) Set a equal to the median of these real-valued distances for both loss functions. For Hampel's loss function, set b and c equal to the 75th and the 85th percentiles of the obtained distances, respectively. An example of the Huber loss function for a = 2.36 (used in Example III.1) is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Example III.1. Consider a sample x 3 = ( x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) with three trapezoidal/triangular fuzzy values given by x 1 = Tra(0, 2, 3, 4), x 2 = Tri(1, 1.5, 2) and x 3 = Tri(3, 4, 5) (displayed in gray in Fig. 3) .\nThe parameter values are fixed to a = 2.36, b = 3.18, and c = 3.51. For the Huber loss function \u03c1 2.36 , the corresponding M-estimate of location can then be determined by means of the following algorithm:\nStep 1: Take as initial estimate g M (1) (k = 1) a \"central\" value. In this case, we have chosen the 1-norm median (see Section III-C) as initial robust location measure. Fix a tolerance \u03b5 = 10 \u22127 .

Properties of M-Estimates Satisfying the Representer Theorem", "text": "In this section, we state several interesting properties of the fuzzy-valued M-estimates when the conditions of the representer theorem are satisfied. These properties have not been studied by Kim and Scott in the context of density estimation yet. Proofs can be found as the supplementary material.\nIn particular, the M-estimates are translation equivariant and under additional assumptions also scale (and, hence, symmetry) equivariant.\nProposition III-B.1 (Translation equivariance). Consider ( x 1 , . . . , x n ) be a sample of independent observations from a random fuzzy number X : \u03a9 \u2192 F * c (R) on a probability space (\u03a9, A, P ). Moreover, let \u03c1 be a continuous loss function fulfilling the assumptions in Theorem III-A.1, such that the corresponding sample M-estimate of location is unique.

Moreover, let \u03c1 be a continuous loss function fulfilling the assumptions in Theorem III-A.1, such that the corresponding sample Mestimate of location is unique.\nIf \u03c1 satisfies the condition \u03c6(k \u00b7 x) \u221d \u03c6(x) for every k \u2208 (0, \u221e) (i.e., the coefficient of proportionality is independent of x), then for all c \u2208 R , it holds that\nwhere g M [c \u00b7 x n ] is the location M-estimate based on c \u00b7 x n , and g M [ x n ] is the location M-estimate based on x n , which satisfies\nFor instance, if \u03c6 is a power function, then the corresponding M-estimate is scale equivariant.\nNote that the extra condition on the loss function in Proposition III-B.2 is a strong requirement. Most loss functions for M-estimates of location do not satisfy this property. Therefore, similarly as in the real setting (see, e.g., [28] ), the resulting M-estimate, especially its robustness, may depend heavily on the considered measurement units. To avoid this drawback, we determine the values of the tuning parameters in the considered loss functions based on the distribution of the distances for the particular dataset, as already explained after Theorem III-A.1.\nAs an immediate consequence from the representer theorem for fuzzy data, one can trivially prove that the M-estimates of LR fuzzy numbers sharing L and R functions (see [29] ) also fall in the LR family. Recall that U is said to be an LR fuzzy number Another interesting property when examining the adequacy of the location M-estimates based on fuzzy data as central tendency measures concerns their behavior in case of symmetrically distributed samples. In the real-valued case, a well-known result is that the median of a symmetric random variable coincides with the point of symmetry whenever it is unique. In the fuzzy-valued case, a similar result can be obtained for location M-estimates under certain assumptions. Let x n = ( x 1 , . . . , x n ) be a sample of independent observations from a random fuzzy number X : \u03a9 \u2192 F * c (R) on a probability space (\u03a9, A, P ). Then, the sample x n is said to be symmetric about c \u2208 R (see [30] ) if and only if x n \u2212 c and c \u2212 x n (or, equivalently, 2c \u2212 x n and x n ) include exactly the same fuzzy data. We then have the following result. ( x 1 , . . . , x n ) be a sample of independent observations from a random fuzzy number X : \u03a9 \u2192 F * c (R) on a probability space (\u03a9, A, P ). Moreover, let \u03c1 be a continu-ous loss function fulfilling the assumptions in Theorem III-A.1, such that the associate M-estimate is unique. If the sample x n is symmetric about c \u2208 R, then the corresponding location M-estimate g M [ x n ] is a symmetric fuzzy number about c.\nIn addition to these properties, it is also of importance to investigate the consistency of sample M-estimators as well as their robustness.\nStrong consistency concerns the almost sure convergence of sample M-estimators to their population analogue, given b\u1ef9\nIn the literature, consistency has been formally guaranteed under certain conditions (see, e.g., [31] ). However, those results do not include most of the commonly used loss functions. In order to cover, among others, the well-known Huber and Hampel loss functions, the following theorem is now stated under the assumption that the referential fuzzy numbers are defined on is bounded, as happens when using the fuzzy rating scale. \nWe now investigate the robustness of location M-estimators for fuzzy data by means of the finite sample breakdown point, for short fsbp (see [32] and [33] ). The fsbp is a measure of robustness that can be adapted to estimators taking values in general metric spaces (see [34] ). It represents the smallest fraction of observations in a sample that needs to be perturbed to make the (suitably chosen) distance between the M-estimates in the original and contaminated samples arbitrarily large.\nThe proof of the first result shows the importance of the translational equivariance of M-estimators as stated in Proposition III-B. \nthe finite sample breakdown point of the corresponding location M-estimator is exactly . In contrast, the fsbp of the sample Aumann-type mean has been shown to be equal to 1 n (see, e.g., [6] , [7] ). M-estimates thus yield a huge gain in robustness in comparison with the commonly used Aumanntype mean."}, {"section_title": "C. Related ad hoc Estimators", "text": "The representer theorem guarantees the existence of sample M-estimates of location as well as their expression as random weighted means of the sample elements for loss functions that satisfy the needed conditions. While several common choices of the loss function \u03c1 satisfy these conditions, there are also some interesting choices that do not satisfy these conditions. In particular, for the choice \u03c1(x) = |x|, which yields the median in the real-valued case, one cannot apply the results in Section III-A. However, Sinova et al. [6] , [7] proposed median-type Mestimates for random fuzzy numbers. These M-estimates cannot be expressed as weighted means of the sample elements, but levelwise they can be expressed in terms of the classical medians of real-valued random variables characterizing the fuzzy number.

Illustrative Real-Life Application", "text": "We now consider a real-life example with fuzzy-valued data and compute the location M-estimates in Sections III-A and III-C.\nExample III.2. In 2011, Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) assessments have joined for the first time to assess the fourth grade students in three fundamental curricular areas: mathematics, science, and reading.\nThe questionnaires in these studies are in a standard format, to be answered in accordance with a four-point Likert scale, namely DISAGREE A LOT, DISAGREE A LITTLE, AGREE A LITTLE, and AGREE A LOT. As indicated in [8] , only limited conclusions can be obtained when the Likert scale responses are encoded by consecutive integer numbers.\nOn the other hand, the fuzzy rating scale has been introduced (see [37] ) as an approach that allows us to combine a freeresponse format with a fuzzy valuation. In the fuzzy rating scale, along a continuous line between two end-points:\n1) a respondent first selects or draws a \"representative position/interval\" of the respondent rating (i.e., the set of points which she/he considers to be fully compatible with such a rating); 2) the respondent then also indicates \"latitudes of acceptance\" on either side by determining the highest and lowest possible positions for the respondent rating (i.e., the set of points which she/he considers to be compatible to some extent with such a rating). The fuzzy rating scale allows us to explore and exploit more information than the Likert scale. Moreover, from a statistical perspective, the fuzzy rating scale is generally also more informative than the usual fuzzy linguistic approach (see, e.g., [38] - [40] for some recent contributions to this approach), as shown by De la Rosa de S\u00e1a et al. [8] .\nIt can be argued that fuzzy rating scale-based questionnaires are not as user-friendly as Likert scales. However, minor training is usually sufficient to explain nonexperts how to respond on a fuzzy rating scale (see [37] ). To show how this fuzzy rating scale works by means of a simple example, some of the items for the Student questionnaire TIMSS/PIRLS (see http://timss.bc.edu/ timss2011/downloads/T11_StuQ_4.pdf) have been adapted in accordance with this scale, and the questionnaire has been conducted on the fourth-grade students of the Colegio San Ignacio in Oviedo-Asturias (Spain). Note that the questions have not been modified with respect to the original questionnaire, but only the fuzzy rating scale has been added as a second way to respond. The students received instructions (in Spanish) on how to answer the questions (see http://carleos.epv.uniovi.es:8080/). We remark that this example accurately follows the spirit of Zadeh, who has coined it as the \"precisiation of the imprecise\" (see [41] ). Surprisingly, no answer has been slightly more frequent with the Likert than with the fuzzy rating scale.\nWe now analyze data from one of the considered items (a different and more detailed analysis of datasets from the whole adapted questionnaire can be found in [42] ), referring to the degree of agreement with the statement that studying mathematics is harder than any other subject. The paper-and-pencil format corresponding to this question is graphically displayed in Fig. 4 .\nData from the 68 fourth-grade students from Colegio San Ignacio have been collected. The results are shown in the plot on the left in Fig. 5 . The outputs for the four location M-estimates discussed in the previous section are displayed in the plot on the right in Fig. 5 .\nIt can be seen that Hampel and Huber M-estimates, which are based on the D 1/3 metric and use the 1-norm median as initial solution, coincide.\nIt can be easily checked that the conditions for the representer theorem are satisfied for the Huber and Hampel M-estimates in this example, whence (as shown in Proposition III-B.3) they preserve the trapezoidal shape of the sample data.\nThis appealing property does not hold for the two mediantype M-estimates, as can be seen from Fig. 5 .\nOn the other hand, differences in the behavior of the L 1 -type medians and the M-estimates in Fig. 5 are mainly due to the influence of the corresponding loss functions. This way, Huber and Hampel loss functions \"penalize\" less (more) the small (large) distances than the absolute value.\nIt is interesting to comment that after integer encoding of the Likert-type responses, the medians for item MS3 correspond to AGREE A LITTLE (6. 6). Hence, as already pointed out by De la Rosa de S\u00e1a et al. [8] , the fuzzy rating scale responses offer richer nuances and expressiveness.\nIn the literature, one can find several arguments to employ triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers or approximations preserving exactly or approximately ambiguity, expected interval, etc. (see, for instance, [44] - [50] ). However, we emphasize that to compute the location M-estimation of fuzzy responses by means of the approaches in this paper, there is no need for fuzzy data to be trapezoidal/triangular (see, e.g., [43] for some examples of other fuzzy data)."}, {"section_title": "IV. EMPIRICAL COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF M-ESTIMATES WITH FUZZY DATA", "text": "While it has been shown that the Aumann-type mean is not robust (see [6] and [7] ), the M-estimators do show robust behavior in terms of fsbp as discussed in Section III. In this section, we empirically compare the performance and robustness of the fuzzy-valued M-estimators in more detail. In particular, we consider the M-estimators based on the Huber and Hampel loss functions using the D 1/3 and D 1 distances, as well as the 1-norm and -wabl/ldev/rdev medians. For each of the estimators, the mean squared error of the estimator is approximated by simulation in different settings.\nThe general scheme of the simulations is as follows:"}, {"section_title": "STUDY 1 (Mid-Points of the 1-Levels Generated From a Symmetric Distribution)", "text": "Based on four real-valued random variables, trapezoidal fuzzy data are generated according to X = Tra(X 1 \u2212 X 2 \u2212X 3 , X 1 \u2212 X 2 , X 1 + X 2 , X 1 + X 2 + X 4 ). Each sample contains a fraction c p of contaminated observations, where c p = 0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4.\nIn the first case (CASE 1), the variables X i are independent. In particular, 1) X 1 \u223c N (0, 1) and X 2 , X 3 , X 4 \u223c \u03c7 independent of X 1 ). The constant C D , which determines the distance between the distribution of the regular and contaminated observations, equals 0, 1, 5, 10, or 100. This yields 16 different settings for each case."}, {"section_title": "STUDY 2 (Mid-Points of the 1-Levels Generated From an Asymmetric Distribution)", "text": "For CASE 3, the trapezoidal fuzzy data are generated according to X = Tra(X (1) , X (2) , X (3) , X (4) ), with X (1) \u2264 X (2) \u2264 Table I , it becomes clear that there does not exist a uniformly most appropriate M-estimator of location. However, the M-estimator based on Hampel's loss function seems to be the most suitable estimator in most of the situations when the trapezoidal fuzzy data are assumed to be generated from independent real random variables. In the case that these variables are dependent, the 1-norm median seems to be the most successful when mid-points are generated from a symmetric distribution, whereas there is a high diversity for asymmetrically distributed mid-points.\nRemark IV.1. In addition to the empirical advantages of the M-estimators based on Hampel's loss function, it should be highlighted that thanks to the representer theorem, the Mestimates of important classes of fuzzy data such as trapezoidal data are guaranteed to give a location estimate that belongs to the same class. This is because the estimates are expressible as weighted averages. This result is not generally true for ad hoc robust measures, which complicates their interpretation as measure of the location of fuzzy data."}, {"section_title": "V. CONCLUDING REMARKS", "text": "One of the advantages of the new location M-estimators for random fuzzy numbers introduced in this paper lies in the fact that the recently established representer theorem in the context of robust density estimation could be easily extended to the case of fuzzy-number data, as shown in Section III. Although the M-estimates based on the representer theorem have been developed for the D \u03d5 \u03b8 metric, other L 2 metrics between fuzzy numbers allowing to embed F * c (R) into a convex cone of a Hilbert space are also worthwhile to consider. For instance, in most of the examples and simulations in this paper, we have also considered the L 2 metric based on the wabl/ldev/rdev representation introduced in [3] , but the conclusions have been essentially the same.\nIt should be pointed out that, in spite of the fact that the mathematical apparatus behind the M-estimates in Sections III-A and III-B involves the Hilbert space-valued setting, the particular case of fuzzy data is definitely much simpler and easier-tofollow. Furthermore, due to the representer theorem, the computations reduce to the calculus of weighted means. The main practical difficulty concerns the calculus of the involved weights, but this iterative procedure can be implemented in R [55] or similar tools.\nFinally, an important remaining problem is to adapt the Mestimates of location with unknown dispersion to the fuzzyvalued case. This would formally overcome the lack of scale equivariance for the location M-estimators. Therefore, the tuning constant(s) in the loss functions would not need to be determined from the data anymore. We hope to solve this issue in the future, when robust dispersion measures for fuzzy data are also developed.\nBeatriz Sinova received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in mathematics from the University of Oviedo, Asturias, Spain, in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and the joint Ph.D. degree in mathematics and statistics from the University of Oviedo and Ghent University, Gent, Belgium.\nShe is an Assistant Professor in statistics with the University of Oviedo since 2015.
