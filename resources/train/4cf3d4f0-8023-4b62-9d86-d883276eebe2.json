[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The persistent gap in academic achievement among different ethnic and racial groups has been a critical and contentious issue in American education, particularly since educational equity has been a national goal for the past 40 years. Since the 1954Brown v. Board of Education (1954 landmark Supreme Court ruling and the publication of the Coleman Report (Coleman, et al., 1966), substantial governmental resources have been devoted to \"closing the gap\" through federal programs such as head start and activities funded through Title I 1 , as well as various programs sponsored by individual states. Although these programs have increased overall access to early child care (Magnuson & Waldfogel, 2005) and provided more resources for schools serving low socio-economic backgrounds (Braun, Wang, Jenkins & Weinbaum, 2006), our national progress towards closing the achievement gap has been disappointing. Results from the nation's report card, or the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has revealed that the achievement gap has narrowed somewhat since the 1970s, but the difference remains substantial (Hedges & Nowell, 1998). Moreover, the existence of the gap appears early. Results from a nationally representative sample of children who were followed from kindergarten through grade 5 found that the achievement gap appeared at kindergarten entry and increased at each successive grade level (Chatterji, 2006;U.S. Department of Education, U.S. DOE, 2004). Although there has been a plethora of research on the achievement gap and its correlates at the elementary and secondary levels (for example, Barton 2003;Miller, 1995;Phillips, Brooks-Gunn, Duncan, Klebanov & Crane, 1998), less attention has been paid to the achievement gap and its correlates during early childhood years, particularly before kindergarten. Moreover, most studies have focused only on the Black children and White children achievement gap, leaving behind examinations of the magnitude of the achievement gap between other ethnic and racial groups, particularly of Hispanic children and Asian children. This study investigated the extent of the math and reading achievement gaps among pre-kindergarten children of different ethnic and racial subgroups. The study utilized publicly available data on the average math and reading achievement of a nationally representative sample of U.S. 4-year-old children to estimate the magnitude of the math and reading gap between Black children and White children; between Hispanic children and White children; and between Asian children and White children. Both statistical significance and practical significance of the gap were examined. The following literature review has been organized into three sections. The first section provided a general overview on the achievement gap literature. The second section examined the magnitude of the achievement gap at school entry, and the last section reviewed the achievement gap prior to school entry."}, {"section_title": "Overview on the achievement gap", "text": "Fifty years after the Brown v. Board of Education (1954) landmark Supreme Court ruling, the gaps in educational achievement and attainment between ethnic and racial groups remain large. This persistent difference among different racial and ethnic groups, particularly between Black children and White children, has been well documented in a number of sources. Jencks and Phillips (1998) provided a brief historical introduction to the problem and a thoughtful review on relevant issues. Hedges and Nowell (1998) analyzed data from six surveys and presented evidence that the achievement gap has narrowed somewhat since 1970, but that the differences remain substantial. The U.S. Department of Education's (2004) The Condition of Education 2004 characterized the mathematics achievement gap of black students and white students as narrowing during elementary school, but widening during middle school, and constant during high school. This led to the characterization of the black-white student gap as \"pervasive, profound and persistent\" by a recent multi-method, multi-state analysis of the achievement gap (Braun, et al., 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Achievement gap at school entry", "text": "The gap at school entry has been well documented. Studies have found that the achievement gap appears as early as school entry and increases over time, and that the gap in mathematics achievement is larger than the gap in reading achievement. Results from a nationally representative sample of kindergarten age children showed that on math achievement, Black and Hispanic kindergarten students scored about two-thirds of a standard deviation below white kindergarten students, while Asian students outscored white students. Moreover, on the reading achievement, Black children and Hispanic children scored just under half a standard deviation lower, while Asian children, again, performed better than White children by one-third of a standard deviation (Magnuson & Duncan, 2006). By following these children from kindergarten to grade 5, studies have found that the math gap between Black children and White children widened from 5 to 16 points from kindergarten entry to grade 3 and that the reading gap widened from 3 to 14 points during the same period (U.S. DOE, 2004). In addressing the criticism that the achievement gap differed depending on the assessment used, Rock and Stenner (2005) reviewed six main assessments used to estimate school readiness in current literature (including Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised (PPVT-R) and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Battery (ECLS-K)), and calculated the school readiness gaps of Black children and White children in standard deviation units. They found the gaps to range from less than half a standard deviation (typically math and reading achievement tests of school readiness) to one standard deviation (typically, vocabulary tests of school readiness), depending on the assessment used (Rock & Stenner, 2005). More recently, researchers have begun to examine not just the magnitude but also growth in the achievement gap. Chatterji (2006) used hierarchical linear models to examine the growth of reading achievement gaps of kindergarten and grade one children. He found reading gaps increased from kindergarten entry to grade one for Black children as compared to their white counterparts; boys as compared to girls; and children from high poverty households as compared to children from more affluent households (Chatterji, 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Achievement gap before school entry", "text": "In comparison, there are fewer research studies that have examined the magnitude and growth of the achievement gap prior to kindergarten. Earlier examinations of the pre-kindergarten achievement gap focused on home language learning experiences. Following children from 42 families from the Kansas area when they were 9-month-old to 36-month-old, Hart and Risley (1995) found that by the age of 3, children in families receiving welfare had vocabularies that were half as large as those of their more affluent peers, and the disparities persisted throughout childhood. More recent studies in this area have examined the pre-kindergarten achievement gap using nationally representative data. Yeung and Pfeiffer's study (as cited in Magnuson & Duncan, 2006), using a nationally representative sample of families in the U.S., estimated the math achievement gap between black preschool age children and white preschool age school as two-third of a standard deviation; and the reading achievement gap as just under half a standard deviation. Phillips, et al. (1998), using a sample of children born to a nationally representative sample of women, estimated that 5-and 6-year-old Black children scored more than a full standard deviation below White children on a picture vocabulary test score. Findings from these earlier studies showed existence of pre-kindergarten achievement gaps in math and reading between Black children and White children; however, these studies fell short in documenting the exact magnitude of the pre-kindergarten achievement gap in math and reading across different ethnic and racial groups. This was because prior studies did not utilize a nationally representative sample of pre-kindergarten children; instead, they examined children from either a specific region of the country or children from samples of families or samples of women. This limitation in sampling has grave implications as those earlier studies could not produce reliable and generalizable estimates of the math and reading achievement gap for not only black pre-kindergarten children but also for Hispanic and Asian pre-kindergarten children. In summary, a review of the current literature on the achievement gap between different ethnic and racial groups revealed a clear documentation of the magnitude of the achievement gap between Black children and White children from kindergarten through high schools. However, the magnitude of the achievement gap at the pre-kindergarten level has not been as well documented. Current research on this issue also has not adequately examined the extent of the math and reading achievement between other ethnic and racial groups, such as between Hispanic children and White children and between Asian children and White children."}, {"section_title": "Current study", "text": "This review of existing research on school readiness and achievement gap suggested that an important question has not been adequately addressed-the question of, to what extent is there a math and reading achievement gap among pre-kindergarten children of different ethnic and racial subgroups?

Department of Education, 2008), thereby, reducing the child's frustration and time needed to complete the assessment. As a result of the adaptive testing strategy, the Item Response Theory (IRT) modeling was used to estimate each child's performance on all of the items in each domain. IRT uses patterns of correct and incorrect answers to obtain estimates on a scale that may be compared for different assessment forms (U. S.

The gaps range from half a standard deviation unit on measures of overall mathematics knowledge and skills, overall literacy knowledge and skills, and phonological awareness knowledge and skills, to almost one full standard deviation on the measure of reflective vocabulary knowledge and skills. These findings add to the current literature on the achievement gap in at least two ways: (1) By documenting the magnitude of the pre-kindergarten achievement gap between nationally representative sample of Hispanic 4-year-old children and nationally representative sample of white 4-year-old children on measures of overall mathematics knowledge and skills and overall literacy knowledge and skills and on sub-measures of literacy. (2) These findings add to the literature by highlighting the extent of educational inequality experienced by Hispanic children in the United States, reminding policymakers, researchers, and educators, to consider the educational experiences of this growing minority subgroup in the achievement gap debate. Findings from this study reveals that there is an achievement gap between Black children and White children 4 years old, ranging from one-tenth of a standard deviation unit (on fine motor skills), one-fifth of a standard deviation unit (on measures of expressive language), to one-half of a standard deviation unit (on measures of reflective vocabulary and overall mathematics knowledge and skills). The size of these gaps are similar to what has been found at the kindergarten level (Rock & Stenner, 2005), indicating that Black children, prior to kindergarten, start out on average, on lower levels than White children on measures of mathematics and literacy and reading. As closing the achievement gap has been a national goal for 40 years, policymakers should consider this new evidence as they are making decisions on the allocation and prioritization of federal education money. Findings from this study reveals that the achievement gap between Asian children and White children ranges from over half of a standard deviation favoring White children on the measure of reflective vocabulary knowledge and skills to approximately half of a standard deviation favoring Asian children on measures of overall mathematics, overall literacy, and fine motor skills. Findings from this study support recent findings at the kindergarten level, where nationally representative Asian kindergarten children were found to outscore nationally representative White kindergarten children (Magnuson & Duncan, 2006). This area is ripe for deeper examination. Questions are raised such as why do Asian children outperform White children on some measures of literacy (e.g. early reading knowledge and skills) but not others (e.g., language knowledge and skills)? And, questions such as to what extent these differences are explained by socioeconomic status, by family structure and practices, by school program and quality, are waiting to be examined. This study attempts to address two limitations in the current literature on the achievement gap by (1) estimating the magnitude of the achievement gap between nationally representative samples of 4-year-old children, and by (2) calculating the achievement gap for Hispanic children and White children, Asian children and White children, and for Black children and White children. However, the study is limited in that the analyses could not go beyond the comparison in central tendency as the author had to analyze data that were reported. Future studies should consider further examining the achievement gap by using measures of variability (Hedges & Nowell, 1999) and by modeling change in the achievement gap over time (Chatterji, 2006)."}]
