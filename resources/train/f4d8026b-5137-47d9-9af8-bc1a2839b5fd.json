These findings can help to streamline follow-up care, potentially improving follow-up efficiency and quality.\nClinic visits with comprehensive history and physical examinations form the cornerstone of breast cancer followup for the more than 3 million breast cancer survivors currently living in the US. [1] [2] [3] Oncologists, especially radiation and surgical oncologists, endorse the importance of localregional examinations for the timely identification of localregional events, and often remain engaged in follow-up for this reason. 4, 5 As a result, many patients continue to see multiple providers after they complete active treatment, 6, 7 which leads to significant redundancy and inefficiency, and contributes to the high costs of providing breast cancer follow-up (estimated at approximately $6.8 billion annually). 8 Furthermore, unnecessary follow-up visits can have negative consequences for patients, with out-of-pockets costs due to travel and visit co-pays, time away from work or family, and anxiety. With the current national focus on value in cancer care, 9 optimizing breast cancer follow-up is a high-impact area for quality improvement.\nThe limited evidence that exists on the utility of clinical examinations for detecting local-regional breast events suggests that these examinations may not be as important as oncologists believe. Prior studies describe that a minority (2-35 %) of the local-regional events that occur after breast conservation are detected by clinical examination. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Some of the variation in reported estimates can be attributed to methodological challenges associated with the studies as the majority were relatively small, single-institution studies. Additionally, as most were conducted outside the US in specialized centers, systematic differences by country and by practice in how breast cancer follow-up care is delivered make it difficult to generalize findings. Finally, these studies reflect the outcomes of historic patient cohorts. After the time period of these studies, screening mammography transitioned from analog film (reported to be less sensitive in patients with a personal history of breast cancer compared with the average screening population 15 ) to digital mammography. This occurred rapidly in the US, beginning in the early 2000s (4 % of centers had digital mammography capabilities in 2003, 27 % in 2007, and 87 % in 2012). 16 Given the increased sensitivity of digital mammography, [17] [18] [19] the relative efficacy of a clinical examination as an adjunct to screening mammography is likely to be quite different in a more contemporary patient cohort.\nThe objective of this study was to examine how new breast events, including both local-regional recurrences and new primary cancers, are first detected in a more contemporary, multi-institution cohort of breast cancer survivors. These findings have direct implications for current breast cancer follow-up and can help to define the added value of providers with local-regional expertise in the long-term follow-up of breast cancer survivors."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Data Source", "text": "The National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), a joint program of the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (CoC) and the American Cancer Society (ACS), is a large national cancer registry database that captures approximately 70 % of all newly diagnosed cancers in the US.

Data on the use of imaging in breast cancer survivors, as well as local and distant breast cancer events, were systematically abstracted to supplement the standardly collected data elements. The study was approved by the University of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board."}, {"section_title": "Patient Cohort and Data Collection Procedure", "text": "The analysis described in this manuscript was part of a CoC special study to evaluate recurrence (both local and distant) within the NCDB. Patients were eligible for participation in the special study if they were diagnosed at a CoC-accredited site, in 2006-2007, with stage II or III breast cancer, were over the age of 18 years, and underwent surgical treatment as part of first-course therapy. Patients diagnosed in 2006-2007 were included to ensure five complete years of follow-up. Stage I patients were excluded given their excellent prognosis and lower likelihood of recurrence, as their inclusion would dilute the power of the study without significant contribution to the endpoints of interest. Exclusion criteria included a history of cancer prior to the patient's index breast cancer, and the identification of distant metastases prior to the beginning of the surveillance period (defined as starting 3 months after the patient's first surgical procedure).\nFrom this group of eligible patients, a stage-stratified sample of 10 patients was then selected at random for abstraction from each of the 1217 CoC facilities that were accredited in 2006-2007. As part of a special study, cancer registrars abstracted information on date and type of localregional and distant breast events, method of event detection, imaging received (date, intent of scan, results), and mortality. The window for abstraction began 90 days postsurgery and continued for 5 years. All patients were followed for 5 years unless they developed a distant recurrence or died, at which point they were censored; abstraction continued after a local-regional breast event.\nFor the current analysis, we further restricted this cohort to women who underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS)."}, {"section_title": "Patient-Related Explanatory Variables", "text": "Sociodemographics and health factors included age at diagnosis, race, and insurance status. Residence location was assessed using rural/urban continuum codes, and Charlson comorbidity scores were used to assess comorbidities at the time of diagnosis. Tumor characteristics included histology, tumor size, nodal status, and estrogen/ progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status. HER2/neu status was abstracted by site registrars as it had not been systematically recorded during the 2006-2007 study time frame. Treatment covariates included receipt of radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal/endocrine therapy, while imaging covariates included receipt of screening mammograms during the study period. These were categorized into four groups based on the average interval between mammograms: every 6 months imaging (if average interval between mammograms was less than 10 months), annual imaging (if average interval was 10-18 months), less than annual imaging (if average interval was [18 months), and no imaging.\nRegistrars abstracted data on the method of detection for each new local-regional breast event that occurred during our study period. Registrars were instructed to code the method by which the new breast was initially detected. It was emphasized to the registrars that a study goal was to determine whether the breast event was symptom-driven (i.e., patient-reported) or asymptomatic based on imaging or examination. Registrars did not report whether the physical examination and imaging occurred on the same day, and we the extent to which concomitant detection of events occurred within our cohort cannot be assessed. Registrars used their chart review to make a determination of the first notice of the new breast event, taking all available information into account."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "Summary statistics were used to describe patient sociodemographic, tumor, and treatment factors for the cohort.

Multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with local-regional breast events, and exploratory univariate analyses examined the relationship between physician detection of a local-regional breast event and receipt of breast imaging."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Overall, 11,099 women with stage II and III breast cancer were included in the parent study. Of these high-risk patients, 44 % (n = 4854) underwent BCS and met the inclusion criteria for this analysis. Consistent with the sampling strategy, 84 % of patients were stage II and 16 % were stage III. Patient demographic, tumor, and treatment characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Seventy percent of patients received screening mammograms during the follow-up period (35 % approximately every 6 months, 59 % annually, and 6 % less than annually).\nA local-regional breast event was detected in 5.5 % of patients (n = 265) at a median 2.9 years after diagnosis. Of these events, 83 % occurred within breast parenchyma (ipsilateral or contralateral), and 17 % occurred within ER/PR estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor ipsilateral lymph nodes. Factors associated with local-regional events are described in Table 2 . The presence of four or more positive lymph nodes was associated with a significantly increased risk of any type of local-regional event (ipsilateral and contralateral combined). ER/PR positive status, regardless of whether endocrine therapy was received, and receipt of chemotherapy were associated with a decreased risk of any event. When considering only ipsilateral events, tumor size (increased risk) and receipt of radiation (decreased risk) were additionally associated with a local-regional breast event.\nForty-eight percent of local-regional events were detected on asymptomatic breast imaging, 29 % by patients, and 10 % on clinical examination. Overall, 0.5 % (n = 26) of the 4854 patients had a local-regional breast event detected by clinical examination. The utility of the clinical examination in detecting a local-regional breast event varied based on whether the event was ipsilateral to the primary cancer or contralateral, and whether it was an in-breast versus lymph node event (Table 3) . Physician examinations detected a larger proportion of lymph node events (8/45) compared with in-breast events (18/220). Of the 18 in-breast events detected by the physician, two were identified in patients prior to the first post-treatment mammogram being due, three were detected in patients who never received post-treatment mammograms (events occurred in years 1-3 post-diagnosis), one was overdue for a mammogram (1.7 years from the last mammogram), four were 6-12 months from the last mammogram, and eight had the event detected within 6 months of the last mammogram. On univariate analysis, no factors were associated with method of detection of the local-regional event."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this multi-institution study of a cohort of high-risk breast cancer survivors, we determined that the impact of a clinical examination as an adjunct to screening mammography in the detection of local-regional breast events after BCS is modest. This study represents a significant contribution to the existing literature given the large number of patients (and local-regional breast events) included. Furthermore, use of the NCDB allowed us to assemble a diverse cohort of patients from varied practices across the US; this ensures our findings more accurately reflect real-world clinical practice as opposed to that of a specialized and/or academic breast center. Finally, given the study time frame, the majority of the imaging obtained during follow-up was likely digital mammography as opposed to analog, which allows the assessment of the utility of clinical examinations as an adjunct to the modern imaging modality.\nAlthough variation exists surrounding the exact proportions of patients whose local-regional breast events are detected by patient-reported symptoms, asymptomatic imaging, and clinical examination, the general trends between our study and prior studies are consistent (Table 4) . [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The vast majority of breast events are either detected by patient-reported symptoms or asymptomatic imaging. Heterogeneity in study design, patient populations, and institutional practices can explain much of the observed variation. For example, the relatively high rate of patient symptom detection reported by van der Sangen et al. can be largely explained by the highly select cohort of young women (all \\40 years of age) evaluated. 10 The authors hypothesized that their findings were due to the increased breast density in this young cohort and associated challenges in mammographic screening. Similarly, the much lower rate of patient-reported symptoms and higher rate of imaging detection described by Yau et al. can be explained by a unique clinical follow-up protocol; at their center, patients often underwent supplementary ultrasound examinations in addition to annual screening mammography. 13 In our study, 10 % of local-regional breast events were detected by clinical examination, with lymph node events more likely to be provider detected than in-breast events. This result is in keeping with the reality that mammography does not adequately evaluate the axilla and is less likely to detect these events. There are several potential reasons for the relatively modest utility of clinical examinations in detecting in-breast events observed in our study. Although mammogram screening in the postoperative breast can be challenging, 15 clinical examinations can also be difficult due to resolving seromas and post-radiation fat necrosis that make it hard to differentiate normal postoperative findings from recurrence. We do not have data on whether the recurrence presented on imaging as calcifications, an asymmetry, or a mass; this clinical presentation may also impact utility of clinical examination. Additionally, our findings may reflect the advances that have occurred in breast imaging technology over the past decade. The advent of digital mammograms increased the sensitivity of screening mammograms in challenging breasts, [17] [18] [19] and even better sensitivity and specificity may be observed with digital breast tomosynthesis. [20] [21] [22] Finally, our findings may reflect the increased awareness of breast cancer survivors to changes in their breasts. Given the high level of anxiety in this patient population, 23 it is likely that these patients are quick to bring any changes in their selfbreast examination to their providers' attention. Combined, these factors all decrease the relative utility of a clinical examination as an adjunct to screening mammograms in detecting local-regional breast events.\nLimitations to our study exist. The data in this analysis were collected retrospectively by site registrars not involved in the patients' care. It can be challenging to make the How the breast event was detected By physician 10 (26) 8 (12) 18 (8) 8 (6) By patient 29 (76) 29 (43) 36 (16) 23 (17) On breast imaging (asymptomatic) 48 (128) 49 (71) 31 (14) 58 (43) Incidental on other imaging 2 (5) 2 (3) 2 (1) 1 (1) Other 11 (30) 12 (17) 13 (6) 10 (7) Data are expressed as % (n) unless otherwise specified LR local recurrence Detection of Local-Regional Breast Eventsdetermination of how a breast event was detected, as evidenced by the fact that 14 % of events were classified as 'other'. To address this, we explicitly delineated how to make the determination in the abstraction instructions for the special study, piloted the data abstraction with the registrars at our own institution as well as at 18 other CoC facilities, and held weekly registrar webinars to address commonly experienced issues. These steps all increase our data quality. Furthermore, the observed local-regional breast event rates are consistent with other recent studies, 24, 25 suggesting cancer registrars consistently captured breast events and had the requisite medical records needed for abstraction. Our study is limited to the evaluation of events that occur within 5 years of diagnosis, and, consequently, our findings may not reflect the relative value of patient symptoms, screening mammography or clinical examination in detecting events outside this early survivorship window. Finally, our study was limited to stage II and III patients; 26 however, our findings for higher risk patients should be generalizable to patients with stage 0-I disease as these patients have a similar, or even lower, risk of local-regional failure, and therefore a potentially lower utility of clinical examination.\nOur finding that clinical examinations detect a localregional breast cancer event after BCS in a minority of patients (0.5 % overall and 10 % of local-regional breast events) has direct implications for breast cancer follow-up. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend frequent follow-up visits (every 3-12 months), with a primary purpose of physical examination. 2, 3 However, these guidelines provide little guidance on which types of providers should be involved in follow-up or what the responsibilities of different providers should be, which leads to substantial variation in who participates in breast cancer follow-up. 6, 27, 28 In our prior work, surgeons and radiation oncologists described their belief that their enhanced post-treatment local-regional examinations were valuable in detecting breast events; for these providers, this was the primary driver for their ongoing participation in follow-up. 4 The findings of our current study conflict with this practice as we demonstrated only a modest utility of clinical examinations in detecting new breast events. Knowing what types of providers participated in follow-up visits for breast cancer patients in this study would provide additional insight into which types of providers may be most efficient at detecting a local recurrence (which may impact the utility of clinical examinations); however, this data collection was outside the scope of the current study."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSIONS", "text": "A clinical examination will always be an important component of breast cancer follow-up; however, it represents only one aspect of what breast cancer survivors require as part of comprehensive care. Other aspects of follow-up, such as assessing for symptoms of distant metastases, side effects of completed or ongoing therapy, and psychosocial well-being, are likely as important as the clinical examination. 29 For most survivors treated with breast conservation, the optimal provider to participate in breast cancer follow-up should be the one best positioned to collectively address all of these issues. Given that the majority of breast cancer survivors are treated with endocrine therapy, 30 this will most often be the medical oncologist; however, there will be circumstances where the ongoing participation of a radiation oncologist or surgeon in addition to the medical oncologist will be necessary or desired. This may be the case for patients with significant radiation toxicity, side effects related to axillary surgery, or at especially high risk of lymph node recurrences; in these circumstances, the relative value of a focused clinical examination may be higher. Combination follow-up with multiple oncology providers may also represent a patient's preferred follow-up strategy, especially if she has a strong relationship with her providers. Furthermore, there may be patients whose preferred follow-up strategy incorporates primary care. Thinking about what the specific follow-up goals are for an individual patient can help different types of providers determine what their personal roles and responsibilities in follow-up care should be, and guide their decision whether to participate in ongoing follow-up for that patient. This is an important first step towards streamlining breast cancer follow-up care, with the potential to increase both the quality and efficiency of follow-up."}]
