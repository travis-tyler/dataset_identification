[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The growth regulating active ingredient 2,4-D was patented in the early 1940's (Peterson, 1967). Its post-war commercialization as a selective, post-emergent herbicide transformed domestic weed management practices and ushered in the modern era of chemical weed control. Glyphosate was synthesized and patented in 1970 (Franz, Mao, and Sikorski 1997). It could be used as post-emergent herbicide, but only carefully, due to its toxicity and non-selectivity. Genetically engineered, herbicide tolerant (HT) crops were commercialized in 1996. Once HT crops were commercialized, post-emergence glyphosate use increased dramatically. Though glyphosate accounted for only one percent of herbicide use in 1980, it accounted for over half of the pounds applied in 2008(Fernandez et al. 2014a. Unfortunately, farmers' reliance on glyphosate has led to the development of glyphosate-resistant weed populations. As of 2014, over 14 glyphosate-resistant weed species have been identified in U.S. crop production areas (Heap, 2015). This article uses a structural model of U.S. corn farmers' weed control decisions to derive cost functions for pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicides. These cost functions are estimated using cross sections of nationally representative survey data collected in 2005 and 2010. The results are used to calculate a variety of estimates, including: the yield losses caused by weeds, the yield losses abated by pre-emergent and post-emergent glyphosate use, and the percent of weed control eroded by glyphosate resistance."}, {"section_title": "Structural Models of Pest Control", "text": "It is generally assumed that the marginal product of agricultural inputs is positive and decreasing.

However, the impacts of adoption have been studied using a variety of reducedform approaches. For instance, Fernandez-Cornejo et al. (2002) analyzed the impacts of HT soybean adoption using data collected during the USDA's 1997 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS). They found that HT soybean adoption had a small, statistically significant impact on yields, but a statistically insignificant impact on profits. Fernandez-Cornejo et al. (2005) employed a similar approach using ARMS data collected in 2000. They found that HT soybean adoption increased off-farm, but not on-farm, income. Nolan and Santos 2012estimated a reduced form model of corn yields using data from US field trials. They did not find evidence that planting seeds with HT traits increased yields. To our knowledge, this is the first article to use the damage abatement framework to explicitly model the uncertainty induced by the timing of corn farmers' weed control decisions. However, our primary contribution is to quantify the extent to which glyphosate resistance has affected the yields of U.S. corn farmers. Though field tests can indicate whether resistance has developed in field-level populations, the test we propose can be employed for large study regions. It can be administered wherever data about prices, field characteristics, and farmers' production practices are collected."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Model", "text": "If left uncontrolled, weeds compete with crops for space, sunlight, and nutrients. Farmers control weeds by applying a variety of herbicides ( ) during different stages ( t ) of the growing season. Prior to crop emergence, non-selective herbicides such as glyphosate can be applied. Post emergence, farmers that plant non-herbicide tolerant seeds must apply non-selective herbicides carefully or use selective herbicides that will not damage their crops. 1 Our two-stage model reflects these stylized facts and the timing of U.S. corn farmers' herbicide use decisions. In the first stage, farmers choose the amount of pre-emergent herbicide ( 1 j H ) to apply and the type of seed (conventional or herbicide tolerant) to plant. In this stage there is uncertainty about future environmental conditions. In the second stage, farmers observe environmental conditions and apply post-emergent herbicides ( 2 j H ). The per-acre dynamic profit function is: where P is the price of the crop, j p is the price of herbicide j , j HT p is the price of the herbicide tolerant seeds, T p is the cost of tillage, x p is the fertilizer price, j HT is an indicator for herbicide tolerant seed use, T is an indicator for tillage, x reflects fertilizer use, and Y reflects agricultural output (e.g., the production function). The farmer's objective is to maximize expected profits by determining the amount of herbicides to apply in each stage, the amount of fertilizer to apply, and whether or not to till: where Z t is the weed populations in each stage, \uf065 H and \uf065 Z are random variables that affect potential yields and weed populations, and f Z 1 \uf028 \uf029 is the transition function for the weed populations. In order to derive closed-form solutions for the pre-emergent and post-emergent herbicide demand functions, an explicit form must be chosen for the abatement function. Similarly to Fox and Weersink (1995), we specify the abatement function such is a damage function (which reflects the percentage of potential output damaged by pests) and t C is a pest control function (which reflects the percentage of pests killed by abating inputs). The weed population levels in the second stage are dependent on the uncontrolled weed populations from the first stage. Therefore, the weed population transition function is: where r is the growth rate of weeds from stage one to stage two. 2 The weed control and damage functions are specified using exponential cumulative distribution functions. The weed control function in period 1 is: where 1 j c is the efficacy of each pre-emergent herbicide and T c is the efficacy of tillage. The weed control function in period 2 is: where 2 j c is the efficacy of each post-emergent herbicide. The damage function is: where d is a damage parameter. Given equations (3), (4), (5) and (6) the abatement function is: We assume that there are two sources of uncertainty in the model: environmental conditions affecting potential yields ( ), and environmental conditions affecting weed populations ( ).

We estimate the system using Nonlinear Full Information Maximum Likelihood (NFIML), the maximum likelihood analogue of nonlinear three-stage least squares (N3SLS). The error vector is assumed to be multivariate normal. Although not strictly required for identification, estimation is aided by cross-equation parameter restrictions and nonlinearities arising from the structural model (Wooldridge, 2010). 4 There are a number of advantages associated with the NFIML estimator. First, it is the only widely-accepted method of endogenous system estimation that does not require instrumental variables. Thus, our approach avoids the pitfalls associated with weak or invalid instruments. Second, when the distributional assumption is accurate, the NFIML estimator has been shown to be the most efficient of the extremum estimators (Hayashi, 2000). Third, NFIML estimators are robust to the choice of likelihood distribution. In particular, Phillips (1982) shows that consistency of the NFIML estimator is maintained even under non-normal error distributions. The NFIML objective function is (Amemiya, 1977): where N is the number of observations, M is the number of equations, Jacobian matrix of the system of equations, and \uf053 \uf059 \uf028 \uf029 is the covariance matrix, which depends on the p-dimensional vector of parameters, \uf059 i .

These expansion factors are calculated annually by NASS statisticians. To ensure that our results are nationally representative, we adopt a bootstrapping procedure that resamples each field (with replacement) according to NASS' population expansion factor (Goodwin and Mishra, 2006). Results are generally reported as means across 250 bootstrap samples. Exogenous sources of variation that explain HT seed adoption, tillage adoption, and yield expectations include real input prices, real output prices, weather, climate, and soil and land characteristics. Farm Resource Region indicators (Heimlich, 2000) account for time-invariant sources of unobserved factors that could otherwise contribute to omitted variables bias. For example, these indicators could capture long-term variation in extension services, differences in regional weed species, longstanding agricultural policies, and unobserved factors influencing management strategies clustered in certain regions. 10"}, {"section_title": "Censoring and Regression Switching", "text": "Given the extensive adoption of herbicide-tolerant corn production systems in recent years, which tend to rely heavily on post-emergent herbicides (e.g., Roundup TM ), pre-emergent herbicides are not used on the majority of fields in our dataset (roughly 65%). This contributes to a substantial empirical censoring problem. There is relatively less censoring in post-emergent herbicide expenditures; these herbicides are not applied to approximately 15% of the observations in our sample. We employ the methods described in Yen and Lin (2002) to account for censoring in NFIML estimation. Inference related to weed resistance and interactions with HT seed adoption could be biased if pre-and post-emergent glyphosate and non-glyphosate herbicides are aggregated. Therefore, we distinguish between the following six cases: Cases (1) and (2) describe farmers who use both pre and post emergent herbicides. Cases (3) and(4) describe farmers who use post-emergent, but not pre-emergent herbicides. Cases 5and 6describe farmers who use pre-emergent, but not post-emergent herbicides. We exclude farmers who use neither pre-emergent nor post-emergent herbicides from the sample.

Commodity-specific versions of the Phase II questionnaire are administered approximately once every five years. Therefore, this study utilizes data from the 2005 and 2010 ARMS Phase II Corn Surveys. The Phase II ARMS data contain information about seed choices, tillage decisions, and yield goals. It also contains information about the timing of herbicide applications, the mode of application, and the quantity of every herbicide product applied. The ARMS survey collects information about a wide range of prices. However, the response rates for these questions are low and highly variable.  to average 11-25 bu/ac higher than realized yields. Tillage was used most frequently (in 82% of fields) when pre-emergent herbicides were not applied. When a pre-emergent herbicide was applied the tillage rate dropped to approximately 55%.

Tillage is increasing in the glyphosate price, which suggests that it is a substitute for herbicide applications. Farmers' yield goals are increasing in the glyphosate price, the corn price, and the farm size. Notably, we find that average fall 30-year precipitation is only significant in the tillage adoption regression, while several of the regional indicators are only significant in the yield goals equation. These present useful exclusions among the instrument sets. Such exclusions facilitate identification but are not strictly necessary for control functions that are nonlinear in combinations of instruments (Terza et al., 2008;Wooldridge, 2015). Terza et al. (2008) notes that, under the general assumptions of an M-estimation model, the exogeneity of potentially endogenous regressors can be tested using a conventional Wald test of the null hypothesis that the coefficients on the generalized residuals jointly equal zero. Further, under the maintained distributional assumptions of the NFIML model, the Wald test, Lagrange multiplier test, and likelihood ratio test have the same limiting distribution (Gallant and Holly, 1980). Since NFIML is a type of M-estimator (Hayashi, 2000), this suits our purposes. We conduct simple tests of exogeneity by calculating likelihood ratio tests for each bootstrap sample (Amemiya, 1985).

Parameters of interest reflect the effectiveness of pre-emergent herbicides ( c 1 ), postemergent glyphosate ( c 2 g ), and other post-emergent herbicides ( c 2 ng ). Not surprisingly, we find that the effectiveness of post-emergent glyphosate is decreasing in the number of glyphosate-resistant weeds. Generally, our results suggest that herbicides were less effective in 2010 than in 2005. Many of the parameter estimates related to potential yields and the proxies for uncontrolled weed pressure have the expected signs and reasonable magnitudes. Estimates of potential yield, , suggest that fields in 2010 with the highest soil productivity for corn and soybeans, and mean growing degree days and seasonal precipitation have average corn yields approaching 176 bu/ac. This is comparable to realized 2014 state yields in Illinois of 200 bu/ac and 2015 Iowa yields of 192 bu/ac (NASS, 2016). The results of our model suggest that pre-emergent weed pressure was relatively high on fields located in Minnesota, South Dakota, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois. The severity of postemergent weed infestations was relatively high in Kansas, Minnesota, Illinois, Iowa and Wisconsin. Generally, pre-emergent weed pressure was lower than post-emergent weed pressure. Post-emergent weed pressure appears to have been more severe in 2010 than in 2005."}, {"section_title": "Model Predictions", "text": "Assuming that farmers used neither pre-emergent nor post-emergent herbicides, the model predicts that weeds would have caused average yield losses of approximately 91 bu/ac (60% of the full sample. Given the complex way in which the weights enter our nonlinear system, estimating the full-sample, weighted log-likelihood is not generally feasible. These results closely correspond to the results of many field tests. For instance, Gower et al. (2002) found that weeds damaged 37% of potential yields on tilled fields when herbicides were not applied and seven % of potential yields when glyphosate was applied at the label rate. On fields that have been tilled, our model predicts that weeds damage 42% of potential yields when herbicides are not applied and 12% of potential yields at observed herbicide application rates (table   7). Our model appears to perform less well on fields in no-till rotations. While Gower et al. found that weeds damaged 92% of potential yields on no-till fields when herbicides were not applied, our model predicted only 83%. The differences were even more pronounced at observed herbicide levels. Gower et al. found that only 2% of potential yields were damaged when glyphosate was applied at the label rate. Our model predicted that 44% of potential yields were damaged. One possibility is that our model underestimates the efficacy of pre-emergent herbicides. This would not be surprising given that the empirical model does not differentiate between pre-emergent glyphosate and non-glyphosate applications. Future work will address this concern. Not surprisingly, our results suggest that the presence of resistant weeds decreases the effectiveness of post-emergent glyphosate applications. Glyphosate appears to kill approximately 98% of weeds when applied at the label rate in HT production systems (see We found that the benefits associated with post-emergent herbicide use were approximately three times larger than the benefits associated with pre-emergent usage in both 2005 and 2010. Though our results suggest that resistance decreased the effectiveness of post-emergent glyphosate applications in HT production systems, these results should be interpreted cautiously.
