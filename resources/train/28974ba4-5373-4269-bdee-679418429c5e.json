[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Objective: To determine whether age-standardized brain morphometric and cognitive profiles differ in young-old (aged 60-75 years) and very-old (aged 80-91 years) patients with Alzheimer disease (AD).\nMethods: Using a case-control retrospective design, we compared hippocampal volume and cortical gray matter thickness in areas known to be affected by AD in 105 patients with AD and 125 healthy control (HC) participants divided into young-old and very-old subgroups. Brain morphometric and cognitive scores of the AD groups were standardized to their respective ageappropriate HC subgroup and then compared.\nResults: Several cognitive domains (executive function, immediate memory, and attention/processing speed) were less abnormal in the very old with AD than in the young old with AD. Similarly, the very old with AD showed less severe cortical thinning than the young old with AD in the left posterior cingulate cortex, right lateral temporal cortex, and bilateral parietal cortex and in overall cortical thickness. This effect is partially explained by an age-related decrease in cortical thickness in these brain regions in the HC participants.\nThe typical pattern of AD-related cognitive and morphometric changes seen in the young old appear to be less salient in the very old. Thus, mild cases of AD in the very old may go undetected if one expects to see the prototypical pattern and severity of cognitive or brain changes that occur in the young old with AD. These results underscore the importance of interpreting neuropsychological test performance and morphometric brain measures in reference to the individual's age.

Normal aging is associated with cognitive decline and increasing variability in cognitive abilities, [2] [3] [4] which makes the typical profile of neuropsychological deficits associated with AD less salient in the very-old patient than in the young-old (i.e., aged \u054575 years) patient. 5 Age-related decline and increased interindividual variability may also attenuate the usefulness of MRI-derived measures of regional brain volumes as markers of early AD in older patients. 6 A number of studies have used a regression-based approach to evaluate the influence of age on brain volume changes associated with AD, but few have directly contrasted young-old and very-old patients with AD using regional brain atrophy measures standardized to age-appropriate normative cohorts.\nThe current study used a sample of normally aging participants to derive standard scores for both neuropsychological and structural MRI measures to determine whether cognitive decline and regional brain atrophy profiles differ in young-old and very-old patients with early AD. We predicted that, when age-appropriate standard scores are compared, 1) very-old patients (i.e., aged \u054680 years) would have less severe cognitive impairment than young-old patients (i.e., aged \u054575 years), replicating previous findings 5 and 2) very-old patients would have less abnormality of brain morphometric features than young-old patients.\nMETHODS Data used were obtained from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (www.loni. ucla.edu/ADNI). ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, and private pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit organizations as a 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biologic markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Participants have been recruited from more than 50 sites across the United States and Canada (www.adni-info.org).\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. This study was approved by an ethical standards committee on human experimentation at University of California, San Diego, and at each ADNI-affiliated institution. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients participating in the study or authorized representatives.\nParticipants. ADNI general eligibility criteria are described at www.adni-info.org/Scientists/ADNIGrant/ProtocolSummary.aspx. Participants included in the present study were aged 60 -91 years, were nondepressed, had a modified Hachinski score of 4 or less, and had a study partner able to provide an independent evaluation of functioning. Healthy control (HC) participants had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 24 and 30 (inclusive), had a global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 7 score of 0, and did not meet the criteria for MCI. 8 Participants with mild AD had MMSE scores between 20 and 26 and global CDR scores of 0.5 or 1.0 and met the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD. 9 A measure derived from the components of the CDR known as sum of boxes was calculated to further estimate the level of clinical impairment.\nHC participants and participants with AD were divided into 2 groups on the basis of their age at testing: a young-old group (age range 60 -75 years) and a very-old group (aged \u054580 years). Our initial sample included 268 participants: 89 young-old HC participants, 76 young-old patients with AD, 45 very-old HC participants, and 58 very old patients with AD. Five HC participants and 29 participants with AD were excluded based on poor quality of imaging data because they did not pass local quality control criteria for magnetic resonance images. HC participants received follow-up study visits at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. We excluded any control subject who developed MCI or AD at any follow-up visit (3 young-old HC participants and one very-old HC participant). This method of selection and group assignment resulted in an approximately 12-year mean age difference between the young-old and very-old groups. Final group demographic characteristics are presented in table 1. Individual test scores on each measure were converted to z scores based on the mean and SD of the respective HC group. The z scores were modified to ensure that negative scores represented poorer performance. Composite scores for each of the 6 neuropsychological domains were then calculated by averaging z scores across the tests within each domain."}, {"section_title": "Magnetic resonance scanning and brain morphometry.", "text": "Protocols are described in detail at www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/ Research/Cores/index.shtml. Two T1-weighted volumes were acquired for each participant. These raw DICOM MRI scans were downloaded from the public ADNI site (www.loni.ucla. edu/ADNI/Data/index.shtml). Images were reviewed locally for quality, automatically corrected for spatial distortion due to gradient nonlinearity 11 and B1 field inhomogeneity, 12 registered, and averaged to improve the signal/noise ratio. Volumetric 13, 14 and cortical surface reconstruction [15] [16] [17] methods based on FreeSurfer software, optimized for use on large, multisite datasets, were used. To measure thickness, the cortical surface was reconstructed 15 and parcellated into distinct regions of interest (ROIs). 17, 18 Details of the application of these methods to the ADNI data have been described elsewhere. 19 To limit the number of comparisons, only regions assumed to be involved in early AD pathology 11,20 -22 were included in the present analyses and several cortical thickness ROIs were combined as follows: caudal and rostral anterior cingulate regions were combined as anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); isthmus and posterior cingulate regions were combined as posterior cingulate cortex (PCC); superior, middle, and inferior temporal regions were combined as lateral temporal regions; parahippocampal and entorhinal areas were combined as medial temporal regions; rostral and caudal middle frontal and frontal pole were combined as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC); lateral and medial orbitofrontal areas and pars orbitalis were combined as orbitofrontal regions; precuneus, superior parietal, inferior parietal, and supramarginal regions were combined as parietal regions; and lateral occipital, cuneus, and pericalcarine areas were combined as occipital regions. All of these ROIs were also averaged to create a measure of average cortical thickness. A hippocampal ROI was based on the volume of the entire structure (not cortical thickness) and was not included in the overall cortical thickness measure."}, {"section_title": "Statistical analyses. Group comparisons of composite z", "text": "scores from each of the 6 neuropsychological domains were performed with separate independent samples t tests. When the assumption of homogeneity of variance was not met, the t value and significance of the comparison were based on unequal variances. Effect sizes for group differences on the composite scores were calculated using Cohen d, computed by dividing the mean difference between groups by the pooled SD.\nTo assess the group difference in MRI morphometric variables, the effect of gender was first regressed from all thickness and volumetric measures. In addition, both left and right hippocampal volumes were corrected for differences in head size by regressing the estimated total cranial vault (eTIV) volume. 23 Volumetric and cortical thickness measures for the 2 AD groups were then z transformed relative to their respective HC group with negative values indicative of smaller volume or less cortical thickness. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) and follow-up univariate analyses were performed on these z-transformed scores. Effect sizes for group differences on the z-transformed morphometric values were calculated. Results were considered significant if the effect size was 0.50 or greater, which corresponded to an \u2423 level of 0.01.\nRESULTS Cognition. Figure 1 shows the mean composite z scores of young-old and very-old patients with AD in each cognitive domain. The young-old AD group was more impaired, relative to their age-appropriate HC group, than the very-old AD group in the domains of executive function (t 93 . The raw scores of the young-old and very-old AD and HC groups for individual cognitive tests are shown in table 2. To assess group differences in cognition, independent of overall cortical atrophy, the effect of average cortical thickness (raw value) was regressed from all cognitive measures, and the above analyses were repeated. The pattern of results and significance of the findings remained unchanged; thus, only the uncorrected data are reported.\nMorphometry. Differences between young-old and very-old AD groups on morphometric measures were assessed by comparing the z scores derived from each group's age-appropriate HC group after controlling for the effects of gender (for volumetric and thickness measures) and eTIV (for volumetric measures (before collapsing across ROIs) for young-old and very-old AD and HC groups after controlling for gender (for both volumetric and thickness measures) and eTIV volumes (for the volumetric measure) for those regions with differences that were significant or approached significance ( p \u03fd 0.05).\nDISCUSSION The present results demonstrate that certain morphometric brain abnormalities associated with AD are less salient in very-old patients than in young-old patients despite similar levels of global cognitive impairment in the 2 groups. When compared with their respective age-appropriate HC groups, very-old patients showed less severe cortical thinning than young-old patients in the left PCC, right lateral temporal cortex, and bilateral parietal cortex and in overall cortical thickness averaged across all ROIs. This effect is partially explained by an age-related decrease in cortical thickness in these brain regions in the HC participants (table 3) .

Thus, cortical thickness reduction that can be attributed to AD in these brain regions is more difficult to detect in very-old patients with AD than in young-old patients with AD. The observed pattern of age-related differences in abnormalities in cortical thickness is reflected in the pattern of age-related differences in the severity of cognitive abnormalities exhibited by the AD groups. Consistent with previous findings, 5 ,24 the present results showed that very-old patients with AD were less impaired (i.e., were less abnormal) than young-old patients with AD in the domains of immediate memory, attention/processing speed, and executive function. As with cortical thickness measures, the reduced degree of abnormality in these cognitive domains can be at least partially explained by an age-related decrease in performance in HC participants (table 2) . Very-old HC participants scored significantly lower than young-old HC participants on a number of measures in these domains (e.g., Digit Symbol Substitution, Trail Making Test Part B, Digit Span-Forward). Similar age-related decrements were reported previously and were attributed, in part, to deterioration Table 3 Estimated marginal volume, controlling for gender effect and estimated total cranial vault volume for hippocampus, and estimated marginal thickness, controlling for gender effect, for frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate regions by group of the frontoparietal cortical systems involved in attention and response selection. 25, 26 Not all brain regions usually affected by AD showed differential levels of volumetric or cortical thickness abnormality in very-old and young-old patients with AD. For example, the AD groups did not significantly differ in degree of abnormality in hippocampal volume or medial temporal cortical thickness, corroborating previous results. 27 Although atrophy of the hippocampus and medial temporal gyrus increased with age in the HC participants, the degree of difference between the HC and AD groups remained large. Consistent with this finding, the AD groups did not differ in the degree of abnormality on delayed recall or savings measures (although this result approached significance) that are largely mediated by the hippocampus and related medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. These results suggest that early and severe atrophy of the hippocampus and MTL cortex due to AD greatly eclipses normal age-related changes and allows atrophy in these regions to be a salient marker of AD regardless of the elderly patient's age.\nIt has been proposed that imaging or other types of biomarkers are critically needed to detect AD early so that interventions can be applied before the disease significantly diminishes cognitive function. 28 Previous studies have shown that MRI-derived indices of atrophy have high sensitivity and specificity for detecting disease in symptomatic patients and, therefore, have the potential to be effective biomarkers. However, our results suggest that it is critical to consider the effect of age in application of MRI-derived markers because they may be better able to distinguish patients with AD from healthy elderly individuals in the young-old than in the very-old groups. A similar loss of saliency may occur with aging for other biomarkers (e.g., tau and A\u2424 in CSF), given the overlap that occurs in AD and the aging process. Indeed, some evidence suggests that AD-related increases in the densities of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that underlie some biomarkers are less profound in very-old than in young-old individuals. 29, 30 Some limitations of the present study should be noted. First, the cross-sectional nature of the study limits the ability to determine whether rate of change in hippocampal volume or cortical thickness is similar in very-old and young-old patients with AD and whether abnormality in rate of change is influenced by age. The results need to be replicated longitudinally to address this issue and to directly compare rate of change in regional brain volumes against rates of cognitive decline. Second, histopathologic verification of disease is not available so it is possible that some participants have a disorder other than AD or have AD with comorbid pathology that contributes to cognitive and neuroimaging presentations. The prevalence of vascular pathology in AD, for example, has been reported to be roughly 30%-60%. 28, 31 Although ADNI exclusionary criteria ensure a low prevalence of vascular risk factors, the impact of white matter changes on the pattern of cognitive and regional brain changes in AD across different age groups may help explain some of the observed differences in cognitive profiles. Third, impaired initial learning can lead to an inflated savings score (percentage retained) in some cases; thus, results from this measure must be interpreted with caution. For example, an individual who learns only one item on list learning and then recalls only that same item after a delay would have 100% savings, despite poor overall memory performance. To reduce the chance of significant inflating in our savings variable, we excluded any outliers (\u05463 SD from the overall group mean). Fourth, other brain variables may contribute to the different cognitive deficit profiles seen in the 2 groups. For example, normal aging is associated with mild brain atrophy on structural MRI, 6 decreased hemodynamic response on fMRI, 32 reduced synaptic density, 33 increased white matter hyperintensities, 6, 34, 35 and a subclinical accumulation of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in MTL regions. 36 These brain changes are accompanied by age-related declines in information-processing speed, executive functions, and efficiency of learning and recall 3, 4, 35, 37 and may help explain the observed differences in severity of cognitive abnormalities in very-old and young-old patients with AD. These possibilities will be addressed in future studies.\nOverall, the present results indicate that overlap between normal and AD-related MRI-based morphometric changes is greater in the very old than in the young old. Thus, the typical pattern of ADrelated morphometric changes seen in the young old is less salient in the very old. A similar loss of saliency in cognitive profiles is evident because of greater overlap in normal and AD-related decline in executive functions, attention/psychomotor processing, and immediate memory in very-old than in youngold individuals. These results highlight the possibility that mild cases of AD in the very old may go undetected and underscore the importance of interpreting neuropsychological test performance and morphometric changes (i.e., atrophy) in reference to the individual's age. A clarification of how the presentation of AD changes with age may enhance our ability to detect early AD in the very old, one of the fastest growing segments of the population. 38 Indeed, enhanced detection is crucial for early application of interventions that may slow the disease process, thus preserving cognitive status, functional independence, and quality of life."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "Dr. Stricker: drafting/revising the manuscript, study concept or design, analysis or interpretation of data, and study supervision.
