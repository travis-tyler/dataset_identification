[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "In situ observing and satellite remote sensing components of the Southeast Atlantic Coastal Ocean Observing System (SEACOOS) implemented from 2002 through 2006 are reviewed and \"lessons learned\" from the operation of these systems are summarized. The in situ observing program built upon several efforts initiated at academic institutions in the southeast U.S. prior to 2002. The partnership and observing capacity were expanded as the SEACOOS program developed. Sustained near real-time in situ observations were obtained from buoys, offshore towers, pier and shore stations, and mobile platforms (ships, gliders, drifters) using several communications options. The SEACOOS observing program also included several test-bed studies, and a pilot program in regional satellite remote sensing utilized established capabilities at partner institutions to deliver satellite products in near real-time to SEACOOS. Many of the SEACOOS observing activities leveraged personnel and infrastructure resources at partner institutions and support from complementary research projects. The SEACOOS experience provides a number of pragmatic (operational) \"lessons learned\" that are relevant to the future operation of a Regional Coastal Ocean Observing System (RCOOS). Adequate support of experienced personnel is critical to the efficient, sustained operation of a real-time observing network. Also required are sufficient inventories of spare components, appropriate transportation options to accommodate both routine and unscheduled maintenance, robust communications with sufficient bandwidth and back-up options, and data logging on deployment platforms to minimize gaps in the time-series. RCOOS planning should include mechanisms to ensure effective communications on operational matters among technical personnel within and across regions."}, {"section_title": "T Introduction", "text": "he primary charge for the SEACOOS Observing Working Group (OWG) was to provide in situ and remote observations to support state variable estimations for the southeast U.S. coastal ocean and atmosphere. SEACOOS made a significant investment in observations, notably in the first three years of the program when equipment and deployment costs represented a large portion of the SEACOOS budget (see Seim et al., this volume) . Although gaps in spatial coverage remained, SEACOOS significantly augmented the federal realtime observing assets in the region; both in terms of the number of locations and in the variables measured. In situ observations included sub-surface, as well as surface temperature and salinity, current profiles through the water column, directional waves, and bio-optical properties. A pilot program incorporating satellite remote sensing was initiated in the second year of the program and delivered near-real time satellite products to the SEACOOS data portal (see Fletcher et al. this volume) .\nEnhancing capabilities for data assimilative modeling and prediction is among the objectives for a future regional coastal ocean observing system (RCOOS) for the southeast U.S. Developing the observational network to support this will require experience with a broad mix of sensors, deployment platforms and communica-tions options, and consideration of how to optimally deploy the observing assets that can be supported with the available resources. Thus, along with the scientific rationale for what is needed and where (see Weisberg et al., submitted) , the RCOOS design will require credible estimates of operational requirements for the deployed assets (including personnel, equipment inventories and transportation).\nAt the start of the SEACOOS program (Fall 2001) , experience with sustained (operational) in situ ocean observing as envisioned for the U.S. component of the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) was limited. (See Ocean.US [2002] for the status of the IOOS concept at that time, and Briscoe et al. [this volume] and Seim and Mooers [this volume] for further historical context for the IOOS and SEACOOS, respectively). The NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) operated a network of buoys and fixed platforms which focused on surface ocean conditions, particularly as relevant to marine weather observations and forecasts (surface meteorological data, sea surface temperature, non-directional waves). The Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) in NOAA's National Ocean Service (NOS) managed the National Water Level Observation Network (NWLON). NWLON focused on coastal water level observations to provide reference stations for tidal predictions, track local storm surge in real-time, and accumulate time-series data for evaluating longer P A P E R term trends in coastal sea level. In 2001, several local to sub-regional pilot efforts in real-time coastal ocean observing were underway in the southeast U.S., including projects involving some of the initial SEA-COOS partners (described below). These sought to fill gaps in the existing NDBC/ NWLON real-time network, enhance the range of variables observed, provide near real-time data for forecasting models, and acquire distributed time-series information for coastal ocean research.\nDuring the SEACOOS program, a range of in situ systems were deployed and evaluated in sustained operations. Test-bed activities examined observing technologies and validated products. Although operating at a pilot level, the observing assets deployed by SEACOOS also benefited research programs within the region, providing important time-series data and observing infrastructure for process studies, and an expanded set of observations used to force and validate coastal ocean circulation models.\nThe synergy between observing system activities and coastal ocean research was evident in the substantial leveraging of SEACOOS resources by partners in the program. While SEACOOS benefited from the contributions of experienced personnel at the partner institutions, few of the engineering and technical support personnel responsible for the design, deployment and maintenance of the observing system components were supported solely by SEACOOS. Key personnel were also supported in part through complementary research projects and through support by the partner institutions. The partner institutions also provided significant infrastructure and facilities support for the SEACOOS observing program, including engineering services, fabrication of system components, vessel operations, satellite remote sensing capabilities, information technology and communications. The significant opportunities for leveraging RCOOS investments with the resources available at academic institutions should be recognized in IOOS and RCOOS development plans.\nThis review of the SEACOOS observing program documents: 1) the origins and implementation strategy for the SEA-COOS observing program; 2) the in situ observing assets deployed and operated by SEACOOS partners; 3) a pilot program incorporating satellite remote sensing into the regional observing network; 4) a number of pragmatic (operational) \"lessons learned\" from the SEACOOS observing program; and 5) several programmatic issues that are relevant to RCOOS development and operation."}, {"section_title": "Origins and Development of the SEACOOS Observing Program", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Implementation Strategy", "text": "The distribution of real-time observations in the southeast U.S. coastal ocean at the start of the SEACOOS program is shown in Figure 1 . This was a sparse network, with most of the offshore observations coming from NOAA NDBC buoys and C-MAN stations measuring meteorological variables and a limited set of surface ocean properties. It was recognized that SEACOOS resources would not be sufficient to fill all significant gaps in spatial coverage for in situ observations in the region. Thus, as a prototype RCOOS, the implementation strategy for the SEA-COOS observing program was a phased build-out from existing assets, engaging a number of experienced groups in the region and enhancing test-bed capabilities for various platforms. (Seim et al. [this volume] (41012) on the continental shelf off St. Augustine, Florida.\nGiven the funding history of the SEA-COOS program, the approach that was adopted for development of the in situ observing system appears to have been appropriate. While there was considerable expansion of observing assets in Years 1-3, budget reductions in Years 4 and 5 (to about 84% and 27% of Year 3 levels, respectively; Seim et al., this volume) constrained capabilities to service what had been deployed and to retain key technical personnel. Adjusting to the budget reductions would have been a greater challenge for a more dispersed network with more partners and a larger personnel pool."}, {"section_title": "SEACOOS Partners in the Observing Program", "text": "The initial SEACOOS in situ observations were based on sub-regional observing projects that had been initiated through funding from several sources. Additional partners and observing capabilities were added as the SEACOOS program grew. These additions considered the capabilities that the new partners could bring to the program, in terms of implementing specific observing technologies (e.g., HF radar and regional satellite remote sensing) and contributions to targeted applications (e.g., near-shore directional waves).\nThe most advanced sub-regional observing effort at the start of SEACOOS was the Coastal Ocean Monitoring and Prediction System (COMPS; http://comps. marine.usf.edu/), an integrated observing/modeling network operated by the University of South Florida (USF) on the West Florida Shelf 1 . COMPS was formally initiated in 1995 in response to coastal flooding events in West Florida that resulted from tropical and extra-tropical storms, building on experience with pilot moorings on the shelf (Cole et al., 2003) . The coastal ocean system is complemented by a Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTS) monitoring system for Tampa Bay that was initiated in 1990 (http://ompl. marine.usf.edu/PORTS). The observing assets deployed at the start of SEACOOS included three buoys with surface telemetry (real-time), two internally recording bottom-mounted packages (delayed mode reporting) and six shore stations. Applications of COMPS observations and models have included analysis and forecasts of coastal ocean circulation and harmful algal blooms on the West Florida Shelf Weisberg et al., submitted) .\nSeveral observing activities at the University of Miami (Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, UM RSMAS) were incorporated into SEA-COOS. 2 High frequency radar (HF radar) measurement of surface currents (Shay et al., this volume) was an area of focused effort, with an initial test deployment within the COMPS domain for inter-comparison of HF radar and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) current measurements (Shay et al., 2007) . SEACOOS also supported developmental work on an ADCP/ CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) profiling package, and partnered with the Explorer of the Seas project (http://www. rsmas.miami.edu/rccl/), in which a cruise liner was equipped with meteorological and oceanographic instrumentation.\nOff Georgia, the South Atlantic Bight Synoptic Offshore Observational Network 3 (SABSOON; http://www.skio.usg. edu/research/sabsoon/), coordinated by the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO), was initiated in 1998. Through the cooperation of the managers of a U.S. Navy flight training range (operated from the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina), SkIO and partners were provided access to several Navy towers located on the middle and outer Georgia continental shelf. The initial meteorological and oceanographic sensors and associated power, communications and mechanical systems are described in Seim (2000) . Partners at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SC DNR) deployed an underwater video system at an artificial reef near one of the towers to evaluate use of video records for fisheries research (Barans et al., 2005; and "}, {"section_title": "Observing Assets Operated by SEACOOS Partners", "text": "Given the substantial observing needs of an RCOOS, use of multiple observing platforms and a range of communications and power system options will be required. Detailed description of the in situ deployment packages utilized in SEA-COOS is beyond the scope of the present document (i.e., the specific instruments and associated data acquisition, power, communications and mechanical systems). The emphasis here will be to describe the in situ deployment platforms utilized, key challenges encountered, and operational \"lessons learned\" during the SEACOOS program. The pilot satellite remote sensing program in SEACOOS, several test-bed activities, and examples of ship-based surveys conducted in response to specific events are also summarized."}, {"section_title": "Fixed Position In Situ Assets", "text": "The distribution of fixed position real-time observing assets deployed in the southeast U.S. coastal ocean between 2001-2006 is shown in Figure 2 , including federally supported systems and those operated by SEACOOS and other sub-regional observing programs.

(2003) . These are single point moorings, modeled after the 3 m discus buoy design employed by NOAA's NDBC. Buoy locations in the COMPS array were selected to span dynamically distinctive regimes on the West Florida Shelf, and to improve spatial coverage for the surface wind field used to force coastal ocean circulation models (e.g., Weisberg et al., 2005) . The most advanced buoys in the COMPS array ( Figure 3 ) are configured to measure air-sea interactions, with meteorological sensor packages based on the IMET or ASIMET design (developed by the Upper Ocean Processes Group, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute), supplemented to include long-and short-wave radiometers and precipitation, surface and sub-surface temperature and conductivity sensors and a buoy-mounted (downward directed) ADCP. Data are logged locally (ensuring uninterrupted time-series information in the event of communications failure) and transmitted hourly via GOES satellite. The basic COMPS buoy design has proven to be mechanically robust. Although meteorological sensors were damaged, one buoy (C17) survived near-passes by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma in 2005.\nUNC-CH began exploring buoy options in 2003 when it became clear that access to Navy towers off North Carolina was not likely to be granted (discussed below). Initially purchase of an NDBC buoy was explored, but at the time the NDBC configuration did not support both directional wave and ADCP observations, and the estimated cost was deemed to be high (less so in retrospect). Subsequently,"}, {"section_title": "FIgURE 2", "text": "Distribution of real-time in situ observations operated in the SE coastal ocean from 2002-2007 (the time frame of the SEACOOS program) and nominal coverage for surface currents from shore-based HF radar stations. Note that these sites were not all operating simultaneously. There were various time frames for deployments of individual assets, and, for most sites, there were temporary gaps in coverage because of equipment failures or communications issues. A number of inshore water level stations, onshore meteorological stations and USGS river gauge sites are not included.\nUNC-CH partnered with the UNC Institute of Marine Sciences (UNC-IMS, Moorehead City, NC) for a buoy deployment off Cape Lookout ( Figure 4 ) using a buoy hull purchased from the University of Maine/Gulf of Maine Ocean Observing System (GoMOOS; Wallinga et al., 2003; Pettigrew et al., this volume) . Several realtime telemetry options for the buoy-shore link were tested: cell phone (out of range of the available coastal coverage, which can be limited in some of the less populated areas of the southeast U.S. coast); freewave radio (requires a shore relay tower) and Iridium (performed well in terms of baud rate, but there were issues with the link through a single board computer used for data acquisition and communications). Operational challenges included storms (the buoy deployed in spring 2005 was damaged during Hurricane Isabelle in late summer 2005) and protection of electronics packages and instruments in the near-water environment (requiring some modifications of the initial design). Also, while the vessel available at UNC-IMS (18.3 m length) was adequate for in-field servicing the buoy under calm conditions, deployment and retrieval operations pushed its capabilities to their limits.\nA third class of buoy utilized in SEA-COOS was a commercial package for making directional wave measurements. A Triaxys directional wave buoy was deployed by the Georgia Institute of Technology, Savannah partner near Tybee Island, Georgia, as part of the SEACOOS near-shore wave initiative (Voulgaris et al. this volume) . This was operated between July, 2004 and April, 2007 . The Triaxys buoy is solar-powered, with a transparent Plexiglas dome covering solar panels. Communications used cell phone and Iridium, and Immarsat-D+ for backup. A separate internally recording ADCP package (RDI with wave module) was deployed near the Triaxys buoy for three months in 2005. Wave parameters derived from these two different approaches compared well overall (Work, 2008) . On the operational side, the Triaxys buoy is a low profile, spherical body, without a mast or radar reflector (which would bias the buoy response to wave motions). Although positioned out of the shipping channel and presumably out of areas of smaller boat traffic, during the 33 month cumulative deployment time, the buoy was apparently hit by boats on two and probably three occasions. The shallow-water mooring hardware for the buoy (including a heavy rubber damper section) is rated for a six-month service life. The buoy broke free on three occasions when the deployment period extended beyond this. A programmed cell phone notification when the updated position left a defined watch circle allowed a rapid small vessel response to tether the buoy until it could be recovered with a larger vessel on two occasions. However, on another, communications were inoperative until after the buoy had been blown across the shelf by strong offshore winds and entrained in the Gulf Stream. Intermittent communications via Immarsat-D+ provided position fixes over the following 9 months as the buoy drifted along the northern flank of the Gulf Stream into the mid-North Atlantic."}, {"section_title": "Offshore Navy Towers", "text": "The Navy towers off Georgia provided established infrastructure on middle and outer continental shelf with substantial on-site power generation, established highbandwidth, two-way communications (a microwave system links the three central platforms and shore), boat landings, and helicopter landing decks ( Figure 5 ). The observing program at the towers was conducted on a \"not-to-interfere\" basis with regard to Navy operations. In practice, a good working relationship was established with the range operators, and SABSOON servicing operations were often coordinated with those of the Navy contractor (e.g., helicopter flight plans and other logistics). The tower locations on the middle-to-outer portions of the broad continental shelf off Georgia are complemented by real-time observations further inshore; an NDBC buoy (41008) in NOAA's Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary (GRNMS)"}, {"section_title": "FIgURE 4", "text": "A photograph and schematic of the UNC-CH/IMS buoy deployed off Cape Lookout.

Power and communications bandwidth from the existing Navy systems were allocated to SkIO on two larger (\"master\") platforms. On a smaller platform (NE \"remote\" tower), the Navy systems were more limited, and SkIO installed separate power (solar panels, wind turbine, batteries, controller) and communications (microwave link to the nearest \"master\" tower). Data were logged on tower computers and retrieved hourly via the Navy microwave link to shore and T1 land-line from a shore relay tower to SkIO. UNC-CH partners also designed a self-contained instrument package that was deployed on the SE \"remote\" platform on the Georgia shelf (45 m depth). This location extended the offshore meteorological observations into the northern portion of the marine forecast zone for the National Weather Service (NWS), Jacksonville, Florida office. The SABSOON towers to the north are in the marine forecast zone for the NWS Charleston, South Carolina office. The instrumented towers were designated NDBC Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) stations, with meteorological and surface ocean data formatted and delivered to NOAA NDBC. 7 The use of Navy platforms came with some constraints. A major structural refurbishment of the towers in [2003] [2004] (including sandblasting and painting) required removal and reinstallation of much of the above-water equipment on the three instrumented towers. Transportation was a major cost consideration for the tower operations. While the helicopter option was initially cost-effective compared to research vessel charges (and attractive for the greatly reduced transit times), helicopter charges increased significantly over the course of the SEACOOS program. This became a serious consideration when budgets were reduced in Years 4 and 5. Vessels operated by the NOAA Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary (a partner in the SABSOON program) were also utilized when scheduling permitted. In retrospect, acquiring an appropriate vessel at the beginning of the program may have provided the most cost-effective and flexible transportation option. Other operational challenges included lightning, which damaged electronics and resulted in significant data gaps at two towers, and fishing activities. The offshore structures attract fish and thus fishermen, and underwater cables were damaged on several occasions by fish hooks or, in the case of cabled ADCP units, by boat anchors."}, {"section_title": "Other Offshore Towers in the Southeast U.S. Coastal Ocean", "text": "The Georgia towers are not the only offshore structures maintained by the Department of Defense (DOD) in the SEACOOS domain; other Navy ranges are located off Key West, Florida and off North Carolina.

Although unit costs for AUVs are significant, they provide a very cost-effective alternative to research vessel surveys. This potential comes with its own set of challenges, some common to fixed position in situ systems (e.g., communications, power management, bio-fouling), others unique to the particular mobile platform (e.g., the level of monitoring required during missions).\nThrough SEACOOS, UNC-CH purchased a Webb Electric Slocum glider, delivered in early 2005. A series of unrelated hardware failures caused early termination of the initial set of test deployments; these included failures of attitude and altitude sensors, GPS, and Iridium antenna and a bladder failure that resulted in a leak. This experience does not appear to be typical. For example, the UNC-CH group helped train UNC-Wilmington personnel to operate a Webb glider that was used in a number of successful month-long missions without any of the failures listed above. The UNC-CH glider was successfully operated for about 1 month in late summer 2006 on the outer shelf off Georgia, then was directed to a rendezvous point for pick-up by ship (Figure 7 ). The quality of Iridium communications and support from the company were judged to be quite good. Beyond the hardware failures (apparently unit-specific in this case), the greatest challenge with the glider is programming. While it employs a highly flexible programming environment, its use requires considerable expertise that must be gained through training and experience. Developing training programs for glider operations is an area where collaborations across regional associations could be very beneficial to the U.S. IOOS program. It is also important to note that when deployed on a mission, the UNC-CH glider required nearly round-the-clock support. A spontaneous reset of the glider control program (yet to be resolved) must be promptly corrected or mission failure (and possible loss of control) can result."}, {"section_title": "FIgURE 7", "text": "Example of repeated CTD profiles (temperature versus depth illustrated here) obtained with the Webb Slocum glider deployed by UNC-CH near the R4 Navy tower off Georgia in 2006.

In return, Horizon Marine was provided with support for mapping and visualization schemes developed for SEACOOS applications. This type of cooperative agreement may provide one approach to engage private industry in a future RCOOS observing program, and acquire valuable data at little cost for the RCOOS. Drifter data from the NOAA Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) Global Drifter Program was also collected by SEACOOS, and USF obtained additional drifter information for units deployed on the West Florida Shelf as part of a separately funded project. Overall, while the potential for incorporating drifter data into the regional program was demonstrated, to date this has been a somewhat untapped resource.

The set of atmospheric and oceanographic instruments installed on the Explorer (see, http:// www.rsmas.miami.edu/rccl/facilities.html) was well beyond that typically found on voluntary observing ships (VOS). While such observations can certainly augment those of a regional observing system, the Explorer program also showed that utilization of a large commercial vessel brings its own set of challenges, as illustrated by the ADCP data records.\nInitially the Explorer alternated on a weekly basis between West and East Caribbean cruise tracks, providing the opportunity for repeated measurements of Florida Current transport from alongtrack ADCP measurements across the Florida Straits. However, issues with data quality and maintaining continuity of the time-series were encountered. The Explorer ADCP current records required a considerable post-cruise processing (Beal et al., 2008) . Two major sources of error in the current records were inaccurate heading information and bubble contamination of the acoustic data. The bubble effects are exacerbated by the flat-bottom design of the vessel and relatively high cruising speed (44.5 km per hr, or 24 knots). In 2005, the May-October cruises were shifted to a New Jersey-Bahamas track, thus breaking the continuity of year-round coverage across the Florida Straits. One of the lessons from the Explorer experience is that timely processing and adequate quality control for the data obtained by the VOS requires dedicated technical support."}, {"section_title": "Satellite Remote Sensing in SEACOOS", "text": "During the second year of the SEA-COOS program (mid-2003) , satellite observations were incorporated into the SEACOOS data stream 11 . Synoptic satellite observations over the SEACOOS geographic domain were delivered in near real-time to the SEACOOS data portal. Funding for the satellite remote sensing effort was modest and progress in this area very much depended on leveraging existing infrastructure and expertise in the region, notably the satellite download, processing and archiving capabilities and experienced personnel at USF IMaRS and UM RSMAS.\nSatellite remote sensing products have generally been envisioned to be core elements of the IOOS \"national backbone\" observations. However, strategies for incorporating remote sensing activities into regional COOS efforts were not welldefined in IOOS planning documents when the SEACOOS effort was initiated (for recent discussion see Ocean.US, 2006) . The pilot program demonstrated regional capabilities for near real-time delivery of high-quality satellite data and derived products and integration with in situ data streams. Variables estimated from various satellite sensors and the sources for these data are listed in Table 1 . Accomplishments from this effort included:\n\u25a0 Raw high-resolution data from lowearth, polar orbiting satellites was downloaded at USF IMaRS and UM RSMAS and provided to SEACOOS within 30 minutes; \u25a0 Satellite data products generated using existing algorithms (e.g., SST, surface chlorophyll concentration) were delivered in near real-time to the SEACOOS web portal (see Fletcher et al., this volume) ; \u25a0 \"Cloud-free\" optimal interpolation (OI) products for SST and ocean color developed by the Ocean Circulation Group (OCG) at USF (He et al., 2003) were incorporated into the satellite data stream ( Figure 10 ); \u25a0 Access for SEACOOS to satellite data collected and processed outside the southeast U.S. was established, including QuikSCAT for winds from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and NOAA AOML and Topex for sea surface topography from the JPL; \u25a0 Data standards for the satellite remote sensing data were adapted to ensure\nThe costs associated with the hardware required to collect, process and distribute large-volume satellite data (including receiving stations, processing computers, data storage and network bandwidth) and the personnel necessary to coordinate these activities were well beyond what could be supported through SEACOOS alone. Leveraging existing resources supported by other agencies and programs (NASA, NOAA, ONR) was the only practical way to include satellite remote sensing in SEA-COOS. Some lessons learned are: \u25a0 For many satellite products, the latency (delay time) between image acquisition and when the imagery could be delivered to the regional data portal was considerably reduced through use of the regional download and processing capabilities. \u25a0 Redundancy in download, processing and delivery is needed to ensure uninterrupted delivery of satellite data (e.g., hurricanes shut down one or both of the USF and UM facilities). \u25a0 While the SEACOOS effort was able to demonstrate near-real delivery of satellite data and derived products, a fully developed program (e.g., including field validation for regional products) would require significant investment. Again, effective partnering with regional and national programs is likely to be essential for infrastructure and personnel support. \u25a0 Effective incorporation of satellite remote sensing into the regional observing network will require close coordination between satellite data providers, information management personnel, and modelers, and mechanisms for interfacing with end users for applications development."}, {"section_title": "FIgURE 10", "text": "Example from the SEACOOS web portal of the \"cloud-free\" Optimally Interpolated (OI) SST product from the USF Ocean Circulation Group (He et al., 2003) .

This will include performance assessments of new sensors and new configurations of sensors (e.g., multiple sensor systems with integrated anti-biofouling), deployment platforms, and the associated data acquisition, power, communications and mechanical systems. SEACOOS-supported field work provides several case studies in this area.\nFocused test-bed activities included the SEACOOS-sponsored field experiment to validate surface directional wave estimates from the WERA HF radar system in SE Florida (see Shay et al., this volume and Voulgaris et al., this volume) . A comparison of wave parameters estimated from a wave buoy and a bottom-mounted ADCP (upward looking) was also conducted in the near-shore off Savannah, Georgia (Work, 2008) . At two near-shore sites off West Florida, USF tested sub-surface wave sensors linked by acoustic modems to surface transmitters on a buoy and on a tower. Performance of surface buoy-mounted ADCPs for current profile measurements were evaluated in two studies. For the COMPS buoys, Mayer et al. (2007) found no substantive differences for currents measured from the buoys and bottommounted instruments except in the upper few meters of the water column. However, from inter-comparison of current measurements obtained with a bottom-mounted ADCP and an ADCP mounted on a shallow-water NDBC buoy off Georgia (Buoy 41008, ~16 m depth), Seim and Edwards (2007) concluded that the instrument configuration on the NDBC buoy strongly biased the current estimates throughout the water column, likely due to surface wave contamination. The configuration was subsequently modified, and the data quality from the NDBC buoy is improved, although a thorough re-examination has not yet been conducted.\nNot all test-bed activities were fully successful, as is the nature of trial instrument deployments in the coastal ocean. At the SABSOON Navy towers on the Georgia shelf, anti-biofouling measures attempted for instruments with exposed optical surfaces (beam transmissometer, an older CDOM fluorometer design) were not effective. Better results were obtained with flow-through fluorometers, although these still required servicing at a minimum of 4-6 week intervals in warmer months to prevent fouling. More recently introduced bio-optical instruments with integral antibiofouling (copper end plate, copper shutter for optical window) appear to extend the required servicing interval to 3 months or more on the Georgia shelf. In other test-bed work, the somewhat mixed results from the UNC-CH test missions of a commercial glider were described previously. And in trial deployments of a bottom-mounted ADCP/CTD profiling package developed at UM-RSMAS, it was found that the winch controls were not adequate to operate the system in areas of strong current (as found along the East Florida Shelf ).\nAlong with test-bed activities, basic operational procedures and servicing strategies evolved. Many of the in situ packages deployed by SEACOOS partners were significantly modified and improved during the program as further experience in sustained deployments was acquired. Similarly, procedures for equipment deployments and field servicing were refined. While the details of such incremental improvements cannot be included here, the following section lists some general operational \"lessons learned\" that may be pertinent to future RCOOS observing efforts."}, {"section_title": "Operational and Pragmatic Lessons LearnedObserving Working Group", "text": "To some extent, the range of in situ observing assets and deployment platforms utilized in SEACOOS reflects the origins of an observing program which incorporated several existing sub-regional observing efforts. As a result, uniformity in the in situ packages was not emphasized. However, in terms of a prototype RCOOS, this approach provided considerable experience in sustained operation of a range of instrument packages deployed on buoys, offshore towers, piers and shore stations, deployment and servicing strategies for these packages, and use of a number of real-time communications options. A number of general \"lessons learned\" from the in situ observing and satellite remote sensing efforts supported by SEACOOS are listed here."}, {"section_title": "Deployment and Maintenance of In Situ Systems", "text": "\u25a0 Personnel are essential \"infrastructure\" for a coastal ocean observing system. Personnel resources were often a limiting factor for the design, installation and maintenance of in situ systems. "}, {"section_title": "TABLE 1", "text": "Summary of remote sensing data provided to SEACOOS.\nGiven the patchwork funding for support, SEACOOS OWG personnel were often multitasking at their institutions, as opposed to being organized into full-time, task-specific groups across SEACOOS. Thus, limited availability of personnel was often a deciding factor in scheduling deployment and servicing operations, and at times resulted in extended down-time following component failures. \u25a0 Efficient, sustained operations are vulnerable to personnel turnover. The collective experience in systems design, development and operations often resided in a small set of key personnel at partner institutions. Thus, systems documentation is critical, particularly for the type of sustained, collaborative operations envisaged for IOOS. The significant time commitment for this is often underestimated in project planning. Essential documentation includes mechanical drawings, circuit diagrams for electrical and electronic systems, and maintenance/ servicing records that are part of package meta-data. \u25a0 As a result of the combination of corrosion, electrolysis and bio-fouling, regular preventive maintenance for all components of the deployed packages is required for sustained operations in the marine environment. While this is perhaps obvious, ongoing maintenance must be recognized as a key costdriver for the in situ observing program, representing an increasingly significant portion of personnel time and transportation resources as more packages and a greater variety of instruments are deployed. This point is particularly relevant to the effort by SEACOOS to deploy sub-surface, real-time instrumentation and packages that included bio-optical as well as physical sensors. \u25a0 Minimizing downtime requires an adequate inventory of spare instruments and components for the supporting infrastructure (e.g., power, communications, data acquisition systems). These must be appropriately staged "}, {"section_title": "Communications and Data Streams", "text": "General lessons regarding communications include: \u25a0 Systems for near real-time communications often utilized a combination of SEACOOS, commercial vendor (e.g., satellite, phone and T1 landlines) and university system components (plus a military microwave system for the SABSOON tower-to-shore link). Thus, troubleshooting communications problems and effecting repairs was not always straight-forward. \u25a0 Bandwidth was a key limitation at various points in the communications stream. A notable example was the limited bandwidth of Argos satellite communications for buoys. \u25a0 There was limited redundancy in communications for the in situ systems deployed by SEACOOS. Backups for critical system components are needed for a robust real-time network. \u25a0 Data logging at the deployment platform (independent of real-time communications to shore) is typically needed to ensure robust time-series records. While real-time data have been emphasized in most IOOS/COOS planning docu-ments, non-real time, time-series observations (delayed mode reporting) also contribute important information regarding coastal ocean processes. The value of non-real-time data should be recognized in IOOS/RCOOS planning. This is an area where there may be significant opportunities to leverage resources, for example through collaboration with other research and monitoring programs that may accommodate deployment/recovery of recording instruments as part of regular sampling. \u25a0 Reliance on the information technology (IT) and communications infrastructure of academic institutions for at least portions of the communications network had both positive and negative aspects. While institution IT infrastructure often represented a significant resource for SEACOOS, the observing system requirements were not necessarily a high priority for university IT groups. For example, emergency response preparations for hurricane threats resulted in system shutdowns and limited access to institution facilities at times when supporting marine weather forecasters and emergency managers with real-time data and products was of particular concern."}, {"section_title": "Programmatic Lessons Learned", "text": "The SEACOOS Strategic Plan and Implementation Plan (www.seacoos. org/documents/) were framed with the expectation of national progress toward a sustained IOOS program. However, since the SEACOOS program was funded on a year-to-year basis, the time horizon for OWG planning and the development of a truly regional program was necessarily constrained. Still, the OWG effort indicates what can be achieved through academic institution participation in an RCOOS. While there were certainly a number of positive accomplishments, in terms of programmatic \"lessons learned\", it is also important to note a number of issues regarding OWG functions and activities in SEACOOS. \u25a0 There largely remained a sub-regional focus among the OWG activities of the partners. Build-out from existing in situ assets was emphasized as opposed to new region-wide activities, primarily due to infrastructure limitations for broader expansion and the associated resources for personnel and transportation. As noted above, most personnel involved in the observing program were not supported full-time by SEACOOS. \u25a0 Personnel resources were not sufficient to develop formal operations groups for the in situ observing activities on a SEACOOS-wide basis. Efforts to deploy and maintain various classes of instrument packages, deployment platforms and supporting power and communications infrastructure would benefit from further collaborations with operators of similar systems within and across regions. \u25a0 Developing tailored regional satellite products requires coordinated crossworking group effort with data management, modeling and outreach/ education groups, and likely requires a field validation program. Engagement with private sector satellite data product providers is also needed to minimize potential conflicts. \u25a0 Focused OWG support of targeted applications areas was limited, and while discussed at workshops, follow-up activities in these areas proved to be difficult to move forward. The issue of applications development for the observing system program is discussed further in Seim et al. (this volume) and Nelson and Simoniello (this volume) . The multi-program origins of most of the in situ and remote sensing efforts in SEACOOS may have contributed to these programmatic shortcomings. Certainly the prior experience of many of the partners was largely in the \"PI culture\" of individual project funding, which tends to emphasize focus on institutional efforts or specific components of the observing system. On the other hand, the research background of many participants contributed to the considerable leveraging of SEACOOS assets that was achieved through linking the SEACOOS activities to complementary research programs. Maintaining effective communications in the OWG between institutions was an issue. While there were regular communications at the Executive Committee level, other PIs often felt less engaged in the program direction and planning. And while the fall workshops (see Seim et al., this volume) provided some opportunities for interactions on technical issues at the engineering/technical support level, cross-institution interactions in technical and operational areas was limited. The fact that the support personnel were spread thin and often multi-tasking was certainly a factor is this; they typically had more than enough to do in terms of keeping up with local issues associated with the deployment, operation and maintenance of the observing system components. However, it is clear that further RCOOS development will benefit from regular interactions among experienced technical personnel on regional and national levels. Communications mechanisms and the resources to support this should be included in IOOS/RCOOS planning."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "A RCOOS that significantly augments the \"national backbone\" to serve regional information needs will require a broad mix of sensors and deployment platforms. The design of the observing network will not be static. There must be provisions to reposition or further augment observing assets based on analyses of the data sets acquired and the practical experience gained from operating these systems. Multiple real-time communications options will be needed along with data logging at deployment platforms to ensure robust time-series. The configuration of individual platforms will need to be flexible and accommodate new observing technologies as these become available. These requirements point to the need for a robust research and development program as part of the RCOOS and for within-and cross-region collaboration among the personnel responsible for operations. SEACOOS and other pilot RCOOS efforts have acquired considerable experience in sustained operation of a range of observing system technologies.
