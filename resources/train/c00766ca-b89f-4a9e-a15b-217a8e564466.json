The abnormal signal, explained by a change in the fat/water ratio, reflects a damage to the white matter. Hypotheses related to deleterious changes in the blood supply and in the blood brain barrier ( Wardlaw et al., 2013 ) have been put forward to explain the occurrence of such damage, and cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension have been shown to be associated to the WMH burden ( Abraham et al., 2015; Vuorinen et al., 2011 ) . Furthermore, such lesions have been linked with cognitive impairment, in particular with respect to processing speed and executive function ( Prins and Scheltens, 2015; Wakefield et al., 2010 ) .\nTo further assess potential causality effects between lesion burden and clinical outcome, new emphasis has been given to longitudinal studies of lesion load and cognitive assessment ( Schmidt et al., 2005 ) . In normal ageing, increase in the lesion volume with time was observed with a higher rate of change correlated with more severe baseline lesion volume ( Pantoni and The LADIS Study group, 2011 ) . For a normal population, progression in leukoaraiosis has been related to motor decline ( Silbert et al., 2008 ) , and cognitive disabilities ( Schmidt et al., 2005 ) as well as memory impairment ( Gunning-Dixon and Raz, 20 0 0 ). Additionally, lesion burden at baseline has been associated with faster cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal populations ( Carmichael et al., 2010 ) .\nThe evaluation of WMH progression, however, remains difficult. In many cases, visual rating scales are used to assess the increase in severity of the lesion burden ( Gouw et al., 2008 ) . Most of them have however been developed for cross-sectional studies and are difficult to utilise in longitudinal cases due to the lack of sensitivity to change ( Schmidt et al., 2005 ) . Specific progressive rating scales have been proposed to alleviate this drawback ( Prins et al., 2004 ) , but volumetric measurements appear to allow for more accurate group differentiation ( Pantoni and The LADIS Study group, 2011 ) . Even when using semiautomatic segmentation methods for volume assessment ( Schmidt et al., 2005 ) instead of performing the segmentation manually, the process remains time-consuming and the strategy of looking at images back-to-back can introduce bias ( Schmidt et al., 2005 ) . Therefore, longitudinal, robust automatic lesion segmentation solutions are greatly needed.\nEven though imaging time points can be considered independently when automatically measuring the volume of WMH in longitudinal studies ( Carmichael et al., 2010 ) , it has been shown that considering the time points separately within subject introduced an additional source of variability in the results ( Elliott et al., 2013 ) . Accounting for the structural similarities between time points, or relating the information from one time point to others may increase the robustness of the method.\nThe problem of longitudinal lesion assessment is of great interest in other fields of neuroimaging such as multiple sclerosis (MS), and various methods have been designed to assess longitudinal lesion change. This issue is especially sensitive in MS, in which the lesion load progression is non-monotonic. Methods relying on the analysis of the differences between registered serial images, as in Rey et al. (2002) , may be hindered by other volumetric changes occurring between the time points. In studies with long-term follow-up, in which the drop-off rate can be high ( e.g. in agerelated studies), being able to handle different numbers of time points is an additional challenge.\nIn the context of age-related WMH, the progressive nature of the damage can be taken as an argument to consider consecutive image pairs as in Bosc et al. (2003) . However, noise and artefacts, prevalent in aging or in the demented population, may affect methods based on direct comparison; other solutions based on image averaging and model building may be advantageous. For instance, the use of average images to guide the processing of longitudinal data has been promoted in Reuter et al. (2012) .\nThe solution developed in this work first consists in creating a longitudinal intra-subject average ( Section 2.1 ), followed by the estimation of an appropriate joint Gaussian mixture model (GMM) ( Section 2.2 ) that will finally be used to constrain the lesion segmentation at each time point ( Section 2.3 ). The main assumption of this work is that all time points can be diffeomorphically mapped to a subject-specific mean appearance.\nTo assess the relevance of the proposed technique for the study of WMH progression, a longitudinal lesion simulator was developed ( Section 3.1 ) so as to test the method with various longitudinal patterns and lesion loads. A surrogate clinical validation was performed using data from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to test whether documented crosssectional as well as longitudinal findings reported in the literature could be reproduced."}, {"section_title": "Method", "text": "In the following the subscript \u03c4 denotes a specific time point and GW the groupwise average appearance model.

Using the priors and brain mask as inputs, BaMoS ( Sudre et al., 2015 ) is used to model the data according to a three-level Gaussian mixture. The first level segments inliers from outliers observations while the anatomical tissue information is introduced at the second level so that each of the inlier and outlier tissue classes is modelled by a Gaussian mixture at the third level of the model.

(2001) , two sets of data are used to simulate lesions: a receiving set, comprised of subjects with minimal to no WMH, and a donating set, comprised of images with non zero WMH lesion load and their associated probabilistic lesion segmentation. The process of simulating lesions involves spatially and intensity transforming the lesions from the donating set to the receiving set. For the receiving set, T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI scans of the ADNI database were used, with the FLAIR image affinely registered to the T1 space resulting in 1 mm 3 isotropic images. To ensure that lesions are contained within the WM, lesion maps are first propagated under the constraint that they fall within the WM. These lesions are then shrunk to simulate different longitudinally consistent lesion loads. To simulate shrunken lesions, the initial propagated WMH load is modified by thresholding the probabilistic lesion segmentation L at a certain value X , followed by a normalisation\nwith L being the original lesion probability per voxel. The value of X is chosen to produce an exact reduction in WMH volume of D. As L new can contain hard edges, L S is then smoothed with a Gaussian filter and, due to the non-volume-preserving nature of the Gaussian smoothing process, re-mapped to have an exact reduction in WMH volume of D through a piecewise linear transformation.

As the receiving images used in the simulation can contain trace amounts of lesions, the region where all methods agreed in the presence of lesions for the time point with minimal lesion load was excluded from the analysis, both in terms of volume and overlap. Ground truth (GT) lesion segmentations are thus the simulated lesion probability maps corrected for the baseline lesion segmentation intersection of all given methods.\nStatistics of the ground truth volumes are presented in Table 1 . Those corrected differences were finally compared in terms of Dice score coefficient (DSC), true positive rate (TPR) and average distance (AvDist) as defined in Styner et al. (2008) . Due to the simulation process, images cannot be considered as independent for the same subject. Therefore, statistics were calculated over the mean per subject in each pattern.

This method, proposed in Schmidt et al. (2012) develops a lesion growing model based on the thresholding of outlier beliefs maps. This threshold has to be chosen by the user, with a default of 0.30 and this choice is denoted LST-d. The value of 0.25 has been considered as adequate when dealing with ageing populations ( Manj\u00f3n et al., 2010 ) and is therefore the second value chosen for comparison and denoted LST-a. Recently a new pipeline called LPA that does not require any user interaction has been included in the toolbox. This configuration was also tested as additional point of comparison.

In the case of the proposed longitudinal framework, both cross-sectional and longitudinal observations can be tested. Here, the longitudinal framework was applied on the subjects from the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease National Initiative) database ( adni.loni.usc.edu ) for which T1 and FLAIR images on at least four time points were available along with genetic status for APOE , that in its allelic variant 4 (among 2 3 and 4) is a known risk factor for AD and a presumed risk factor for white matter lesions.

Further information about imaging and genetic protocols can be found at www.adni-info.org . Focusing here on WMH, the effect of age as risk factor was assessed on the baseline volumes. Since in ADNI, some subjects undergo MRI scanning sessions at a small time interval ( < 5 months), during which, the volume of WMH is assumed to change subtly and the variability of change across subjects is supposed to be reduced, such series of scans were used as a surrogate for a short term change experiment to evaluate the ability of various methods to detect subtle change and the variability in the measured changes. Therefore, both the monthly volume difference and relative difference between close time points were compared across methods.\nAdditionally, in ageing, the amount of WMH is not expected to decrease in time. Thus a comparison of spurious decrease between methods is a further way of evaluating the clinical potential of the methods evaluated. In order to assess the consistency between time points, the mean ratio of decrease for each subject per month was compared across methods. Although some noise in the measures may be expected, smoother volume trajectories are thought to reflect more consistency in the segmentation results.\nThen, in order to investigate the relationship between WMH accumulation and APOE genetic status, generalised linear mixed models enabling the analysis of repeated measures were applied. Due to the skewness of their distribution, WMH volumes were modelled as following a gamma distribution and used as the dependent variable while time from initial measurement was considered both as fixed and random effects thus allowing for individual slopes and intersection values. The other fixed effects included age, sex, total intracranial volume and APOE status, and their interaction with time. After adjustment for covariates, joint Wald tests were used to compare rates of change between APOE status. The presented results are the fitted mean rates of change, standardised to the mean levels of covariates in the sample as a whole. Eleven cases failed to provide segmentation results for LST while two failed for LPA. To ensure model convergence, priors were imposed on the covariance matrices that may otherwise be naturally singular."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this work the methodological aspects of a new longitudinal framework for WMH segmentation accounting for within-subject consistency was detailed and tested with synthetic and clinical data.

These corrected images display the log-transformed normalised, bias field corrected, skull-stripped and intensity matched intensities. a lesion simulator incorporating WMH lesion evolution patterns. A major difficulty in the assessment of segmentation protocols and algorithms is indeed the availability of a possible ground truth. The use of simulated data as an initial step has been promoted in Llad\u00f3 et al. (2012) for lesion segmentation. Actually, simulation of white matter lesions at different loads has been made available in the Brainweb project http://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca . However no simulated longitudinal progression is available. Here, the simulation is applied to existing clinical data so that the realism of the simulated images is high. It must however be noted that the lesion simulator, although tested with different lesion loads, is based on typical age-related lesion distribution patterns as observed in the ADNI dataset. Increasing the variability of the lesion maps as well as the anatomical shape of change used for the simulator would be of further interest. Furthermore, extensions towards MS-like patterns of evolution, involving the explicit modelling of appearance and disappearance of lesions could be added, using for instance secondary lesion maps in the simulation. With respect to the longitudinal framework, this simulator allowed the evaluation of the impact of evolution patterns on the segmentation performance as well as the impact of periods without change on the progression detection. From the assessment of the longitudinal framework across evolution patterns, subjects with smaller variations in WMH load led to slightly better overall segmentation results although no statistical difference was observed. Investigating longitudinal bias through plateauing situations, the stability in the results highlights the ability of the longitudinal framework to detect change even if periods of stability are included. This stability is crucial in processes for which subtle and irregular progressions are observed, such as multiple sclerosis. In terms of error, most of the erroneous classifications appear at the border of the lesions and very few lesions were completely undetected. The comparison between the longitudinal and the crosssectional versions of BaMoS (Cross and Cross+) underlines the improved robustness of the proposed framework with higher performance and lower variance in the results. Although the detected volumes appeared higher than expected, the strong correlation observed between segmented and reference volumes ( R 2 = 0.94) makes the detection of change trustworthy. This tendency to overestimation can be partially related to the observation, that the longitudinal framework tended to underestimate the true slope. It can be explained by a bias of the model towards the average image with less noise and therefore smaller covariance matrices that in turn contribute to a less conservative outlier separation.\nThe ability to detect differences in longitudinal rate of change was however exemplified in the simulations of treatment effect. In this case, the difference observed between evolutions is similar to the simulated ground truth difference. A decreased variance reflecting higher measurement robustness compared to both crosssectional methods led to a decrease in required sample size. In this setting however, the LST algorithm appeared to perform poorly. Using an experiment with atrophy simulation, thus incorporating stronger volume change, the susceptibility of bias towards image ordering was investigated. In the proposed framework, the only source of potential bias lies in the order used to build the average image on which the model used to constrain the segmentation of the individual time points is selected. The iterative process used to build the average image is assumed to prevent bias to any specific time point. Comparing segmentation results obtained using the forward (increasing lesion load and atrophy) and backward (decreasing lesion load and atrophy) orders showed that the results were stable with respect to the order with a R 2 between segmented volumes of 0.96 and a median difference DSC of less than 0.03% of DSC at each evaluated time point. This agnosticity to order and therefore independence with respect to lesion evolution would make this algorithm suitable for an extension to the longitudinal analysis of multiple sclerosis patients. In this setting, the longitudinal method appeared to be more robust for dealing with global volume changes as shown by a lower variability in DSC.\nWhen applying the longitudinal framework on clinical data, in the case of the ADNI population, findings reported in the literature both cross-sectionnally and longitudinally were reproduced using the proposed method. As such, age, established risk factor for the existence of WMH ( Grueter and Schulz, 2012; Targosz-Gajniak et al., 2009; Schmahmann et al., 2008 ) , was strongly associated with the segmented volumes. In a short term change experiment using the first two time points when spaced by less than 5 months, the mean difference detected was for all methods except TOADS significantly different from 0 but the variability lower for the longitudinal framework. Therefore, the worries that Long may miss some changes due to an underestimation bias are alleviated by the consistency it shows in its detection of change.\nAs far as the longitudinal analysis of rate of change was concerned, a dose-dependent effect of APOE \u03b54 was observed for which homozygous \u03b5 4 \u03b5 4 were found to progress faster than heterozygous and non-carriers with regards to WMH load which has been reported in the literature ( Godin et al., 2009 ) . Noticeably, the effect size of this finding was stronger when using a longitudinal method compared to a cross-sectional analysis. The differences observed may be related to the increased variability introduced when considering data cross-sectionally. Note however that the rates of change were significantly different between methods; in particular, LST was found to strongly overestimate volumes. However, observed discrepancies in absolute values between methods can be mitigated by studying the relative change between groups and estimating statistical group differences as commonly done in clinical trials. To conclude, a new longitudinal framework for WMH segmentation was presented and an increased robustness was demonstrated compared to similar methods applied cross-sectionally, thereby ensuring the relevance of the longitudinal extension of the original method. For validation purposes, a realistic longitudinal lesion simulator was developed allowing for a wide variety of evolution patterns on a possibly large range of images. Assessments relative to the images order in the building of the average image showed a high consistency thus ensuring the absence of bias with respect to the ordering of images. Clinically, when applied to ADNI, a large cohort of elderly with minimal cardiovascular risk factors, previously reported cross-sectional and longitudinal findings were again noticed and the longitudinal method proved more powerful in highlighting group differences than the cross-sectional methods it was compared to. Further work could include the evaluation of the impact of the parameters chosen to build the average appearance model. Future research will also work towards reducing the between-time-point group-average transformation regularisation so as to maximise not only the precision but also the accuracy of the measurements.\nwhere \u2202Seg (resp. With this measure, a perfect score at the voxel level can be reached for a suboptimal segmentation if the errors are exclusively false positives. In the cardinal form, the ratio becomes dependent of the lesion spatial connectivity since joined lesion are only counted once. Recently, new inter-rater assessment measures with application to MS lesion segmentation have been developed. These have shown to be less dependent than the DSC to the assessed lesion burden ( Wack et al., 2012 ) . Detection error (DE) The detection error is the volume of error measured cardinally (using lesion entities) and is expressed as\nOutline error (OE) The OE is measured as the volume of voxelwise error found for the true positive lesion entities.\nIn order to better assess the origin of the errors, based on the definition by Wack et al. (2012) , additional evaluation may be carried out: OE/F Measures the proportion of total error (F) that is related to the outline error OE. FP/F Measures the proportion of error that is false positive. OEFP/FP Measures among the false positives, the proportion that relates to the outline error. OEFN/FN Measures among the false negatives, the proportion that relates to the outline error."}]
