Alfalfa is the fourth largest crop in the United States (in terms of acreage and production value). South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Idaho, and Wisconsin account for 42 percent of national acreage devoted to alfalfa. \u2022 The first GE HT alfalfa varieties were deregulated by USDA in June 2005. Deregulation facilitates commercialization by allowing the introduction (importation, interstate movement, and environmental release) of the GE organism without further authorization from USDA. Following legal action from environmental groups in March 2007, plantings were temporarily suspended while USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) prepared an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Once the applicable regulatory requirements were satisfied, GE HT alfalfa was fully deregulated in February 2011. Planting resumed that spring. \u2022 Alfalfa is a perennial crop with an average of 6-7 years between plantings. Approximately 3.5 million acres were newly seeded in 2013 (14 percent of the acres that were harvested that year). Nearly one-third of this newly seeded alfalfa acreage was GE HT. \u2022 Data from USDA's Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) indicate that GE HT alfalfa constituted 13 percent of the alfalfa acres harvested in 2013. \u2022 GE HT alfalfa adoption rates were highest in New York, where approximately 37 percent of the acres that were harvested in 2013 were produced using GE HT. Adoption rates were also relatively high in Washington and Colorado. \u2022 ARMS data from 2013 suggest that farmers who planted GE HT alfalfa had higher yields than farmers who planted conventional seeds. On average, adopters' yields were 0.53 ton per acre, approximately 17 percent higher than the yields of other farmers.\nAlfalfa is a highly nutritious, perennial legume. In the United States, it is primarily used as feed for dairy cattle. 3 Though it has been grown domestically only since 1736, farmers have produced alfalfa for over 4,000 years (Yueago and Cash, 2009). Currently, it is cultivated on approximately 74 million acres worldwide, mainly in temperate countries such as the United States, Argentina, Canada, Russia, Italy, and China (Yueago and Cash, 2009). In 2013, approximately 18 million acres of alfalfa (table 1), with a production value of $10.7 billion, were harvested in the United States. Only three crops (corn, soybeans, and wheat) are grown on more acreage or have more aggregate production value than alfalfa (USDA/NASS, 2014). In 2012, alfalfa was grown throughout the continental United States (figure 1). Because alfalfa yields are highly variable, the States that produce the most alfalfa are not always the ones with largest planted acreages (table 1). The ratio of newly seeded (planted) alfalfa acres to harvested alfalfa acres was 0.14 (2,517/17,763) in 2013 (table 2). This implies that approximately 14 percent of the harvested area was newly seeded that year. It also suggests that U.S. alfalfa fields are seeded, on average, once every 7 years. 3 Alfalfa is a perennial crop and produces its highest yields during the second year of growth. In climates with mild winters, alfalfa is grown for 3 to 4 years continuously, but in climates with cold winters, it is grown for 6 to 9 years, with a dormant period in winter (FAO, 2013).

ARMS data indicate that GE HT canola accounted for 95 percent of U.S. canola acres that were harvested in 2013. While this result is based on a small sample, it is consistent with estimates obtained from other sources.\nPrior to 1980, rapeseed oil was largely used as an industrial lubricant. Undesirable byproducts, such as erucic acid, made it unsuitable for human or animal consumption. Canadian scientists solved both of these problems using modern (but not GE) plant breeding methods. Canada labeled the modified, edible rapeseed plants \"canola\" in 1979. 15 This distinction was formalized in 1985, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration deemed rapeseed and canola to be separate crops. Though it is referred to as canola in North America only, edible versions of rapeseed have been commercialized in Australia, China, Europe, and India. In the United States, 1.26 million acres of canola, with a production value of $456 million, were harvested in 2013 (USDA/NASS, 2014b and 2015a). 16 Canola production is concentrated in North Dakota, where 1.7 billion pounds were grown on 915,000 acres in 2013 (figure 3 depicts harvested acreage in 2012).

While the widespread adoption of these crops has been extensively analyzed and reported, relatively little is known about the adoption of GE alfalfa, canola, and sugarbeets, crops that add substantial value to the U.S. agricultural sector. 1 This report uses data from USDA's 2013 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) to analyze the adoption of GE alfalfa, canola, and sugarbeets in the United States. It discusses trends in adoption of these crops, describes the legal/regulatory issues associated with their commercialization, and the economic impacts of adoption. The mostly widely adopted GE crops have herbicide tolerance (GE HT) traits. These crops were developed to survive the application of specific herbicides that previously would have destroyed the crop along with the targeted weeds. GE HT-based production systems provide farmers with multiple options for effective weed control (Fernandez-Cornejo and McBride, 2002). The most common GE HT crops tolerate glyphosate, an herbicide first marketed in 1974 under the trade name Roundup. Glyphosate is effective on many species of grasses, broadleaf weeds, and sedges. 2 However, overreliance on glyphosate and a reduction in the diversity of weed management practices have contributed to the evolution of glyphosate resistance in some weed species (Livingston et al., 2015). Glyphosate tolerance has been incorporated into soybeans, corn, cotton, canola, sugarbeets, and, more recently, alfalfa. USDA's annual Acreage reports provide estimates of planted and harvested acres for many major crops (USDA/NASS, 2015b). Since 2000, this publication has included survey estimates of the shares of acreage planted using GE corn, cotton, and soybeans with insect-resistant and herbicidetolerant traits. ERS researchers added questions to the 2013 ARMS (see appendix 1) to support similar estimates for alfalfa, canola, and sugarbeets. ARMS is a nationally representative survey that provides an objective source of production data. However, ARMS surveys are administered to a relatively small number of canola and sugarbeet producers. This report, therefore, combines ARMS, NASS, and private-sector data to assess the adoption of GE seeds for alfalfa, canola, and sugarbeets."}, {"section_title": "Thousand acres", "text": "\n\nAcres Not estimated 1 -5,000 5,001 -10,000 10,001 -15,000 15,001 -20,000 20,001 -40,000 40,001 or more Arguing that an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) had not been prepared for GE HT sugarbeets, the Sierra Club, the Center for Food Safety, High Mowing Organic Seeds, and the Organic Seed Alliance filed suit against the U.S. Government in 2008 (Center for Food Safety et al. v Vilsack andSmith, 2013). In 2009, the U.S. District Court of California found that an EIS should have been conducted, but that it was not in the public interest to (1) issue an injunction on GE HT sugarbeet use, or (2) void the USDA's deregulation decision (Cowan and Alexander, 2013). Because APHIS had not initiated an EIS when the U.S. District Court reconvened in August, 2010, APHIS's deregulation decision was vacated (Cowan and Alexander, 2013). Though GE sugarbeets planted prior to the ruling were not affected, the Court warned growers that they should be prepared to plant conventional seeds in 2011 (Oeschger et al., 2011). In the fall of 2010, APHIS issued permits to seed producers that authorized seedling production of GE HT sugarbeets. Though these permits were initially contested, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that there was no risk of cross-species pollination (Cowan and Alexander, 2013). 23 In 2011, APHIS announced that GE HT sugarbeets would be partially deregulated (Oeschger et al., 2011). Root crop production would be deregulated but not the seed crop production. This was announced as an interim measure effective through December 31, 2012, while APHIS completed the EIS.

A glufosinate-tolerant varietal was field tested in Woodland, California, later that year (Information Systems for Biotechnology, 2015). In 1998, the first field tests of genetically engineered, glyphosate-tolerant alfalfa were authorized in Iowa, Idaho, Indiana, and Wisconsin (ISB, 2015). 4 In the spring of 2004, APHIS received a petition from Monsanto Company and Forage Genetics International to deregulate two glyphosate-tolerant alfalfa lines. After assessing the plant pest risks and preparing an Environmental Assessment (EA), APHIS determined that these lines (J101 and J163) did not pose a plant pest risk (USDA/APHIS, 2010a). 5 In June 2005, the GE HT lines were deregulated and full-scale commercialization was permitted (Cowan and Alexander, 2013).  (Cowan, 2011). Though the legal actions described above did not prevent the deregulation of GE HT alfalfa, they did slow its adoption. Plantings of GE HT alfalfa were suspended from 2007 to 2010. Alfalfa that has been genetically engineered to have low lignin content was deregulated in November 2014 after a petition from Monsanto Company and Forage Genetics International. This trait increases the digestibility of the alfalfa, thereby enhancing the nutritional quality of the derived feed and directly benefiting the consumer (as opposed to herbicide-tolerance traits that benefit the producer). This alfalfa varietal has been reported to increase yields by 10-20 percent (ISAAA, 2014b), which may lead to further adoption of GE alfalfa in the near future. USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) plays a central role in regulating field testing of agricultural biotechnology products. Through either a notification or permit procedure, such products-which include certain genetically engineered plants, microorganisms, and invertebrates-are considered \"regulated articles.\" APHIS issues authorizations for field releases of those GE organisms (mostly GE plants) that are categorized as \"regulated articles\" to allow technology providers to conduct field testing. GE plants that meet six specific criteria (described in the regulations) undergo an administratively streamlined process, known as a notification. Under a notification, applicants provide information on the nature of the plant and introduced genes, exact genetic modifications, size/ scope of the introduction, and origin/destinations for movement or the location of a field test. For GE plants that do not meet the criteria for a notification, an APHIS permit is required. This process involves a more comprehensive review. In addition to the data required for notification, permit applicants must describe how they will perform the test, including specific measures to reduce the risk of harm to other plants, so that the tested organisms remain confined and do not persist after completion of the field test. After years of field tests, an applicant may petition APHIS for a determination of nonregulated status in order to facilitate commercialization of the product. If, after extensive review, APHIS determines that the GE organism is unlikely to pose a plant pest risk, the organism is issued a \"determination of nonregulated status.\" At this point, the organism is no longer considered a regulated article and can be moved and planted without APHIS oversight under the biotechnology regulations.

Therefore, there were approximately 255,000 acres of GE HT alfalfa in the United States by 2007. After a 3-year moratorium (during which planting GE HT alfalfa was prohibited), GE HT planting resumed in 2011. Approximately 245,000 acres of GE HT were planted during that year.

Adoption rates tend to be higher in States with less alfalfa acreage.

For instance, alfalfa yields are influenced by many factors such as seed variety (there are hundreds of alfalfa varieties), weather and soil conditions, water availability, the severity of pest infestations, fertilizer use, and method of weed/insect control (Dixon et al., 2005). In other words, though the mean comparisons suggest that yields tend to be higher on fields 11 A negligible percentage of alfalfa was planted with GE HT seeds in Montana. Montana is a very large cow-calf State with high demand for \"cowboy mix\" (alfalfa hay mixed with grasses with the intention of being grazed or fed on cowcalf operations). Producers use the grasses to keep the hay from being too rich, which can cause serious problems with digestion. Producers using the cowboy mix would defeat the intent of the mix if they sprayed their fields with glyphosate because it would kill the grasses. Commercial growers may also be wary of using GE HT alfalfa due to export restrictions on the hay. where farmers have planted GE seeds, they do not demonstrate that these increases were caused by GE HT adoption. Experimental field studies of GE HT alfalfa in several U.S. locations have produced mixed results (USDA/APHIS, 2010b;Van Deynze et al., 2004). Wilson (2007) found that GE HT alfalfa in Nebraska provided slightly higher forage yields and better weed control than conventional production systems. 14 However, D. Putnam, a plant and soil scientist at the University of California, Davis, who has field tested GE alfalfa and other alfalfa cultivars in California concluded (as reported by USDA/APHIS, 2010b) that the yields of herbicide-tolerant alfalfa as a group \"are no different than what could be expected from similar conventional lines...\" Regardless of whether adoption increases yields, there appear to be benefits associated with GE HT alfalfa use. In its Final Environmental Impact Statement, APHIS reported that GE HT adoption increased forage quality and reduced herbicide costs (USDA/APHIS, 2010b).

Data from the 2013 ARMS show that approximately 95 percent of the 1.3 million acres of canola grown in the United States consists of GE HT varieties. Despite legal challenges that delayed the commercialization of GE HT alfalfa and sugarbeets, U.S. farmers have adopted these seeds rapidly in recent years. GE HT sugarbeets were deregulated in 1998. However, these seeds were not widely distributed until 2007. By 2008, over 60 percent of sugarbeet acreage was produced using GE HT seeds. An analysis of 2013 ARMS data suggests that over 99 percent of the 1.2 million acres of sugarbeets harvested in 2013 were planted using GE HT seeds. Approximately 13 percent of U.S. alfalfa acreage was planted (including newly seeded acres plus acres planted in previous years) using GE seeds in 2013. Since alfalfa is a perennial that is seeded approximately once every 7 years, only a fraction (about one-seventh) of the alfalfa acreage is newly seeded each year. There were about 810,000 acres newly seeded with GE HT alfalfa in 2013 out of a total of 2.5 million newly seeded alfalfa acres (table 2). This implies that nearly one-third of newly seeded alfalfa acreage was genetically engineered in 2013. Our analysis of the ARMS data suggests that farmers who planted GE HT alfalfa seeds had higher yields than farmers who planted conventional seeds. On average, adopters' yields were 0.53 ton per acre (approximately 17 percent) higher than the yields of other farmers. Adoption rates for the first GE crops (corn, cotton, and soybeans) were rapid, and the adoption rates for GE canola and sugarbeets increased just as quickly. As of 2013, 90 percent of corn, 90 percent of cotton, 93 percent of soybeans, 93 percent of canola, and 98 percent of sugarbeets were produced using genetically engineered seeds. Adoption rates for GE HT alfalfa appear to be increasing quickly, but it is unclear if this trend will persist. Currently, seed companies are conducting research to produce new varieties of genetically engineered corn, soybeans, cotton, alfalfa, canola, sugarbeets, wheat, sorghum, cucumbers, tomatoes, potatoes, and many other grains, fruits, and vegetables. If this trend continues, it seems likely that many crops will eventually be produced using seeds that have been genetically engineered."}]
