Increasingly, agent-based models are being used to analyze the spread of animal-borne infectious disease outbreaks and derive policy alternatives to control future outbreaks. Although the locations, types, and sizes of animal farms are essential model inputs, no public domain nationwide geospatial database of actual farm locations and characteristics currently exists in the United States. This report describes a novel method to develop a synthetic dataset that replicates the spatial distribution of poultry farms, as well as the type and number of birds raised on them. It combines county-aggregated poultry farm counts, land use/land cover, transportation, business, and topographic data to generate locations in the conterminous United States where poultry farms are likely to be found. Simulation approaches used to evaluate the accuracy of this method when compared to that of a random placement alternative found this method to be superior. The results suggest the viability of adapting this method to simulate other livestock farms of interest to infectious disease researchers."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Because of the potential spread to humans, infections and diseases in poultry and other livestock populations are of keen public health interest. Avian influenza (H5N1), for example, is of particular concern because of its high case mortality (14-33 percent) among previously healthy children and adults (Li, Choi, Sly, & Pak, 2008; World Health Organization, 2005) . Of equal concern is the potentially severe economic impact to the livestock and poultry industries, such as that caused by outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom (UK). These outbreaks also threaten the food supply and thus are a concern for everyone (Smith & Kelly, 2008) .\nInfectious disease researchers are increasingly using mathematical models to simulate the transmission dynamics of infections of veterinary interest to inform policy decisions affecting specific control and containment strategies (e.g., Bates, Carpenter, & Thurmond, 2003; Bates, Thurmond, & Carpenter, 2003a , 2003b Kobayashi, Carpenter, Dickey, & Howitt, 2007a , 2007b . In 2001, for example, British policymakers relied on mathematical models to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies to control and contain a large outbreak of foot-andmouth disease in the UK (Keeling, Woodhouse, May, Davies, & Grenfell, 2003; Keeling et al., 2001; Morris, Wilesmith, Stern, Sanson, & Stevenson, 2001) . Containment spared livestock that might have been infected had the outbreak expanded. It also resulted in significant economic savings for animal farmers outside of the containment areas, as well as for consumers of UK animal products around the world.\nThese models of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK relied on the availability of data containing the locations of UK animal farms with associated animal types and numbers on each farm. The attributed farm locations were needed because many infectious disease mitigation strategies, such as culling or ring vaccination, explicitly rely on spatial relationships between susceptible animal populations and pathogen reservoirs.\nIn the absence of more detailed information, some researchers have examined the usefulness of models based on aggregate census records and maps consisting of farm locations uniformly distributed at defined scales (e.g., townships, ZIP Codes, or counties). The usefulness of the models turned out to depend on the end point of interest (e.g., epidemic impact, radius of the culling zone, duration of the epidemic) and the spatial scale of the map (Le Menach et al., 2005; Tildesley et al., 2010) . It was clear, however, that all of the models were impaired to a greater or lesser extent by the lack of good information on the spatial clustering of farms at a fine scale.\nTo accurately and effectively simulate avian disease transmission and the requisite control strategies, US researchers performing simulations need good farm locations, particularly with respect to how they cluster spatially (Rorres, Pelletier, Keeling, & Smith, 2010; Rorres, Pelletier, Bruhn, & Smith, 2011) . However, unlike their counterparts in the UK and many other European countries, most US researchers lack access to explicit geospatial farm data. For instance, only a handful of US states collect spatial data on poultry, swine, and cattle operations. Additionally, even when spatial data exist, they are rarely in the public domain. The National Animal Identification System (NAIS) collects detailed poultry (and other) data, for example, but access is restricted to state and federal animal health officials, and only in the event of a serious infectious disease epidemic. These data are not available for research purposes (Baca, 2004) .\nFurthermore, the record is and will remain incomplete because the NAIS, as originally conceived, was abandoned in February 2010. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced that it would revise the prior animal identification policy and offer a new approach to achieving animal disease traceability (USDA, 2010) . By abandoning a policy that might have led to an individual animal and farm identification database and moving to a state-by-statedetermined policy intended to track only animals that cross state lines, there is no longer any realistic prospect of access to an accurate map of existing individual farm locations in the United States.\nTo circumvent issues of access to actual farm data, researchers have attempted to use public information to simulate farm and animal populations. For example, USDA researchers simulated beef and dairy farm locations and animal populations in North Carolina by randomly locating the farms within restrained areas determined by several geographic factors, such as roads and water bodies (Geter, 2006; Miller et al., 2007) . Although promising, this approach resulted in local farm densities that were too high as well as an unreasonably large spatial distribution. Additionally, Engle (2006) used high-resolution aerial imagery to create poultry house identification algorithms. This method, however, created a large number of false-positive identifications, required the type of detailed data that are not yet widely available in the United States, and has only been attempted in a few small areas.\nTo fill this gap in the science, our study aimed to create a nationwide spatial dataset of synthetic poultry farms from publicly available data that infectious disease researchers could use as input to their infectious disease models in the United States until more accurate data are available. The final database is termed \"synthetic\" because, while it is realistic (i.e., synthetic farms will be located in locations suitable for commercial poultry production and have attribute values similar to actual farms raising poultry) and it is derived from actual poultry farm data, it does not contain names, addresses, or any other identifying or sensitive characteristics of actual poultry farms.\nThe resulting synthesized data contain the number of farm operations by poultry type and size that match aggregated counts by county. The locations of the synthesized farms are generated so that they are consistent with poultry farm siting factors-such as physical and regulatory constraints, existence of poultry industry support infrastructure, and likelihood of acceptance by neighbors-observed from real poultry farm maps from two states, Delaware and Pennsylvania.\nIn this report, we describe the construction of the synthesized poultry farm database, evaluate its accuracy, and discuss the implications for future research."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "We used a variety of data processing steps to create the synthesized poultry-farm database, including obtaining the number of poultry farms by type and size within each county; identifying common factors that influence the siting of poultry farms; developing geographic layers using suitability scores associated with each siting factor; merging site suitability layers into a single combined suitability surface; and placing poultry operations within each county based on that surface. We expect some variability in how each type of poultry farm (i.e., broilers, layers, pullets, turkeys, and other poultry) is influenced by each siting factor, but in this exercise we assumed that the differences are negligible, as noted in the discussion."}, {"section_title": "Obtain Data on Poultry Farm Counts, Types, and Sizes of Operations, Aggregated by County", "text": "The best source of data on poultry farm counts, types, and sizes of operations, aggregated by county, is the 2002 US Census of Agriculture published by the USDA's National Agriculture Statistics Service (USDA, 2002) . This census is conducted every 5 years to obtain data on farming and ranching operations and includes agricultural operation (i.e., farm) characteristics, such as the types and amount of produce grown and animals raised. Participation is required by law.\nWe extracted and downloaded county-level data from the Census of Agriculture's Web site (USDA, 2002 ). We selected the county level because it is the smallest geographical division with complete summary statistics of the relevant variables-including counts for each poultry type, number of animals, and for broilers, the number sold (because the actual number of broilers was not available).\nAdditional processing and summarization were required to address double counting of farms at the county level that have a combination of types (e.g., a farm may raise both broiler and layer chickens). To reconcile these data, we developed an algorithm that assigned a unique farm type to synthetic farm locations based on type categories and farm size (see the appendix)."}, {"section_title": "Identify the Factors That Affect the Siting of Actual Poultry Farms", "text": "After analyzing available poultry farm data and conducting a literature review, we determined that the following four siting factors are associated with the locations of poultry farms (Berry, 2007; Goan, 2005; Sambidi, 2003; Sambidi, Harrison, & Farr, 2004; USDA, 2002 ):\n\u2022 Zoning and local regulations-can influence the likelihood of finding a poultry farm at a given location in several ways:\n-Municipal versus agricultural land use-areas zoned for agricultural use have a higher likelihood of allowing commercial poultry production, whereas municipalities are more likely to have specific regulations prohibiting it.\n-Constraints on where businesses can operatetypically, commercial poultry operations are not allowed to operate on public lands.\n-Separation of potentially conflicting land uses-commercial poultry operations are not usually found in areas of high population whose occupants might object to being near a commercial poultry operation (e.g., residential areas, schools, churches), often because of odor concerns.

Because the poultry often reside on only a small portion of the farm on which they are located, we considered the siting of commercial poultry houses rather than the location of the entire farm.\n(continued)\nHaving identified the broad factors that influence the siting of poultry houses, we analyzed actual farm locations to quantify the relevance of each factor to the likelihood of finding a farm at a given site. We used three sources of actual farm locations: the Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) business database (Dun & Bradstreet, 2007) , a restricted access database of poultry farms developed by University of Pennsylvania researchers, and the Delaware Environmental Navigator (DEN) (State of Delaware, 2006) .\nAlthough the D&B business database contains poultry farm locations from around the country, it contains only about 30 percent of the poultry farms reported by the 2002 US Census of Agriculture. We believe that smaller farms in particular are underrepresented. Also, the locations from this data source were mostly georeferenced by address matching; consequently, their locations were not always as precise as the locations from the other two data sources. For example, we examined a small sample of the D&B poultry businesses in Pennsylvania and Delaware and determined that most D&B locations were within 500 m of the actual poultry houses, but many were not within the boundaries of the farm.\nNonetheless, the D&B database allowed us to test and refine some of our potential siting factors that involved larger areas or distances. For example, we Within agricultural land, most sample poultry farms were found preferentially in land classified as cropland by the National Land Cover Dataset, so croplands were considered a complimentary (and optimum) land use instead of a competing land use. Croplands were assigned an optimum score as compared with other land uses.\nAgricultural/non-agricultural land use/ land cover Sample poultry farms were found on pasture to a much lesser degree, especially the middle or \"core\" pasture areas. We believe these areas were preferentially used by non-poultry animal operations (e.g., cattle, sheep) for grazing. Peripheral pasture areas were assigned low scores and core pasture areas were assigned very low scores.\nAgricultural/non-agricultural land use/ land cover Exclude areas where other businesses exist that are likely incompatible with commercial poultry production."}, {"section_title": "Non-agriculture businesses", "text": "Exclude areas where other land uses exist that are likely incompatible with commercial poultry production.\nTransportation (e.g., airports, railroads)"}, {"section_title": "Poultry industry infrastructure", "text": "Place near roads accessible by large trucks.

These findings were contrary to expectations and allowed us to adjust our siting factor assumptions. We assigned a small, nonzero suitability score for municipal areas and public lands, allowing a small number of synthesized farms to be placed in municipal areas and within certain public lands if other suitability conditions were also favorable. We created the small non-zero suitability score for only the public lands that contained a D&B poultry farm or for public lands that covered an entire county in which the Census of Agriculture indicated poultry farms existed.\nWe used poultry farms maps from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and the state of Delaware (referred to as \"truth\" datasets because they represent the known locations of some poultry farms) to estimate suitability scores for siting factors, including land cover areas and distances to other features, such as roads and support infrastructure. While Lancaster County and the state of Delaware have a high density of poultry farms, the densities of poultry farms vary within the area. For example, Lancaster County and Sussex County (Delaware) have very high farm densities (1.00 and 0.59 poultry farms per square mile, respectively), whereas Kent and New Castle counties (Delaware) have lower farm densities (0.21 and 0.04 poultry farms per square mile, respectively). We used these truth data to represent the location patterns and siting factors for the conterminous United States.\nFinally, we obtained locations of poultry farms for the state of Delaware from the DEN (State of Delaware, 2006) . The DEN provided actual poultry farm locations, but did not provide data on the type of poultry or count of birds at each farm. We examined the locations of the Delaware farms in the DEN and identified some spatial inaccuracies. We then edited and adjusted these locations using aerial imagery so each farm point was located on a poultry house, as seen in the aerial imagery. Based on the types of farms from the D&B database for Delaware and professional knowledge of the poultry operations in the state, we concluded that the vast majority of Delaware poultry farms are broiler farms.\nWe used the DEN data in conjunction with the truth datasets to estimate suitability scores for distances from poultry infrastructure. A suitability score is a value between zero and 1,000 that reflects how suitable a given location is for a poultry farm. A value of zero denotes a location in which the likelihood that a farm would be placed there is nil, whereas 1,000 denotes an area that is very suitable for placement of a farm.\nFor instance, the likelihood that a farm would be placed inside core developed areas (high-or mediumintensity development) is extremely low, so the suitability score is set to zero; whereas the likelihood that a farm would be placed in areas other than core developed areas is very high, so the suitability score is set to 1,000. Table 2 presents the suitability scores for various siting factors (presented as data layers in Table 2 ). In many cases, the suitability score varies with distance from features or areas, such as a town or road.\nWe further categorized suitability scores to represent the different levels of suitability for poultry house placement. For distance from roads, for example, we considered areas within 50 to 300 m of a road to be optimum and assigned them the highest score (1,000) for placing a poultry house, whereas the areas very close to (<50 m) or far from (>1 km) the roads had the lowest scores for placing a poultry house (5 to 10 percent of the optimum).\nTo determine scores for proximity data layers, we used the actual farm location data (D&B, DEN, Lancaster County) and compared those locations to zones of increasing distance from features (i.e., buffer zones). This enabled us to calculate suitability scores for areas based on their distances from various geographic features. For instance, we generated multiple buffer zones (or rings) at various distances from some roads and poultry support service businesses, including hatcheries. We based the scores assigned to each buffer zone on the distribution of actual poultry farms that fell within them. "}, {"section_title": "Develop Geographic Layers Using Suitability Scores Associated with the Siting Factors", "text": "This data processing step involved developing geographic information system (GIS) data layers that contain geospatially specific farm suitability scores, using the site-location factors and suitability scores specified in Tables 1 and 2 .

For example, we used GIS techniques to compute slope values from the elevation data (National Elevation Dataset [US Geological Survey, 2006] ). We also developed a data layer consisting of a 75 m buffer zone around short local road segments (i.e., those less than 0.5 km in length) in a detailed road dataset to approximate exurban developed or residential areas.\nWe converted each data layer to a uniform raster format-a geospatial layer made up of a series of regularly spaced grid cells all having the same size, such as those seen on typical street-routing Web sites-with grid cells 30 m on a side. We assigned each grid cell the farm suitability score of the category or buffer zone that its center fell within."}, {"section_title": "Merge Site Suitability Layers into a Single Combined Suitability Surface", "text": "We created the raster grid cell layers so that each individual data layer could be merged with other data layers into a single layer (i.e., we combined the individual layer raster grid scores to create an overall suitability score for each 30 m grid cell). The overall suitability score was the product of all the input layer scores calculated separately for each cell and rescaled back to the zero to 1,000 range. Consequently, a cell with a zero suitability score for any of the data layers would have an overall score of zero, enabling us to filter out these cells for farm placement. The resulting set of cell-specific scores is a suitability surface that combines all of the individual data layers. Note that this process uses the same score for all animal types. Figure 1 is a simplified example of the likelihood combination process that combines three data layers into a single resulting likelihood surface. In future versions of the database, separate likelihood surfaces for each animal type and size class may be necessary depending on the use of the data."}, {"section_title": "Place Poultry Operations Based on the Combined Suitability Surface", "text": "To locate poultry operations for each county, we developed a process consistent with the expectations of the poultry suitability surface. Figure 2 is an example of an input suitability surface, with colors indicating ranges of suitability (left side) and the resulting placement of synthetic farms (right side) for Lancaster County.\nTo place poultry operations using the constraints of the suitability surface, we first randomly generated 10 times the number of desired poultry locations in the county and then screened out candidate locations based on the suitability score at that location using a random number generator. We assigned random numbers from a uniform distribution between zero and 1,000 to each of the potential synthetic farm locations. We then compared the assigned random number for each potential farm location with the farm suitability score at that location. If the assigned random number was less than the suitability score, we retained the location and considered it still viable to become a synthetic poultry farm location. If the converse was true, we removed the potential farm location from consideration. The intended net effect was that potential locations in more suitable areas were preferentially kept as synthetic farm locations.\nIn some cases, this process resulted in fewer potential farms being left for consideration in a county than the total number of farms reported in the Census of Agriculture county poultry farm counts. This could happen in counties where the majority of the county had very low farm-siting scores. In these cases, we created a new set of potential farm locations, generating 10 times the previous number of candidates (i.e., 100 times the desired number) and repeated the process for the county, discarding the first attempt. 250,000,000 500,000,000 1,000,000,000 250 500 1,000\nMore commonly, too many potential synthetic poultry farm locations passed the screening process.\nTo obtain the desired number of farm locations, we randomly selected locations from the remaining candidates.\nOnce we reached the desired number of synthetic poultry farm locations in a county, we randomly assigned a bird type and bird count range (i.e., farm size) attribute to each synthetic poultry farm location according to the distribution of poultry farm type and size combinations found in the Census of Agriculture for the county. Finally, we assigned a bird count generated at random from the location's bird count range. Figure 2 shows the results for the pilot area, Lancaster County. Note the large variability and coverage of the suitability scores across the county and that the high-suitability areas are clustered (left-hand graphic). According to a visual analysis of the pilot results by University of Pennsylvania researchers, the distribution of the synthetic poultry farms (right-hand graphic) reflects the distribution of actual poultry farms much more accurately than farms placed randomly within the county's borders using the same census counts (S. Dunipace, personal communication, 2006) . We considered this to be sufficient evidence to proceed with generating synthetic poultry farms for the rest of the conterminous United States."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy Assessment Method", "text": "We used agreement matrices (also known as error, confusion, or correlation matrices), a standard method of evaluating map accuracy (Jensen, 1996; Munoz, Lesser, Dorney, & Savage, 2009; R Development Core Team, 2010; Stehman & Czapewiski, 2003) , and statistics derived from these matrices to evaluate the accuracy of our synthesized data. When using agreement matrices to evaluate classification accuracy, one dataset often serves as a reference dataset (i.e., \"truth data\") and the other serves as a predictive model of the truth.\nIn this case, we compared locations from the synthesized dataset that could support a farm (i.e., had a non-zero suitability score) and locations that could not support a farm (i.e., had a zero suitability score) with actual land use data from aerial imagery and supplemental data sources. 1 The actual land use data served as the reference dataset that provided the classifications.\nWe also recalculated the suitability surface following the more common approach, using a uniform distribution to generate a dataset of randomly placed farms (from which we derived random placement classifications) and compared We selected North Carolina for this comparison because in North Carolina (1) commercial poultry operations range from very large factory operations to small family-owned farms, (2) the state has a diversity of terrains (e.g., coastal plain, rolling farmlands, foothills, mountains), many of which are similar to other US poultry-producing areas, and (3) we had access to high-resolution (1 m) and very high-resolution (6 in to 1 ft) true-color aerial imagery for most of the state, as well as online US Geological Service (USGS) 1:24,000 digital topographic maps (known as digital raster graphics, or DRGs).\nThe first step involved the selection of a reasonable number of locations that could be compared across all three surfaces (i.e., synthesized, random, and actual use). The 2002 Census of Agriculture for North Carolina indicated that there were 6,251 poultry farms in the state. Consequently, we randomly selected 6,251 locations from the synthesized surface that had a non-zero suitability score of supporting a poultry farm (i.e., these were classified as \"suitable\" for the synthesized classification). We repeated the process of selecting and classifying locations using the random placement surface (i.e., these new locations were classified as \"suitable\" for the random placement classification). We then generated an equal number of \"unsuitable\" locations from the synthesized surface and from the random placement surface by randomly selecting from among the locations with zero suitability scores. We did this because we are as interested in avoiding incorrect placement as placing farms correctly. From the resulting 25,004 locations (i.e., 4 \u00d7 6,251), we randomly selected a 10 percent sample of 2,499 for the calculation of the agreement matrices.\nThe second step involved determining the reference classifications at each of the 2,499 sampled locations from each of the three datasets. To create our reference classifications (actual land use), we developed a simplified set of \"suitable\" and \"not suitable\" land use categories ( 14. Other (not described in any other category; also includes areas of farms deemed unsuitable because of steep slope)\nTo evaluate the overall similarity of the approaches, we calculated three agreement matrices: a matrix comparing the agreement of the synthetic farm locations with the truth (or reference) data; a matrix comparing the randomly placed farm locations with the reference data; and a matrix comparing the synthetic farm locations with the random farm locations. The accuracy statistics calculated from these matrices (Figure 3 ) include the Total Accuracy (i.e., the proportion of the predictions that were correct), the User's Accuracy (i.e., the proportion of correct predictions given a particular prediction value [Yes/No]), and the Producer's Accuracy (i.e., the proportion of correct predictions given a specific truth value [Yes/No] ). Note that the Producer's Accuracy reflects the percentage of poultry locations in the reference dataset (truth data) correctly classified by the synthetic or random surfaces, and that the User's Accuracy reflects the percentage of synthetic or random placement locations that matched the truth data.\nsuitable poultry locations that were, in fact, classified as unsuitable by the synthetic or random surfaces. It is preferable for the false-negative and false-positive statistics to be very low, and for the Producer's, User's, and Total Accuracy statistics to be very high.\nWe used a bootstrap approach to estimate 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) and mean values for each of the agreement statistics, using the opensource statistical software package R to implement appropriate code (R Development Core Team, 2010). Using sampling with replacement, 1,000 samples of size 500 were drawn at random from the set of 2,499 selected locations. For each of the 1,000 samples, we calculated the agreement statistics (Total Accuracy, User's Accuracy, and Producer's Accuracy, as well as the commission and omission errors), resulting in a sampling distribution of 1,000 values for each statistic. The mean of each statistic is the mean of the resulting distribution, and the upper and lower 95 percent CIs correspond to the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the sampling distribution for each statistic (e.g., Total Accuracy) values.\nWe used these bootstrap CIs to test the null hypothesis of no difference between accuracy statistics calculated from the two methods. In particular, if the mean of a given accuracy statistic for the synthetic poultry surface did not fall within the 95 percent bootstrap CI of the corresponding accuracy statistic for the randomly placed surface, and vice versa, then we could say that the two given accuracy statistics are significantly different with 95 percent confidence.\nResults Table 4 presents the distribution of classifications for the sampled locations from all three datasets (i.e., the synthetic dataset, the random placement dataset, and the reference dataset, or actual land use) by land use category. For the synthetic surface, a larger percentage of locations with non-zero scores (73.5 percent) were classified in the suitable categories compared with the percentage of the zero score locations (26.5 percent) classified in the same categories. The opposite was observed for locations classified in the suitable categories by the random placement surface. When looking at the not suitable categories, both surfaces We also calculated the proportions of false-positive and false-negative cases, also known as commission and omission errors, respectively. The false-positive statistic is the proportion of locations unsuitable for poultry production that were, in fact, classified as suitable by the synthetic or the random surfaces. The false-negative statistic denotes the proportion of show a larger percentage of the zero score locations classified in these categories. Overall, the estimates presented in Table 4 indicate that the synthetic surface was more successful in replicating the actual land use distribution. b A successful predictive model for these locations would classify these locations as non-zero suitability areas; that is, ideally the percentage of locations that were non-zero on the surface should be close to 100%, and the percentage that were zero should be close to 0% for each category.\nc A successful predictive model for these locations would classify these locations as zero suitability areas; that is, ideally the percentage of locations that were zero on the surface should be close to 100%, and the percentage that were non-zero should be close to 0% for each category.\nWith respect to the random placement surface, a bootstrap CI for the Total Accuracy is from 54 to 62 percent. All of the accuracy statistics for the two surfaces are significantly different (at the 95 percent CI) from one another. The lack of strong agreement between the two surfaces and the superior poultry farm prediction capability of the synthetic surface suggests that this method can be used to create more reliable inputs to agent-based models than those from random placement methods."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "By using US Census of Agriculture farm counts and publicly available GIS data, this study demonstrates that it is possible to generate a nationwide poultry farm dataset with locations that are significantly more realistic than locations created using a common random placement method alternative. Our method, and the maps it provides, has already proved useful in obtaining preliminary estimates of the parameters that govern the transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the USA (Rorres, Pelletier, Bruhn, & Smith, 2011) .\nThe success rate of the synthetic poultry surface in correctly identifying commercial poultry production locations (62.3 percent) is more than twice that of the random placement surface (25.4 percent). The accuracy statistics (i.e., Total Accuracy, User's Accuracy, and Producer's Accuracy) for the synthetic poultry surface are all significantly higher (95 percent confidence level) than the corresponding random placement surface's accuracy statistics. Most importantly, the Total Accuracy statistic is quite high for the synthetic poultry surface, with a mean of 79 percent, as compared with a mean of 58 percent for the random placement surface. Also, the rates of misclassifications (i.e., false negative and false positive cases) are lower (i.e., better) for the synthetic surface. These synthetic data can be used in modeling and simulations-for example, infectious disease spread modeling of avian influenza-and when regional estimates of actual farm distributions are needed, for example, these data can be used in the determination of the approximate number of poultry farms and birds by watershed. However, we do not recommend using the data when precise locations and/or reliable associated poultry counts for specific farms are needed, such as might be the case in site pollution estimation scenarios.\nOverall, the results suggest the viability of adapting this method to simulate other livestock farms of interest to infectious disease researchers, such as swine and cattle. To improve on the realism of the locations and estimated bird counts, we are investigating five research avenues.\nFirst, we are considering incorporating actual farm locations when available after the locations have been confirmed using aerial imagery and ancillary datasets, such as the datasets used to classify the locations in our accuracy assessment plus any local data sources if they are available. The associated farm capacity (number of animals) might be estimated if the imagery supports the estimation of animal house sizes. Farm type is often included with the actual farm location data, or might be estimated based on the animal building size, number, configuration, and contextual information. We will use these actual farm locations to perform additional accuracy assessments as well.\nSecond, to reduce prediction errors related to precision or classification errors present in the data sources used to create the synthetic poultry surface, we are considering substituting or adding newer datasets, such as LandScan 90 m population counts (Oak Ridge national Laboratory, 2010), better approximations for rural housing and industrial areas, more accurate forest data, soils, and detailed croplands.\nThird, if further investigation determines that the different combinations have significantly different placement profiles, we can create separate placement surfaces for the different animal farm type and size combinations. For example, large broiler farms (>10,000 birds) would be expected to have different spatial constraints than small layer farms (<100 birds) because of their different infrastructure, food, and waste-handling requirements.\nFourth, we plan to examine the suitability factors more closely to determine whether a similar result might be obtained with fewer data inputs, and in that case develop a simpler process with fewer data inputs and less processing to generate more current versions of the synthetic population. An examination using fewer data points might provide valuable insights that could be used if similar data were to be generated for other countries that may not be as data rich or may have different local suitability factors.\nLastly, we looked at the county-summarized estimated bird counts and noted that the average difference from the Census of Agriculture county counts was -4 percent for layers, 24 percent for broilers, 48 percent for pullets, and 73 percent for turkeys. The largest average percentage difference was noted for counties with the smallest number of birds (e.g., turkey farms with 1,000 or more turkeys had an average difference of only 13 percent). The differences are due to the need to assume a sampling distribution within farm size categories to assign synthetic farm sizes. We assumed a uniform distribution. In future research, we will explore other distributions and enforce tolerances on the acceptable difference between the estimated bird counts and the reported bird counts at the county level.\nRTI International is an independent, nonprofit research organization dedicated to improving the human condition by turning knowledge into practice.
