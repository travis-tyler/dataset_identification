The information-collection phase will terminate at the end of the calendar year MJor Findings: In 1983, the number of employed doctoral scientists and engifleas in the United States reached 369,000. Employment of doctoral scientists and engineers in industry increased sharply between 1981 and 1983 (about 15% versus 7.5% for ail sectors combined), continuing a trend that began in the early 1970's. Academic employment grew at little more than half the rate of industrial employment during the 1973-83 decade, and Federal Government employment grew even more slowly. As a result, hinnm mourns* by 1983 industry's share of the doctoral employment of scientists and engineers was 31%, the academic share was 53%, and the Federal Government share was 7%. Employment of computer specialists increased at three times the average rate (16.3% per year versus 5.3% per year) between 1973 and 1933. The social sciences and psychology grew at higher than average rates during this period, while physical and mathematical sciences grew at slower rates. Women and minority doctoral scientists and engineers showed sitting employment gains between 1973 and 1983, an average annual growth rate of 11.2% for women and 9-13% for blacks, Asians. and Hispanics. lb determine whether there have been differential changes in patterns of enrollment, sources of student support, and doctoral output among research doctorate departments of varying quality.

Most of this growth was generated by high-technology industrieselectrical and nonelectrical machinery, transportation equipment, chemical, and instiummts. Most manufacturing industries inawased the share of their wait force that consisted sdentific, engineakig, and technical personnel. Those types of increases, as opposed to overall employment growth. accounted for 85% of the gtowth of sciedids, =gingen, and technicians.\nThis study will link data from two prior surveys that eruunined the experiences, aptitudes, interests, and other attributes of engineers and of engineering students. These data on the characteristics of recent graduates will be applied to survey data about the precollege interests, activities, career plans and abilities of beginning engineering students to ascertain the characteristics of students most likely to complete engineering migrants.

These surveys contain information on date doctorate was received, age, tenure status, . ,;e, sex, identity of doctorate-granting institution, and characteristics of the current employee Productivity will be nutasumd by the output of publicatiom and will be ascertained by matching the atm* population with the Science Citation Index. \nThe projections will be both short tetra (up to five years) and long term, and will be closely related to projections of the economic conditions that affect the market place for engineers, comparing them to past occupational-choice patterns of students. to meet the demands generated by the proposed defense buildup ova the 1980-86 period.\nThe research entails utilization of the Defense Intepindusuy Fon:casting System (DIPS) of Data Removes, Inc., to gamine employment requirements by detailed occupation and industrial classifications in both the defense and nondefense secton. Detailed occupational requirements generated by various combin' atlas of defense expenditure patterns and macroeconomic amdidons vame compared to the projected supply of S/E personnel to identify possible shortages. The projected supply was derived by use of a dynamic simulation model that forecasts degree conferrals, curriculum choice, labor force participation, and occupational mobility. The latter model was developed under NSF support by Drs. Robert DauffenBach (Oklahoma State University) and Jack Fiorito (University ii Iowa).\nMaterial included in the report is based on an annual survey of all Federal agencies that support R&D programs, and on reports provided annually by agencies to the Office of Management and Budget for the Special Analysis on research and devdopment. Attention is given to Federal R&D finding in the content el total national R&D support, and on Fedend funding by agency and character of work, and support to univessiass and colleges.

The data were developed and arranged by budget function by NSF/SRS staff, and descriptions of budget changes were produced from budget documents.\nThe project included onsite and telephone discussions with company officials Hof randomly selected major R&D-performers) responsible for setting corporate policy on response to Government surveys. Based on these discussions, TARP, Inc., identified four models of the decision-making process, developed strategies designed to motivate decision makers to encourage their companies' full participation in the survey, and tested these strategies to determine if the response rate could be improved. Major Findings: Several deterrants to response were identified including unavailability of data requested, resource constraints, and lack of perceived benefits to the company from participating in the survey. Several of the strategies proposed and tested, however, may have some potential for improving response. ltvo of these strategies are encouraging better communication within companies between data users and actual respondents, and enlisting the assistance of a few trade associations by asking them to endorse the survey. \nThe report is based on information obtained from two sources: (i r Mail responses to an inquiry sent to members of the NSF Industrial Panel on Science and Technology, and (2) interviews with R&D officials representing firms in the major R&D-performing industries.

R&D data were collected from firms with fewer than 1,000 employees and less than $1 million in R&D expenditures only for those years --1971. 1976, and 1981-- To develop quantitative indicators of the status of, and need for, equipment for scientific research in U.S. universities and colleges through a nationally representative survey of higher education institutions.\nThe contractor is conducting a stratified probability sample of 43 universities from a universe of the approximately 160 largest academic R&D performers. During Phase I of the survey, departments within universities were subsampled in the physical and computer sciences and engineering to collect information on equipment costing between $10,000 and $1,000,000. This study is based on the \"Instrumentation Indicators Feasibility Study\" completed for NSF by Westat, Inc., in early 1982. Phase II of this projected 3-year study will subsample departments within universities in the biological, agricultural, environmental, and medical sciences. Major Findings: University researchers classified about one-fourth of the items in their 1982 research equipment inventories as obsolete and no longer in use. Of all academic research equipment listed in the 1982 inventories, only 18% was characterized as \"state-of-theart.\" More than 90% of departmental chairpersons in each of the three surveyed fields reported that the lack of equipment inhibited the conduct of critical research. lvo-thirds of all academic research systems were acquired partly or entirely with Federal funds. PROJECT: R&D hinds in Academic Science and Engineering, FY 1983 Objective: To collect data from academic institutions spending over $50,000 for separately budgeted research and development.\nOver 560 institutions and 19 affiliated federally financed R&D centers received the questionnaires for the FY 1983 survey. There were several data elements: Source of support, amount allocated to basic research, total and federally financed R&D expenditures by discipline, research equipment expenditures from separately budgeted R&D funds by discipline, and capital expenditures for scientific and engineering activities. The survey was closed out in June 1984. Major Findings: NA funding of science and technology To extend the investigator's previous study on computers to provide a general method for measuring the advance of an industry's technological performance through time. Method: Three industries will be selected from such possibilities as general-purpose assembly robots. logic analyzers. and solar energy. Data on firms will be collected and used in further studies of technology transfer, the effect of firm size on innovativeness, and the relation between R&D expenditure and innovation output. Cost is regressed against performance and date of introduction for all models of the technology. Performance will be measured in terms of the value of the product to users, and possibly will be calculated as a composite of a great number of technical variables. Final report expected in November 1985..\nThe Census Bureau will create a mechanism for researchers to better utilize the NSF/Census Bureau industrial R&D data base for the years 1972-81 (collected on an enterprise basis) in conjunction with other economic data sets collected on an establishment basis. To date, one of the major constraints in merging the NSF R&D data base is that these data arc collected by enterprise. This project will develop the mechanism to enable researchers to use the R&D data with other data sets (collected via a different reporting unit) and will pilot test the system to ensure validity. ing a broader range of data on industrial innovation than is currently available. The need for these data is based on the fact that many activities other than research and developmentsuch as marketing researchcontribute to the innovation process in the private sector. The investigator will compile and analyze the data collected, and debrief a subgroup of respondents. \nFor each technology, determine surfaces of constant probability density in terms of the performance variables. Determine the distance between surfaces prcthabilistically by an application of discriminant functions. This distance represents the amount of progress from one surface to anothet Dimensional analysis was investigated as a way of reducing the number of variables to be studied. Major Findings: Separate indices were developed to represent advances in the deep structure and the surface structure of the two technologies studied. The separate influences of incremental and radical innovations were studied, as well as the influence of the advances in different component technologies. Quantitative estimates were made of the effects of these and other types of innovation on overall progress in both technologies.\nFor each technology, the devices are grouped into sets that are equivalent in performance. Each set is fit witha tradeoff surface in multidimensional space. A distance measure between the surfaces is defined to represent the degree of progress from one to another. Major Findings: Families of tradeoff surfaces were calculated for each technology. In some cases, surfaces for different time periods intersected. The need was discovered to make sure that all relevant variables are included and that the variables used really are traded off against one another. lb provide current and time-series data on patenting in the United States for 55 product fields and 10 designated technology fields, analyzed by country of origin. sector of patent owner, year of patent application, and year of patent grant.\nData are based on the computer file of patenting data of the Office of lbchnology Assessment and Forecast. They are converted from the Patent Office Classification system to the Standard Industrial Classification system for 55 product fields, by a revised concordance. \nComplete documentation for the concordance will be developed and studied. A workshop of experts in the use of patenting data made criticisms and suggestions. A final report to NSF will summarize these steps and make recommendations for changes in the concordance. Changes agreed upon will be implemented. represented by patenting data, in comparison with West Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom. and France, in various product fields and in two time periods.\nThe international patent file provided by Dement was used to determine the rules of patenting by these countries in various recipient countries in 1975-77 and 1980-82 in each of six R&D-intensive product fields. and in two mature product fields. Revealed Advantage Indices were calcubsted and plotted to show the areas of U.S strength and weakness and changes in those areas. %dor Findings: During the two periods studied, U.S. inventors placed a greater emphasis on patenting in the laser, microbiology-enzymology, drug, and integrated circuit technologies than did inventors in the rest of the world. Japanese inventors were particularly active in the second period in integrated circuits, in lasers, and in telecommunications, while inventors from West Germany placed relatively great emphasis on inventions related to internal combustion engines. \"lb develop a new indicator of scientific progress based on cocitation cluster analysis methodologies.\nCo-citation clusters drawn from the Science Citation Index data base were screened to determine year-to-year continuities. Quantitative characteristics of these clusters were studied to monitor important developments in research specialties, as reflected in the research literature. %dor Findings: This project has resulted in the automation of inter -year cluster links and the formation of all strings of clusters found in 10 yearly sets of Science Citation Index co-citation clusters, 1970-79. The data base thus created can be regarded as a resource for the study of specialty development in the sciences and engineering. Over the 1970's, almost three-fourths ut the co-citation clusters shim, comauity for at least the following year. Statistical variables the' were examined include the following: impact, reamcy, intellectual focus, literature size and dispersion, individual productivity, geographic focus, level of research (basic, applied), and cross-disciplinary orientation. Final report is available for inspection in the SRS/Science Indicators Unit.\nBibliometric analyses were conducted on publications from 15 59 countries using the Science Citation Index source tapes. All of dte citation data used in the cross-country analyses were developed from the exact-matched citation tapes. The project provided several new indicators of the output of research including the rapidity of a nation's use of research results in subsequent research, international differences in the use of basic research findings in applied research, and changes in the quantity of research described in the average report. This project also tested some of the operating assumptions that underlie the literature indicators used in the Science Indicators reports. Major Findings: The basic-to-applied character of these research articles was found to be very similar from country to country within fields, and quite stable over the 1973-79 period. In particular, the United States showed no significant differences from other countries taken as a group. The high citation rates to U.S. research articles cannot he ascribed to differences in research level. An examination of the length of all articles in this set of science and technology journals showed that those on the subject of chemistry were the shortest, and those on mathematics and earth/space sciences were the longest. U.S. versus non-U.S. comparisons showed ii at the United States had shorter papers in biology, whereas it had longer papers in mathematics than did non-U.S. countries. \nThe most highly cited papers in the fields are identified and then clustered by co-citation methods. The clusters, representing key events. are mapped in two dimensions, by centroid scaling, to distribute them over time and to show their proximity to each other. Published reviews and interviews with experts in the fields will serve to check the key events. \nThe project will proceed in two steps. First, three industries in the United States and in the United Kingdom will be stuthee. qualitatively to identify important influences on the ability of firms to capture the profits that are earned when these innovations are transferred internationally. Second. data on the factors that were found to be important in the first phase will be collected and will he used in a regression model to predict the distribution of the returns from innovation in a fourth industry. To examine the impact of agricultural research and development 63 on selected characteristics of the U.S. farm sector and to assess ire validity and reliability of various agricultural R&D indicators such as expenditures and scientific personnel data.\nThe research focused on possible relationships between research and development and changes in farm commercialization and concentration and in the farm labor force for the Nation as a whole. The project examined different types of R&D output, levels of effort to diffuse such outputs. and the resultant effects. A simultaneous equation model was developed to test the various relationships. A comprehensive longitudinal data set was also created for research and development in the agricultural sector for the period 1915-73. Major Findings: Results indicate that publicly financed agricultural research and development has tended to increase average farm size, the number of large farms (i.e., farms of 1,000 + acres), and large farms as a percent of all farms. The greatest impact was in the percent of large farms. With regard to commercialization and employment, it was found that research and development was of little direct significance. The concentration of farming in large farms, however, appears in turn to affect both commercialization and the size of the farm labor fon. . In addition to funding, the investigators explored the relationship between the number of publications derived from publicly financed agricultural research and the concentration of farms. The number of total publications was found to be an effective predictor of increased farm concentration. Publications in scientific journals. however, failed to perform adequately as an indicator. Further evaluation of this finding would seem to be necessary. To produce survey data on the attitudes toward science and technology of several groups. including opinion leaders in science and technology (SIT) policy outside the Government and the portion of the public that is most interested in and informed about SIT issues.\nTwo questionnaires were designed. partly overlapping the one used in the 1979 national survey for Science Indicators, with the nationwide survey conducted by telephone.

Major Findings: Opinions were obtained from samples of the broad public, an 67 \"attentive public\" knowledgeable about and interested in srr issues, a potentially attentive group, and opinion leaders in S/T policy outside the Government. The attentives' assessment of the benefits from SIT was found to be even more favorable than that of the general public, with potential attentives falling in between. Policy leaders are still more favorably disposed and have a greater preference for basic, as opposed to applied. \nOnsitc data teams will identify foreign data sources. Data will be collected through direct contacts with officials from various sectors including government, industry, higher education, and nonprofit institutions. Reports, surveys, and other literature published in the national language will be examined. An examination of the comparability of the foreign data will ix done in terms of U.S. definitions and concepts. Analytical analyses will be conducted on the foreign R&D data and comparisons will be made with U.S. R&D data trends. Major Findings: Soviet R&D investments rose through the late seventies and were considerably larger than U.S. investmentsboth in absolute numbers and in terms of the size of the economy. In 1984, the Soviet Union expended about 27 billion rubles on research and development. This represented 3.65% of their gross national product. Attempts were made to present Soviet S/E per-International science and technology sonnel data in accordance with U.S. definitions. There were between 1.4 and 1.6 million Soviet scientists and engineers engaged in research and development in 1984. The concentration of R&D scientists and engineers in the labor force was the highest of any country: 9-10 R&D scientists and engineers for every 1,000 persons in the labor force in 1984.\nInformation on U.S. and Japanese engineers will be compiled and cataloged from existing data sources. These data will be critically evaluated and analyzed. New data on the career paths of comparable cohorts of U.S. and Japanese engineers will be gathered and analyzed for the purpose of adding substantive insights into these indicators. An evaluation of a sample of engineering curricula in the two countries will provide additional information on the training and knowledge base of engineers.
