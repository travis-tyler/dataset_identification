[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "[1] In [2003][2004][2005], systematic studies in four contrasting hydrogeologic settings were undertaken to improve understanding of source and transport controls on nitrate movement to public supply wells (PSW) in principal aquifers of the United States. Chemical, isotopic, and age tracer data show that agricultural fertilizers and urban septic leachate were the primary sources of large nitrate concentrations in PSW capture zones at Modesto, California (Central Valley aquifer system) and York, Nebraska (High Plains aquifer). Urban septic leachate and fertilizer (possibly nonfarm) were the primary sources of large nitrate concentrations in PSW capture zones at Woodbury, Connecticut (glacial aquifer system), and Tampa, Florida (Floridan aquifer system), respectively. Nitrate fluxes to the water table were larger in agricultural settings than urban settings, indicating that it would be beneficial to reduce PSW capture zone areas in agricultural regions. Mixing calculations indicate that about 50 to 85% of the nitrate in water from the PSW could be from those modern anthropogenic sources, with the remainder coming from sources in old (>50 years) recharge or sources in young recharge in undisturbed settings such as forests. Excess N 2 concentrations and age tracers showed that denitrification at Modesto occurred gradually (first-order rate constant of 0.02/a) in a thick reaction zone following a $30-year lag time after recharge. Denitrification generally was not an important nitrate sink at Woodbury. At York and Tampa, denitrification occurred rapidly (0.5 to 6/a) in thin reaction zones in fine-grained sediments that separated the anoxic PSW producing zones from overlying oxic, highnitrate ground water. Particle tracking showed that a major pathway by which anthropogenic nitrate reached the York and Tampa PSW was by movement through long well screens crossing multiple hydrogeologic units (York) and by movement through karst features (Tampa), processes which reduced ground water residence times in the denitrifying zones. These results illustrate how PSW vulnerability to nitrate contamination depends on complex variations and interactions between contaminant sources, reaction rates, transit times, mixing, and perturbation of ground water flow in contrasting hydrogeologic settings."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "[2] Nitrate (NO 3 \u00c0 ) is one of the most common ground water contaminants in the world and its presence in the environment at elevated concentrations poses well-known human health and ecological risks [Fan and Steinberg, 1996; Galloway et al., 2003] . In 2000, about 37% of the public water supply in the United States came from ground water [Hutson et al., 2004] . A nationwide survey of NO 3 \u00c0 , pesticides, and volatile organic compounds in untreated water from domestic and public supply wells (PSW) in the United States showed that NO 3 \u00c0 was the contaminant that most frequently exceeded a federal drinking water standard (10 mg/L as N for NO 3 \u00c0 ) [Squillace et al., 2002] . Similarly, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported that among organic and inorganic contaminants in all types of public water systems, NO 3 \u00c0 was the one that most frequently exceeded a federal drinking water standard [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005] . In California, about 10% of the 38,000 water samples collected from PSW exceeded the NO 3 \u00c0 drinking water standard in a 1975 to 1987 survey [Franco et al., 1994] . Despite the importance of ground water to the nation's water supply and the relative impact of NO 3\n\u00c0 on the quality of that resource, detailed and systematic assessments of the processes re-sponsible for NO 3 \u00c0 contamination in PSW generally are lacking [Kauffman et al., 2001] .\n[3] Understanding the origin, fate, and transport of NO 3 \u00c0 and other contaminants to PSW is challenging for a number of reasons. Large-capacity pumping wells could have large and complex areas contributing recharge to the well screens [Barlow, 1997; Kauffman et al., 2001] , in which the land use (contaminant source) varies temporally and spatially. Under nonpumping conditions, water movement across long-screened intervals common in PSW could vertically redistribute contaminants in the flow system [Reilly et al., 1989; Shapiro, 2002; Konikow and Hornberger, 2006] . Under pumping conditions, composite samples from longscreened intervals could consist of waters of varying ages and chemical compositions [Reilly and LeBlanc, 1998; Weissmann et al., 2002] , thus complicating interpretations of contaminant source and fate. Studies of contaminant movement to PSW that address these and other related issues could lead to better understanding of how to locate, construct, and operate PSW to minimize contamination. In 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey began a systematic assessment of processes affecting the transport of anthropogenic and natural contaminants, including NO 3 \u00c0 , to PSW in the United States [Eberts et al., 2005] . The purpose of this report is to examine source and transport controls on the movement of NO 3 \u00c0 to PSW in selected principal aquifers of the United States.\n[4] A single PSW in each of four communities across the United States was selected for detailed study. The communities and the principal aquifers in which the wells are screened are Modesto, California (Central Valley aquifer system); York, Nebraska (High Plains aquifer); Woodbury, Connecticut (Glacial aquifer system); and Tampa, Florida (Floridan aquifer system) ( Figure 1 ). These four communities and principal aquifers were selected to represent a range of land uses, population sizes, and hydrogeologic conditions. In each area, ground water was a major source, if not the sole source, of water supply. Similar monitoring well network designs, sampling methodologies, broad suites of chemical and isotopic parameters, and analytical and modeling methods were used at all sites to enhance comparability of results between sites. Thus, this study represents one of the first to systematically evaluate source and transport controls on NO 3 \u00c0 movement to PSW in diverse hydrogeologic settings."}, {"section_title": "Study Area Descriptions", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Modesto, California", "text": "[5] Modesto, with a population of 188,856 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000, U.S. Census 2000 American Fact Finder, accessed 13 April 2006, available at http://factfinder.census. gov/home/saff/main.html? _ lang=en), is located in the Central Valley of California.

Existing steady state, three-dimensional ground water flow models done using MODFLOW-2000 [Harbaugh et al., 2000; Starn and Brown, 2007; Clark et al., 2007; Burow et al., 2008; U.S. Geological Survey, unpublished data, 2007] provided input into MODPATH. The forward tracking option of MOD-PATH was used for pathline analysis. From 2,344 to 47,008 particles were started at all inflow locations in the models and tracked to their discharge point. The particles were uniformly distributed on the face of the model cells associated with inflow to the model. Particles captured by the PSW were used to delineate areas contributing recharge and flow paths to those wells. The flow associated with each particle was computed by dividing the inflow at the source face by the number of particles started at that face. Effective porosity is required for pathline analysis and assigned values ranged from 0.2 to 0.45. Maps of the three-dimensional distribution of redox zones in the flow systems were superimposed on the pathlines to determine travel times in each zone."}, {"section_title": "Sampling", "text": "[10] Water table monitoring wells were installed under the major land uses in or near the contributing areas to characterize the chemical composition of recent recharge in each land use ( Figure S1 ). Nested monitoring wells were installed along the MODPATH identified flow paths to the PSW to study the history, transport, and fate of NO 3 \u00c0 . At the PSW, composite water samples were collected at the wellhead and depth-dependent samples were collected from discrete depth intervals in the well screen during pumping. Areas contributing recharge were derived from particle tracking models. at which reactions occurred and on the density of sampling points in the reaction zones. Groffman et al. [2006] discuss in more detail scale issues associated with estimating in situ denitrification rates. In thick reaction zones where O 2 reduction and denitrification appeared to occur gradually, O 2 reduction and denitrification rates were estimated by comparing gradients in reaction progress and ground water age using the following models:\nwhere C is the measured O 2 or NO 3 \u00c0 concentration, C o is the initial O 2 or NO 3 \u00c0 concentration in recharge [B\u00f6hlke, 2002] , Dt is the difference between the ground water age of the sample and the age when it entered the relevant reaction zone, R is the rate (mg/L-year) for zero-order reaction kinetics, and k (1/a) is the rate constant for first-order reaction kinetics. For O 2 reduction, the water table was assumed to be the top of the reaction zone, and C o was assigned the maximum measured O 2 concentration near the water table, which is likely to result in maximum estimates of R and k. For denitrification, C o is equal to the sum of NO 3 \u00c0 -N + excess N 2 -N, where excess N 2 -N is the concentration of N 2 attributed to denitrification. The methods for calculating excess N 2 -N and initial NO 3 \u00c0 are presented in Text S1.\n[12] In thin reaction zones where denitrification appeared to occur rapidly, denitrification rates were estimated by comparing analytical solutions to the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation with decay to vertical NO 3 \u00c0 concentration profiles using the following models:\nwhere D is the coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion, z is distance along the flow path, and v is ground water interstitial velocity in the denitrifying zone. Average ground water velocities in the denitrifying zones ranged from 0.7 (Tampa) to 1.6 m/a (York) and were obtained from the ground water flow models. Details of our 1-D modeling approach and the analytical solutions are presented in Text S1."}, {"section_title": "Results and Discussion", "text": "[13] The quality of water produced by PSW is complexly linked to the quality of water recharging and the effect of transport. By assessing relations between the quality of water recharging the aquifers (NO 3 \u00c0 sources), the effect of transport through the hydrologic systems on NO 3 \u00c0 (NO 3 \u00c0 transport), and the quality of water produced by the PSW (NO 3 \u00c0 receptors) in differing hydrogeological settings, insight can be gained into the factors controlling the occurrence of NO 3 \u00c0 in water supplies. [14] Areas contributing recharge to the four PSW included a variety of land use settings such as agricultural, urban, and forest lands (Table 1) . Thus, NO 3 \u00c0 in water produced by the PSW could have been derived from numerous sources associated with those land uses. Nitrate under different land uses was characterized by its initial concentration and N isotope composition at the time of recharge (Figure 3 ), as well as its corresponding apparent ground water age (Figure 4 ). The NO 3 \u00c0 source characterization is based on monitoring well samples. Samples from the PSW also are plotted in Figure 3 , but they are discussed in the section ''Nitrate Receptors.'' 4.1.1. Agricultural Sources of Nitrate"}, {"section_title": "Nitrate Sources", "text": "[15] Areas contributing recharge to the PSW in Modesto and York were the only ones to contain >5% agricultural lands (Table 1) \u00c0 ] in agricultural recharge in Modesto and York were 6.4 and 7.1%, respectively.\n[16] The values of d 15 N[NO 3 \u00c0 ] in agricultural recharge from both study areas could be consistent with NO 3 \u00c0 derived from natural soil N or from fertilizer N that has undergone varying amounts of isotopic fractionation in the soil zone prior to recharge [Kreitler, 1979; Gormly and Spalding, 1979] . Fertilizer was the primary source of N applied to agricultural fields in both study areas. Furthermore, NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations and d 15 N values in recent agricultural recharge were distinctly different from those in old recharge (>50 years) that may represent natural conditions ( Figure 3 ). Thus, fertilizer is considered to be the most likely source of large NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in agricultural recharge in both study areas. The sample of York agricultural recharge with the largest NO 3 \u00c0 concentration (well NWT1 in Figure 3) , however, had a d 15 N value of 10.4%, more characteristic of an animal waste source, and was located downgradient from a former manure-spreading area, so animal waste sources may be locally important in that agricultural area.\n[17] On average, the dated ground water records indicate that NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in agricultural recharge at Modesto and York increased by about 11.5 and 14.5 mg/L as N, respectively, from before 1950 to 1995 (Figure 4) . The increases in NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations could be related to the temporal increase in farm fertilizer applications over the past $50 years if the equivalent of about 40 to 50% of the applied N was nitrified and leached to the water table (Figure 4 ). Similar temporal trends and leaching fractions have been reported for agricultural recharge in other areas in the United States [Hallberg, 1986; B\u00f6hlke and Denver, 1995; B\u00f6hlke et al., 2002 B\u00f6hlke et al., , 2007 Howarth et al., 2002; McMahon et al., 2006] ."}, {"section_title": "Urban Sources of Nitrate", "text": "[18] Median NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in urban recharge at the four sites ranged from 1.14 mg/L as N at Woodbury to 22.5 mg/L as N at York ( [Kreitler, 1975; Heaton, 1986; McMahon and B\u00f6hlke, 1996] . The most likely sources of animal waste N at the York urban area are septic systems and perhaps leaking sanitary sewer lines. Tampa ( Figure 3 ) are more consistent with NO 3 \u00c0 derived from atmospheric deposition, natural soil N, or fertilizer N than with an animal waste source. It is not likely that atmospheric deposition in the absence of substantial evaporative concentration could produce NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations larger than 1 to 2 mg/L as N in any of the study areas based on total inorganic N concentrations in wet deposition from nearby NADP sites (National Atmospheric Deposition Program, 2006 , available at http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/sites/ ntnmap.asp?), average values of which ranged from 0.21 to 0.83 mg/L as N. Likewise, the small NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in old recharge at Modesto and Tampa (Figures 3 and 4) indicate that soil N probably was not a source for the largest NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in urban recharge in those two areas. Hence, fertilizer probably was a more important source of large NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations than soil N at Modesto and Tampa. The Modesto urban monitoring well with the largest NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations (well SC in Figure 3) , however, was located in an unsewered part of the city. Thus, it is possible that septic leachate also was an important source of large NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in Modesto urban recharge. . Initial nitrate concentrations in recharge in relation to recharge year. Where necessary, initial concentrations were obtained by correcting measured concentrations for denitrification effects produced in the aquifer (see Text S1 for details). Apparent groundwater ages were determined using CFC, SF 6 , and\nHe data. Samples containing <0.5 TU of 3 H were assigned recharge dates of $1900; however, some samples could be older on the basis of particle ages and 14 C data, or slightly younger (but prior to $1950). The solid lines represent nitrate concentrations that would occur in agricultural or urban recharge for the indicated recharge rates and fractions of applied nitrogen leached to the water table. Nitrogen applications were based on county-level data from Ruddy et al. [2006] . Farm fertilizer applications were normalized to total cropland in the county (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Census of agriculture: National Agricultural Statistics Service, variously dated, http://www.nass.usda.gov/Census_of_Agriculture/ index.asp). Atmospheric nitrogen deposition is for wet deposition of nitrate and ammonium [Ruddy et al., 2006] . MCL is Maximum Contaminant Level.\narea. Nitrate concentrations in forest recharge in Connecticut and other northeastern States typically are less than 1 mg/L as N (Figure 4 ) [Grady and Mullaney, 1998; Mayer et al., 2002] , so soil N was not a likely source of the large NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in recharge. The Woodbury sample with the largest NO 3 \u00c0 concentration (well WY90 in Figure  3 ) was located downgradient from residential septic systems and had a d 15 N value (9.5%) that is consistent with a septic source of N. The Woodbury sample with the second largest NO 3 \u00c0 concentration (well WY79 in Figure 3 ) had a d 15 N value (3.9%) that is more consistent with a fertilizer source of N.\n[21] Nitrate concentrations in urban recharge at Tampa could be from nonfarm fertilizer applications and atmospheric N deposition if the equivalent of $50% of that N was nitrified and leached to the water table (Figure 4 ). In the case of Woodbury, the available data indicate that nonfarm fertilizer and atmospheric N deposition could not account for most of the large NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in urban recharge, even if 100% of that N leached to the water table. This apparent discrepancy probably could be resolved if NO 3 \u00c0 loading from septic systems in that area was accounted for. Septic systems are the primary waste disposal system used in that community."}, {"section_title": "Nitrate Recharge Fluxes", "text": "[22] Sources of NO 3 \u00c0 in the areas contributing recharge to the PSW were diverse and appear to have included farm and nonfarm fertilizers, septic leachate or leaking sewer lines, manure spreading, atmospheric deposition, and natural soil N. Nitrate fluxes to the water table depended on the strength of those sources and recharge rates. Nitrate recharge fluxes were calculated using NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in recharge and water balance estimates of recharge (Table 2) . Variability in the flux estimates probably represents spatial and temporal variations in NO 3 \u00c0 inputs and recharge rates (Figures 3 and  4) . Median NO 3 \u00c0 recharge fluxes under agricultural land (33 to 69 kg N/ha-year) were larger than those under urban land (7.4 to 16 kg N/ha-year) ( Table 2 ). The agricultural NO 3 \u00c0 fluxes were similar to or larger than agricultural NO 3 \u00c0 fluxes determined similarly in Minnesota, Maryland, and Nebraska (32 to 46 kg N/ha-year) [B\u00f6hlke and Denver, 1995; B\u00f6hlke et al., 2002 B\u00f6hlke et al., , 2007 , and the largest urban NO 3 \u00c0 flux was similar to the NO 3 \u00c0 flux under Nottingham, England (21 kg N/ha-year) [Wakida and Lerner, 2005] . Although the NO 3 \u00c0 recharge fluxes reported here are only approximations, they imply that agricultural sources produced larger NO 3 \u00c0 loads to ground water than urban sources. From the standpoint of minimizing NO 3 \u00c0 contamination in PSW, these findings indicate that it would be beneficial to reduce PSW capture zone areas in agricultural regions. In urban settings, consideration should be given to understanding the distribution of septic systems and leaking sewer lines in PSW capture zones."}, {"section_title": "Nitrate Transport 4.2.1. Terminal Electron-Accepting Processes", "text": "[23] Concentrations of O 2 in water from the aquifers at Modesto and Woodbury were mostly !0.5 mg/L, whereas waters containing <0.5 mg/L O 2 were more widespread in the aquifers at York and Tampa. For NO 3 \u00c0 transport, the transition zone between oxic and anoxic conditions in an aquifer is important because that is generally where microbially mediated nitrate reduction begins [Korom, 1992] . Chapelle et al. [1995] proposed an O 2 concentration of 0.5 mg/L as the threshold at which NO 3 \u00c0 reduction begins, but onset of NO 3 \u00c0 reduction has been reported in aquifers where field measurements of O 2 concentrations were of the order of 1 -2 mg/L McMahon et al., 2004; B\u00f6hlke et al., 2007] . In this study, oxic waters are operationally defined by O 2 ! 0.5 mg/L. Data from all the sites show that excess N 2 concentrations were significantly smaller in samples containing !0.5 mg/L O 2 (average of 0.6 mg N/L) than in samples containing <0.5 mg/L O 2 (average of 1.7 mg N/L) (p = 0.002, Mann-Whitney test).\n[24] The selected PSW at Modesto and Woodbury were screened in oxic zones (Figure 2) . The general absence of anoxic conditions in the aquifers at Modesto and Woodbury indicates that NO 3 \u00c0 was likely to persist as it was transported along flow paths from recharge areas to those PSW. At York, the transition zone between oxic and anoxic conditions was located in the clayey till confining unit between the base of the unconfined sand and the top of the upper confined sand (Figure 2 ). At Tampa, the transition zone was located near the top of the Floridan aquifer system, just a few meters below the water table, and probably is related to the downward fining of sediment texture in the surficial deposits. The selected PSW at York and Tampa were screened below the redox transition zones, indicating that NO 3 \u00c0 was likely to be at least partially reduced as it was transported along flow paths from recharge areas to those PSW.\n[25] Vertical profiles of redox-sensitive species at York and Tampa show that concentrations of excess N 2 increased with depth below the water table as concentrations of O 2 decreased ( Figure 5 ), indicating that reduction of NO 3 \u00c0 did occur along flow paths leading to the producing intervals in which those PSW were screened. Median denitrification reaction progress in the PWS production zones ranged from 0 to 94 percent (Figure 6 ), with the greatest progress occurring in the aquifers at York and Tampa. The presence of elevated Fe 2+ , H 2 S, and CH 4 concentrations indicate that anoxic zones at York and Tampa progressed beyond denitrification to Fe(III) reduction, SO 4 2\u00c0 reduction, and methanogenesis ( Figure 5 )."}, {"section_title": "Isotopic Evidence for Denitrification", "text": "[26] The N and O isotopes of NO 3 \u00c0 in oxic water samples, which included almost all of the samples from Modesto and Woodbury, exhibited little or no evidence of fractionation (Figure 7) . At York and Tampa, N and O isotopes in anoxic water are positively correlated and resemble fractionation trends that have been reported for denitrification [e.g., B\u00f6ttcher et al., 1990; Aravena and Robertson, 1998; Mengis et al., 1999; Fukada et al., 2003; Sigman et al., 2005] \u00c0 and excess N 2 plotted relative to denitrification reaction progress are qualitatively consistent with fractionations expected for denitrification (Figure 6 ). The apparent enrichment factors (e) that would be consistent with the data are approximately \u00c010 to \u00c02%. These apparent e are variable and generally smaller than those determined experimentally for denitrification (about \u00c030 to \u00c020%) but within the range of possibilities in heterogeneous ground water systems [e.g., Mariotti et al., 1988] ."}, {"section_title": "Rates of Oxygen Reduction and Denitrification in Unconfined Sands", "text": "[28] The presence of relatively large O 2 concentrations in water from the Turlock Lake and Riverbank Formations in Modesto, unconfined sand in York, glacial drift in Woodbury, and surficial sand in Tampa (Figure 2 ) indicate that those coarse sediments could represent thick reaction zones where O 2 reduction and denitrification occur gradually. Thus, equations (1) and (2) were used to describe the reaction kinetics. Results for both kinetic models (zeroorder and first-order) are presented in Table 3 for comparison with other data, although it is uncertain whether either of these is the correct model because of sparse data in the reaction zone. The following comparative discussion focuses on the first-order rate constants, k.\n[29] Rate constants for O 2 reduction at York, Woodbury, and Tampa were roughly similar and ranged from 0.02 to 1/ a (Figure 8) . The values at those sites are similar to O 2 reduction rate constants reported for fluvial (0.1/a) and glaciofluvial (0.13/a) sands in Nebraska and Minnesota, respectively [B\u00f6hlke et al., , 2007 . The largest rate constant at Modesto, 0.03/a, was at the low end of values at the other sites. Rate constants for O 2 reduction in the study areas have important implications with respect to lag times for the start of denitrification.\n[30] Excess N 2 was present in small concentrations (0.3 to 1.8 mg/L as N) in the aquifer at Modesto and the concentrations systematically increased with depth at multiple well nests, indicating that small amounts of denitrification occurred in the aquifer even though it was generally oxic. All of the samples with detectable excess N 2 had apparent ground water ages !40 years (Figure 8) , indicating a lag time of possibly several decades before the onset of denitrification. Such a long lag time may be related to the relatively small rate constants for O 2 reduction at that site. Much longer lag times prior to denitrification have been reported elsewhere (e.g., $3,000 -10,000 years [Vogel et al., 1981; McMahon et al., 2004] ). Values of ln(C/C o ) plotted in relation to ground water age correspond to a maximum k of 0.02/a at Modesto (Figure 8) , assuming a lag time of $30 years after recharge before the onset of denitrification. This lag time corresponds to the oldest sampled water at Modesto that did not contain detectable excess N 2 (Figure 8 ). This analysis is limited by the fact that the most denitrified samples, which were the deepest samples in their respective well nests, were too old to be dated with the available tracers and so were omitted from the analysis. One possible explanation for denitrification in this oxic flow system is that it occurred in association with abundant sand/clay contacts in the aquifer. Clay and silt comprise about 50% of the sediments in this aquifer. Despite the apparent occurrence of denitrification in the Central Valley aquifer, its rate was sufficiently slow to allow 95%, on average, of the NO 3 \u00c0 originally present in modern recharge to persist along the sampled flow paths.\n[31] For the most part, excess N 2 was not detected in the unconfined, sandy sediments at the other three sites (Figure 8) , indicating a general lack of denitrification in those settings even though O 2 reduction rate constants were larger there than at Modesto (Table 3) . Larger O 2 reduction rate constants presumably would produce anoxic conditions more quickly at those sites than at Modesto. At Woodbury and Tampa, the apparent lack of denitrification could result from the short residence time (roughly <10 years) of water in those sandy sediments (Figure 8 ). Ground water residence times in the unconfined sand in York were as long as those at Modesto but systematic increases in excess N 2 with depth were not detected at York like they were at Modesto. The reason for this difference between the two sites is not clear, but it could be related to the smaller clay content in the sediment at York compared to Modesto if the clays contain more organic carbon to support denitrification than sands [McMahon et al., 1999] .\n[32] Denitrification could be locally important in the unconfined sands at York, Woodbury, and Tampa, in places where lag times may be considerably shorter. For example, water from well OFPS-38 at York (Figure 8 ), which is located in the floodplain of a small stream, contained no detectable O 2 , 5.7 mg/L of excess N 2 -N and elevated concentrations of Fe 2+ and CH 4 . The apparent age of that water was about 20 years, but denitrification is likely to have begun soon after recharge in the anoxic floodplain sediments."}, {"section_title": "Rates of Oxygen Reduction and Denitrification in Clay Confining Units", "text": "[33] The presence of relatively small O 2 concentrations in the clayey till at York and sandy clay above limestone at Tampa (Figure 2) indicate that those sediments could represent thin reaction zones where O 2 reduction and denitrification occur rapidly. Thus, equations (3) and (4) were used to describe the reaction kinetics. At York, the modeled denitrification zone was the top of the clayey till confining unit at well site FP5, which was a transition zone from oxic to anoxic conditions at that site (Figure 2 ). At Tampa, the modeled zone was the top of the sandy clay at well site 113RC, which was the transition zone from oxic to anoxic conditions at that site (Figure 2) .\n[34] Nitrate concentrations in the sediment pore waters at both sites decreased with depth, implying that denitrification may have occurred (Figure 9 ). Other evidence for denitrification in those pore waters included fractionation of N and O isotopes in residual NO 3 \u00c0 , accumulation of excess N 2 , and (or) a decrease in NO 3 \u00c0 /Cl \u00c0 ratios with depth. The decrease in NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations with depth at both sites appears to be better represented by the models with first-order reaction kinetics than the ones with zeroorder kinetics (Figure 9 ). In these instances, k ranged from 0.1 to 6/a at York and from 0.1 to 0.5/a at Tampa. These rate constants are considerably larger than those from the Modesto and Woodbury sandy sediments (Table 3) , which lack laterally extensive confining layers. Thus, the confining layers at York and Tampa are considered to be more effective reactive barriers to NO 3 \u00c0 transport than isolated denitrifying zones that might be present in the unconfined sands at Modesto and Woodbury. Furthermore, Fe(III)-reducing, SO 4 2\u00c0 -reducing, and methanogenic conditions deeper in the aquifers at York and Tampa ( Figure 5 ) imply that NO 3 \u00c0 transported below the confining layers would not persist under natural conditions.\n[35] The spatial distribution of denitrifying zones in the aquifers at York and Tampa differed markedly from the spatial distribution of denitrifying zones in a shallow sand aquifer at Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Bowen et al. [2007] reported that denitrification was focused near the shallow water table in that aquifer because the source of electrons for denitrification was DOC leached from the soil zone. At York and Tampa, the electron donors for denitrification had geologic sources deeper in the flow system. Thus, there was a $5-to 40-year lag time prior to the onset of denitrification as ground water traveled through the O 2 reduction zone near the water table."}, {"section_title": "Nitrate Attenuation Efficiency", "text": "[36] The concentration of NO 3 \u00c0 eventually entering PSW screens depends in part on denitrification rates and ground water velocities along all flow paths leading to the PSW. Figure 9 . Range of apparent rates (R) and rate constants (k), assuming zero-and first-order kinetics, respectively, for denitrification in confining units in the High Plains and Floridan aquifer systems. Core was collected from site FP5 near York and from site 113RC near Tampa. Values of R and k were estimated by comparing analytical solutions to the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation with degradation (equations (3) and (4) in text) to the vertical nitrate concentration profiles.\nNitrate concentrations should be relatively small where denitrification rates outpace velocities and relatively large where velocities outpace rates. Denitrification rate constants and average ground water velocities in denitrifying zones were used as a framework for comparing NO 3 \u00c0 attenuation efficiency, defined as k/v, in the aquifers (Figure 10 ). The attenuation efficiencies essentially represent fractional NO 3 \u00c0 losses from denitrification per unit distance of transport. General patterns in the NO 3 \u00c0 attenuation efficiencies appear to be related to sedimentary depositional environment; attenuation efficiencies increased as follows: fluvial sand aquifers < glacial sand aquifers < glacial/marine clay < marine shale. Various uncertainties are associated with the NO 3 \u00c0 attenuation efficiencies defined here, such as representative sampling of the reactive zone, ability to date ground water at appropriate timescales, and NO 3 \u00c0 transport limitations on denitrification. Nevertheless, this approach could provide a useful framework for comparing aquifer susceptibility to NO 3 \u00c0 contamination."}, {"section_title": "Nitrate Receptors 4.3.1. Nitrate Concentrations in Public Supply Wells", "text": "[37] Measured NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in the PSW composite (wellhead) and depth-dependent samples ranged from <0.06 to 9.7 mg/L as N (Figure 11 ). The largest measured NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations (4.4 to 9.7 mg/L as N) occurred in samples from the Modesto PSW, and the smallest concentrations (<0.06 to 0.47 mg/L as N) occurred in samples from the York PSW. Denitrification apparently did not reduce any NO 3 \u00c0 to N 2 in water captured by the Modesto and Woodbury PSW (Figure 11 ), whereas it reduced about 60 to 95%, on average, of the NO 3 \u00c0 in water captured by the Tampa and York PSW, respectively.\n[38] Reconstructed initial NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations (indicated by the sum of NO 3 \u00c0 -N + excess N 2 -N concentrations in Figure 11 ) exhibited substantial variability with depth in the well screens at Modesto and York. At Tampa, the lower third of the well intercepted a high-permeability conduit [Katz et al., 2007] (represented by the 49-m sample) that may have dominated the chemistry of shallower depthdependent samples. The short screen in the Woodbury PSW (Figure 2 ) precluded the collection of depth-dependent samples from that well. Initial NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in samples from the Modesto and York PSW were not consistently larger than those from the Tampa and Woodbury PSW even though NO 3 \u00c0 fluxes to the water table at Modesto and York were larger than those at the other two sites ( Table 2 ), indicating that water entering the PSW probably contained NO 3 \u00c0 from multiple sources and (or) water of multiple ages."}, {"section_title": "Mixing in Public Supply Wells", "text": "[39] According to the MODPATH analysis, water from most of the PSW consisted of a broad distribution of agesspanning <20 years at Woodbury to >1000 years at Modesto and York (Figure 12a ). Contributions of <50-year-old water to flow in the PSW ranged from about 30% at York to 100% at Woodbury (Figure 12a ). The <50-year-old fraction of these distributions is important because it contained the largest NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations (Figure 4 ) and the >50-year-old fraction is important because it could dilute anthropogenic NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations when waters of different age mixed in the PSW. Young ground water also is important because it could indicate limited denitrification potential in flow systems with long denitrification lag times (Table 3) . For example, the single largest annual age fraction of water entering the Modesto PSW was about 25 years old (Figure 12b) , which is shorter than the 30-year denitrification lag time at that site (Table 3) . Thus, NO 3 \u00c0 in that young fraction of water is less likely to have been denitrified compared to NO 3 \u00c0 in older fractions of water.\n[40] All of the PSW samples contained some anthropogenic NO 3 \u00c0 on the basis of mixing calculations in which initial NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations and isotope compositions in recharge were used to define possible mixing end members (Figure 3) . Most of the Modesto PSW samples plot along mixing lines defined by old recharge and contaminated modern urban (well SC) or agricultural (well FPD-1) recharge. Twenty to 55% of the water in the composite samples (and 55 to 85% of the NO 3 \u00c0 ) may have been derived from urban sources such as septic leachate (as represented by SC). Alternatively, 15 to 30% of the water in the composite samples (50 to 75% of the NO 3 \u00c0 ) may have been derived from agricultural sources such as irrigation return flow containing fertilizer N (as represented by FPD-1). It also is possible that the composite samples contained NO 3 \u00c0 from both anthropogenic sources. The remaining NO 3 \u00c0 presumably was from old, possibly natural, sources. These fractions of modern anthropogenic recharge in the Modesto PSW samples are roughly consistent with the simulated fraction of <50-year-old water entering the Modesto PSW (Figure 12a ).\n[41] Old recharge (>50 years) apparently was not present in the aquifer at Woodbury, but recharge through forest soils in New England generally contains small NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations (<1 mg/L as N) [Grady and Mullaney, 1998; Mayer et al., 2002] . The Woodbury PSW samples plot along a mixing line defined by hypothetical forest recharge and contaminated urban recharge (WY90) (Figure 3 ), indicating that only about 10% of the water in those composite samples (but 75% of the NO 3 \u00c0 ) may have been derived from urban sources such as septic leachate (as represented by WY90). The composite samples do not plot near the mixing line defined by well WY79 (Figure 3) , which may contain NO 3 \u00c0 from a fertilizer source.\n[42] The York PSW samples generally plot along mixing lines defined by old recharge and two urban end members (wells FP1-63 and FP3-33 in Figure 3 ), such that 25% of the water in the composite sample (60% of the NO 3 \u00c0 ) may have been derived from urban sources such as septic leachate (as defined by FP1-63). These results are consistent with particle-tracking simulations for the York PSW, which showed that about 30% of the water entering the well was <50 years old (Figure 12a ).\n[43] At Tampa, the most likely recharge end members containing small NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations were old recharge and Figure 12c , k refers to the first-order denitrification rate constant within a zone of active denitrification (ranges of values indicate uncertainty of the estimations). Along each flow path, the value of k was zero before the onset of denitrification. It was assumed that the rate constants measured in the overlying confining layers were representative of the rate constants in the underlying sediments.\nmodern recharge from wetlands/rivers. The 15 N composition of those types of waters could not be analyzed because of their small NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations and (or) small amounts of excess N 2 . Nevertheless, the initial NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations and isotopic compositions in Tampa PSW samples indicate that a substantial fraction of NO 3 \u00c0 in those samples probably was derived from urban sources like fertilizer (Figure 3) . 4.3.3. Short-Circuiting Pathways at York and Tampa\n[44] The York PSW produced waters that were recharged with 2.0 to 8.8 mg/L NO 3 \u00c0 as N (Figure 11 ), whereas four of seven monitoring wells in that interval produced water that was recharged with <2 mg/L NO 3 \u00c0 as N and 6 of 8 wells contained <1 TU 3 H. Such data indicate that much of the confined part of the High Plains aquifer may have contained old water that was recharged with substantially less NO 3 \u00c0 than water captured by the PSW. The youngest particle age for water moving downward through the confining unit by advection was about 60 years, further suggesting that under natural flow conditions the confined aquifer should not have contained modern, high-NO 3 \u00c0 water. Clark et al. [2007] proposed that the occurrence of modern recharge in the confined aquifer resulted from downward leakage of water through wells screened in multiple geologic layers and through the annular space of well bores that penetrated the confining layer, essentially bypassing the confining unit. If that interpretation is correct, the leakage probably did not occur at the PSW itself because the deepest depth-dependent samples contained the largest initial NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations (Figure 11 ). It is more likely that leakage between aquifers occurred at upgradient locations in the PSW capture zone through high-permeability features such as irrigation wells. Even though NO 3 \u00c0 -rich water may have either partially or fully bypassed the denitrifying zone in the confining unit, about 95% of the initial NO 3 \u00c0 in water captured by the PSW was removed by denitrification ( Figure 11 ). Thus, it appears that denitrification must have occurred within the confined sand where highly reducing conditions naturally existed (Figure 5a ).\n[45] As at York, waters from the Tampa PSW contained substantially larger initial NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations than several monitoring wells screened in the same producing interval. The PSW samples were recharged with about 4 mg/L NO 3 \u00c0 (Figure 11 ), whereas 7 of 12 monitoring wells in that interval produced water that was recharged with <1 mg/L NO 3 \u00c0 as N, and 6 of 10 wells contained <1 TU 3 H. The high-permeability conduit at a depth of about 49 m that was intercepted by the PSW apparently was connected to the surficial aquifer allowing for the rapid movement of modern recharge to the PSW. Katz et al. [2007] estimated that 50 to 70% of the water produced from the PSW was from the surficial sand aquifer, rather than the Floridan aquifer, on the basis of chemical mass balance calculations. Those chemical results are consistent with the particle-tracking results (which accounted for conduit flow) that showed the PSW capturing a large fraction of very recent recharge (Figures 12a and 12b) . Conduit flow such as this could bypass the denitrifying zone at the top of the Floridan aquifer and also reduce reaction time in the underlying carbonate sediments which were highly reducing ( Figure 5b) . All of these factors may explain why the PSW contained detectable NO 3 \u00c0 but most monitoring wells in the same interval did not (Figure 3 )."}, {"section_title": "Nitrate Age Distributions in Public Supply Wells", "text": "[46] Denitrification rates, spatial distribution of redox conditions, and time spent by water in different redox zones strongly influenced the fractions of initial NO 3 \u00c0 remaining in different age fractions of water captured by the PSW. The combined effect of these factors resulted in very different relations between NO 3 \u00c0 losses and particle ages in the different study areas (Figure 12c ). Because first-order reaction kinetics was assumed, the fractional NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations in Figure 12c are independent of specific NO 3 \u00c0 input histories. At all of the sites except for Woodbury, denitrification had the potential to substantially reduce initial NO 3 \u00c0 concentrations if there was sufficient ground water residence time in the denitrifying zones. Well construction or management practices that reduce water residence time in those zones, such as screening across confining layers, do not take full advantage of the natural NO 3 \u00c0 attenuation capacity of the aquifer system. Sites like Woodbury do not have substantial NO 3 \u00c0 attenuation capacity, but the short ground water residence times indicate that those types of systems would be relatively responsive to land use changes designed to reduce NO 3 \u00c0 fluxes to the water table. These results illustrate that PSW vulnerability to NO 3 \u00c0 contamination depends on complex variations and interactions between contaminant sources, reaction rates, transit times, mixing and perturbation of ground water flow in contrasting hydrogeologic settings."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "[47] Understanding factors controlling the source and transport of NO 3 \u00c0 to public supply wells (PSW) is challenging because of complex areas contributing recharge to the wells, spatial and temporal variability in NO 3 \u00c0 sources within the contributing areas, spatially variable denitrification rates along flow paths leading to the wells, mixing, and possible perturbations in the flow system caused by well construction and (or) operation. Systematic studies of NO 3 \u00c0 movement to PSW in four diverse hydrogeologic environments showed that NO 3 \u00c0 in PSW was derived from varying proportions of agricultural (fertilizer, manure spreading), urban (septic leachate, fertilizer), and natural sources. Nitrate fluxes to the water table were larger in agricultural settings than in urban settings, indicating the PSW capture zones should be designed to limit inputs from agricultural sources. Denitrification in the aquifers was characterized by either slow rates in broad reaction zones within sandy fluvial and alluvial fan deposits or by fast rates in thin reaction zones at clay/sand contacts of glacial and marine deposits. In undisturbed flow systems, denitrification in the thin reaction zones provided more protection against NO 3 \u00c0 contamination than the broad reaction zones. However, well construction and (or) operational features caused high-NO 3 \u00c0 water in two study areas to partially bypass or move more quickly through the denitrifying zones. In one sand aquifer, shallow NO 3 \u00c0 -contaminated water bypassed the thin reaction zone and entered the producing interval of the PSW by moving down in local high-permeability features such as long well screens of nearby irrigation wells. In one carbonate aquifer, shallow NO 3 \u00c0 -contaminated water bypassed the thin reaction zone and entered the producing interval of the PSW by moving through a high-permeability conduit. Consideration should be given to constructing and manag-ing PSW to minimize bypass of denitrifying zones to take full advantage of the natural NO 3 \u00c0 attenuation capacity of aquifer sediments."}]
