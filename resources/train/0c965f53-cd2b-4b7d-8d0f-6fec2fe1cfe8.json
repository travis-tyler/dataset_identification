However, there is a lack of study of mothers with children <3 years of age participating in Early Intervention (EI) programs. This study aims to more fully describe the extent of mood disorders in these mothers including estimated prevalence, severity and factors associated with maternal mental health, using gold standard clinical diagnostic and symptom measures, and test models associating depressive symptoms with contextual factors and child behavior. Methods A crosssectional study was conducted with 106 women who had at least one child enrolled in EI. Mothers were interviewed and completed reliable, valid measures to evaluate mental health, health status, family conflict, parent-child interaction, self-efficacy, social support, child behavioral with the child (Ciciolla et al. 2014; Shonkoff et al. 1992) . Data amassed over 30 years of study have shown that typically-developing infants and toddlers whose mothers have depressive symptoms show more language and global developmental delays, more negative affect, less sustained attention, overly high activity levels, and more non-compliance and tantrums than children of non-symptomatic mothers (Turney 2012) . These suboptimal developmental outcomes have been linked to the toll that depressive symptoms take on the capability of mothers to consistently respond to the cues of the child and provide appropriate and sensitive responses (Lovejoy et al. 2000; Wheeler et al. 2007) .\nGreater maternal psychological distress has been linked to less use of effective parenting strategies in response to challenging child temperaments and behaviors (Jones et al. 2001) . Infants and toddlers of depressed mothers receive fewer intensive enrichment services (Siqveland et al. 2013) . For these reasons, mothers with depressive symptoms may have difficulty implementing routines-based interventions, the effectiveness of which relies on interpreting the cues of the child, responding accurately, managing challenging behaviors and maintaining consistency. Two reviews Singer 2006) in the last decade have suggested that approximately a third of mothers of children with disabilities experience significant depressive symptoms during their lifetime; a significantly higher rate than is seen in the general population of women or in mothers of typically developing children. However, both of these reviews reflect a striking lack of studies examining depressive symptoms in mothers of very young children with disabilities, and, as far as we can tell, there has been only one study that has examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms among mothers of children in EI (Feinberg et al. 2012) . This study, which used data from self-report measures collected through the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth cohort (ECLS-B), found that 35 % of mothers of children in EI were experiencing significant depressive symptoms when their children were 2 years old. There were significantly less severe depressive symptoms among mothers whose child received a diagnosis at birth, compared to those whose eligibility for EI came later, suggesting time since diagnosis and/or variables related to the nature of the child's disability (e.g., behavioral issues, severity of delay) may have a greater impact on depressive symptoms than eligibility for EI per se. This study suggests that a substantial subset of women whose children are enrolled in EI are experiencing significant depressive symptoms, which are likely to interfere with their ability to carry out routinesbased EI interventions. However, while the Feinberg et al. (2012) study provides important insight into the prevalence of depressive symptoms among mothers of children in EI, the reliance on parental self-report-necessary for large longitudinal studies such as the ECLS-B-significantly limits"}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Early Intervention (EI) services in the US are provided to 336,895 children less than 3 years of age at a cost of more than $438.5 million annually (Center for Parent Information and Resources 2015). Eligibility criteria for EI services includes a documented developmental delay (cognitive, physical, communication, social-emotional and/or adaptive delay) or established condition with a high probability of developmental delay or disability (e.g., premature birth). EI provides evaluation and ongoing assessments, service coordination, an Individualized F amily Service Plan (IF SP), access to interventions and support services to improve the child's function, and training for the mother and family (Hebbeler et al. 2007) . EI is designed to help caregivers accurately assess the abilities of the child and increase parenting efficacy to improve outcomes for the child.\nEI teaches routines-based intervention, a parent-mediated approach in which parents (most often mothers) integrate specific developmentally supportive activities outlined on the IFSP (The National Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center 2015) into the family's normal routines. Optimally, these activities are implemented throughout the day, every day providing continuous therapeutic input that complements therapy provided by specialists. By improving the child's functional capacity in ways that parents can see, routines-based intervention averts behavioral problems and improves the quality of everyday life (Spagnola and Fiese 2007) . Because of the emphasis on parent-mediated, routines-based intervention, the beneficial effect of EI is largely dependent on whether parents can provide consistent, developmentally supportive interactions with the child.\nDepressive symptoms may undermine uptake and efficacy of EI services by interfering with maternal interactions Institutional Review Board approval, EI agency staff provided information about the study, contact information and a self-addressed, stamped envelope to mail a \"Permission to Contact\" form to mothers.

During the data collection visit, mothers provided written consent for project staff to audit pre-specified elements of the child's EI service record.

Using a gold standard assessment measure (M.I.N.I.) and stringent diagnostic criteria for current MDE (in the past month), we found the percentage of mothers who met criteria was 8 %, and was no higher than the general US adult 12-month prevalence rate (8.3 %; Bromet et al. 2011 ). However, when we included mothers who met 5 of 9 depressive symptom criteria in the past month, as required by the DSM-V and similar to methodology used by Ko et al. (2012) , the prevalence of MDE in the past month increased to 15 %, which is higher than the 10.9 % rate found among U.S. women of reproductive age in a 12 month period (Ko et al. 2012 ). Moreover, a third (34 %) of mothers reported experiencing current symptoms significant enough to warrant clinical concern (CES-D \u2265 16). This was much higher than the (14 %) rate found using self-report in a nationally representative sample of women in the U.S. of reproductive age (Farr et al. 2010) . Over half of the sample met diagnostic criteria for one or more episodes of major depression, mania or hypomania over their lifetime and more than a quarter of the sample experienced comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. This is in contrast to previous reports Singer 2006 ) that estimated lifetime episodes of depression at approximately 33 %. This is the first study to report rates of suicidal ideation among mothers of children in EI. It is concerning that over a quarter of mothers in this sample indicated some degree of suicidal ideation in the past month (see Table 3 for description), and speaks to the critical importance of having high quality screening measures in place for these families and expanded mental health supports for parents who do not meet criteria for treatment in the current mental health system. These rates are slightly higher than the 2 \u2212 15 % reported among mothers postpartum (Lindahl et al. 2005) and closer to the 19-30 % estimates reported among women who screen positive for depressive symptoms postpartum (Wisner et al. 2013) .\nWe found a previous episode of depression was the strongest predictor of current depression even after controlling for the severity of the child's disability and other stressors known to have a relationship with depression (Singer 2006) . Previous research has suggested that child behavior problems may be the strongest predictor of maternal outcomes ), but many of these studies did not examine maternal mental health history. Mothers with a history of depression and/or mood disorders may be especially vulnerable if they have a child with developmental or behavioral problems. One simple question, \"have you ever been depressed?\" could help EI providers (or referring pediatric reported recent engagement in counseling, group therapy or other mental health services. Only 15 % reported both recent pharmacological and therapy mental health services.\nAs moderate to severe depressive symptoms impair maternal responsiveness, we were interested in the presence of depressive symptoms that did not meet diagnostic threshold for MDE. Using the CES-D to assess current depressive symptom severity, approximately 34 % of mothers screened at or over a CES-D score of 16. Of these mothers, 13 met all diagnostic criteria for MDE on the M.I.N.I. except endorsement of functional impairment. In summary, 57 % of the sample either met criteria for MDE, reported significant symptoms that fell short of a formal diagnosis or had elevated symptom severity levels on the CES-D (see Table 3 )."}, {"section_title": "Factors Associated with Maternal Depressive Symptoms", "text": "Past episode of depression, family conflict, child behavior problems, maternal self-efficacy, social support, maternal health, monthly household income, perceived hardship and perceived endangerment were entered in a linear regression model predicting severity of current depressive symptoms. The correlations of the variables are shown in Table 4 . The prediction model was statistically significant, F(10, 86) = 6.97, p < 0.001 and accounted for 45 % of the variance in current depression severity (R 2 = 0.45, Adjusted R 2 = 0.38). Current depression severity was primarily predicted by more problematic child behaviors (\u03b2 = 0.27, p < 0.01), lower self-efficacy (\u03b2 = \u22120.21, p = 0.01), poorer maternal health status (\u03b2 = 0.22, p = 0.03), and past MDE (\u03b2 = 0.18, p = 0.04).

The study purposely recruited mothers whose child was referred to EI before knowing a cause or whether the delay was transient or pervasive. Positive changes in the child's development, or conversely, the emergence of a more serious diagnosis could affect the course of maternal depressive symptoms and thus, longitudinal studies are needed to observe this trajectory. The convenience sample introduces potential bias in the sample (e.g., severely depressed mothers may have not had the energy to participate), limits generalizability, and was not representative of the demographics of the entire community served by the EI program partner. However, inclusion of mothers who were primarily Spanish speaking as well as the spectrum of social and economic stressors increases generalizability. In this sample, the validated Spanish language GES showed lower reliability than the English language form, potentially suggesting differences in the construct of self-efficacy in this sample. These and other constructs are critical to the understanding of factors important to maternal mental health in EI populations and should be a priority for future studies.\nproviders) recognize maternal mood issues early and provide resources, referrals and support to these mothers. Depressive symptoms can compromise mothers' use of EI services and as such, must be addressed so that EI can optimally benefit the child. EI services can be tailored to meet mothers with depressive symptoms where they are. Tailoring can include accommodating to mothers' shifts in symptoms by relaxing expectations and providing essential supports such as respite care when mothers are not able to function optimally due to depressive symptoms. To help a symptomatic mother use her limited energy efficiently, interventions can focus on those most important to the child's functioning.\nPerception of poorer health status and lower self-efficacy was also a predictor of current depression. Perception of health may be dependent on mood and once available resources have been accessed, improvement may be seen. Low self-efficacy can be increased by the tailoring of interventions and emphasizing successes that may help mothers perceive their ability to help their child. Other approaches that can help build self-efficacy include increasing motivation through techniques such as brief motivational interviewing (Rubak et al. 2005 ) and a flexible approach to routinesbased strategies that encourages the mother to implement them when she has the energy available to implement them. Assisting mothers in accessing treatment for depression, tailoring interventions to meet mothers where they are and setting the stage for success in small increments can make a major difference for the child and the family.\nThese data suggest that maternal history of past MDE, current health and degree of self-efficacy are the important factors to assess when evaluating how to support mothers of children in EI. These factors can be assessed efficiently in the EI setting and providers can be trained to use validated tools such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2; Kroenke et al. 2003) to screen for symptoms. Once a mother is identified to be at risk, it is possible to intervene within the context of EI as described, thus reducing the burden on families and potentially decreasing the need for additional services. More research on the development of specific intervention tools to use in this population is greatly needed. We believe that adding a brief assessment of maternal mood, health and self-efficacy provides important information that can guide how EI providers optimize their time with mothers and children to improve outcomes."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "The study generated descriptive data about depressive symptoms, depression diagnoses and associated mental health diagnoses in mothers of children currently receiving services from EI.
