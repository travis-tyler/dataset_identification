[{"section_title": "LIST OF FIGURES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Bedforms of varying scales are widespread features in sand-dominated shallow marine and estuarine environments. Small to large subaqueous dunes with wavelengths of several meters to several tens of meters (Ashley, 1990), are both ubiquitous and highly dynamic under strong tidal conditions, and can migrate with speeds of up to tens of meters per year (van Dijk and Kleinhans, 2005;Buijsman and Ridderinkhof, 2008). Consequently, the presence of dunes often evokes questions regarding the spatial and temporal stability of the seafloor. Understanding seafloor stability is particularly important in the estuarine and coastal environment, where migrating bedforms have the ability to impact cable and pipeline routes (Morelissen et al., 2003), marine habitats (Daniell et al., 2008), and maintenance of navigable channels (Lindenbergh et al., 2007), and to influence target-detection capabilities (Mayer et al., 2007;Wolfson et al., 2007). In recent years numerous laboratory studies have examined mechanisms of bedform generation and evolution (Hulscher, 1996;Nemeth et al., 2002;Besio et al., 2003;Besio et al., 2004), and other papers have presented methods for predicting bedform morphology and migration (Lesser et al., 2004;Lindenbergh et al., 2007). To determine actual dune migration rates, however, it is necessary to perform repeated surveys of the same area of the seabed. Studies continue to utilize repeated single-beam sonar surveys (Terwindt, 1971;Bokuniewicz et al., 1977;FitzGerald et al., 2000;Kostaschuk and Best, 2005), although major drawbacks of this method are the lack of spatial resolution and difficulty of ensuring that profiles are taken normal to dune crests. The use of repeat multibeam echosounder (MBES) surveys has surged in popularity in recent years (Ernstsen et al., 2005;Ernstsen et al., 2006b;Nittrouer et al., 2008) due to the high resolution and precision of many MBES systems, as well as the ability of MBES to produce bathymetry with full swath coverage. Though use of repeat MBES surveys presents a significant advantage over other techniques, the ability to successfully detect bedform migration from MBES bathymetry depends on the survey resolution and knowledge of positioning uncertainty (Ernstsen et al., 2006a), as well as the surveyrepetition rate. Many bedform-migration studies utilizing MBES rely upon differential GPS (DGPS) for positioning, which is capable of achieving a horizontal positioning uncertainty of several decimeters at the DGPS receiver (Nittrouer et al., 2008). This study presents a novel approach that improves upon existing methods for detecting bedform migration from high-resolution MBES bathymetry, and applies this approach to assess dune migration in a bedform field located near the entrance to Portsmouth Harbor, New Hampshire, USA ( Fig. 1-1). Recent bedform-migration studies have focused on the comparison of sequential bed elevation profiles from MBES bathymetry (Ernstsen et al., 2005;Ernstsen et al., 2006b;Nittrouer et al., 2008); manual definition of minimum-perpendicular-distance between crest positions identified on a bathymetric digital terrain model (DTM) (Knaapen et al., 2005;Daniell et al., 2008); and spatial cross-correlation of a series of DTMs (Duffy and Hughes-Clarke, 2005;Buijsman and Ridderinkhof, 2008;van Dijk and Egberts, 2008). A significant disadvantage of the first method is that it lacks the full spatial resolution inherent in the MBES bathymetry, as migration vectors are defined only along transects. The second method yields better spatial resolution, but is problematic in that bedform migration does not always occur along a direction strictly perpendicular to the dune crests. The third method fully exploits the spatial resolution of the underlying MBES bathymetry and has the added advantage of measuring dune migration over the region in a DTM in which the dune morphology is most highly correlated (Duffy and Hughes-Clarke, 2005  The spatial cross-correlation method of Duffy and Hughes-Clarke (2005) is applied here to binary images (\"ridge maps\") of dune crest locations defined from the MBES bathymetry. Ridge maps are created from the bathymetry using a novel algorithm (BISHNU) inspired by fingerprint detection techniques (Bishnu et al., 2002). The ridge map is a more suitable surface for cross-correlation than the bathymetry or maximumslope surface because it more adequately emphasizes the dune crest, which is the morphologic feature that is principally used in tracking dune migration. Indeed, many studies of bedform migration have focused only on the dune crests rather than the entire bathymetric surface (Knaapen et al., 2005;Daniell et al., 2008;Whitmeyer and FitzGerald, 2008). Repeat MBES surveys utilized for detecting bedform migration in this study were conducted over periods ranging from 6 hours to 7 days, with the intention of capturing the seafloor response to ebb-flood and spring-neap tidal cycles. Other studies have examined bedform dynamics on time-scales of hours to days (Kostaschuk and Best, 2005;Ernstsen et al., 2006b;Nittrouer et al., 2008), although many of these studies are qualitative in nature and few have published bedform-migration rates. With the goal of successfully detecting bedform migrations in the range of several decimeters, this study has implemented positioning from real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS, which is capable of achieving a horizontal positioning uncertainty of several centimeters at the GPS receiver. To provide further context for the observed bedform migration rates and patterns, acoustic current-meter observations were made concurrently with several of the MBES surveys. Bed shear stress was subsequently calculated from the current-meter data to determine whether threshold conditions for initiation of bedload sediment transport were exceeded during the observation period."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 2 PHYSICAL SETTING", "text": "Portsmouth Harbor is located in the lower reaches of the Piscataqua River, which connects Great Bay Estuary of southeastern New Hampshire and southwestern Maine, USA to the Gulf of Maine ( Fig. 1-1). Great Bay Estuary is a bedrock-controlled estuary eroded into a complex assemblage of metasedimentary, metavolcanic and plutonic bedrock ranging in age from 300 to 600 Ma (Ward, 1992). The sedimentary framework of the estuary is heavily influenced by the Quaternary glacial history and associated isostatic and eustatic sea-level change within the Gulf of Maine, and is dominated by glacial tills, stratified ice-contact deposits, glacial-marine muds and sands, and marsh deposits (Belknap et al., 1987;Ward, 1995;Barnhardt et al., 1997;Belknap et al., 2002). The distribution of surficial sediments within the lower estuary has been mapped by Ward (1995;2008). Major surficial-sediment classes include gravel, sandy gravel, gravelly sand, sand, muddy sand and sandy mud ( Fig. 2-1). Gravels and sandy gravels dominate tidal channels within the lower estuary, whereas the shallower areas are dominated by sands, muddy sands and sandy muds (Ward, 1995;2008). Intertidal bedrock is also present along the shallower areas, particularly along the eastern shoreline of New Castle Island and the southern shoreline of Gerrish Island. 70\u00b043'30\"W 70\u00b043'0\"W 70\u00b042'30\"W 70\u00b042'0\"W 70\u00b043'30\"W 70\u00b043'0\"W 70 o 42'30\"W 70\u00b042'0\"W 70\u00b041'30\"W Figure 2-1. Map of surficial sediment classes within the main tidal channel of the Piscataqua River, Portsmouth Harbor, New Hampshire, USA. Modified from Ward (2008). Sediment classes along shoreline (not mapped here) are muds and sandy muds along Seavey Island, and sand, gravelly sand, and sandy gravel within Pepperrell Cove (Ward, 1995 (Short, 1992). Great Bay Estuary comprises a total area of 2409 km 2 , whereas the tidal waters of the estuary cover approximately 44 km 2 with nearly 160 km of shoreline (Reichard and Celikkol, 1978). The lower estuary at Portsmouth Harbor is mesotidal and varies from stratified to moderately well-mixed, depending on freshwater-discharge conditions and the phase of tide (Ward and Bub, 2005). Freshwater discharge into the estuary varies seasonally and is typically 1% or less of the total tidal prism (Bilgili et al., 1996). The range of tide within Great Bay Estuary is greatest at Portsmouth Harbor. The tidal range decreases from Portsmouth Harbor toward Dover Point, and from Dover Point increases slightly toward the mouth of the Squamscott River (Reichard and Celikkol, 1978). The tidal range at Portsmouth Harbor is 3.5 m (\u00b1 0.5 m) under spring tidal conditions and 2 m (\u00b1 0.5 m) under neap tidal conditions (NOAA, 2009). Field programs conducted in 1977 and 2007 have observed flood and ebb tidal currents of up to 1.2 m/s in the vicinity of Fort Point (Swenson et al., 1977;NOAA, 2007). The focus of this study is a bedform field located near the entrance to Portsmouth Harbor ( Fig. 1-1, Fig. 3-1). The bedform field is located on a shallow (12 m deep), sandy bank between the main tidal channel and western shoreline. The bedform field is an elongate feature (900 m by 200 m) with its major axis oriented parallel to the north-south main channel axis of the lowermost Piscataqua River. The bedform field is a persistent feature within Portsmouth Harbor and has been documented by numerous hydrographic surveys since 1992 (Ward, 1995;Huff, 2001;Cutter, 2005;Gostnell, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 3", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "DATA AND METHODS", "text": "New data sets were acquired in order to evaluate bedform migration and bed shear stress within Portsmouth Harbor during 2007 and 2008.

Grainsize analysis was performed using standard sieve and pipette procedures (resolution of 0.5 \u00a7) described by Folk (1980).

Observations were made on 25 and 26 February 2008 from a towed camera system with integrated WAAS-enabled GPS positioning deployed from the UNH R/V Gulf Challenger. The GPS receiver from which positioning data were obtained was mounted on a stanchion on the starboard side of the vessel approximately 1 m before the A-frame. Video footage with superimposed digital overlay containing time-stamp and positioning data was recorded at a rate of 30 frames/s.

Multibeam surveys were conducted again on 3 and 9 July 2008 in order to capture a second neap-spring tidal cycle, as well as to enable the determination of gross morphological change of the seafloor over a period of approximately one year. Each MBES survey was conducted within a one-hour window surrounding predicted slack water in order to record the seafloor in a state of \"rest\" with respect to time-dependent oscillating tidal currents. Multibeam data were acquired with a dual-head Kongsberg EM3002D MBES system installed on the UNH vessel R/V Coastal Surveyor. The dual-head EM3002D operates in the 300-kHz frequency band and contains 320 dynamically focused beams (1.5\u00b0 beamwidth at broadside). Multibeam data were acquired in equiangular beamspacing mode with a user-specified total angular coverage of 120\u00b0. Position, heading, vessel speed and attitude data were acquired with an Applanix POS/MV system with integrated real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS. RTK correctors were broadcast continuously to the R/V Coastal Surveyor receiver from a base station at the Seacoast Science Center, Rye, New Hampshire, located approximately 2 km line-of-sight from the survey area ( Fig. 3-1). The multibeam data were logged using a Kongsberg SIS acquisition platform. Angular and level-arm offset measurements (made prior to each of the 2007 and 2008 survey seasons) were applied to the data in the Kongsberg SIS software, as were correctors for static draft, sound speed through the water column, and sound speed at the transducer face (required for beam steering).

The current meters were positioned near the eastern and western margins of the bedform field to compare current regimes during spring tidal conditions and to determine whether near-bottom currents were capable of initiating bedload sediment transport. Instrumented frames bearing the current meters were deployed from the UNH ADCP and MAVS observations were recorded as northgoing, eastgoing, and vertical current velocities, and were converted to vector-averaged current speed and direction in post-processing using MATLAB software. Correctors for magnetic declination (-15.6\u00b0 in Portsmouth Harbor) were applied to the ADCP data at the time of acquisition, and to the MAVS data in post-processing. An additional corrector was applied to the MAVS data in post-processing to compensate for an inverted compass in the MAVS instrumentation at the time of acquisition, which caused northgoing velocities to be registered as negative rather than positive. A subsequent tank test determined that the switch had no effect on the measurement of eastgoing velocity.\nCurrent observations from the ADCP and MAVS current meters were obtained   "}, {"section_title": "Bed Shear Stress", "text": "Bed shear stress was calculated to determine whether the critical threshold for initiation of sediment motion was exceeded during the current observation period, thus validating bedform migration observed from the multibeam bathymetry. Bed shear stress was evaluated from the ADCP current observations using the log-profile method described by Sherwood et al. (2006) and others (Dyer, 1980;Middleton and Southard, 1984;Huntley, 1988). Additionally, bed shear stress was evaluated from the ADCP and MAVS data using a quadratic shear-stress equation. Results from both methods were compared against the critical bed-shear stress to determine whether the threshold of motion was exceeded during the observation period (3 to 5 July 2008) of near-bottom currents in Portsmouth Harbor.\nBed shear stress was calculated according to the log-fit (LF) method of Sherwood et al. (2006) and a drag coefficient (DC) method (Wright, 1995;Soulsby, 1997) A series of residual plots (Fig. 5-21) were created to test the goodness-of-fit of the LF and DC methods applied to the ADCP data. To create the residual plots, model velocity was computed for each method by applying estimates of z 0 and u* into Equation 3.5. Residual plots were created by subtracting the model velocities U(z)if and U(z)d c from the observed velocity U(z). It is apparent from Figure 5-21 that the LF method yields the best fit to the observed current profiles; the residual barely exceeds 0.06 cm/s. The DC method also yields a very good fit; it is within 0.05 cm/s most of the time, except during a few periods around slack water. However, the poor fit around slack water is fine, considering that the bed shear stress is typically small or negligible during these conditions.     x sf j f is the skin-friction shear-stress computed from the log fit method (ADCP only) while T S f, dc is the skin-friction shear-stress computed from the drag coefficient method (ADCP and MAVS). x cr is the threshold bed shear-stress that must be exceeded for initiation of bedload sediment transport."}, {"section_title": "Critical Bed Shear Stress", "text": "The critical bed shear stress can be described theoretically as the balance of forces acting on a sediment grain. These forces include the force imparted on the sediment grain by its submerged weight (which acts as a stabilizing force to keep the sediment grain immobilized), and the force imparted on the sediment grain by the shear stress of the surrounding flow (which acts as a destabilizing force to move the sediment grain along the bed). The critical bed shear stress is commonly given in terms of the Shields parameter, which is defined theoretically as: where r CI is the threshold bed shear stress, g is the acceleration due to gravity, p s is the grain density, p is water density, and d is the median grain diameter. In the theoretical evaluation of d cr presented in Equation (32), T cr is the shear stress imparted on the grain by the surrounding flow and g(p s -p)d is the submerged weight of the sediment grain. In the time that has elapsed since Shields (1936) first evaluated the empirical relationship between grain size and the critical bed shear stress (yielding the ubiquitous Shields curve depicted in Figure 3-2), it has become commonplace to evaluate 6 cr as a function of the dimensionless grain size D*: where s = pjp and v is the kinematic viscosity of water. Soulsby (1997) provides an algebraic expression that yields a close fit to the original Shields curve for coarser grain sizes ( Fig. 3-2): The critical value of the Shields parameter can subsequently be converted to bed shear stress using Equation (3.2). Several field measurements are required in order to calculate d cr from Equations (3.3) and (3.4). Measurements of water temperature and salinity are necessary to evaluate the density and kinematic viscosity of water in Equation (33). Median grain size is also required as an input to Equation (3.3). Water temperature and salinity values for this study were taken from CTD observations made in July 2008. Median grain size was derived from grain-size analyses of sediment samples obtained at the ADCP and MAVS stations. x\" 3 1 "}, {"section_title": "Total Bed Shear Stress", "text": "Total bed shear stress (Tb) was evaluated using two methods. The first estimate of Tb was given by the log-profile (LP) method described by Sherwood et al. (2006) and others (Dyer, 1980;Middleton and Southard, 1984;Huntley, 1988). The second estimate of Tb was obtained using the quadratic shear stress equation, which requires an empirical drag coefficient describing the bottom roughness. The second method is referred to here as the drag coefficient (DC) method. The log-profile method of estimating bed shear stress requires observations of the vertical profile of current speed within the current bottom-boundary layer. The von Karman-Prandtl equation, known as the logarithmic law of the wall, states that velocity in this layer varies as a function of shear velocity (w*) and height above the bottom (z): where U(z) is mean velocity at height z above bottom, K = 0.408 is the von Karman constant, and zo is the hydraulic roughness length. Studies have shown that the law of the wall holds true for velocity profiles near the bed even when the flow is not strictly steady or uniform (Dyer, 1980), which is often the case in marine and estuarine systems such as Portsmouth Harbor. The von Karman-Prandtl equation can be re-arranged as: where U(z) is the dependent variable, U*IK is the slope, ln(z) is the independent variable and ln(zo) is the y-intercept, thus allowing u* and zo to be estimated from a linear leastsquares fit to a measured velocity profile plotted as ln(z) vs. U(z) (Sherwood et al., 2006). The shear velocity u* can subsequently be converted to bed shear stress: A significant advantage of using the log-profile method to estimate bed shear stress is that the measured velocity profiles can be tested for log-linearity, thus giving a statistical measure of the goodness-of-fit (Sherwood et al., 2006). However, because the log-profile method requires measurements of current speed at several elevations above the bottom, this method was only applied to the ADCP current-meter station. A second estimate of bed shear stress was calculated from a quadratic shear stress equation, which only requires measurement of current speed at a single location within the logarithmic current bottom-boundary layer. This method has been demonstrated to give a reasonable estimate of the magnitude of bed shear stress for current observations made some distance above the bed (Home and Patton, 1989;Sanford, 1991;1994;Soulsby, 1997). The quadratic shear stress equation is given as: where Cwo is an empirical drag coefficient and Uwo is the mean velocity at a height of 1 m above the bed. The value of Cwo is related to the roughness length zo according to the relationship: where K is the von Karman constant. A typical value of Cioo for a rippled, sandy bed is in the range 0.005 to 0.008 (Wright, 1995). This study evaluated Equation (3.8) using two different estimates of Cioo-The first run applied a Cioo value of 0.006, which is the theoretical bottom roughness for a rippled, sandy bed without larger-scale bedforms (Soulsby, 1997). The second run applied a Cioo value based on the mean ZQ value estimated by the log-profile method. The Cioo value based on the log-profile method expresses the actual bottom roughness of the seabed at the ADCP station, where small, asymmetrical dunes (wavelength of 7m and height of 0.35 m) are present. The quadratic shear stress method was applied to the ADCP and MAVS data, as this method only requires measurements of velocity at a single point (e.g., 1 m above bottom)."}, {"section_title": "Partitioning Bed Shear Stress", "text": "The presence of bedforms on the seafloor is a major consideration in evaluating bed shear stress (Smith and McLean, 1977;Dyer, 1980;Bennett and Best, 1995;McLean et al., 1999;Best, 2005). The presence of a bedform causes a horizontal pressure gradient within the surrounding flow as a result of flow separation and re-attachment over the bedform wavelength, and the horizontal pressure gradient in turn induces a horizontal drag force (Smith and McLean, 1977;Best, 2005). This drag force increases the total bed shear stress in the region away from the bed (the outer flow), while decreasing the skinfriction component of the total bed shear stress (the dominant force in the internal boundary layer near the bed), thus decreasing the ability of the shear stress to impact sediment grains on the bed. Where bedforms are present, it is thus necessary to isolate the skin-friction component of the total bed shear stress in order to calculate the excess bed shear stress for initiation of sediment motion. The difference between the skinfriction shear stress and the total bed shear stress is given by: where Xb is the total bed shear stress, Ts/is the skin-friction shear stress, and Xfj is the form drag. Because the skin-friction shear stress cannot be measured directly, it is necessary to calculate this value indirectly through drag partitioning. Smith and McLean (1977) accomplish this by evaluating the form drag with respect to the total shear stress and the shear stress felt near the bed (i.e., the skin-friction shear stress): where FD is the form drag, C D is a drag coefficient that depends on the bedform shape, U r is the reference velocity associated with the internal boundary layer, r\\ is the bedform height, and X is the bedform wavelength. Substituting Equation (3.5) for U r , Equation (3.11) becomes: where (w*) n and (zo) n are the shear velocity and roughness length associated with the internal boundary layer and z* is the \"matching height\" where the outer flow meets the internal flow. Evaluating z*/(zo) n in terms of the average height of the internal boundary layer over the bedform wavelength and substituting into Equation (3.12) yields the partitioning ratio T^/%: which is then used to approximate x S f from a reasonable estimate of Xb. The partitioning ratio given by Equation (3.13) is typically in the range 2 to 3 for many natural systems (Harris, 2003)."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER 4 DETECTING BEDFORM MIGRATION", "text": "This chapter presents a new technique for quantifying bedform migration from high-resolution bathymetry. This novel approach explores the use of a fingerprintdetection algorithm (Bishnu et al., 2002) to convert bathymetry to a binary map of bedform crests, which are subsequently tracked using a normalized two-dimensional spatial cross-correlation technique (Duffy and Hughes-Clarke, 2005). This new approach has advantages over techniques currently used to track bedform migration, which tend to focus on surfaces (e.g. depth and maximum slope) which may not adequately emphasize bedform morphology (Duffy and Hughes-Clarke, 2005;Buijsman and Ridderinkhof, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "BISHNU: A New Technique for Ridge Detection", "text": "A new algorithm (BISHNU) has been applied to delineate dune crest (\"ridge\") locations from bathymetric data. BISHNU applies a two-pass combinatorial classification scheme to extract ridge locations from a bathymetric DTM, and produces a binary image (\"ridge map\") of ridge-classified grid cells. The ridge maps are subsequently used to determine dune-crest displacements using a spatial cross-correlation technique (Duffy and Hughes-Clarke, 2004;. This section provides a detailed overview of how BISHNU has been implemented to produce binary ridge maps from bathymetric data. A brief overview of the algorithm is presented here to provide context for the indepth discussion that follows in this section. BISHNU is comprised of several subroutines, which are implemented in sequential order. The subroutines implemented by BISHNU proceed as follows: (1) Convert gridded bathymetry (\"DTM\") from XYZ format to a binary format (*.DBL); (2) Apply two-dimensional Gaussian filter to the binary DTM to reduce influence of noise; (3) Implement a (two-pass) combinatorial algorithm for classifying ridges based on topographical relationships between neighboring grid cells (\"pixels\") in the binary DTM. In the first pass each pixel is assigned a label that may be \"unambiguous\" (ridge, valley, or slope) or \"ambiguous\" (ridge/valley, ridge/slope, or unknown). Ambiguously-labeled pixels are passed to subroutine (4); (4) Resolve ambiguous preliminary labels by examining their relationship with neighboring unambiguous pixels. In this second pass, all pixels receive an unambiguous, final label (slope, valley, crest). (5) Compile a map of all crest-labeled pixels. This is the binary ridge map, and is output in *.BMP image format. As stated above, prior to running BISHNU the bathymetry must be converted to binary format. A program, XYZ2DBL, has been developed to convert the gridded bathymetry from XYZ format to the requisite binary format (*.DBL). Subsequently, the first step undertaken by BISHNU is to remove high-frequency noise from the DTM by applying a two-dimensional Gaussian filter. Optional arguments allow the user to specify the kernel size (in grid cells) of the Gaussian filter, as well as the number of times the filter is applied to the DTM. After smoothing the DTM, BISHNU begins a two-pass combinatorial algorithm for classifying ridges within the DTM based on topographical relationships (i.e., slope) between neighboring grid cells. This aspect of the algorithm was originally developed for ridge extraction in grayscale fingerprint images for the purposes of automated fingerprint identification (Bishnu et al., 2002). Here, DTM grayscale is a function of the gridded depth. The first pass applied by BISHNU examines the gradient along a path (\"walk\") through a grid cell (P) with boundary grid cells There  (Fig. 4-1). A straight-line walk along any of the directions of D (e.g. from NW to SE) consists of a walk wj followed by another walk W2 in the same direction. The first pass of BISHNU examines the gradient along each elementary walk wj and W2, where gradient is defined as the difference in depth (L) between P and any point on B (or vice versa). Note that depth L is positive. For the example of a walk through P Fig. 4-1). The gradient along any direction (k,t) \u00a3 D is defined as the first difference pair A ft # = {L' wl , (k ,i), L' w2 ,(k,i)}, and (k,i))} denotes the sign of this pair, where there are three possible signs: (Depth remains the same) xyK,l) x (Ktl) In order to remove additional uncertainty from the gradient calculation, the directional average is taken for a 5 by 5 neighborhood of pixels along each of the directions (k,t)E.D for calculating L ' w j and L ' W 2. The pixel P is classified along a single direction (k,T) \u00a3D with respect to the change in gradient along that direction A^y  or to an ambiguous class CV (can be crest or valley), CS (can be crest or slope), VS (can be valley or slope), or XX (can be crest, valley, or slope). All cases that cannot be unambiguously classified are processed further during the second pass of BISHNU. Grayscale DTM Elementary walks w, and  2). BISHNU allows the user to specify the dimensions of R(P) to be used in the second pass. Bishnu et al. (2002) recommend that the user select a region of size (Wx W) where W=(rk)/V2 and r is the desirable number of crest lines (~3) located in R(P). Following this method, the appropriate value of W for this study would be at least 10 m. We determined, however, that a much smaller value of W = 0.5X. = 2.5 m yielded a better result (e.g., smoother ridge lines), where X is the minimum wavelength (5 m) within the DTM."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Cross-Correlation", "text": "Although many methods exist for quantifying bedform migration, it is often difficult to detect movements of very small magnitude (decimeters or less). Moreover, many methods, particularly profile-based methods, are unable to capture the full spatial resolution of bedform migration across a three-dimensional seafloor. In this study, a spatial cross-correlation method for detecting bedform migration (Duffy and Hughes-Clarke, 2005) has been adapted for analysis of binary ridge maps produced by BISHNU.  The technique of Duffy and Hughes-Clarke (2005) uses a simple, normalized twodimensional cross-correlation routine to measure bedform migration by identifying the region over which two bathymetric datasets are most highly correlated (i.e., most similar). This technique has been implemented on a number of representations of the bathymetric surface, including bathymetric DTMs, grayscale images of maximum slope, and grids of variance around mean depth derived from ADCP profiles (Duffy and Hughes-Clarke, 2005;Buijsman and Ridderinkhof, 2008). As Duffy and Hughes-Clarke (2005) note, the cross-correlation method works best where bedforms dominate the input imagery. Whereas the maximum slope surface more strongly emphasizes the dune morphology with respect to the bathymetric DTM, the slope surface is also prone to emphasizing any artifacts present in the underlying bathymetry (e.g., heave, tide, and/or offset artifacts) ( Fig. 4-3). Conversely, binary ridge maps derived from the bathymetric surface provide maximum contrast between the dune crests and the surrounding seafloor, while excluding artifacts (that are smoothed by a Gaussian filter in BISHNU).

Dynamic range of each candidate surface is noted. Morphology is obscured in depth DTM because of the narrow dynamic range {11.89, 14.02} which appears as near-black in a grayscale image (0=black, 255=white). Maximum slope has a wider dynamic range {0.21 40.00} but emphasizes data artifacts, which are indicated by red arrows. BISHNU ridge map is a binary image with range {0, 1}, where ridge pixels are assigned a value of 1 and non-ridge pixels are assigned a value of 0. Ridge map most strongly emphasizes the dune morphology. The cross-correlation (CC) method is used to examine spatial patterns from a series of two discrete data sets, which are defined here as two binary ridge maps, MAPi and MAP2, acquired at time steps t\\ and h. The cross-correlation coefficient quantifies the strength of correlation of MAPi and MAP2, and is the sum of the products of overlapping pixels of windowed spatial variables/( x,j^ and g(x,y), where f(x,y) is a subset of MAPi and g(x,y) is a subset of MAP2 (Fig. 4-4). The calculation of the crosscorrelation coefficient is iterated by incrementing and decrementing the relative displacement in the x and y directions by k and /, respectively. The cross-correlation coefficient is given by: where the cross-correlation coefficient R^\\ is normalized to {-1 1} by subtracting the mean of each spatial variable and dividing by the standard deviation.

Bathymetry from the 2007 MBES surveys is presented in Figure 5-4 and bathymetry from the 2008 MBES surveys is presented in Figure 5-5. The range of surveyed water depth within the survey area was 10 meters to 20.5 meters relative to mean lower low water (MLLW). Histograms of the horizontal total propagated uncertainty (HzTPU) of soundings from the seven completed MBES surveys are presented in Figure 5-6. HzTPU was calculated in CARIS HIPS using real-time *.SBET error data as described in Chapter 3."}, {"section_title": "Bathymetry and Dune Morphology", "text": "Typical HzTPU values for the MBES surveys (reported at 2DRMS) are in the range 0.15 to 0.25 m, which is just less than the resolution of the gridded data (0.25 m). The HzTPU values represent the absolute horizontal positioning uncertainty for each sounding. It is important to note, however, that bedform migration estimates are derived from the gridded data. The gridded data were processed using the CUBE algorithm implemented in CARIS HIPS 6.1, and thus contain a separate vertical uncertainty estimate for each grid node that is a factor of the HzTPU and DpTPU (depth total propagated uncertainty) of the soundings contributed to each node. Moreover, the high-resolution MBES data yield a high concentration of soundings per grid node (approximately 18.5 soundings/node), which further decreases the uncertainty estimate associated with the gridded data. Because the HzTPU and DpTPU values from the seven completed MBES surveys are less than the resolution of the gridded data (0.25 m), and because of the high concentration of soundings contributing to each grid node, it is assumed that the horizontal positioning uncertainty of the gridded data is unlikely to be a source of significant error in determining the bedform-migration rates. Gross morphology of the dune field did not appreciably change during periods observed in 2007 or in 2008, although the morphology changed dramatically during the roughly one-year period between the 2007 and 2008 surveys.      This area of complex bedforms is located to the north and east of a large (10 m by 12 m) target that appears to be a bedrock outcrop (Fig. 5-9). The flood-ebb asymmetry of medium and large dunes within the interior of the study area is dramatically different from 2007 to 2008. The dunes in 2007 were uniformly flood-oriented across the bedform field (e.g., cross sections A, B, D, E, F and G in Figure 5-7). Dunes in 2008 in the western sector of the bedform field were moderately flood-oriented (e.g., cross sections B, E and F in Figure 5-8), whereas dunes in the eastern sector of the bedform field were moderately to strongly ebb-oriented (e.g. cross sections A, C and G in Figure 5-8). Dune crests of opposite asymmetry often join together at a dune bifurcation (Fig. 5-9 "}, {"section_title": "Ridge Maps and Dune Migration", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "BISHNU Results", "text": "Very good agreement was observed between the BISHNU ridge-map output and the bathymetric surfaces.   to large (8 m to 12m wavelength) and small (3 m to 5 m wavelength) dunes alike. In the regions outside of the dune field, BISHNU correctly identified other small targets as ridges, particularly within areas of coarser-textured seafloor east and west of the dune field (see, e.g., Figure 5-1 for textural data from these areas)."}, {"section_title": "Spatial Cross-Correlation Results", "text": "Estimates of dune migration were obtained through normalized, two-dimensional spatial cross-correlation of the BISHNU ridge maps (Duffy and Hughes-Clarke, 2005). An example of the full vector-field output from the cross-correlation algorithm It is evident from the preceding figures that dunes within the study area are actively migrating over time-scales as short as 6 hr. However, the overall trend of dune migration on such short time-scales is highly spatially variable (Fig. 5-13, Fig. 5-14). A more coherent pattern of dune migration begins to develop on time-scales of 1 day or longer (e.g. Fig. 5-15, Fig. 5-16, Fig. 5-17). It is worth noting again that the results have been spatially averaged, so that each migration vector represents the average magnitude and direction of dune migration over a specified area, rather than the \"instantaneous\" magnitude and direction of dune migration of a unit width of dune crest. Overall trends of dune migration in the study area can be discerned from the histograms of \"instantaneous\" magnitude and direction presented in Figure 5-18, thus providing further context for the spatially-averaged vector field output. The results indicate that dunes are actively migrating on time-scales of 6 hr. The dune-migration vectors observed over the period 1400 to 2000 UTC on 8 June 2007 ( Fig.   5-13), on a rising tide under neap tidal conditions, are highly spatially variable, although the overall trend of dune migration is flood-oriented. The histograms in Figure 5-18 indicate that dune migration is predominantly directed to the northwest as indicated by a direction peak at 330\u00b0, although a low, broad peak from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0 indicates some movement in directions ranging from north to south. Magnitude of dune migration observed over this period is predominantly in the range of 0.2 to 0.6 m ( Fig. 5-18). The migration vector field for the period 1330 to 1930 UTC on 14 June 2007, on a falling tide under spring tidal conditions, is also highly spatially variable (Fig. 5-14). Histograms of dune migration and direction for this period indicate that dune migration is primarily directed to the southeast and northwest, as indicated by direction peaks at 150\u00b0 and 320\u00b0, respectively (Fig. 5-18). Magnitudes of dune migration observed over this period are predominantly 0.2 to 0.4 m, which is slightly less than the range observed over the 6-hour period on 8 June 2007.  (Fig. 5-15). Dunes in the eastern sector of the bedform field clearly migrate in a net ebb (south to southeast) direction, while dune migration in the western sector of the bedform field remains spatially variable. A histogram of dune migration direction (Fig. 5-18) indicates one peak centered on 330\u00b0 and another low, broad peak centered on 180\u00b0. The broad peak at 180\u00b0 likely corresponds to the ebbmigrational dunes in the eastern sector of the bedform field, whereas the peak at 330\u00b0  (Fig. 5-18). A coherent pattern of bedform migration is strongly apparent over the 7-day period observed from 8 June 2007 (2000 UTC) to 15 June 2007 (1400 UTC) ( Fig. 5-16). Dunes in the eastern sector of the bedform field migrate in a net ebb (south to westsouthwest) direction, whereas dunes in the western sector of the bedform field migrate in a net flood (northwest to northeast) direction. This reciprocal pattern of bedform migration in the east vs. west sectors is apparent from the histogram of dune-migration direction in Figure 5-18, which contains migration peaks centered on 0\u00b0 (flood) and -200\u00b0 (ebb). Note the low, broad ebb peak that indicates that ebb migration directions ranged from southeast to southwest (Fig. 5-18). The magnitude of dune migration observed over this period reached nearly 2.0 m (Fig. 5-18). The reciprocal pattern of dune migration is absent over the 6-day period observed from 3 July 2008 (1420 UTC) to 9 July 2008 (1630 UTC) ( Fig. 5-17).

The histogram of dune migration over this time period (Fig. 5-18) contains a low, broad peak centered on 180\u00b0 that contains the ebb-migrating dunes in the eastern sector of the dune field. A second peak centered on 300\u00b0 indicates bedform migration in this direction as well, perhaps in the southwest quadrant of the dune field (Fig. 5-17). The maximum magnitude of dune migration observed during this period was 2.0 m, although more typical values of dune migration were much less, ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 m.  Figure   5-17. This suggests that the suspect vectors are noise that resulted from the crosscorrelation of ridges identified in rough seafloor terrain, and that the ridges are not bedforms."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER DISCUSSION", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Bedform Migration in Portsmouth Harbor", "text": "The bedform migration estimates from 24-hr and multi-day periods in 2007 and 2008 indicate strong differences in sediment transport across the east-west axis of the Portsmouth Harbor dune field. Dunes within the eastern sector of the bedform field are observed to have migrated in a net ebb (southeast to southwest) direction over 24-hr and multi-day periods in 2008 (Fig. 5-15, Fig. 5-16, Fig, 5-17). Dune migration in the western sector of the bedform field appears to have been temporally variable. Over a 24-hr period in 2007 there is no strong pattern of dune migration in this area, although migration appears to have been directed generally to the northwest (Fig. 5-15, Fig. 5-18). A strong coherent pattern of dune migration is apparent in the western sector of the bedform field over a 7-day period in 2007, when dune migration was oriented in a net flood (northwest to northeast) direction ( Fig. 5-16). Conversely, over a 6-day period in 2008 there was relatively little migration of dunes in the western sector of the bedform field ( Fig. 5-17). This strong east-west difference in bedform migration is reflected in the morphology observed from a timeline of MBES bathymetric surveys of the dune field extending back to November 2000. Surveys were conducted by the NOAA Ship Whiting in November 2000 with a Reson 8101 MBES ( Fig. 6-1); by the University of New  6-3); and by the R/V Coastal Surveyor in June 2004 using a Kongsberg EM3002 (Fig. 6-4 However, it should be noted that apparent symmetry of bedforms in Profile A may be caused by the fact that not all transects were taken at a direction perfectly normal to the dune crests. Bedforms from Profile B are strongly flood-oriented for all surveys. The east-west differences in dune asymmetry discussed here were briefly noted, but not analyzed, in a seafloor-habitat characterization study in Portsmouth Harbor (Cutter, 2005).     Although bedform morphologies in the June 2007 surveys were flood-oriented across the survey area ( Fig. 5-7, Fig. 6-5, Fig. 6-7), spatial cross-correlation results presented in Chapter 5 clearly indicate that the bedforms in the eastern sector of the dune field were migrating in a net ebb direction (Fig. 5-15, Fig. 5-16). Inspection of a timeseries of bed-elevation profiles from the five surveys conducted in 2007 ( Fig. 6-8, Fig. 6-9) suggests that the apparent ebb migration direction of the flood-oriented dunes was the result of a subtle shift in dune asymmetry. From 8 June to 15 June, dunes in the eastern sector of the bedform field (Profiles A and D of Figure 6-9) became slightly less floodasymmetrical. By the next available survey in July of 2008, the bedforms in this area had resumed their ebb asymmetry ( Fig. 5-8). It should be noted that Figures 6-8 and 6-9 also provide further evidence of strong east-west differences in dune migration during the 7day period in 2007. Dunes in the western sector of the bedform field (profile B in Figure   6-9) had migrated in a net flood direction, whereas dunes in the eastern sector of the bedform field (profile C in Figure 6-9) had migrated in a net ebb direction. The dominant pattern of reciprocal dune orientation corresponds with the velocity asymmetry of the observed current data. The current data were observed during spring tidal conditions from 3 to 6 June 2008, a period that was concurrent with the 2008 multibeam echosounder surveys (Fig. 5-19, Fig. 5-20). Although the current observations are assumed to be representative of normal hydrodynamic conditions in Portsmouth Harbor in the absence of wave forcing, it should be noted that the observations are quite limited, spanning only six tidal cycles, and that the current-meter stations ADCP and MAVS were located in the eastern and western sectors of the bedform field, respectively (Fig. 3-1). The current-meter data in Figure 5-19 show ebb-dominant currents at the ADCP site (1.03 m above bottom) and strongly flood-dominant currents at the MAVS site (1.00 m above bottom). Maximum flood and ebb currents at the ADCP site are 54 cm/s and 73 cm/s, respectively, while maximum flood and ebb currents at the MAVS site are 49 cm/s and <20 cm/s (with brief excursions to -40 cm/s). Plots of partitioned bed shear stress at the ADCP and MAVS sites ( Fig. 5-23) indicate that the critical bed shear stress x cr was exceeded at both locations. At the ADCP site x CI was exceeded during flood and ebb tidal conditions, although the skin-friction bed shear stress x s f was much stronger during ebb conditions (maximum 3 N/m 2 ) than it was during flood-tidal conditions (maximum 1.5 N/m 2 ). Conversely, at the MAVS site, t cr was commonly exceeded during flood-tidal conditions, but very rarely (and for shorter periods) during ebb-tidal conditions (Fig. 5-23). If typical current-dominated hydrodynamic conditions such as those observed in July 2008 were responsible for initiating and sustaining the dominant pattern of dune morphology (i.e., reversal in dune asymmetry across the east-west axis of the bedform field) observed in the multibeam bathymetry from 2000, 2001, 2004 and 2008, then atypical current or wave-plus-current conditions may have been responsible for the anomalous bed morphology (i.e. strongly flood-asymmetrical dunes throughout the bedform field) observed in the bathymetry from 2007. Indeed, strongly flood-dominated current or wave-plus-current conditions would be necessary to have formed the bedformorientation pattern observed in 2007. Such conditions could potentially be initiated by storm forcing, particularly if accompanied by a significant storm surge and/or significant wave height. The formation and endurance of relic bedform morphology produced by such low-frequency events has been documented previously by Whitmeyer and FitzGerald (2007). If the bedform morphologies observed in 2007 were a relic caused by a lowfrequency storm event, then one would expect to find evidence of probable cause in the meteorological record.

Surveys were conducted over periods that range from 6 hr to 7 days in June 2007 and July 2008 in order to capture the response of dune morphology to ebb-flood and neapspring tidal cycles. Current observations were made at two locations within the study area concurrent with the July 2008 MBES survey in order to provide context for the observed patterns of bedform migration and in order to calculate bed shear stress. A targeted sediment sampling and underwater video survey was conducted in February 2007 in order to characterize seafloor sediments within the study area and to provide necessary textural information for calculations of bed shear stresses. A new technique was developed for detecting bedform migration. This technique (BISHNU) utilizes a fingerprint-detection algorithm (Bishnu et al., 2002) to convert bathymetry to a binary map of dune crests, which are subsequently tracked using a normalized two-dimensional spatial cross-correlation technique (Duffy and Hughes-Clarke, 2005). Ridge maps are a better candidate for spatial cross-correlation than the bathymetric or maximum-slope surfaces because they provide stronger emphasis of dune crests, which are the primary features to be tracked. Results of BISHNU coupled with the spatial cross-correlation routine yield reasonable estimates of bedform-migration magnitude and direction. Results indicate that bedform migration magnitudes of approximately 0.2 to 0.4 m were observed over 6-hr periods during spring and neap tidal conditions. Bedform migration magnitudes of 0.2 to 1.2 m were observed over a 1-day period during spring tidal conditions, whereas migration magnitudes in excess of 2.0 m were observed during 6-day and 7-day periods. Bedform migrations observed over 6-hr periods indicate the episodic response of the seafloor to oscillatory tidal currents. Results from repeat surveys conducted over 6-hr periods on 8 June 2007 and 14 June 2007 suggest a high degree of spatial variability in dune migration across the study area ( Fig. 5-13, Fig. 5-14). Conversely, bedform migration observed over 24-hr and multi-day periods show the response of the seafloor to residual currents, perhaps as the result of flood-ebb velocity asymmetry ( Fig. 5-15, Fig. 5-16, Fig. 5-17). Results over multi-day periods in 2007 and 2008 indicate a coherent pattern of bedform migration within the study area characterized by strong cross-channel differences in dune migrations (Fig. 5-16, Fig. 5-17). Results over a 7-day period in 2007 indicate a reciprocal pattern of bedform migrations, whereby dunes in the eastern sector of the bedform field migrated in a net ebb (southward) direction, and dunes in the western sector of the bedform field migrated in a net flood (northward) direction (Fig. 5-16). Results over a 6-day period in 2008 indicate a net ebb (southward) migration of dunes in the eastern sector of the bedform field, but reveal only weak activity in the western sector of the bedform field ( Fig. 5-17). Acoustic current-meter observations obtained from two locations in the study area in July 2008 provide context for the observed patterns of bedform migrations. The current-meter data show ebb-current dominance at the ADCP station in the eastern half of the bedform field and flood-current dominance at the MAVS station in the western half of the bedform field. Plots of partitioned bed shear stress indicate that the critical bed shear stress x cr was exceeded at both stations during both flood and ebb tides. At the ADCP site, x cr was exceeded during both flood and ebb tidal conditions, though the skinfriction shear stress x S f was much higher in magnitude during ebb tidal conditions. x cr at the MAVS site was commonly exceeded during flood tidal conditions but only rarely during ebb tidal conditions, indicating that bedload transport was primarily to the north at this location. The magnitude of x s f at the ADCP site was highest in magnitude during ebb tidal conditions, indicating that bedload transport was primarily to the south. The results of this study could be enhanced by the acquisition and analysis of high-resolution in situ observations of instantaneous and mean current speeds and bed shear stresses below 1.0 m above the seabed, which are necessary to more accurately assess bedload transport in the study area, although reasonable estimates thereof are provided by this study. A further improvement on this work would be simultaneous high-frequency observations of bed dynamics and bed shear stress via bottom tripods, which would be necessary to assess the instantaneous response of the seabed to tidal and wave-reinforced tidal conditions. A worthwhile extension of this study would be to continue extending the timeline of high-resolution multibeam bathymetry within the study area in order to monitor long-term changes in bedform morphologies."}]
