[{"section_title": "", "text": "In the United States, the concentration of college graduates in the population varies widely by state. In 2000, the percentage of adults aged 25 and older with a bachelor's degree varied from 14.8% in West Virginia to 33.2% in Massachusetts and 39.1% in the District of Columbia. As shown in Figure 1, this percentage was lowest in several Appalachian states and in the South Central region of the country. The percentage was highest in several states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions and in Colorado. Cross-state differences in the percentage of state residents with a college degree are quite stable over time. For example, although each state experienced an increase in this percentage from 1990 to 2000 (the cross-state average increased from 20.0% to 24.1%), the correlation across states between the percentages in 1990 and 2000 is 0.99. Over many decades, the pattern is still quite persistent; for example, the correlation between the percentages in 1950 and 2000 is 0.76 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 2006). Furthermore, the extent of variation across states in the concentration of college graduates was roughly constant between 1934 and 2004 (Bauer, Schweitzer, & Shane, 2008). Policy makers in many states seek to increase the percentage of their state's population with college degrees. The motivation for this goal is the documented relationship between knowledge stocks and the economic vitality of states, cities, and regions. Evidence from cities suggests that raising the overall education level of an area increases the wages of all workers in that area (Moretti, 2004) and contributes to economic growth (Glaeser, Scheinkman, & Shleifer, 1995). Evidence from states indicates that the share of the workforce with a college degree is a key factor in the state's productivity (Iranzo & Peri, 2009) and relative per capita personal income (Bauer et al., 2008). Moreover, college graduates earn more and, therefore, pay more in state taxes. On the flip side of government budgets, college graduates are less likely to receive public assistance (such as welfare and Medicaid), have lower costs for employment-related programs (unemployment insurance and worker's compensation), and are less likely to be imprisoned (Trostel, 2010). Higher education in the United States is financed to a large extent through state governments. Public colleges and universities account for about 65% of all bachelor's degrees awarded (National Center for Education Statistics, 2008). Given the large financial role of states and the economic benefits to knowledge stocks, many states attempt to use higher education policies to increase the percentage of their state's population (or workforce) that has a college degree. However, given the mobility of the labor force in general (Bartik, 1991;Blanchard & Katz, 1992;Long, 1988) and of college-educated labor in particular (Bound & Holzer, 2000;Long, 1988;Wozniak, 2010), a policy change in a given state may not necessarily affect the number of college graduates living in that state. This article reviews the effectiveness of state higher education policies at influencing the supply of college-educated labor within a state. Although in practice states target policies to both the demand and supply sides of the labor market to promote economic development (Bartik, 1991), my focus in this article is on the supply side. At issue is the relative effectiveness of supply-and demand-side policies in affecting the location choice of college-educated workers. I discuss policy options that have been implemented (or proposed) and highlight research that is relevant to evaluating these policies. My focus is on policies at the undergraduate level, though state policies may also affect the production of advanced degrees (e.g., master's degrees and doctorates) and sub-baccalaureate degrees (e.g., associate's degrees). The review approaches the problem from the perspective of a given state, though states' interests are, perhaps necessarily, somewhat narrow: What is a good investment for the nation as a whole may not necessarily be a good investment for a given state, and vice versa. The next section of the article presents a conceptual model of the supply and demand for college-educated labor in a state. The subsequent sections discuss various types of policies related to the finance and production of undergraduate education in a state, including (a) expansions in the number of degrees awarded by institutions in the state; (b) merit-based scholarships, an increasingly popular form of student financial aid; (c) location-contingent financial aid, which directly links retention with recruitment; (d) adjustments to the composition of enrollment by residency or field of study; and (e) other retention and recruitment policies."}, {"section_title": "Conceptual Framework", "text": "Students graduating from high school face a sequence of choices regarding their education and employment. First is the decision of whether to go to college or to enter the workforce. Among those who attend college, the second choice is which college to attend. Students make these choices based on their aptitude for academic study, the educational opportunities and costs at various colleges, and the proximity of these colleges to family and friends. Once enrolled in college, students choose a major field of study, how much effort to apply to their studies, and how to finance their college costs. Students who complete a college degree must decide which occupation to enter and where to work. These choices are shaped by the wages and employment opportunities in the occupations for which their major prepares them. These opportunities often vary across space, and therefore, geographic considerations play a large role in graduates' employment choices. A simple conceptual model helps organize thoughts about the effects of various policies. The model presented in this section places state-level degree outputs in the context of demand and supply in the labor market. The model, which is from Bound, Groen, Kezdi, and Turner (2004), is appropriate to the U.S. context because any given state is an open economy: Workers can move freely into and out of the state depending on economic opportunities in the state and in other states. Firms are also mobile across state borders. In the model, which is shown graphically in Figure 2, the wage and quantity of college-educated labor in a state are considered relative to the wage and quantity of high schooleducated labor-as is common in the literature on the demand and supply for educated workers (e.g., Katz & Murphy, 1992). The horizontal axis indicates the relative quantity of collegeeducated labor, and the vertical axis indicates the relative wage of college-educated labor. There are two supply curves (labeled F and S) that represent labor stocks that are influenced by degree flows. The F curve is the long-run supply curve under the assumption that post-college migration is not possible; this is based on the flow of college-educated labor arising from the production of bachelor's degrees within the state, relative to the flow of high school-educated labor. The S curve is the long-run supply curve when migration is possible. Under infinitely elastic migration, S would be horizontal at the national wage ratio. The figure represents the case of imperfect but nonzero mobility, which is shown by the S curve being more elastic than the F curve. The two curves intersect at the relative wage level for which there is no net migration. For wages above this point, there is net in-migration of college-educated labor and S lies to the right of F; for wages below this level, there is net out-migration of college-educated labor and S lies to the left of F. The D curve represents the relative long-run demand schedule for college-educated labor within the state. Shifts in the relative supply of college-educated labor in a state (the S curve) lead to adjustments in production, with shifts toward industries and technologies intensive in college-educated workers when this factor is relatively plentiful (movements along the D curve). In this way, changes in output mix are one way that state labor markets can adjust to supply shifts (Hanson & Slaughter, 2002). The elasticity of demand is tied to the mix of traded and nontraded goods produced in the state. For workers (e.g., engineers) employed in the production of goods and services that are traded across state borders, the within-state demand curve is likely to be relatively flat, because there is more room for the reallocation of labor across sectors. In contrast, the demand curve is likely to be relatively steep for types of skilled labor (e.g., teachers) employed in the production of goods and services that are not traded across state borders but are instead produced and consumed locally. Point A in Figure 2 represents equilibrium in the state labor market. In the case represented, the state is a net importer of college-educated labor: Equilibrium stocks are greater than flows. In practice, some states are net exporters and others are net importers. This distinction is likely driven by variation across states in degree flows and in the demand for collegeeducated labor. Variation in degree flows across states may occur because some states have a comparative advantage in the production of higher education, with differences derived from historical forces affecting where colleges were located more than a century ago, proximity to population centers, or the willingness of voters to support higher education. Variation across states in demand for college-educated labor may occur because some states have a comparative advantage in the production of goods and services intensive in collegeeducated labor. This type of comparative advantage might arise from the pattern of settlement of the country, the initial location of particular industries, and the pattern of resource endowments and climate. Examples might include the nation's political capital (Washington, D.C.) and its suburbs in Maryland and Virginia and the nation's financial capital (New York City) and its suburbs in Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York. Each of the policies discussed in this review seeks to increase the relative quantity of college-educated labor in a state by shifting the supply curve. A shift in the relative supply of college graduates in a state is represented in Figure 2 as a shift in the supply curve from S to S\u2032. In keeping with my focus on supply-side policies, I assume that the shift in S does not directly affect the demand for college-educated labor. With the shift in the supply curve, equilibrium stocks increase from q to q\u2032 and equilibrium wages for college graduates fall from w to w\u2032. For a given shift in the supply curve, the increase in the relative quantity of college-educated labor (q to q\u2032) depends on the elasticity of demand: The more elastic is the demand, the greater is the increase in quantity. Note that although the shift in supply is assumed not to affect the demand curve, this shift may lead to an increase in the quantity demanded."}, {"section_title": "Expansion of Degree Production", "text": "One policy option for shifting the supply curve is to increase the number of degrees awarded by colleges and universities in the state. Degree production could be expanded by increasing the number of students starting college or by increasing persistence to completion among those starting college. Specific policy tools for states include increasing direct aid to public institutions, financial aid to students, and funding for student services. An expansion of degree production would be represented graphically in Figure 2 by an outward shift in the F curve. The shift in F would induce a shift in the net relative supply of college-educated labor (the S curve), and the equilibrium would shift along the demand curve from Point A to a point such as Point B. Bound et al. (2004) estimated the relationship between the relative flows of college graduates at the state level and the stock of college-educated workers in the state. Using a formal version of the model illustrated in Figure 2, they showed that in response to an exogenous increase in flows, the ratio of the change in stocks to the change in flows is \u03b2 \u2261 [\u03c3/(\u03c3 + \u03b8)], which is less than or equal to 1. In this expression, \u03c3 represents the elasticity of within-state relative demand (i.e., the elasticity of substitution between college-and high school-educated labor) and \u03b8 represents the migration elasticity (which determines the contrast between the F and S curves). The definition of \u03b2 is useful in understanding the determinants of the effect of flows on stocks. The larger the elasticity of demand (\u03c3), the larger will be the effect of changes in flows on changes in stocks. For example, the effect would likely be larger for degree types employed in the traded-goods sector than for those employed in the production of nontraded goods. This is because the traded-goods sector can sell in other states the increased output resulting from the increased use of collegeeducated labor. In contrast, more mobility (\u03b8) dampens the effect of flows on stocks. At one extreme, no mobility (\u03b8 = 0) leads to a one-to-one mapping between changes in flows and changes in stocks (because in this case the S and F curves are identical). At the other extreme, frictionless mobility (\u03b8 = \u221e) leads to a zero effect of flows on stocks. Bound et al. (2004) estimated \u03b2 separately for two degree types: bachelor's degrees and medical degrees (MDs). The elasticity of demand in state labor markets is likely to be greater for baccalaureate graduates than for medical doctors because baccalaureate graduates are more likely to be employed in the traded-goods sector. 1 Consequently, employers can concentrate production of traded goods and services in areas where college-educated labor is relatively plentiful. In contrast, medical doctors work largely in the nontraded sector, providing services to patients who live in a particular geographic area. The empirical results in Bound et al. (2004) indicate a modest association between flows and stocks for bachelor's degrees. Based on data for individuals who received their degrees between 1966 and 1985, a 10% increase in per capita degree production in a state is associated with a 3.2% increase in concentration of bachelor's recipients in the state's population. 2 Thus, stocks and flows are related, but the relationship is appreciably less than one-for-one-which points to the importance of migration of graduates across state borders. For medical degrees, in contrast, the cross-sectional relationship between production of MD degrees and the representation of doctors in the population is remarkably weak. A 10% increase in per capita degree production is associated with an increase in concentration of physicians of less than 1%. 3 The weak link between flows and stocks for medical degrees is consistent with an inelastic demand for medical services within states, reflecting employment concentrated in the nontraded sector. The graphical presentation of flows and stocks in Figure 3 helps sharpen understanding of the regression estimates. In each panel, the horizontal axis shows the average production of each type of degree for the 1966-1985 degree cohorts, and the vertical axis shows the average concentration of these degree holders in the population. The diagonal line distinguishes net importers (above the line) from net exporters (below the line). For bachelor's degrees (top panel), net importers include California, Maryland, and Connecticut; on the flip side, states such as South Dakota, Utah, and Vermont are net exporters of baccalaureate-trained personnel. The importing states have a large fraction of college graduates in their workforces even though they do not produce a lot of graduates. The exporting states produce a lot of graduates but have a relatively small fraction of college graduates in their workforces. The figure makes clear the positive association between stocks and flows for bachelor's degrees and the complete lack of association for medical degrees (bottom panel). The figure also demonstrates that the variation across states in the concentration of degree recipients is less than the variation of degree productionespecially in the case of medical degrees. The association between stocks and flows for bachelor's degrees suggests that the presence of college graduates in a state works, to some extent, to expand output in industries that are intensive in college-educated labor. However, the relationship between stocks and flows is much less than one-for-one, which suggests that increasing the scale of a state's higher education system has a limited effect on the human-capital level of its workforce. Therefore, although there are many reasons why states might invest in higher education, the geographic mobility of college-educated labor reduces incentives for states to make such investments (Justman & Thisse, 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Merit-Based Scholarships", "text": "States provide across-the-board subsidies to undergraduate students in the form of below-market tuition rates for in-state students at public colleges and universities. On top of that, states target subsidies to particular types of students using grants based on their financial need or academic merit. The share of state grant aid that is based on merit has increased from 12% in 1990 to 27% in 2007 (National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs [NASSGAP], 1991[NASSGAP], , 2008. The primary reason for this shift has been the introduction of broad-based merit-aid programs in many states. During the 1990s, a dozen states introduced such programs (Dynarski, 2004; Education Commission of the States, 2001), and since 2000, several other states have done so (Doyle, 2006;Zhang & Ness, 2010). These programs waive tuition and fees for students who achieve a minimum grade point average (GPA) in high school (typically 3.0) and maintain a minimum GPA in college (typically 2.5 to 3.0). Eligibility is restricted to those who attended high school in the state. The programs usually cover attendance at any public institution in the state, and some programs allow students to receive a subsidy of comparable value for attendance at a private institution in the state. These merit-aid programs are typically quite broad in application. For example, nearly 60% of students graduating from high school in Georgia qualified for its merit scholarship (Dynarski, 2008). In addition to broad-based merit-aid programs, states also have smaller merit-aid programs that are targeted at their \"best and brightest\" high school graduates. For example, Tennessee's Ned McWherter Scholars Program required students to have a high school GPA of at least 3.5 and to score in the top 5% on the American College Test (ACT) or Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). As of 2000, there were 17 states with selective merit-aid programs (Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute, 2000). My analysis here focuses on the case of broad-based merit aid; some of this analysis may also apply to merit aid that is more narrowly targeted. One goal of merit-aid programs is to increase the supply of college-educated labor in a state. This could be achieved through two primary mechanisms. First, the programs could increase the percentage of high school graduates in the state who attend college (and ultimately earn bachelor's degrees)either by lowering the cost of attending 4-year institutions (relative to attending 2-year institutions or entering the workforce) or by inducing additional student effort during high school and college (to qualify for and renew scholarships). Second, the programs could shift the college choices of those high school graduates who would go to college even in the absence of a merit-aid program. By reducing the relative cost of attending in-state institutions, merit-aid programs seek to increase the number of talented students who attend college in their home state rather than in other states. The potential influence of merit aid on state of college attendance is important because a perception among policy makers in many states is that talented students leave the state for college and do not return (Schmidt, 1998). Given that the market for higher education in the United States is regional or even national in scope, many academically talented students choose to attend colleges outside their home states (Hoxby, 1997). Nationwide in 1996, 25% of first-time undergraduates at 4-year colleges and universities attended an institution outside their home state, up from 20% in 1975 (Groen, 2004). This percentage is higher among those with stronger academic backgrounds. For example, among students who entered a set of selective institutions in 1976 (those in the Mellon Foundation's College and Beyond database), 59% attended an institution outside their home state (Groen, 2004). The empirical evidence suggests that merit-aid programs promote college attendance and completion. Using data from the 2000 census, Dynarski (2008) found that the programs in Arkansas and Georgia increased the share of the high school graduates from these states who obtained a bachelor's degree (before age 34) by 2.5 percentage points (from a base of 27%). 4 However, Dynarski's analysis does not distinguish between college graduates living in Arkansas/Georgia and those living in other states at the time of the census. As a result, 2.5 percentage points is an upper bound for the impact of the merit-aid programs on the share of high school graduates from Arkansas/ Georgia who graduate from college and reside in Arkansas/ Georgia after college. There is some evidence that the overall gains in college attendance and completion are driven in part by gains in student achievement induced by merit scholarships. Henry and Rubenstein (2002) show that the Georgia program increased high school grades among Georgia students who attended Georgia public colleges and that these increases reflect improvements in student achievement rather than grade inflation. Pallais (2009) found that the Tennessee program induced large increases in performance on the ACT near the threshold required for program eligibility. In terms of college achievement, Scott-Clayton (2009) found that the estimated effects of the West Virginia program on course credits and GPA are concentrated near the annual requirements for scholarship renewal. Merit programs appear to have a strong influence on state of college attendance. In both Georgia and New Mexico, the programs expanded enrollment in 4-year institutions in the state, and a large share of the program effect at these institutions is because of a reduction in students leaving the state (Binder & Ganderton, 2002;Cornwell, Mustard, & Sridhar, 2006). For example, Georgia's program increased enrollment by 9% in 4-year public institutions and by 13% in 4-year private institutions (Cornwell et al., 2006). 5 Among freshmen who recently graduated from high school, two thirds of the enrollment effect at 4-year institutions can be accounted for by a decrease in Georgia residents leaving the state (Cornwell et al., 2006). 6 At the 10 institutions in Georgia's border states that drew the most students from Georgia, enrollment of Georgians dropped from 17% of freshman enrollment in 1992 to 9% in 1998 (Dynarski, 2000). 7 The evidence from Georgia and New Mexico is consistent with estimates of enrollment effects from an analysis of merit-aid programs in 14 states (Zhang & Ness, 2010). 8 Do merit-aid programs accomplish their ultimate goal of increasing the supply of college-educated labor in a state? For students who are induced to attend college (and ultimately graduate), the answer depends on two things. First, how many of the additional graduates remain in the state after graduation? Second, do those who remain represent net additions to the state's skilled labor force-or do they crowd out migration into the state by natives of other states? A starting point for answering the first question is descriptive evidence from nationally representative samples of college students. In the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), 73% of students who attended college in their home state were living in that state 14 years after entering college (Groen, 2004). 9 Data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study indicate that among students who graduated from a college in their home state in 1993, 81% were living in that state 4 years later (Perry, 2001). 10 The second question has not, to my knowledge, been addressed by the empirical literature on this topic. For students who would have attended college anyway but were induced by a merit-aid program to attend college in the state, the impact of the program on the supply of collegeeducated labor in the state depends on whether attending college in a state encourages students to work in the state after college. After students leave college, merit-aid programs do not provide any direct financial incentive for graduates to remain in the state. Instead, these programs could influence the location decisions of college graduates through the accumulation of location-specific capital-a generic term for factors that \"tie\" someone to a particular place (DaVanzo & Morrison, 1981). This concept includes features specific to a place that are more valuable to an individual in one location than in another, such as personal knowledge of an area, employment connections, community ties, and social networks (Marmaros & Sacerdote, 2002). For example, a student would likely accumulate more Georgia-specific capital from attending a college in Georgia than from attending a college in, say, Massachusetts. Groen (2004) provided indirect evidence on the effectiveness of merit-aid programs on retention by estimating the impact of attending college in one's home state on the probability of working in the state after college. Data from two samples of students who attended college in the 1970s contain information on students' locations during high school, the colleges they applied to and attended, and their state of residence 10 to 15 years after college. In the context of merit-aid programs, the focus is on the probability of graduates residing in their home state. The parameter of interest is the difference between this probability for those who attended college in their home state and the probability for those who attended college in another state. To control for differences in students' preferences for living in their home state, which are manifest in both choice of college and choice of postcollege location, Groen (2004) limited the sample to students who applied to at least one college in their home state and to at least one college outside their state. (This restriction makes the estimates more meaningful for policy analysis because they focus on students at the margin for attending college inside or outside the state.) Estimates from both data sets indicate that those who attended college in their home state are about 10 percentage points more likely to live in this state after college than are those who attended college outside their home state. For the Mellon Foundation's College and Beyond database, which covers a set of selective institutions, the estimated effect is 9 percentage points (from 0.39 to 0.48). For the NLS-72, the estimated effect is 10 percentage points (from 0.52 to 0.62). 11 These estimates likely overstate the causal effect of attending college in one's home state because the use of applications information does not perfectly control for selection into colleges based on location preferences. The magnitude of these estimates is modest, especially considering their upward bias. This can be seen in the context of an example using the NLS-72 estimates from the previous paragraph. Suppose a merit scholarship induces 100 additional students to attend college in their home state rather than in another state. With the scholarship program, these 100 students attend college in state, and therefore, 62 (62% of 100) of them locate in their home state after college. In contrast, without the program, these 100 students attend college out of state, and therefore, 52 (52% of 100) of them locate in their home state after college. Therefore, for every 100 additional students induced to attend college in state, the program induces only 10 additional graduates to locate in their home state. That the translation of additional students to additional college graduates working in the state is much less than one-for-one suggests the importance of the migration of college graduates across state borders. Tornatzky, Gray, Tarant, and Zimmer (2001), however, reached the opposite conclusion. Using data from the National Survey of Recent College Graduates on students who received bachelor's degrees in science and engineering between 1994 and 1996 and were interviewed 1 to 3 years after college, they report estimates of the effect of attending college in one's home state that are quite large. In their data, the probability of living in the home state is 0.76 for those who attended college in this state and 0.23 for those who attended college in another state, which implies an effect of 53 percentage points. However, this estimate likely overstates the causal effect because Tornatzky et al. did not control for selection into colleges based on location preferences. Groen (2004) showed that not controlling for location preferences leads to much larger estimated effects. Their results might also differ from Groen because they measure postcollege locations only a few years after college (when some graduates are enrolled in graduate school) and because their sample covers only science and engineering graduates. Hickman (2009) directly related a merit-aid program to the location decisions of college graduates. Hickman used data from the 2000 census and the 2001-2006 American Community Survey to examine the effect of Florida's Bright Futures Scholarship Program (enacted in 1997) on the location decisions of college-educated Florida natives. Those who graduated from high school when the program was in place and attended college were 3.4 percentage points more likely (from a base of 51%) to be living in Florida at age 23 to 27 than were those who attended college but graduated from high school before the program was enacted. 12 This estimate implies that of the 52,368 graduates of Florida high schools in 1997 who attended college, the program caused 1,780 of them to locate in Florida after college. 13 Do the benefits of state merit-aid programs outweigh the costs? On the basis of the impact of the Arkansas and Georgia programs on college entry and completion, Dynarski (2008) conducted a cost-benefit analysis and concluded \"that the programs are socially efficient at rates of return to schooling as low as 5 percent\" (p. 576). However, Dynarski's analysis counts the additional human capital created by the programs as a social benefit regardless of where graduates locate. A goal for future research is a cost-benefit analysis from a state's perspective that takes into account the postcollege locations of college graduates. Although some questions remain unanswered, the empirical evidence currently available suggests that broad-based merit-aid programs may not be a cost-effective way for a state to increase its supply of college-educated labor. These programs appear to increase participation in postsecondary education, but most of the money goes to students who would have attended college anyway (Cornwell et al., 2006;Dynarski, 2008). Among those students, the programs appear to have a large effect on the choice to attend college in state, but the ultimate effect of that shift on retention in the state's workforce is modest. Given these findings, basing state financial aid on need rather than merit might be a more effective way to promote the supply of college-educated labor in a state. This is because need-based aid is targeted to students who are likely to be at the participation margin, which not only improves targeting but also lowers costs (Doyle, 2008). However, evidence from the introduction of the Pell Grant program (in 1972), currently the largest source of need-based federal grant aid, is mixed. Hansen (1983) and Kane (1995) found no impact on the enrollment rates of low-income recent high school graduates, but Seftor and Turner (2002) found positive effects on the enrollment of older, nontraditional students. Need-based state aid programs began in most states in the 1960s and 1970s (Doyle, 2008); even with the recent rise in merit-based aid since 1990, need-based aid still comprises 73% of all state grant aid to undergraduates (NASSGAP, 2008)."}, {"section_title": "Location-Contingent Financial Aid", "text": "In contrast to merit-aid programs, other state aid programs make a direct connection between receiving aid and working in the state after graduation. These programs are usually smaller in scale than broad-based merit-aid programs, and many are targeted to particular fields, such as medical services, teaching, or science and technology. Though these programs currently constitute only a small share of total state spending on student financial aid, they are relevant for this review because of their design and because of recent interest in them from policy makers (Jaschik, 2007;Redden, 2007). 14 There are two types of location-contingent aid in place at the undergraduate level. One type provides a scholarship during college in exchange for a commitment to work in the state after graduation; students who do not fulfill the work requirement must repay the scholarship. For example, the Maryland Science and Technology Scholarship provided up to $3,000 per year for use in eligible academic programs at any Maryland 4-year institution. Recipients must work in Maryland after graduation 1 year for each year they receive the scholarship; those who fail to meet the service obligation must repay the scholarship (National Governors Association, 1998). The second type of location-contingent aid provides subsidies not during but after college, in the form of repayments of student loans. For example, Maine enacted a program in 2007 to provide a tax credit of up to $5,500 per year in loan-repayment assistance to anyone who earns a bachelor's degree from a Maine college (public or private), stays in Maine after graduation, and has loan debt (beginning with loans originating in January 2008). 15 Compared with other location-contingent aid programs, the Maine program is notable for being available to students regardless of their field of study. Location-contingent aid programs for undergraduate education are relatively new and, to my knowledge, have not been subject to formal evaluations. However, some lessons can be gleaned from the experience with contingent aid programs in other educational settings. Field (2009) examined a financial aid experiment at a law school involving two alternative aid packages assigned by lottery to a set of admitted students. The packages had equivalent monetary value but differed in the timing of payments and debt. One package required the student to take on a loan that would be repaid by the school if he or she worked in publicinterest law. The other package covered tuition but required the student to reimburse the school if he or she did not work in public-interest law. The tuition assistance approach was much more effective: Recipients had a higher placement rate into public-interest law and (when lottery results were announced prior to enrollment) were more likely to enroll in law school. The greater effectiveness of the tuition assistance approach might result from a student's aversion to debt or from psychological factors related to the way choices over debt are framed at career entry and exit. The federal government operates several programs to encourage primary care physicians and other health care practitioners to work in underserved areas. The most visible federal program is the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), which is operated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The two components of the NHSC parallel the types of location-contingent aid in place at the undergraduate level. The NHSC Scholarship Program, established in 1972, provides a full scholarship to medical students in exchange for a commitment to work in an underserved geographic area following graduation and the completion of residency training. The NHSC Loan Repayment Program, established in 1987, recruits already-trained clinicians (physicians and related professionals) to work in underserved areas in exchange for annual payments against students loans. By 1998, the NHSC had supported more than 42,000 clinician years of service and 15,000 scholarships (Mullan, 1999). 16 Studies of the recruitment of physicians to rural areas have consistently found that rural upbringing is positively associated with physicians choosing rural communities for their initial practice sites (Brooks, Walsh, Mardon, Lewis, & Clawson, 2002). Studies of the NHSC throughout the 1990s have shown that, although this program has brought physicians into rural and underserved areas in large numbers, the turnover of physicians once they complete their service obligation is high (Brooks et al., 2002). For instance, a study of primary care doctors who entered rural practices in the late 1970s and early 1980s found that those serving NHSC obligations (nearly all through the NHSC Scholarship Program) were less likely to remain in rural practice compared with those who voluntarily chose rural practice (Pathman, Konrad, & Ricketts, 1992). An analysis by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) suggests that the loan repayment program is better than the scholarship program at recruiting physicians to shortage areas and retaining them there: 12% of scholarship recipients breached their contract to serve between 1980 and 1999, compared with only 3% of loan repayment recipients since that program began in 1987 (U.S. GAO, 1995GAO, , 2000. 17 Using data from 1991 to 1993, GAO found that 48% of loan repayment recipients were still at the same site 1 year after fulfilling their obligation, compared with only 27% for scholarship recipients. 18 The inferior outcomes for scholarship recipients likely reflect the fact that they must enter into their contracts up to 7 years or more before beginning their service obligation, during which time their professional interests and personal circumstances may change. In contrast, loan repayment recipients do not commit to service until after they have completed medical school and residency. In the context of financing undergraduate education, location-contingent aid could be a vehicle for states to provide funding for college while providing incentives to reside in a state after college (either because loans get repaid or because scholarships do not have to be repaid). However, there are a number of issues that should be considered in designing these programs for the undergraduate context. The discussion that follows highlights administrative costs, debt levels, and the types of students who choose to participate in these programs. Comparing scholarships and loan repayments, there is a large difference in administrative costs between the two when the service requirement is not met. Under loan repayment, this case is simple: the state does not repay loans. But with scholarships, the money has already been spent so the state would have to collect some of the scholarship; this process could be messy and costly. This process is analogous to what is called clawback in the context of economic development incentives provided by state and local governments. Clawback provisions provide recourse for governments to reclaim all or part of a public subsidy when a firm relocates or fails to create a certain number of jobs (Ledebur & Woodward, 1990;Peters, 1993). In the undergraduate case, service requirements would be broken in many cases because students failed to graduate. This consideration is important given the large amount of attrition that occurs. About 50% of students who enroll at a 4-year college do not go on to earn a bachelor's degree (National Center for Education Statistics, 2002); by comparison, only about 5% of entering medical students fail to complete an MD (Association of American Medical Colleges, 2007). To ensure clawback in the case of attrition (and other breaches of the service requirement), scholarships would need to contain complicated provisions. This facet could discourage eligible students from accepting these scholarships in light of the evidence that complexity in the aid process limits the take-up of student loans and grants by the target population (Dynarski & Scott-Clayton, 2008). In addition to attrition, another difference between undergraduate education and medical school is the amount of debt taken on by students. Medical students typically have greater debt burdens at graduation, consistent with the payment of higher tuition. 19 Medical students have an average debt of approximately $80,000 at graduation (Association of American Medical Colleges, 1998). College graduates, in contrast, have lower debt levels at graduation. Among 1999-2000 bachelor's degree recipients, 65% had borrowed and the average amount borrowed was $19,300 (National Center for Education Statistics, 2004); thus, the average debt at graduation for all students (including those with no debt) was about $12,500. As a result, the scope for loan repayments as a vehicle for locationspecific subsidies is much less among college graduates than among MD recipients. Plainly, an offer to repay loan debt would provide little incentive for college graduates who had no debt or small amounts of it. In contrast, a more direct financial incentive, such as cash payments or income tax deductions, would appeal to a broader range of graduates. This is consistent with a proposal in 2001 by the governor of Iowa to provide tax credits to graduates of Iowa colleges who settle in the state (\"Iowa: Governor,\" 2001). Another important issue in the potential effectiveness of location-contingent aid programs is the composition of students who choose to participate in these programs. Because the programs provide funding for locating in a particular state, they appear to appeal more to students who already have plans to locate in the state, either because of location preferences (e.g., wanting to be close to family) or because of occupational choice (e.g., the state has many jobs in chemical engineering). To the extent this occurs, it would limit the program's causal effect on the geographic distribution of college graduates. Said another way, most of the money spent on these programs could go to people who would locate in the state anyway. The size of a program could be an important factor in the balance between selection and causal effects, with the selection effect being larger in smaller programs. Another factor in this regard could be whether aid is targeted to specific fields of study."}, {"section_title": "Adjustments to the Composition of Enrollment", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Mix of In-State and Out-of-State Students", "text": "As the debate over merit-based scholarships demonstrates, some state policy makers are focused on retaining home-grown students in the state for college and for the workforce. But students who were raised in other states are also relevant prospects for the future supply of college-educated labor in a state. Attending college in a state could encourage these students to permanently relocate to the state. The mix of in-state students and out-of-state students can be affected by admission standards (Groen & White, 2004) and tuition levels (Rizzo & Ehrenberg, 2004;Zhang, 2007). 20 Groen and White (2004) found that public universities usually set lower minimum admission standards for in-state applicants than out-of-state applicants. This outcome is likely the result of state pressure to favor in-state students, including explicit quotas on admissions of out-of-state students. But is favoring in-state students consistent with a state's long-term financial interest? According to the model in Groen and White, if states would like to maximize the present value of future state tax revenues, they would like their universities to set standards such that the additional expected future state tax revenue from the marginal student admitted is the same for in-state and out-of-state students. (Marginal students are those just meeting the academic standard for admission.) As a result, the state's preferred mix of in-state students and out-of-state students depends on how attending college in a state affects marginal students' probability of working in that state. Estimates from the College and Beyond database (for students who applied to colleges in more than one state) indicate that the size of this effect is similar for marginal instate and out-of-state students. For marginal in-state students, attending college in a state increases the probability of working in the state 20 years after college by 11 percentage points (from 0.34 to 0.45); the comparable increase for marginal out-of-state students is 10 percentage points (from 0.04 to 0.14). 21 Given that the location effects are similar, states would maximize expected future tax payments by having their public universities set equal minimum standards for in-state and outof-state applicants. Under the usual practice of favoring in-state applicants, marginal out-of-state students have higher earnings and, thus, pay more in future state taxes than do marginal instate students. Average lifetime state tax payments for marginal out-of-state students at public universities were $227,000, compared with only $185,000 for marginal in-state students. 22 Therefore, the additional expected future state tax revenue is greater for marginal out-of-state students than for marginal in-state students. As a result, total expected future state tax payments (by graduates from a given university) would increase if universities shifted their admissions toward equal minimum standards for in-state and out-of-state applicants."}, {"section_title": "Mix of Students by Field of Study", "text": "States may also consider adjusting the composition of enrollment by field of study to influence the supply of collegeeducated labor. In their study of the growth of public higher education from 1890 to 1940, Goldin and Katz (1999) argued that a primary reason for state support to higher education during this period was to provide goods and services of value to citizens and local industrial interests. One of those goods and services was training in fields in which the state's economy was specialized. In states having a concentration of economic activity in particular industries (or products), the public sector often invested heavily in training and research in these industries. For example, Wisconsin subsidized work on dairy products, North Carolina on tobacco, and Colorado on mining. Because public universities provided training in fields that their states specialized in, graduates tended to remain in the state; this allowed states to capture the benefits of their investments. Consistent with this argument, Goldin and Katz found that the shares of employment in mining, manufacturing, and agriculture were positively related to state support for higher education over this period. As state economies have become more diversified over time, the rationale for states to target particular industries in their funding of higher education has presumably become less important. Though there are still some regional specializations (e.g., forestry in Michigan), most universities offer training in a wide range of subjects. Still, targeting specific industries is in line with the finding that the elasticity of demand for college-educated labor is greater for degree types more likely to be employed in the production of traded goods (Bound et al., 2004). If a state were to shift the composition of degrees awarded by its universities toward degree types employed in the traded-goods sector, then the relative stock of collegeeducated labor would be more responsive to changes in the relative flow of bachelor's degrees. In addition, targeting particular industries within higher education policy has a demandside rationale as well as a supply-side rationale (Dewan, 2009;Saxenian, 1996)."}, {"section_title": "Other Retention and Recruitment Policies", "text": "Some states have promoted internships for college students as a vehicle for encouraging graduates of colleges in their states to remain in the state after graduation. In these programs, states function as intermediaries between students seeking internships and employers seeking interns. States hope that internships will engage students with state-based employers and promote the development of location-specific human capital that will encourage them to stay in the state after graduation. For example, Pennsylvania's SciTech Scholarship included an internship component with a location-contingent scholarship (National Governors Association, 2000). The scholarship provided up to $3,000 per year for Pennsylvania residents to pursue a bachelor's degree in an approved science and technology field at a Pennsylvania institution. Students must complete an internship with a Pennsylvania company, and after graduation they must work in Pennsylvania 1 year for each year of scholarship assistance. If these requirements are not met, the scholarship converts to a loan. Apart from this particular scholarship, Pennsylvania promoted internships as part of its \"Stay and Invent the Future\" initiative that was designed to reverse the net outward migration of college graduates from the state (Wirtz, 2003). In other respects, this initiative is a marketing campaign that promotes Pennsylvania as a great place to live, work, and play. Related initiatives in other states seek to appeal to those who had previously lived in the state. For instance, in 1998 the state of Michigan mailed recruitment letters to engineering graduates who had left the state (Durbin, 2000). Other state programs go beyond providing information and promoting the state's image. North Dakota, South Dakota, and Vermont all had formal programs that augmented marketing efforts with job-search assistance by matching participants with job openings from state-based employers (Dougherty, 2007). These programs target those with ties to the state to return to the state."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Evidence from cross-state variation indicates a positive association between the production of bachelor's degrees by institutions in a state and the stock of college graduates living in the state. However, this relationship is much less than one-for-one, which suggests the importance of the geographic mobility of college graduates. Although states appear to have a limited ability to affect human-capital levels through a general expansion of degree production, other activities of colleges and universities may be important to state economic development. For instance, universities might promote economic growth through relationships between university research and local industry (e.g., Governor of New York, 2009;Hill & Lendel, 2007;Jaffe, Trajtenberg, & Henderson, 1993). The empirical evidence on broad-based merit aid raises questions about the cost effectiveness of these state scholarship programs as vehicles for increasing the supply of college-educated labor in a state. These programs appear to increase participation in postsecondary education, but most of the money goes to students who would have attended college anyway. Among those students, the programs appear to have a large effect on the choice to attend college in state, but the ultimate effect of that shift on retention in the state's workforce is modest. Identifying and measuring the effects of merit-aid programs on the local stock of college-educated labor is complicated, and more research is needed. Also needed is research on the effectiveness of state need-based grant programs at encouraging low-income students to attend college and graduate. Locationcontingent aid offers an alternative way for states to structure financial assistance to undergraduate students, but these programs have yet to be rigorously evaluated. State policy makers often discuss the migration of college graduates with an exclusive focus on brain drain-the outward migration of college graduates who were either raised in the state or attended college in the state. This group is important for both practical reasons (these graduates are good candidates to return) and political reasons (their parents often still reside in the state). However, from an economic perspective, a college graduate trained in another state is just as valuable as one trained locally. Plainly, every state has some residents who were educated in other states; one state's brain drain is another state's brain gain. Furthermore, the evolution of the stock of college-educated labor in a state depends on the net migration of college-educated workers (i.e., the difference between inflows and outflows). Outflows are inevitable, but they can be compensated for by inflows (see Deitz, 2007). Many analyses of higher education policy consider one state in isolation and assume that policies in other states will not change. However, in reality a policy change by one state is often followed by policy changes in other states (Besley & Case, 1995), and these responses can alter the impact of the initial policy change. This possibility is particularly relevant to the policies discussed here because students' choice of college and graduates' choice of work location both depend not just on their opportunities in any one state but on their relative opportunities in many states. For instance, the spread of merit-aid policies throughout the Southeastern states amounts to a competition for highability students. 23 Georgia implemented its merit-aid program in 1993 and witnessed an increase in the average ability of college freshmen in its public institutions (Cornwell et al., 2006). But when neighboring states later enacted their own merit-aid programs, many high-ability students in these states chose to attend home-state colleges rather than Georgia colleges, which may have dissipated some of Georgia's initial gains. 24 In the long run, the number of high-ability students attending college in a given state might be little different from the number before the wave of merit-aid plans. Meanwhile, the changes might have worsened the matching of students to colleges because students selected their colleges based more on financial considerations than other factors. 9.

Data from the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs (NASSGAP) provide a rough estimate of the size of location-contingent aid programs. In the NASSGAP survey, the two types of contingent programs are referred to as \"conditional grants\" and \"loan assumption/forgiveness.\" Together these types of programs accounted for 10.2% of state nongrant student aid in the 2007-2008 academic year and 2.0% of total state-funded student financial aid (NASSGAP, 2008). 15. Based on the Opportunity Maine website (http://www.opportunity maine.org; accessed April 14, 2009). The bill that created the program was signed into law in July 2007. 16. Programs designed to influence the geographic distribution of the health care workforce are also funded by state governments (Pathman et al., 2000). The most common of the state programs are those similar to the two NHSC programs, in which financial support is provided to students and health care practitioners in exchange for a period of service in underserved communities. States also have programs to provide loans to medical students that are to be repaid after training (either financially or by providing service), as well as direct financial-incentive programs that are similar to loan repayment programs except that funds are used to pay practitioners directly rather than to pay educational debt. 17. U.S. General Accounting Office (2000, pp. 14-15). 18. U.S. General Accounting Office (2000, p. 15). 19. For the academic year 1996-1997, tuition for medical students was roughly 1.4 to 3.3 times tuition for undergraduate students, depending on institution type. For institutions offering both bachelor's and MD degrees, private universities charged on average a tuition of $18,235 in undergraduate programs and $25,655 in MD programs; public universities charged nonresidents on average a tuition of $8,668 in undergraduate programs and $22,353 in MD programs; and public universities charged residents on average a tuition of $3,140 in undergraduate programs and $10,398 in MD programs. Data for tuition and fees in MD programs are from the Association of American Medical Colleges and the corresponding undergraduate data are from the U.S. Department of Education. 20. Though nonresident tuition is typically much higher than resident tuition, the differential between these two charges is smaller at universities that participate in tuition reciprocity agreements. One type of reciprocity agreement is a bilateral agreement that is negotiated between two states; an example of this type is the agreement between Minnesota and Wisconsin, which goes back to 1968 (DesJardins, 1999). Another type is consortium agreements, in which a number of states in a geographic region are treated similarly under the agreement; an example is the Academic Common Market, which is administered by the Southern Regional Education Board and covers institutions in 16 states. 21. Groen and White (2004, table 2). 22. Groen and White (2004, table 3). 23. See McLendon, Heller, and Young (2005) and Doyle (2006) for analyses of interactions among states in establishing merit-aid programs and other higher education policies. Zhang and Ness (2010) discuss the difficulty of estimating the effects of a given state's merit-aid program when other states in the same region also have merit-aid programs. 24. In principle, a merit-aid program in a state provides an incentive for entire families to migrate into that state in order to make the children eligible for the scholarships. However, this incentive would be moderated (or eliminated) if other states enact their own merit-aid programs."}]
