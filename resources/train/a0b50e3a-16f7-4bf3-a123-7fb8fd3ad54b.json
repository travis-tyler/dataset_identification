The science practices and cognitive demands are explained more fully in chapter three."}, {"section_title": "DISTRIBUTION OF ITEMS", "text": "As measured by student response time, the distribution of items by content area should be as follows: approximately equal across Physical Science, Life Science, and Earth and Space Sciences at grade 4; more emphasis on Earth and Space Sciences at grade 8; and a shift to more emphasis on Physical Science and Life Science at grade 12. With respect to science practices, at all grades the greatest emphasis should be on identifying and using science principles and slightly less than a third of the time should be spent on items related to using scientific inquiry. Specific recommended percentages are discussed in chapter four.\nThis section recommends appropriate item distributions. The three types of distribution, as measured by percentage of student response time at each grade level, are as follows: \u2022 Items by content area-Physical Science, Life Science, and Earth and Space Sciences NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK \u2022 Items by science practice-Identifying Science Principles, Using Science Principles, Using Scientific Inquiry, and Using Technological Design \u2022 Items by type-Selected-response items and constructed-response items"}, {"section_title": "TYPES OF ITEMS", "text": "Item types for the 2009 NAEP Science Assessment fall into two broad categories: selected-response items (such as multiple choice) and constructed-response items (such as short answer). As measured by student response time, 50 percent of the assessment items at each grade level should be selected response and 50 percent should be constructed response. To further probe students' abilities to combine their understanding with the investigative skills that reflect practices, a subset of the students sampled should receive an additional 30 minutes to complete hands-on performance or interactive computer tasks. At each grade, at least four of these tasks should be included. Of these four tasks, there should be at least one hands-on performance and one interactive computer task; the number of interactive computer tasks should not exceed the number of hands-on performance tasks. Chapter four contains more information about types of items.\nThe judicious selection of items lies at the heart of any effective assessment of science achievement. The Framework for the 1996-2005 NAEP Science Assessments called for multiple-choice items (selected response), open-ended paper-and-pencil items (constructed response), and performance exercises. Multiple-choice items made up about 40 percent of the assessment, as measured by student response time, and open-response items made up about 60 percent of assessment time. In addition, subsets of the students sampled were given an extra 20 minutes in grade 4 and 30 minutes in grades 8 and 12 to complete hands-on performance tasks. This framework generally follows the 1996-2005 recommendations in item structure but also specifies additional item types-some selected response and others constructed response. As noted above, the 2009 recommendation for item distribution by item format, in terms of student response time, is 50 percent selected response and 50 percent constructed response. Two additional considerations are the need to develop items that probe students' ability to use communication skills and quantitative reasoning skills in science (see p. 64). Although this framework does not prescribe the amount of assessment time to be spent on items that require specific forms of communication or application of mathematics, it is expected that items requiring these skills will be represented at all three grade levels. Further details will be provided in the specifications."}, {"section_title": "Hands-on Performance Tasks", "text": "In hands-on performance tasks, students manipulate selected physical objects and try to solve a scientific problem involving the objects. NAEP hands-on performance tasks should provide students with a concrete task (problem) along with equipment and materials. Students should be given the opportunity to determine scientifically justifiable procedures for arriving at a solution. Students' scores should be based on both the solution and the procedures created for carrying out the investigation. Further discussion about hands-on performance tasks can be found in chapter four."}, {"section_title": "Interactive Computer Tasks", "text": "There are four types of interactive computer tasks: (1) information search and analysis, (2) empirical investigation, (3) simulation, and (4) concept maps. Information search and analysis items pose a scientific problem and ask students to query an information database and analyze relevant data to address the problem. Empirical investigation items place hands-on performance tasks on the computer and invite students to design and conduct a study to draw conclusions about a problem. Simulation items model systems (e.g., food webs) and ask students to manipulate variables, and predict and explain resulting changes in the system. Concept map items probe aspects of the structure or organization of students' scientific knowledge by providing concept terms and having students create a logical graphic organizer. Chapter four contains more information about interactive computer tasks.\nThe 2009 NAEP Science Assessment should include some but not necessarily all of the following four types of ICTs: (1) information search and analysis, (2) empirical investigation, (3) simulation, and (4) concept mapping.

Group 2 special studies are discussed in appendix D."}, {"section_title": "NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK", "text": "\n\u2022 Each achievement level-Basic, Proficient, and Advanced-includes a range of items assessing various levels of cognitive knowledge that is broad enough to ensure each knowledge level is measured with the same degree of accuracy. Descriptions of Basic, Proficient, and Advanced must be as clear as possible. \u2022 Connections among the framework, the specifications, and the assessment items themselves are transparent, coherent, and have a consistent level of specificity. The specifications should be written with detail consistent with the framework. The content addressed in the specifications should reflect the standards and focus on the significant information and knowledge that students should retain over time (e.g., big ideas, fundamental understandings). The verbs used in the specifications should describe the expected target for assessment (e.g., identify, describe, evaluate, relate, analyze, and demonstrate). The content expectations should match in level of specificity and scope across the disciplines. The specifications should follow the idea of learning progressions. To assess overarching concepts or themes, the specifications should reflect a layered understanding of growth in knowledge of the concepts. \u2022 The framework addresses the use of assessment data to conduct research on science learning and to improve science achievement. Data (background variables) from the assessment should be collected in a way that provides details about the characteristics of the students being assessed (e.g., race/ethnicity and gender), the academic preparation of their teachers, and the nature of their schools. Such data provide feedback to educators for improving science instruction and learning.\nThe content statements are organized according to the three broad content areas that generally comprise the K-12 school curriculum: \u2022 Physical Science \u2022 Life Science \u2022 Earth and Space Sciences Classifying content statements into one content area is not always clearcut, but doing so helps ensure the areas of science are assessed in a balanced way. Some common content is found to be significant in each of the three content areas (e.g., energy conservation and its associated principles are applicable to the living and nonliving systems studied by physical, life, and Earth scientists). This crosscutting content is further described in chapter two. The content statements are derived from National Standards and Benchmarks and are informed by international frameworks and state standards. Content statements have been added where warranted by advances in science since the development of the standards documents. The selection of science content statements to be assessed at each grade level focuses on principles central to each discipline, tracks related ideas across grade levels, and limits the breadth of science knowledge to be assessed. The selection of content statements used an iterative approach and took into account the many perspectives of various stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\nExhibit 8. Physical Science content statements for grades 4, 8, and 12 (cont.)\nExhibit 8. Physical Science content statements for grades 4, 8, and 12 (cont.)\nExhibit 8.

The following item illustrates the expectation that students will predict phenomena.\nThe following item set illustrates a combination of Identifying Science Principles and Using Science Principles. It also addresses the expectation that students interpret data presented in a graph and use the data to perform a mathematical calculation.\nThe following middle school (grade 8) item illustrates the expectation that students will conduct scientific investigations. By manipulating the simulation, students gather data and solve the problems that are presented.\n\nUsing Scientific Inquiry 1. Given a data table showing the mass of grass plants of each type grown in the sunlight and shade, draw conclusions about which variety of grass is better adapted to each condition. 2. List other variables that should be controlled in order to feel confident about your conclusions. The first performance is related to the content statement in that the importance of light for plant growth is useful background information for students. However, the performance requires interpretation of new information (the data table) that has to do with differences among types of plants, while the content statement contains generalizations about all plants. Thus, the performance requires students to use the data to develop new knowledge that they did not have previously. The second performance is in part an assessment of the students' understanding of experimental design. However, good answers would also require knowledge of this and related content statements to identify variables that are relevant to plant growth.\nThe content statements from chapter two on which these performance expectations are based are written in general terms. The process of creating performance expectations requires further clarification of the content statements themselves. As described in chapter two, this involves \"detailing\" the meanings of the content statements and setting boundaries on the content to be assessed at a given grade level. Moreover, if the crossing of content statements with practices were done for every science content statement and practice, the number of performance expectations generated could be unmanageably large. Exhibit 15 provides selected example performance expectations for a single Earth and space sciences content statement. The specifications include additional examples. These examples are illustrative, not exhaustive. It is expected that assessment developers will continue this process for all content and practices sampled for a particular NAEP Science Assessment. Performance expectations are written with particular verbs indicating the desired performance expected of the student. The action verbs associated with each practice are not firmly fixed, and the use of any action verb must be contextualized. For example, when the science practice component \"conduct scientific investigations\" is crossed with a states-of-matter content statement, it can generate a performance expectation that employs a different action verb, such as \"heats as a way to evaporate liquids.\"\n\n\n\nInformation search and analysis items pose a scientific problem and ask students to query an information database to bring conceptual and empirical information to bear (through analysis) on the problem. Following is a screen shot from such an ICT developed for eighth graders.\nAccording to the National Research Council: Fairness, like validity, cannot be properly addressed as an afterthought once the test has been developed, administered, and used. It must be confronted throughout the interconnected phases of the testing process, from test design and development to administration, scoring, interpretation, and use (1999b, pp. 80-81). When assessments are first conceptualized, they must be thought of in the context of the entire population that will be assessed (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological Association, and National Council on Measurement in Education 1999;NRC 1999a;Thompson, Johnstone, and Thurlow 2002). NAEP assessments, as well as all large-scale assessments, must be responsive to growing demands: increased diversity, increased inclusion of all types of students in the general curriculum, and increased emphasis and commitment to serve and be accountable for all students. Assessments must measure the performance of students who have a wide range of abilities and skills, ensuring that those with diverse learning needs receive opportunities to demonstrate competence on the same content as all other students. Students with disabilities and English language learners each present challenges in how their science competencies can be assessed in a valid manner. Nevertheless, these groups share some commonalities, including considerable heterogeneity in each group regarding assessment needs. In addition: \u2022 Conceptual frameworks based on appropriate theories of language development and proficiency and of various forms of disabilities will be needed to build inclusive assessments. \u2022 A greater commitment to financial and human resources will be needed to develop, administer, and interpret performance on relevant tasks. Two general recommendations pertain to both groups in the context of good assessment design for all students: readability of written text and alignment to content statements. Students' ability to read and respond to written text often determines successful performance on assessments. Assessment items may pose an unfair disadvantage for some students if there is a heavy burden on reading skills when reading is not the goal of the assessment. Language that is both straightforward and concise and that uses everyday words to convey meaning is needed. The goal of ensuring that language has these characteristics is to improve the comprehensibility of written text and at the same time preserve the essence of its meaning. Using language that reduces the linguistic demands placed on students reduces the effect of reading skills and language proficiency on students' science performance and assessment scores. More information on reading level is provided in the specifications. NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK Items on the NAEP Science Assessment must be aligned to the content statements and science practices with the same depth and breadth of coverage and the same cognitive demands as specified in the framework. Assessment design should emphasize accessibility using different formats, technologies, designs, and accommodations to include as many students as possible. It must be clear from the outset that, to be equitable, assessments need to measure the achievement of all students on the same content and achievement standards. To these ends, field tests should sample every type of student expected to participate in the final assessment administration, including students with a wide range of disabilities, English language learners, and students across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic lines. Field testing NAEP items with a broad range of students will not only help determine whether items are unclear, misleading, or inaccessible for certain groups of students, but will also help ensure that assessment procedures are accessible to students when the NAEP Science Assessment is fully implemented. More information about these recommendations can be found in the specifications. NAEP strives to assess all students selected by its sampling process. Rigorous criteria are applied to minimize the number of English language learners and students with disabilities who are excluded from NAEP assessments. Participating students with special needs are permitted to use accommodations, as stated in current NAEP policy: All special-needs students may use the same accommodations in NAEP assessments that they use in their usual classroom testing unless the accommodation would make it impossible to measure the ability, skill, or proficiency being assessed, or the accommodation is not possible for the NAEP program to administer (NCES 2005a). See the specifications for more information on NAEP's inclusion policy and permitted accommodations.\n\u2022 understand and apply knowledge of links and commonalities of science across fields The scientific disciplines are no longer practiced in isolation, and research that cuts across discipline boundaries is common. The framework should: \u2022 identify some of the science concepts and skills that cut across the assessed content areas; \u2022 address science in both the natural and designed world; and \u2022 clearly define and identify commonalities and differences between \"science\" and \"technology\" or \"technological design.\" The framework should also address social and historical contexts, which are keys to understanding how the scientific community has arrived at its current body of knowledge.\n\nAnnotated example of a 2-point response: Explanation of how planting trees could benefit the natural ecosystem: The ecosystem will rebuild more quickly, and that would give the animals a new habitat more quickly.\nItem Source: Persky et al. 2005 (framework, p. 103)."}, {"section_title": "CONTRIBUTING GROUPS", "text": "In developing this framework, the Governing Board benefited from the extraordinary efforts of hundreds of individuals and organizations across the nation. Although these individuals and organizations provided valuable comments and feedback on draft documents, they were not asked to endorse the final version of this framework. The Governing Board wishes to acknowledge their contributions by listing them below. Although every effort has been made to ensure the list is accurate and comprehensive, we apologize for any omissions or errors. In addition, the Governing Board received feedback on the draft framework via hundreds of individual letters and e-mails. The authors of these letters and e-mails included scientists; teachers; university administrators and professors; education researchers; curriculum developers; assessment and measurement specialists; and representatives from science industry, museums and science centers, community interest groups, professional organizations, and government agencies at the federal, state, and district levels. NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK xix CHAPTER ONE OVERVIEW NAEP measures student science achievement nationally, state by state, and, most recently, across selected urban school districts. Periodically, the framework underlying the science assessment is revised or updated. This document, Science Framework for the 2009 National Assessment of Educational Progress, contains a new set of recommendations for the NAEP Science Assessment to be administered in 2009 and beyond. The framework provides guidance on the science content to be assessed, the types of assessment questions, and the administration of the assessment. For more than 35 years, NAEP has gathered information on student achievement in selected academic subjects. Originally, assessments were age-based samples of 9-, 13-, and 17-year-old students. Beginning in 1983, the assessment also has included grade-based samples of students in grades 4, 8, and 12. Currently, long-term trend NAEP continues to assess 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds in mathematics and reading, while main NAEP assesses students in grades 4, 8, and 12. More information about differences between long-term trend and main NAEP can be found on the Internet at http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/about/ltt_main_diff.asp (NCES 2005b). NAEP has become an important source of information on what U.S. students know and are able to do in reading, mathematics, science, U.S. history, writing, and other subjects. In addition, NAEP provides information on how student performance has changed over time. Since the 1990s, in addition to the national-level assessments, NAEP has conducted and reported state-level assessments at grades 4 and 8 in reading, mathematics, writing, and science. State-level as well as national science assessments were conducted in 1996, 2000, and 2005. The resulting data on student knowledge and performance have been accompanied by background information that allows analyses of a number of student demographic and instructional factors related to achievement. The assessments have been designed to allow comparisons of student performance over time and among subgroups of students according to region, parental education, gender, and race/ethnicity. In 2002, NAEP began a Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA) in districts that volunteered to participate. TUDA has continued through 2005, when 10 districts took part in NAEP assessments that produced district-level results."}, {"section_title": "NEED FOR A NEW FRAMEWORK", "text": "The framework that guided the last three NAEP Science Assessments (administered in 1996, 2000, and 2005) was developed some 15 years ago. Since then, the following developments have taken place, making it necessary to create a new framework for assessing science in 2009 and beyond: NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK \u2022 Publication (for the first time) of National Standards for science literacy in National Science Education Standards (National Research Council [NRC] 1996) (National Standards) and Benchmarks for Scientific Literacy (American Association for the Advancement of Science [AAAS] 1993) (Benchmarks). Since their publication, these two national documents have informed state science standards. \u2022 Advances in science research (e.g., on the relationship between human activity and the natural world) that have increased knowledge and, as a consequence, have influenced the school curriculum in the fields of physical, life, and Earth and Space Sciences. \u2022 Advances in cognitive research (e.g., on how students learn increasingly complex material over time) that have yielded new insights into how and what students learn about science (NRC 1999c). \u2022 Growth in the prevalence of science assessments nationally and internation ally, including the requirements in the current federal education legislation (No Child Left Behind) for science assessment starting in 2007, the ongoing international assessment (TIMSS) (http://timss.bc.edu), and PISA (www.pisa.oecd.org). \u2022 Growth in innovative assessment approaches that probe students' understanding of science in greater depth than before (e.g., clusters of items tapping students' conceptions of the natural world), sometimes with the use of computer technology (NRC 2001). \u2022 Increased inclusion of formerly excluded groups in science assessments (e.g., students with disabilities and English language learners), requiring a new assessment to be as accessible as possible and also to incorporate accommodations so the widest possible range of students can be fairly assessed. Accommodations should not alter the science constructs being measured."}, {"section_title": "CONTEXT FOR PLANNING THE FRAMEWORK", "text": "Any NAEP framework must be guided by NAEP purposes as well as the policies and procedures of the Governing Board, which oversees NAEP. For the NAEP Science Assessment, the main purpose of the framework is to establish what students should know and be able to do in science for the 2009 and future assessments. Meeting this purpose requires a framework built around what communities involved in science and science education consider as a rigorous body of science knowledge and skills that are most important for NAEP to assess. In prioritizing the content, the framework developers used the NAEP Science Assessment steering committee guidelines (presented later in this chapter), which recommended the two national documents (National Standards and Benchmarks) as representative of the leading science communities and their expectations for what students should know and be NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK able to do in science. As curriculum frameworks, however, these documents cover a very wide range of science content and performance. The inclusive nature of both documents demonstrates the difficulty of identifying a key body of knowledge for students to learn in science and, therefore, what should be assessed. Neither document limits or prioritizes content as is necessary for developing an assessment, posing a considerable challenge to the framework developers. The development of the framework also was informed by research in science and science education, best practices, international assessment frameworks, and state standards."}, {"section_title": "THE FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT PROCESS", "text": "In September 2004, the Governing Board awarded a contract to WestEd and CCSSO to develop a recommended framework and specifications. WestEd and CCSSO, in collaboration with AAAS, the Council of State Science Supervisors (CSSS), and the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA), used a process designed to accomplish the purposes of this project with special attention given to the assessment issues specific to K-12 science achievement. The process for developing the framework and related products was inclusive and deliberate, designed to achieve as much broad-based input as possible. A two-tiered committee structure, consisting of a steering committee and a planning committee, provided the expertise to develop the framework as specified by the Governing Board. (See \"NAEP Science Project Staff and Committees\" for lists of committee members.) The two committees were composed of members who were diverse in terms of role, gender, race/ethnicity, region of the country, perspective, and expertise regarding the content of the assessment to be developed. The science assessment steering committee included leaders in science, science education, general education, assessment, and various public constituencies and set the course for the project. Functioning as a policy and oversight body, this group developed a charge that outlined the planning committee's responsibilities in developing the framework. The committee also reviewed and provided feedback on drafts of the framework and related materials. The science assessment planning committee, supported by the project staff, was the development and production group responsible for drafting the framework, the Specifications, recommendations for background variables, designs for one or more small-scale studies, and preliminary science achievement level descriptions. This committee was made up of science teachers, district and state science personnel, science educators in higher education, scientists, and assessment experts. The planning committee's work was guided by policies, goals, and principles identified by the steering committee. In addition, the planning committee used a number of resources to facilitate its work. These resources included an issues and recommendations paper (Champagne et al. 2004) developed specifically for this NAEP project; the frameworks and specifications for the 2005 NAEP Mathematics Assessment and 1996-2005 NAEP Science Assessments; other NAEP reports and documents produced by the Governing Board and NCES; international NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK assessment frameworks; syntheses of state and national curriculum standards; and research papers and resources provided by steering and planning committee members and project staff. The structure for conducting the work consisted of a series of meetings. From December 2004 through September 2005, the steering committee met three times and the planning committee met six times; two of the steering committee meetings overlapped with planning committee meetings. Governing Board staff supported and participated in the work of the committees during the meetings. In addition, between formal work sessions, Governing Board members and staff provided ongoing feedback and guidance on project documents and processes. During spring 2005, CCSSO led a series of outreach efforts to solicit feedback on draft versions of the framework. Formal activities included the following: \u2022 A series of 13 regional meetings held across the country and hosted by CCSSO and CSSS members \u2022 A national meeting of CSSS representatives \u2022 A Web-based survey of science teachers distributed through NSTA \u2022 An invitational science and industry feedback forum held in Atlanta, GA, in conjunction with a Governing Board meeting These activities are discussed in A Summary of National Feedback Provided on Preliminary Drafts Gathered from Surveys and Regional and National Feedback Meetings (CCSSO 2005). Feedback from these sessions has been incorporated into the framework. Examples include reducing the number of statements of science content to be assessed; comparing the old and new science frameworks; and ensuring a high level of consistency in scope, specificity, language, and format across the science content areas. Other related outreach activities included but were not limited to presentations and sessions held with AAAS, the CSSS annual conference; the NSTA national and regional conventions; meetings of the NRC's Board on Science Education and Committee on Science Learning K-8; and CCSSO's Mega-SCASS (State Collaborative on Assessment and Student Standards) conference, large-scale assessment conference, and Education Information Management Advisory Consortium (EIMAC). The Governing Board engaged an external review panel to evaluate the draft framework and convened a public hearing to gather additional input during the development process. (See \"NAEP Science Project Staff and Committees\" for more complete lists of individuals and organizations that contributed to the development of this framework.) The planning committee reviewed feedback from these groups as well as that from the steering committee and made changes as it deemed appropriate. After final approval from the steering committee, the framework, specifications, and related products were submitted to the Governing Board for approval. The Governing Board unanimously approved the 2009 Science Framework NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK on November 18, 2005. Final copies of the specifications and related products were submitted to the Governing Board in March 2006."}, {"section_title": "STEERING COMMITTEE GUIDELINES", "text": "Because the steering committee guidelines were important to the planning committee in developing the framework, the major points of the guidelines are summarized below. (The complete document is contained in appendix A.) The guidelines consist of criteria that the framework and specifications must meet: \u2022 The framework is informed by the National Standards and Benchmarks. The framework should reflect the nation's best thinking about the importance and ageappropriateness of science principles and thus be informed by two national documents that were subject to extensive internal and external reviews during their development. \u2022 The framework reflects the nature and practice of science. The National Standards and Benchmarks include standards that address science as inquiry, nature of science, history of science, and the manmade world. The framework should emphasize the importance of these aspects of science education and should include the expectation that students will understand the nature and practice of science. Because the scientific disciplines are no longer practiced in isolation and research that cuts across discipline boundaries is common, the framework should identify some of the science concepts and skills that cut across the assessed content areas. The framework should address science in both the natural and manmade world, as well as social and historical contexts. \u2022 The framework uses assessment content, formats, and accommodations con sistent with the objectives being assessed. It should be guided by the best available research on assessment item design and delivery. The framework should include student diversity as reflected in gender, geographic location, language proficiency, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and disability. The assessment should be designed and written to be accessible by the majority of students, minimizing the need for special accommodations for both students with disabilities and English language learners. However, students with special needs should be provided appropriate accommodations to allow them to participate in the assessment. The framework should reflect knowledge about the acquisition of key science concepts over time, based on research about how students learn. Critical content and skills should be articulated and assessed across grades 4, 8, and 12 (vertically), as well as across the fields of science (horizontally) by creating items that are deliberately layered to achieve these goals. \u2022 The framework uses a variety of assessment formats. This includes wellconstructed multiple-choice and open-ended items as well as performance tasks. In addition, multiple methods of assessment delivery should be considered, including appropriate uses of computer technology."}, {"section_title": "USES OF NAEP DATA", "text": "For more than four decades, NAEP has provided information integral to reporting on the condition and progress of education at grades 4, 8, and 12 for the nation and, more recently, for the states and for a set of large, urban school districts. Legislation concerning NAEP states that its purpose is to provide, in a timely manner, a fair and accurate measurement of student academic achievement and reporting of trends in such achievement in reading, mathematics, and other subject matter (Public Law 107-279).

For example, NAEP reports (known as The Nation's Report Card) compare student performance in a given subject across states, within the subject over time, or among groups of students within the same grade. NAEP also reports longterm achievement trends for 9-, 13-, and 17-year-olds in reading and mathematics (e.g., Perie, Moran, and Lutkus 2005). To the extent that individual state standards reflect the common core of knowledge and skills specified in the framework, state comparisons can legitimately be made.

Each of these challenges is discussed below."}, {"section_title": "MEASUREMENT CONSTRAINTS", "text": "Like any large-scale assessment in education, the workplace, or clinical practice, NAEP is constrained in what it can measure. This has implications for the proper interpretation of NAEP Science Assessment results. The NAEP Science Assessment framework is an assessment framework, not a curriculum framework. Although the two are clearly interrelated, each has a different purpose and a different set of underlying assumptions. A curriculum framework is designed to inform instruction, to guide what is taught, and often, to guide how it is taught. It represents a very wide universe of learning outcomes from which teachers pick and choose what and how they teach. An assessment framework is a subset of the achievement universe from which assessment developers must choose to develop sets of items that can be assessed within time and resource constraints. Hence, the science content to be assessed by NAEP has been identified as that considered central to the Physical, Life, and Earth and Space Sciences. As a result, some important outcomes of science education that are difficult and time consuming to measure (such as habits of mind, sustained inquiry, and collaborative research), but valued by scientists, science educators, and the business community, will be only partially represented in the framework and in the NAEP Science Assessment. Moreover, the wide range of science standards in the guiding national documents that could be incorporated into the framework had to be reduced in number so as to allow some indepth probing of fundamental science content. As a result, the framework and the specifications represent a careful distillation that is not a complete representation of the original universe of achievement outcomes desirable for science education."}, {"section_title": "TIME AND RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS", "text": "What NAEP can assess is limited by time and resources. Like most standardized assessments, NAEP is an \"on-demand\" assessment. It ascertains what students know and can do in a limited amount of time (50 minutes for paper-and-pencil questions and, for a subset of students sampled, an additional 30 minutes for hands-on performance or interactive computer tasks) and with limited access to resources (e.g., reference materials, feedback from peers and teachers, opportunities for reflection and revision). The national and state standards, however, contain goals that require extended time (days, weeks, or months). Therefore, to assess student achievement in the kinds of extended activities that are a central feature of the national and state standards and many science curricula, it would be necessary to know (for example) the quality of students': \u2022 reasoning while framing their research questions; \u2022 planning for data collection and the execution of the plan; NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK \u2022 abilities to meet unpredictable challenges that arise during an actual, ongoing scientific investigation; \u2022 lines of argument in deciding how to alter their experimental approach in the light of new evidence; \u2022 engagement with fellow students and/or the teacher in interpreting an observation or result and deciding what to do about it; and \u2022 deliberations and reasoning when settling on the defensible conclusions that might be drawn from their work. Like other on-demand assessments, NAEP cannot be used to draw conclusions about student achievement with respect to the full range of goals of science education. States, districts, schools, and teachers can supplement NAEP and other standardized assessments to assess the full range of science education standards. In addition to describing the content and format of an examination, assessment frameworks like this one signal to the public and to teachers the elements of a subject that are important. The absence of extended inquiry in NAEP, however, is not intended to signal its relative importance in the curriculum. Indeed, because of the significance of inquiry in science education, the framework promotes as much consideration of inquiry as can be accomplished within the time and resources available for assessment."}, {"section_title": "BALANCING CURRENT AND FUTURE CURRICULA", "text": "The framework attempts to strike a balance between what can reasonably be predicted about future school science and what students are likely to encounter in their curriculum and instruction now and in the near future. It is a significant challenge to write a framework for the future. Cutting-edge science research creates new knowledge at the intersection of disciplinary boundaries. For example, research on human and natural systems has generated new understanding about environmental science that is closely linked to knowledge generated in the Physical, Life, and Earth and Space Sciences. Although the framework is organized into the more traditional Physical, Life, and Earth and Space Sciences, features of current science research are woven throughout. Another example of burgeoning knowledge relates to technology and technological design and the role of both in the NAEP Science Assessment. Technology and technological design are closely interrelated with science, yet the focus of this assessment is on science. Hence, technology and technological design are included in the framework but are limited to that which has a direct bearing on the assessment of students' science achievement (see chapter three). The framework is intended to be both forward looking (in terms of the science content that will be of central importance in the future) and reflective (in terms of current school science).

To carry out its mandated responsibility to set appropriate achievement goals for NAEP, the Governing Board adopted an achievement levels policy in 1989 (modified in 1993). This policy establishes three levels of achievement-Basic, Proficient, and Advanced. Basic denotes partial mastery of prerequisite knowledge and skills that are fundamental for proficient work at each grade. Proficient represents solid academic performance for each grade assessed. Students reaching this level have demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter, including subject-matter knowledge, application of such knowledge to real-world situations, and analytical skills appropriate to the subject matter. Advanced signifies superior performance. These levels are the primary means of reporting NAEP results to the general public and policymakers regarding what students should know and be able to do on NAEP assessments.

The NAEP Science Assessment provides a snapshot view of what the nation's 4th, 8th, and 12th graders know and can do in science. One expects students, as a result of their education and life experiences, to have learned about the principles (along with the facts, concepts, laws, and theories) that have been verified by the community of scientists, as well as how scientists discover regularities in the natural world. 1 NAEP will assess students' abilities to identify and use science principles as well as use scientific inquiry and technological design (see chapter three). Although the framework distinguishes content from practice, the two are closely linked in assessment as in science itself. The framework addresses scientific knowledge and processes. Science is a way of knowing about the natural world based on tested explanations supported by accumulated empirical evidence. Explanations of natural phenomena that rely on nonscientific views are not reflected in the framework. The committees responsible for the framework development relied on National Standards, Benchmarks, international frameworks, and state standards for content about the nature and practice of science. As stated in the National Standards: Scientific explanations must meet certain criteria. First and foremost, they must be consistent with experimental and observational evidence about nature, and must make accurate predictions, when appropriate, about systems being studied. They should also be logical, respect the rules of evidence, be open to criticism, report methods and procedures, and make knowledge public (p. 201). The design of the NAEP Science Assessment is guided by the framework's descriptions of the science content and practices to be assessed. Exhibit 1 illustrates how content and practices are combined (crossed) to generate performance expectations. The columns contain the science content (defined by content statements-propositions that express science principles-in three broad areas) and the rows contain the four science practices. A double dashed line distinguishes identifying science principles and using science principles from using scientific inquiry and using technological design. The first two practices can be generally considered as \"knowing science\" and the last two practices can be considered as the application of that knowledge to \"doing science\" and \"using science to solve real-world problems.\" The cells at the intersection of content (columns) and practices (rows) contain student performance expectations. Because content and practice categories are not entirely distinct, some overlap in the resultant performance expectations is to be expected (as denoted by dashed lines). Exhibit 2 illustrates the fuller process of generating assessment items and interpreting student responses. An item is an individual question or exercise on the NAEP Science Assessment and is used to gather information about students' knowledge and abilities. Exhibit 2 begins with student performance expectations, which describe in observable terms what students are expected to know and do on the assessment. These performance expectations guide the development of assessment items. The cognitive demands (see chapter three) of the items can then be used to interpret students' responses as evidence of what students know and can do in science (see  for more information on cognitive interpretations of performances on assessment tasks). Exhibit 2 suggests a linear process, but the development of an assessment is iterative (e.g., assessment items are modified based on student responses provided on trials of pilot versions).

Beyond the science content statements and practices, there are other valuable components of science that NAEP will not directly assess. These components-the history and nature of science and the relationship between science and technology-are treated as possible contexts in which assessment items may be presented. The assessment includes selected-response (multiple-choice) items and constructedresponse items (which include short and extended constructed-response items as well as concept-mapping tasks). Some combination items may require more than one response. They include item clusters, predict-observe-explain (POE) item sets, hands-on performance tasks, and interactive computer tasks. The responses requested may be all selected response, all constructed response, or a mixture of both. (See chapter four for a fuller explanation of types of items, including examples.) Chapter four recommends three types of percentages for item distribution (as measured by student response time) at each grade level: \u2022 Items by content area (Physical, Life, and Earth and Space Sciences) \u2022 Items by science practice (Identifying Science Principles, Using Science Principles, Using Scientific Inquiry, and Using Technological Design) \u2022 Items by type (selected-response and constructed-response items) Additional specifications about the number of hands-on performance tasks and interactive computer tasks are also provided. Chapter four also describes considerations for English language learners and students with disabilities.

One difference between the two frameworks is that the 2009 steering and planning committees drew on a variety of new standards and assessments.

The content statements contain key science principles for NAEP assessment. In the framework, the phrase \"science principles\" is broadly conceived and encompasses not only the key principles but also the facts, concepts, laws, and theories of science. To specify the science that should be assessed at each grade level, the framework organizes the science content into the three broad content areas that generally make up the K-12 school curriculum to which students are exposed: \u2022 Physical Science \u2022 Life Science \u2022 Earth and Space Sciences Classifying statements into one primary content area is not always clearcut and is artificial to some extent. For example, physicist Ernest Rutherford's discovery of the nucleus earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and physicist Rosalyn Yalow's work on radioimmunoassay earned her the Nobel Prize in Medicine. However, using three broad content areas as an organizer helps ensure that key science content is assessed in a balanced way. For clarity, exhibits are used to depict the content statements at each grade level. The content statements are based on the assumption that a person literate in science is one who understands key science ideas, is aware that science and technology are interdependent human enterprises with strengths and limitations, is familiar with the natural world and recognizes both its diversity and unity, and uses scientific knowledge and ways of thinking for individual and social purposes (see AAAS 1994, p. xvii). Two types of textboxes are used throughout this chapter. Clarification textboxes provide details on potentially confusing content, such as the distinction between mass and weight. Crosscutting content textboxes provide descriptions of science content that cuts across the three broad content areas, such as biogeochemical cycles."}, {"section_title": "DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTENT STATEMENTS", "text": "The selection and generation of specific content statements at each grade level followed a similar approach across the three broad content areas: \u2022 The National Standards and Benchmarks were used as key documents for identifying the science content to be assessed, pursuant to the charge from the steering committee. Various tools, primarily crosswalks between the National Standards and Benchmarks (AAAS 1997; Kendall and Marzano 2004), were used to cross-check the documents' content standards and benchmark statements; those that were common to both documents were generally given priority. On a caseby-case basis, content not represented in both documents was discussed and decisions made about inclusion or exclusion. Additions were made where warranted by scientific advances in the decade or more since the development of the National Standards and Benchmarks, or as a consequence of international assessment results from TIMSS and PISA. Some of this framework's content statements are verbatim reproductions of statements from the National Standards and Benchmarks. 2 \u2022 The focus in the selection process was on the central principles of each discipline. The content statements in the framework represent foundational and pervasive knowledge, key points of scientific theories, and underpinnings upon which complex understanding is built; and/or they demonstrate connectivity to other central content. \u2022 A primary consideration was the grade-level appropriateness and accuracy within grade level of content statements. \u2022 Once key content was identified within subtopics, the progression of ideas and performances, informed by available research, was tracked through grades 4, 8, and 12. \u2022 A deliberate attempt was made to limit the breadth of science content to be assessed so that some important topics could be measured indepth. Once core content was identified in each science area, additional content statements could be added only if others previously included were eliminated. The selection and generation of content statements for inclusion in the framework was not a linear process. Although the planning committee attempted to use clear and concise language, the complexities associated with the task of defining what students should know and be able to do in science at particular points in their development necessitated an iterative approach that included many perspectives. In addition to internal review by the project committees and staff, outreach activities gathered external feedback on the content statements from a variety of stakeholders (e.g., teachers, school and district administrators, state science education personnel, policymakers, scientists, and members of the business, industry, and postsecondary communities). The framework should be revisited in the future as new research becomes available and as the influence of new developments in science takes shape in the K-12 curriculum."}, {"section_title": "ORGANIZATION OF SCIENCE CONTENT", "text": "As described above, this framework organizes science content into three broad content areas (Physical Science, Life Science, and Earth and Space Sciences). The content is further organized into topics (such as motion), subtopics (such as forces affecting motion), and grade-specific content statements. The description of each broad content area follows this structure of increasing specificity and is presented in two ways: narrative introductions and content statements presented in exhibits (see exhibits 8, 10, and 12 in the sections for Physical Science, Life Science, and Earth and Space Sciences, respectively). Exhibit 4 summarizes the 2009 NAEP science content topics and subtopics.  As an organizational tool in exhibits 8, 10, and 12, each content statement is preceded by a specific code in bold (e.g., \"L12.10: Sorting and recombination of genes in sexual reproduction results in a great variety of possible gene combinations from the offspring of any two parents\"). Within a code, the letter denotes broad content area (\"P\" for Physical Science, \"L\" for Life Science, and \"E\" for Earth and Space Sciences); the number before the period denotes grade level (grade 4, 8, or 12); and the number following the period denotes the content statement's order of appearance within a given content area and grade. Thus, L12.10 denotes that this is the tenth content statement to appear in the grade 12 section of the Life Science content statements "}, {"section_title": "INTERPRETATION OF THE CONTENT STATEMENTS", "text": "In the framework, the content statements generally follow a form that is consistent with the National Standards, Benchmarks, and the practice of the scientific community. * This content statement is longer in the framework than in the Benchmarks or National Standards-not because it introduces additional science principles, but because it has adopted more detailed language. The content statements form the basis for explaining or predicting naturally occurring phenomena. For example, the above content statement about objects in motion can be used to explain and predict the motions of many different specific objects (e.g., an ice skater, an automobile, an electron, or a planet). The content statements do not include observations of phenomena. As the content statements are written, the empirical foundations of the science principles they represent are not detailed. Instead, knowledge is presented in general terms, such as patterns in observations or theoretical models that account for these patterns. The NAEP assessment will require students to apply content statements to specific observations and examples of phenomena. Therefore, the specifications provide boundaries on the range of phenomena NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK and examples that are appropriate for inclusion on the NAEP Science Assessment. The boundaries also describe the appropriate instrumentation, representations, and technical vocabulary to be included in the assessment. The process of item development and making inferences about students' knowledge and abilities (see exhibits 1 and 2) may necessitate further clarification of the content statements themselves. For example, this may involve \"detailing\" the meanings of individual content statements (e.g., \"boiling point\" assumes standard atmospheric pressure) or further defining the boundaries of the content to be assessed (e.g., grade 12 students are expected to know that DNA provides instructions for assembling proteins but not the details of DNA transcription and translation). Exhibit 6 is an example of commentary on a grade 8 Physical Science content statement. Although the commentary describes key ideas about waves relevant through grade 12, only three of these key ideas are recommended for assessment at grade 8. Whenever possible, commentary on content statements was informed by available research on learning and cognition. Commentary is intended as helpful notes to item writers and is provided for a number of content statements in the specifications. Commentary is not always of the same kind, and the examples provided do not exhaustively cover the content statements.

Energy and refraction calculations are not recommended for assessment at grade 8. A quantitative understanding of electromagnetic waves is expected at grade 12. See P12.10. To fully understand the content statements and their intent, readers of the framework should be cognizant of the following: \u2022 Although all content statements have been assigned a primary classification, some are likely to fall into more than one content area. \u2022 Some assessment items may draw on more than one content statement at a time. \u2022 Empty cells in the content statement tables denote that a particular subtopic is not recommended for assessment at that grade level. \u2022 Retention of foundational knowledge from one grade to the next is assumed; however, if the relevant content statement does not appear in a succeeding grade level, it should not be assessed. \u2022 The content statements listed in the framework describe the whole of what is to be assessed on the 2009 NAEP. The content statements should not be interpreted as a complete description of the recommended school science curriculum.\nThis content statement encompasses two interrelated sets of concepts: 1. Gravity acts between and among all objects in the solar system, and it plays an essential role in the regular and predictable motions of planets around the Sun and of satellites around planets. \u2022 On Earth, gravity is experienced as a force that pulls everything \"down\" toward the center of the Earth. (A common naive conception is that the atmosphere \"pushes\" things down and causes gravity.) \u2022 Gravity is a force of attraction that is exerted by every object on every other object. \u2022 Gravity exists in space and on other planets. (A common naive conception among students is that there is no gravity in space because space has no air.) \u2022 The almost circular motion of planets and satellites results from the force of gravity and the tendency of a body to continue moving through space in a straight line unless acted upon by a net force. 2. The regular and predictable motions of Earth, the Sun, and the Moon cause the cyclic phenomena that can be observed in the sky. \u2022 The day-night cycle results from Earth's rotation on its axis once in 24 hours. \u2022 Annual changes in the visible constellations and the seasons result from Earth's revolution around the Sun once every 365\u00bc days. \u2022 Moon phases result from the Moon's orbit around Earth about once a month, which changes the part of the Moon that is lighted by the Sun and how much of the lighted part can be seen from Earth. Note the connection between this content statement and the Physical Science subtopic, forces affecting motion. Students are not expected to use the inverse square relationship of gravitational force and distance to find the strength of the gravitational force between two objects.

Some examples of crosscutting content are described in textboxes that appear throughout the content area introductions: Energy Sources and Transfer in Physical Science; Uses, Transformations, and Conservation of Energy in Life Science; and Biogeochemical Cycles in Earth and Space Sciences. Additional examples are suggested in the specifications.

Energy from the Sun fuels electrical storms, hurricanes, tornados, and photosynthesis. In turn, the products of photosynthesis (carbohydrates and oxygen) react during respiration to fuel life processes, such as growth and reproduction of plants and animals.

Every object exerts gravitational force on every other object. The force depends on how much mass the objects have and on how far apart they are. Force and weight are measured in newtons (N) using a spring scale. Changing an object's position (e.g., from Earth to the Moon) will change its weight, but not its mass. For example, on the surface of Earth, a cannon ball has a mass of 10 kg and a weight of 98 N. On the surface of the Moon, the cannon ball still has a mass of 10 kg, but its weight is only 16 N. So, the cannon ball weighs less on the Moon than on Earth, even though nothing has been taken away. Why? Because of the Moon's lesser mass and smaller radius, the force of attraction between the Moon and the cannon ball is less than the force of attraction between Earth and the cannon ball. Hence, it is said that an object on the Moon weighs less than the same object weighs on Earth. These concepts of mass and weight are complicated and potentially confusing to fourth grade students. Therefore, this framework uses the more familiar term \"weight\" in grade 4 to stand for both weight and mass, and this usage is denoted as \"weight (mass).\" By grades 8 and 12, students are expected to understand the distinction between mass and weight, and both terms will be used as appropriate. * In current NAEP practice, metric units of measure are used for grades 4, 8, and 12. Matter exists in several different physical states, each of which has unique properties (grade 4). Three of the most commonly encountered states are solids, liquids, and gases. Shape and compressibility are examples of properties that distinguish solids, liquids, and gases (grade 4). The particulate model of matter can be used to explain and predict the properties of states of matter, such as why ice is harder than liquid water and why ice (once formed) has a shape independent of its container while liquid water takes the shape of whatever container it is in (grade 4). In the particulate model of matter, the molecules or atoms of which matter is composed are assumed to be tiny particles in motion (grade 8). The motion is translational, rotational, and vibrational (grade 12). This model can be used to explain the properties of solids, liquids, and gases as well as changes of state. The particulate model can be used to explain the unique properties of water, as described in the following textbox. As with all kinds of matter, water's unique properties can be explained by the shape of its molecule, the forces between its molecules in solid (ice) and liquid states, and the resulting arrangement of molecules in solid and liquid states. In particular, in the solid state, the molecular bonds are such that they separate the molecules more than in the liquid state, resulting in ice being less dense than liquid water. The strong intermolecular forces of liquid water account for its high specific heat. (The specific heat of a substance is the amount of energy required to change 1 g of the substance by 1 degree Centigrade.) The detailed structures of molecules and the atoms that compose them serve as models that explain the forces of attraction between molecules. The structure of atoms, especially the outermost electrons, explains the chemical properties of the elements and the formation of the chemical bonds made and broken during chemical reactions (grade 12). The Periodic Table of the Elements (introduced at grade 8) is another way in which order can be made out of the complexity of the variety of types of matter. (In grade 8, the emphasis is on observed periodicity of properties.) The Periodic Table demonstrates the relationship between the atomic number of the elements and their chemical and physical properties and provides a structure for inquiry into the characteristics of the chemical elements (grade 12). Two classes of chemical substances serve as exemplars of chemical properties: metals (elements) and acids (compounds). A chemical property of metals is to react with nonmetals to form salts. One of the properties of acids is the formation of characteristic colors when interacting with acid/base indicators and the interaction with bases to produce salts and water (i.e., neutralization) (grade 8)."}, {"section_title": "Changes in Matter", "text": "Matter can undergo a variety of changes. Changes are physical if the relationships between the molecules of the material are changed, such as from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas (grade 4). When matter undergoes a physical change, generally no changes occur in the structure of the molecules or atoms composing the matter (grade 8), although there are exceptions (e.g., sulfur). Changes are chemical if they involve the rearrangement of how atoms are bound to one another, thereby changing the molecules of the material. These are changes in the configuration of the outermost electron shell NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK surrounding the nuclei of the interacting atoms (grade 12). Changes are nuclear if the particles are emitted from or absorbed into the nucleus of the atom, thereby changing the atoms themselves into isotopes or different elements (grade 12). The fact that mass is conserved when matter undergoes physical and chemical changes is a powerful principle for understanding the natural world and was influential in the development of chemical theory. Adherence to the principle discourages the conclusion that something \"disappears\" (as water seems to disappear from a puddle) and encourages the search for the \"missing\" matter. Most nuclear reactions, involving changes in the nuclei of atoms, are very high energy and result in the formation of elements or nuclei different from those that began the process. In nuclear reactions, a measurable amount of mass is converted into energy (grade 12)."}, {"section_title": "ENERGY", "text": "The topic \"energy\" is divided into two subtopics; one addresses the forms of energy and the other addresses energy transfer and conservation. 4"}, {"section_title": "Forms of Energy", "text": "Knowing the characteristics of familiar forms of energy (grade 4) and the scientific categories of potential and kinetic energy (grade 8) can lead to an understanding that, for the most part, the natural world can be explained and is predictable. The most basic characteristics of thermal, light, sound, electrical, and mechanical energy and the relationship between changes in the natural world and energy are included in the framework. 5 For example, the fact that two objects, one at a higher temperature than the other, come to the same temperature when placed in contact with each other is a familiar experience. Heat as a concept can be used to explain this experience (grade 8)."}, {"section_title": "Energy Transfer and Conservation", "text": "The fact that energy is conserved can be demonstrated by keeping track of the familiar forms of energy as they are transferred from one object to another. The chemical potential energy in a battery is transferred by electric current to a light bulb, which in turn transfers the energy in the form of heat (thermal energy) and light to its surroundings (grade 4). The energy stored in the battery decreases as its surroundings are heated. The loss in chemical potential energy equals the light and heat (thermal energy) transferred by the bulb and the wires to their surroundings. Quantitative accounting is complex; however, on a qualitative basis, both the ability to trace energy transfer and the understanding that energy is conserved (grade 8) are of great explanatory and predictive value. Chemical reactions either release energy to the surroundings or cause energy to flow from the surroundings into the system (grade 12). The Sun as the main energy source for the Earth provides an opportunity at all grade levels to make important connections between the science disciplines (see the following textbox)."}, {"section_title": "Crosscutting Content: Energy Sources and Transfer", "text": "When a sufficiently high temperature occurs in the Sun because of gravitational attraction, nuclear reactions take place. These reactions result in the transfer of energy from nuclei to their surroundings. At the same time, those high temperatures cause the Sun to radiate visible light and many other forms of electromagnetic waves. A small fraction of this light energy reaches Earth, heating the land, air, and water. Some of this energy causes some water to evaporate. The water vapor travels high into the atmosphere, thus increasing its gravitational potential energy. There it cools and condenses, some of it falling into reservoirs behind dams. At many dams, some of this water is directed downhill through tubes, resulting in the transfer of gravitational potential energy to the descending water as kinetic energy. This water is then used to turn turbines, and energy is transferred from the moving water to electrical appliances through circuits and power lines. Accordingly, the energy used to power commonplace objects such as a light bulb, TV, radio, or stereo can be traced back to nuclear reactions deep inside the Sun. Consider also the transfer of energy that occurs as a diver falls through air into water. When the diver is initially poised on a cliff high above a lake's surface, one says that the diver has potential energy with respect to the air and water below. As the diver falls, her speed (kinetic energy) increases as her potential energy decreases. Her body transfers energy to the medium through which she falls; that is, the diver's body rubs against the air and water (heating them) and exerts force on the air and water (moving them aside). When the diver finally comes to rest in the lake, some or most of her potential energy has been transferred to heating and setting into motion the air and water through which she fell.

The energy change is understood in terms of forces. For example, it takes energy for a baseball pitcher to set the ball in motion toward the batter.

Principles germane to the relationship of forces and motion serve to motivate the search for forces when objects change their motion or when an object remains at rest even though it seems that the forces acting on it should result in setting it in motion (grade 8). Some forces act through physical contact of objects while others act at a distance. The force of a bat on a ball and the downward push of a lead block resting on a tabletop are contact forces. Gravitational and magnetic forces act at a distance (grade 8). Magnets do not need to be in contact to attract or repel each other. The Earth and an airplane do not need to be in contact for a force of attraction to exist between them.

The media regularly ask questions related to health and disease, such as what constitutes a healthy lifestyle and how to deal with the mutability of bacteria, viruses, and parasites that thwart efforts to develop antibiotics and vaccines. Although science does not currently provide complete answers to these types of questions, it provides the tools for understanding and addressing them. Understanding principles in Life Science is inextricably linked with understanding principles in Physical Science and Earth and Space Sciences. \"Living organisms are made of the same components as all other matter, involve the same kind of transformations of energy, and move using the same basic kinds of forces\" (AAAS 1994, p. 59). Understanding living systems and their interactions with their environment requires not only an understanding of various levels of biological organization-molecules, cells, tissues/organs, organisms, populations, ecosystems-but also an understanding of interactions (including the transfer of information) within and across these levels and how they can change over time. For example, understanding how populations of organisms change over time is greatly facilitated by understanding the changes that occur in DNA molecules.

Plants are similar to animals in that, to make other molecules for their growth and reproduction, they use the energy that is released as carbohydrates react with oxygen. In making these other molecules, plants use the breakdown products of carbohydrates, along with minerals from the soil and from fertilizers (known colloquially as \"plant foods\"), as building blocks. Plants also synthesize substances (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins) that are components of foods eaten by animals. Therefore, although synthesis and breakdown are common to both plants and animals, photosynthesis (the conversion of light energy into stored chemical energy) is unique to plants, making them the primary source of energy for all animals. Basic needs are connected with the processes of growth and metabolism. Organisms are made up of carbon-containing molecules; these molecules originate in molecules that plants assemble from carbon dioxide and water.

In these grand-scale cycles, the total amount of matter and energy remains constant, even though their form and location undergo continual change. Almost all life on earth is ultimately maintained by transformations of energy from the Sun. Plants capture the Sun's energy and use it to synthesize complex, energy-rich molecules (chiefly sugars) from molecules of carbon dioxide and water. These synthesized molecules then serve, directly or indirectly, as the source of energy for the plants themselves and ultimately for all animals and decomposer organisms (such as bacteria and fungi). This is the food web: The organisms that consume the plants derive energy and materials from breaking down the plant molecules, use them to synthesize their own structures, and then are themselves consumed by other organisms. At each stage in the food web, some energy is stored in newly synthesized structures and some is dissipated into the environment as heat produced by the energy-releasing chemical processes in cells. A similar energy cycle begins in the oceans with the capture of the Sun's energy by tiny, plant-like organisms. Each successive stage in a food web captures only a small fraction of the energy content of organisms it feeds on.

The modern concept of evolution, including natural selection and common descent, provides a unifying principle for understanding the history of life on Earth, relationships among all living things, and the dependence of life on the physical environment. The concept is so well established that it provides a framework for organizing most of biological knowledge into a coherent picture. All organisms are similar to and different from other organisms, and some kinds of organisms and individuals have advantages in particular environments (grade 4). Preferential survival means that differences among individuals in a population affect their ability to survive and reproduce. Classification reflects degrees of relatedness among species (grade 8). Evolution is the consequence of natural selection and differential reproduction.

The study of Earth has shifted from surface geology and mining toward global change and Earth systems; research methods have changed from human observations and mapping to remote sensing and computer modeling. 6 This concept of Earth as a complex and dynamic entity of interrelated subsystems implies that there is no process or phenomenon within the Earth system that occurs in complete isolation from other elements of the system. There has also been a shift in goals as advances in theory have made it possible to more accurately predict changes in weather and climate; to provide life-saving warnings of floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions; and to understand how human activities influence ecosystem and climate changes across the globe. In space science, similar changes have taken place as a result of new technologies. Successful probes to Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn have vastly expanded knowledge of the solar neighborhood. The discovery of more than 100 planets outside the solar system has raised new questions about the origin of life. Furthermore, advances in ground and space-based telescopes capable of observing many different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum with unprecedented detail have revolutionized understanding of the structure and evolution of the universe itself. In brief, descriptive methods of Earth and Space Sciences have given way to theory-based inquiry and problem-solving approaches that have farreaching consequences with regard to understanding the universe and stewardship of planet Earth. Changes in Earth and Space Science education are beginning to catch up with advances in research. The National Standards emphasize a systems approach to studying Earth, especially at the high school level. Some of today's textbooks pay less attention to describing Earth features and focus instead on a systems perspective in which Earth is viewed as a physical system of interrelated phenomena, processes, and cycles. Some high school curricula have integrated the traditional Earth science disciplines of geology, meteorology, and oceanography with aspects of biology, chemistry, and physics to introduce students to a more holistic study of Earth. The tools available to students for learning about Earth and space have changed as well, although not all of these resources are available to all students. Visualization tools, such as geographical information system (GIS) software, have made it possible for Earth science students to have direct access to the raw data and models used by scientists. Other Web-based programs allow students to view and process satellite images of Earth, to direct a camera on board the Space Shuttle, and to access professional telescopes around the world to carry out science projects. In other words, the core concepts, subject matter, and tools used by students have undergone profound changes in recent decades that mirror many of the advances in Earth and Space Sciences. The data and images gathered by these tools could be used as source materials for assessment items. For example, students could examine data on sea surface temperatures and upper atmospheric winds, derived from satellite observations, to predict the intensity and track of a hurricane.

One of the earliest discoveries of the scientific age was that Earth is not the center of the universe. It is now known that Earth is a planet in space, one of a family of planets and other bodies that circle a yellow star in a vast galaxy of other stars. Like countless other worlds that are known to exist, Earth has a beginning and a history. That history can be read by carefully and thoughtfully observing the world and the universe."}, {"section_title": "Objects in the Universe", "text": "Objects in the sky, such as the Sun and the Moon, have patterns of movement. These patterns can be observed through changes in shape or placement in the sky based on time of day or season (grade 4).

It was previously thought that Earth was the center of the universe. However, it is now known that the Sun is the central and largest body in the solar system, which includes Earth and other planets and their moons as well as other objects such as asteroids and comets. Objects in the solar system are kept in predictable motion by the force of gravity (grade 8). According to the \"big bang\" theory, the entire contents of the known universe expanded explosively into existence from a hot, dense state 13.7 billion years ago. Early in the history of the universe, stars coalesced out of clouds of hydrogen and helium and clumped together by gravitational attraction into billions of galaxies. When heated to a sufficiently high temperature by gravitational attraction, stars begin nuclear reactions, which convert matter to energy and fuse light elements into heavier ones (grade 12)."}, {"section_title": "History of Earth", "text": "Theories of planet formation and radioactive dating of meteorites have led to the conclusion that the Sun, Earth, and the rest of the solar system formed from a nebular cloud of dust and gas 4.6 billion years ago. Early Earth was very different from today's planet. Initially, there was no life and no molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. Evidence shows that one-celled organisms (bacteria) were the first forms of life on the planet, appearing about 3.5 billion years ago. These bacteria are thought to be responsible for adding oxygen to Earth's atmosphere, making it possible for a wider diversity of life forms to evolve (grade 12). Earth processes seen today, such as erosion and mountain building, have made possible the measurement of geologic time through methods such as observing rock sequences and using fossils to correlate the sequences at various locations. Fossils also provide evidence of how life and environmental conditions have changed (grade 8). Early methods of determining geological time, such as the use of index fossils and stratigraphic sequences, allowed for the relative dating of geologic events. However, absolute dating was impossible until the discovery that certain radioactive isotopes in rocks have known decay rates, making it possible to determine how many years ago a given rock sample formed (grade 12). Earth's surface changes over time. Some changes are due to slow processes, such as erosion and weathering, and others are due to rapid processes such as volcanic eruptions, landslides, and earthquakes (grade 4). Changes caused by violent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions can be observed on a human time scale; on the other hand, many geological processes, such as the building of mountain chains and shifting of entire continents, take place over hundreds of millions of years.

Natural materials have different properties that sustain plant and animal life (grade 4). Soil consists of weathered rocks and decomposed organic material from dead plants, animals, and bacteria. Soils are often found in layers, with each having a different chemical composition and texture (grade 8). Some Earth materials have properties (either in their present form or after design and modification) that make them useful in solving human problems and enhancing the quality of life (grade 4). Rocks and rock formations bear evidence of the conditions and forces that created them, ranging from the violent conditions of volcanic eruptions to the slow deposition of sediments. The atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace gases that include water vapor. The atmosphere has a different physical and chemical composition at different elevations (grade 8)."}, {"section_title": "Tectonics", "text": "A basic understanding of geological history (described above) forms the foundation for later understanding of tectonics. Earth's internal structure is layered with a lithosphere, hot convecting mantle, and dense metallic core. Lithospheric plates, on the scale of continents and oceans, constantly move at rates of centimeters per year in response to movements in the mantle. Major geological events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and mountain building result from these plate motions (grade 8). Although continental drift was first suggested as early as the late 16th century and further developed in the early 1900s, it was not widely accepted until more convincing evidence emerged as a result of extensive exploration of the sea floor. By the late 1960s, mapping of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, evidence of sea floor spreading, and subduction led to the more general theory of plate tectonics. The current explanation is that the outward transfer of Earth's internal heat propels the plates comprising Earth's surface across the face of the globe, pushing the plates apart where magma rises to form midocean ridges, and pulling the edges of plates back down where Earth materials sink into the crust at deep trenches (grade 12). Earth as a whole has a magnetic field that is detectable at the surface with a compass. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field of a natural or manmade magnet with north and south poles and lines of force. For thousands of years, people have used compasses to NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK aid navigation on land and sea (grade 8). Crucial evidence in support of tectonic theory came from studies of the magnetic properties of rocks on the ocean floor (grade 12)."}, {"section_title": "EARTH SYSTEMS", "text": "Earth systems is divided into three subtopics: energy in Earth systems, climate and weather, and biogeochemical cycles.

Each element can exist in several different chemical forms. Elements move within and between the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere as part of biogeochemical cycles (see the following textbox). Movement of matter through Earth's systems is driven by Earth's internal and external sources of energy. These movements NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK are often accompanied by a change in the physical and chemical properties of the matter. For example, carbon occurs in carbonate rocks such as limestone, in coal and other fossil fuels, in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas, in water as dissolved carbon dioxide, and in all organisms as complex molecules that control the chemistry of life (grade 12). Water, which covers the majority of Earth's surface, circulates through the crust, oceans, and atmosphere in what is known as the water cycle. Water evaporates from Earth's surface, rises and cools as it moves to higher elevations, condenses as clouds, falls as rain or snow, and collects in lakes, oceans, soil, and underground (grade 8). Natural ecosystems provide an array of basic processes that affect humans. These processes include maintenance of the quality of the atmosphere, generation of soils, control of the hydrologic cycle, disposal of wastes, and recycling of nutrients (grade 12). The supply of many Earth resources such as fuels, metals, fresh water, and farmland is limited. Humans change environments in ways that can either be beneficial or detrimental for themselves and other organisms (grade 4). Humans have devised methods for extending the use of Earth resources through recycling, reuse, and renewal (grade 4). However, other activities (reducing the amount of forest cover, increasing the amount and variety of chemicals released into the atmosphere, and intensive farming) have changed Earth's land, oceans, and atmosphere.

These practices are useful for generating science-rich assessment items. To help assessment developers, the science practices can be associated with the cognitive demands they place on students. This chapter employs a set of four cognitive demands: (1) \"knowing that,\" (2) \"knowing how,\" (3) \"knowing why,\" and (4) \"knowing when and where to apply knowledge.\" These cognitive demands help ensure that NAEP assessment items are developed in a way that will elicit the kinds of knowledge and thinking that underlie the framework's performance expectations (as explained later in this chapter). They also provide a tool for interpreting students' responses on the assessment items. This chapter shows how science content statements can be combined or crossed with practices to generate performance expectations, which then guide the development of assessment items. By comparing student responses with the particular science content and practice being assessed, inferences about what students know (about particular science principles) and can do (with respect to particular science practices) are made.

These ideas have enabled successive generations to achieve an increasingly comprehensive and reliable understanding of the natural world. Scientific ideas are generated and verified by observing natural phenomena, finding patterns in these observations, and constructing theoretical models to explain NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK these patterns. 7 The patterns and models can in turn be used to describe, measure, classify, explain, and predict other observations. Science knowledge is used to reason about the natural world and to improve the quality of scientific thought and action. Hence, NAEP will assess how well 4th, 8th, and 12th grade students can engage in the following broadly organized science practices: Because these practices are closely related, the categories are not distinct and some overlap is expected. The ability to communicate accurately and effectively is essential in science, and this expectation is a strand that runs across the practices. Accurate and effective communication may include (but is not limited to) writing clear instructions that others can follow to carry out an investigation; reading and organizing data in tables and graphs; locating information in computer databases; using audio, video, multimedia, and other technologies to access, process, and integrate scientific findings; using language and scientific terms appropriately; drawing pictures or schematics to aid in descriptions of observations; summarizing the results of scientific investigations; and reporting to various audiences about facts, explanations, investigations, and data-based alternative explanations and designs (AAAS 1993;NRC 1996; Partnership for 21st Century Skills 2004). Quantitative reasoning is also fundamental to science. It is the capacity not only to calculate (e.g., determine density given an object's mass and dimensions) but also to model a system (e.g., determine the energy released from a chemical reaction)."}, {"section_title": "SOURCES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRACTICES", "text": "The framework developers examined a number of sources to develop the short list of practices to be assessed in the NAEP Science Assessment.

Conducted by SRI International during 2001-05, this project classified assessment items according to the inquiry standards discussed in the National Standards. The practices described below are found in most of the above sources. Cognitive research on science learning, international frameworks, and state standards were also used as reference points."}, {"section_title": "IDENTIFYING SCIENCE PRINCIPLES", "text": "This category focuses on students' ability to recognize, recall, define, relate, and represent basic science principles specified in the Physical Science, Life Science, and Earth and Space Sciences content statements presented in chapter two. The content statements themselves are often closely related to one another conceptually. Moreover, the science principles included in the content statements can be represented in a variety of forms, such as words, pictures, graphs, tables, formulas, and diagrams (AAAS 1993;NRC 1996). NAEP will assess students' ability to describe, measure, or classify observations; state or recognize principles included in the content statements; connect closely related content statements; and relate different representations of science knowledge. The practices assessed in this category draw on declarative knowledge (or \"knowing that\"), which is described in the Cognitive Demands section later in this chapter. Identifying Science Principles comprises the following general types of performance expectations: \u2022 Describe, measure, or classify observations (e.g., describe the position and motion of objects; measure temperature; classify relationships between organisms as being predator/prey, parasite/host, producer/consumer). \u2022 State or recognize correct science principles (e.g., mass is conserved when substances undergo changes of state; all organisms are composed of cells; the atmosphere is a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and trace gases that include water vapor). \u2022 Demonstrate relationships among closely related science principles (e.g., connect statements of Newton's three laws of motion, relate energy transfer with the water cycle). \u2022 Demonstrate relationships among different representations of principles (e.g., verbal, symbolic, diagrammatic) and data patterns (e.g., tables, equations, graphs). Identifying Science Principles is integral to all of the other science practices. The following two items illustrate the expectation that students will recognize correct science principles. The first item assesses students' ability to correctly identify simple information about the location of bodies within the solar system (declarative knowledge). More than half of the eighth graders answered it incorrectly. Thirty-five percent of the students thought that the Moon is sometimes closer to the Sun than to Earth."}, {"section_title": "Illustrative Item", "text": "The Earth's Moon is A. always much closer to the Sun than it is to the Earth.

If the corn crop failed one year, what would most likely happen to the robin population? Explain your answer. (See appendix C for item scoring guides.) L8.6, Using Science Principles Source: TIMSS 1999, Grade 8. The first two science practice categories-Identifying Science Principles and Using Science Principles-both require students to correctly state or recognize the science principles contained in the content statements. A difference between the categories is that Using Science Principles focuses on what makes science knowledge valuable or, in other words, its usefulness in making accurate predictions about phenomena and in explaining observations of the natural world in coherent ways (i.e., \"knowing why\"). Distinguishing between these two categories draws attention to differences in the depth and richness of individuals' knowledge of the content statements. Certain actions on the part of students NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK lead to an inference of Identifying Science Principles, while other actions lead to an inference of Using Science Principles. Assuming a continuum from \"just knowing the facts\" to \"using science principles,\" there is considerable overlap at the boundary. The line between the identifying and using categories is not distinct. Consider the following item, which illustrates the expectation that students will connect different representations. In this case, the student must identify the correct pictorial representation of a complete electrical circuit.\nThe pictures show a lightbulb connected to a battery. The following textbox provides further illustration of the distinction between identifying the boiling point of water (a fact) and using the relationship between boiling point and pressure (altitude) to explain or predict.\nKey: D \nThis interactive computer task is one module in an extended assessment of students' abilities to use a range of technologies to investigate a complex problem, \"Should lynx be reintroduced into a national park?\" Students accessed, organized, and analyzed data on the number of hares in the park over a 25-year period, researched factors that would impact the population, and created a graph to analyze the trend. (See appendix C for a description of the full task.) This module allows students to interact with a simulated predator/prey (lynx/hare) population model. Students use the modeling tool to observe population trends that result from different parameter values for the lynx and hare populations. The screen shot below is an example of what students see after they have selected parameters and run the simulation. Note that it is a single screen shot and represents only a small subset of the many screens that students actually see when engaged in this interactive computer task. After students have run the modeling software, they are asked a series of questions (e.g., size of the hare population over time). L8.6, Using Scientific Inquiry Source: Quellmalz et al. 2004.

On the diagram below, circle the letter indicating the approximate location of the space station. Interpretation: The correct answer is C. Since the Moon has one-sixth the amount of gravity as Earth, a body that experiences an equal gravitational force from Earth and the Moon should be closer to the Moon. Point C is the only point that is closer to the Moon. Note: Point C is about one-twelfth of the way between the Moon and Earth; it should be one-sixth of the distance.

Following is an example of one of several tasks that a student completes: Your task is to identify two states that will have a high annual solar energy and will be able to generate the maximum amount of electricity from their solar panels. Name two states that you predict will have a good annual electrical yield. In the rest of this performance assessment, you will generate visualizations and calculate which states will generate the best annual electricity yield from solar panels.

NAEP 2009 Finally, concept mapping can be done by providing concept terms and asking students to build propositions on the computer by linking pairs of terms with arrows and words or phrases. Following is a screen shot of a completed concept map.\nIn this task, middle and high school students used a customized software program to create concept maps. Students received 18 environmental science terms and 7 link labels.* Students could drag and drop these concepts onto the grid space of the mapping program and add, erase, and link the items in their newly constructed maps. (See appendix C for more information about this task.) Computers and other media provide potential solutions to a variety of practical challenges posed by complex assessment exercises. The logistical challenges of hands-on performance tasks can be circumvented with computer simulation. Extensive databases can be used to assess students' ability to select and evaluate information relevant to the situation NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK or problem they need to address. In addition, the difficulty of providing materials and training for complex tasks (such as concept maps) can be circumvented with computers. To avoid cheating and teaching to the concept map, concept terms can be randomly sampled for a particular map ). ICTs should be used when the format offers advantages over other assessment modes. ICTs include (but are not limited to) testing student knowledge, skills, and abilities related to the following situations: \u2022 For scientific phenomena that cannot easily be observed in real time, such as seeing things in slow motion (e.g., the motion of a wave) or at a higher speed (e.g., erosion caused by a river). They are also useful when it is necessary to freeze action or replay. \u2022 For modeling scientific phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye (e.g., the movement of molecules in a gas). \u2022 For working safely in lab-like simulations that would otherwise be hazardous (e.g., using dangerous chemicals) or disorderly in an assessment situation. \u2022 For situations that require several repetitions of an experiment in limited assessment time while varying the parameters (e.g., rolling a ball down a slope while varying the mass, the angle of inclination, or the coefficient of friction of the surface). \u2022 For searching the Internet and resource documents that provide high-fidelity situations related to the actual world in which such performances are likely to be observed. \u2022 For manipulating objects in a simplistic manner, such as moving concept terms in a concept map. Extended constructed-response items, concept-mapping tasks, and simulated performance tasks are especially strong candidates for ICTs. In this way, the complex science understandings and practices that need to be probed in the NAEP Science Assessment could be captured with less time, cost, and logistical challenges and with greater opportunity for divergent problem-solving tasks than has been the case in the past."}, {"section_title": "USING SCIENCE PRINCIPLES", "text": "Scientific knowledge is useful for making sense of the natural world.

Both the first and second responses suggest that the question is only assessing knowledge of facts or the ability to identify a science principle; however, they illustrate the difference between recognizing a correct answer and retrieving that correct answer from memory. The third response contains even more sophisticated information, suggesting that the student can use a science principle to make predictions. Distinctions between these two categories can be clarified by examining student responses and conducting cognitive labs."}, {"section_title": "USING SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY", "text": "Scientists make observations about the natural world, identify patterns in data, and propose explanations to account for the patterns. Although scientists differ greatly from one NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK another in the phenomena they study and in how they go about their work, scientific inquiry involves the collection of relevant data, the use of logical reasoning, and the application of imagination and evidence in devising hypotheses to explain patterns in data. Scientific inquiry is a complex and time-intensive process that is iterative rather than linear. Scientists are also expected to exhibit, indeed to model, the habits of mindcuriosity, openness to new ideas, informed skepticism-that are part of science literacy. This includes reading or listening critically to assertions in the media, deciding what evidence to pay attention to and what to dismiss, and distinguishing careful arguments from shoddy ones. These critical thinking and systems thinking skills are the basis for exercising sound reasoning, making complex choices, and understanding the interconnections among systems (Partnership for 21st Century Skills 2004). Thus, using scientific inquiry depends on the practices described above-Identifying Science Principles and Using Science Principles. Moreover, in addition to involving declarative and schematic knowledge, Using Scientific Inquiry draws heavily on procedural knowledge (\"knowing how,\" e.g., knowing how to determine the mass of an object). This framework focuses on a few key inquiry practices that are practical to measure in the NAEP Science Assessment. Using Scientific Inquiry comprises the following general types of performance expectations: 8 \u2022 Design or critique aspects of scientific investigations (e.g., involvement of control groups, adequacy of sample). \u2022 Conduct scientific investigations using appropriate tools and techniques (e.g., selecting an instrument that measures the desired quantity-length, volume, weight, time interval, temperature-with the appropriate level of precision). \u2022 Identify patterns in data and/or relate patterns in data to theoretical models. \u2022 Use empirical evidence to validate or criticize conclusions about explanations and predictions (e.g., check to see that the premises of the argument are explicit, notice when the conclusions do not follow logically from the evidence presented). Scientific inquiry is more complex than simply making, summarizing, and explaining observations, and it is more flexible than the rigid set of steps often referred to as the \"scientific method.\" The National Standards make it clear that inquiry goes beyond \"science as a process\" to include an understanding of the nature of science (p. 105) and further state the following: It is part of scientific inquiry to evaluate the results of scientific investigations, experiments, observations, theoretical models, and the explanations proposed by other scientists. Evaluation includes reviewing the experimental procedures, examining the evidence, identifying faulty reasoning, pointing out statements that go beyond the evidence, and suggesting alternative explanations for the same observations (p. 171). In the NAEP Science Assessment, when students use scientific inquiry they are drawing on their understanding about the nature of science, including the following ideas (see Benchmarks): \u2022 Arguments are flawed when fact and opinion are intermingled, or the conclusions do not follow logically from the evidence presented. \u2022 A single example can never support the inference that something is always true, but sometimes a single example can support the inference that something is not always true. \u2022 If more than one variable changes at the same time in an experiment, the outcome of the experiment may not be clearly attributable to any one of the variables. \u2022 The way in which a sample is drawn affects how well it represents the population of interest. The larger the sample, the smaller the error in inference to the population. However, large samples do not necessarily guarantee representation, especially in the absence of random sampling. NAEP will assess students' abilities to use scientific inquiry in two ways: students will be required to do the practices specified above and students will critique examples of scientific inquiry. It is incorrect to assume that assessment of using scientific inquiry is best or only achieved through hands-on performance tasks and interactive computer tasks (ICTs). In both cases of doing and critiquing, some assessment tasks will also be presented as paper-and-pencil items. In doing, tasks may present data tables and ask students which conclusions are consistent with the data. Other tasks will be presented as hands-on performance and/or interactive computer tasks (e.g., students collect data and present their results or students specify experimental conditions on computer simulations and observe the outcomes). In regard to critiquing, students might be asked to identify flaws in a poorly designed investigation or suggest changes in the design to produce more reliable data. Tasks may be based on print or electronic media (e.g., items may ask students to suggest alternative interpretations of data described in a newspaper article). Chapter four contains more information on types of items."}, {"section_title": "USING TECHNOLOGICAL DESIGN", "text": "In both the National Standards and Benchmarks, the term \"technological design\" 9 refers to the process that underlies the development of all technologies, from paper clips to space stations. The National Standards explain that this meaning \"is not to be confused with 'instructional technology,' which provides students and teachers with exciting tools-such as computers-to conduct inquiry and to understand science\" (p. 24). In the framework, using technological design describes the systematic process of applying science knowledge and skills to solve problems in a real-world context. The National Standards clearly state the reason for including technological design in the science curriculum: \"Although these are science education standards, the relationship between science and technology is so close that any presentation of science without developing an understanding of technology would portray an inaccurate picture of science\" (p. 190). The National Standards define technology and its relationship to science as follows: As used in the Standards, the central distinguishing characteristic between science and technology is a difference in goal: The goal of science is to understand the natural world, and the goal of technology is to make modifications in the world to meet human needs. Technology as design is included in the Standards as parallel to science as inquiry (p. 24). As in scientific inquiry, the professional practice of technological design (also called engineering design) is complex and time intensive. Because NAEP addresses the subject area of science, the use of technological design components in the 2009 NAEP Science Assessment will be limited to those that reveal students' abilities to apply science principles in the context of technological design. Students' abilities to Identify and Use Science Principles should provide the opportunities as well as the limits for assessment tasks related to Using Technological Design. For example, if students are asked to design a town's energy plan, they may be expected to consider the environmental effects of using natural gas versus using coal, but they would not be expected to consider the economic, political, or social ramifications of such a plan. The framework samples key components of Using Technological Design from the more complete descriptions found in the National Standards and Benchmarks. Using Technological Design comprises the following general types of performance expectations, all of which involve students using science knowledge to accomplish the following: \u2022 Propose or critique solutions to problems, given criteria and scientific constraints. \u2022 Identify scientific tradeoffs in design decisions and choose among alternative solutions. \u2022 Apply science principles or data to anticipate effects of technological design decisions. The three components of Using Technological Design are discussed below. First, the technological design process is rooted in the definition of a problem that can be solved through a technological design process. The problem generally describes a human need or want and specifies criteria and constraints for an acceptable solution (International Technology Education Association 2000). Only constraints that reflect the science content statements in this framework will be considered in developing relevant NAEP assessment items. The engineer who designs a bridge, for example, must take into account the effects of wind and water currents by using relevant physics principles to simulate these effects on possible structures before the bridge is built. Second, even if limited to the application of science principles, choosing between alternative solutions almost always involves tradeoffs. As stated in the Benchmarks: There is no perfect design. Designs that are best in one respect . . . may be inferior in other ways . . . . Usually some features must be sacrificed to get others. How such trade-offs are received depends upon which features are emphasized and which are down-played (p. 49). The application of science principles may be used to compare alternative technological solutions to see which will better solve the problem and accomplish the project's goals. Finally, while the chosen solution may be intended to solve a human problem or meet a human need, the effects are not always as planned. When the automobile was invented, no one could have predicted the environmental and human health impacts of vehicle emissions. However, scientists and engineers must work together to apply their knowledge of the natural world to make such predictions. According to the National Standards, students in grades K-4 should know about the effects of design solutions: People continue inventing new ways of doing things, solving problems, and getting work done. New ideas and inventions often affect other people; sometimes the effects are good and sometimes they are bad. It is helpful to try to determine in advance how ideas and inventions will affect other people (p. 140). In terms of cognitive demands, both declarative (knowing that) knowledge and schematic (knowing why) knowledge come into play for the three components of Using Technological Design, as does strategic knowledge (knowing when and where to apply knowledge). The role of technological design in U.S. science classrooms currently varies widely, and it is not possible to predict the extent to which it will be integrated into the school curriculum in the future. The role of technological design in the NAEP Science NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK Assessment will need to be revisited regularly in response to its evolving role in school science. Since using technological design in the NAEP Science Assessment must have direct relevance to science, it is assumed that students have some understanding of the relationship between science and technology. The science-technology relationship is further discussed in chapter four as providing context for assessment items. The following item illustrates the expectation that students will apply science principles to anticipate the effects of a technological design decision.

No. There is no air in space, so gravity cannot exist there. C. Yes. There must be gravity since planets keep circling the Sun. D. Some. The Moon has one-sixth as much gravity as Earth, so we know there is some gravity in space. Key: C Interpretation: The correct answer is C. This question is drawn from a series of studies that show a common naive conception-that there is no gravity in space because space has no air. The distractors are drawn from student interviews. It is likely that these naive conceptions stem from images that students have seen of astronauts floating around in a \"weightless\" environment while in orbit. This item probes schematic knowledge (see Cognitive Demands section later in this chapter).\nA student is presented with a set of photographs of the Moon taken over a month's time. The photos are not presented in chronological order. The student is asked to arrange them in the order in which they were taken and explain the reason for Moon phases. Interpretation: This suggestion reflects items used frequently in curricular materials (e.g., Schatz and Cooper 1994). Students are asked to find patterns in the data. First, they should be sufficiently familiar with the lunar cycle to arrange the photographs in order, either in a line to represent a chronology or in a circle to represent a cycle (tapping declarative knowledge and procedural knowledge to a lesser extent-see Cognitive Demands section later in this chapter). Then, students should be able to explain Moon phases in terms of the Moon circling Earth and the changing angle between the Sun and Moon as observed from Earth. This part of the item probes schematic knowledge-see Cognitive Demands section later in this chapter. This is a challenging question that many educated adults fail to answer. However, studies show that middle school students can learn to do this exercise by observing lunar phases and explaining them using a model of the Earth-Sun-Moon system (Barnett and Morran 2002;Kavanagh, Agan, and Sneider 2005). NASA wants to launch a spacecraft with rockets from Earth so that it will reach and orbit Mars. Which of the following statements about this flight is WRONG? A. In the first phase of its flight, the forces acting on the spacecraft are the thrust of the rocket engine, gravity, and friction from the Earth's atmosphere. B. When the rocket engine shuts off, the only force acting on the spacecraft is the force of gravity. C. Once the spacecraft is above the Earth's atmosphere and the rocket engine is off, it will travel at a constant speed since there is no gravity in space. D. If the spacecraft is aimed correctly and has the proper speed, the spacecraft will reach Mars and require only engine braking to attain orbit. Key: C Interpretation: The correct answer is C because there is gravity in space and planning for such a rocket flight would need to take into account the gravity from Earth, Mars, and the Sun (declarative knowledgesee Cognitive Demands section later in this chapter). This question is drawn from a series of studies that show the following naive conceptions about gravity are common among many students at the middle school, high school, and even college levels: If a body is moving, there is a force acting on it in the direction of motion (Finegold and Gorsky 1991;Gunstone and Watts 1985;Sequeira and Leite 1991); there is no gravity in space (Bar et al. 1994;Chandler 1991;Morrison 1999); and gravity cannot act in space because there is no air in space (Bar and Zinn 1998). One study showed that, with effective instruction, middle school students can overcome these naive conceptions and learn that gravity does, in fact, act in space, where it keeps satellites and planets in their orbits (Bar, Sneider, and Martimbeau 1997)."}, {"section_title": "Item To Assess Using Scientific Inquiry", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Item Suggestion 2", "text": "Decisions about whether or not to develop new technologies always concern tradeoffs. For example, most scientists today believe that the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species was caused by the collision of a large asteroid with Earth 65 million years ago.

Also look for evidence that students understand that spacecraft can be built, launched, and navigated to intercept solar system bodies. (In fact, several spacecraft have already intercepted asteroids and comets.) Regarding scientific tradeoffs, look for evidence that students recognize the advantages of the proposed technologies (e.g., avoid a catastrophic collision in which billions of people and animals could die) as well as possible negative effects (e.g., breakup of the asteroid so there are many collisions rather than one, accidents on launch)."}, {"section_title": "LEARNING PROGRESSIONS", "text": "A learning progression is a sequence of successively more complex ways of reasoning about a set of ideas. For any important set of ideas in science, understanding increases over time as students learn more, moving from initially naive knowledge of the natural world to increasingly more sophisticated knowledge and conceptual understanding; this typically occurs in conjunction with educational experiences in and out of school (NRC 2001). In other words, the progression from novice learner to competent learner to expert begins with the acquisition of relevant experiences, principles, concepts, facts, and skills and moves to the accumulation and organization of knowledge in a specific domain and finally to expertise after extensive experience and practice (e.g., Ericsson 2002). The attention paid to growth of understanding may yield rich information about student progress. Research has been conducted on students' learning progressions in some areas of science and at some levels of students' development. It is expected that this research will directly inform the development of assessment items at grades 4, 8, and 12. For example, NRC has commissioned papers on learning progressions in evolution (Catley, Lehrer, and Reiser 2005) and in atomic molecular theory (Smith et al. 2004). Learning progressions provide opportunities for assessing specific content in greater depth. Several caveats about learning progressions are in order. First, learning progressions are not developmentally inevitable but depend on instruction interacting with the student's prior knowledge and construction of new knowledge. Thus, learning progressions need to invoke assumptions about instruction. Second, there is no single \"correct order\"; there may be multiple pathways by which certain understandings can be reached. The particular pathway taken may be influenced by prior instructional experiences, individual differences, and current instruction (NRC 1999c(NRC , 2001). Thus, learning progressions will necessarily be complex, involving multiple specific paths at the micro level, and will need to be described in ways that encompass such diversity. Third, actual learning is more like ecological succession with changes taking place simultaneously in multiple interconnected ways. Thus, attempts to describe specific sequences of learning performance (including those in the Catley, Lehrer, and Reiser (2005) and Smith et al. (2004) papers) must inevitably be artificially constrained and ordered. Finally, the learning progressions suggested in the framework and specifications are partly hypothetical or inferential because long-term longitudinal accounts of learning by individual students do not exist. Exhibit 16 uses a set of related science content statements across grades 4, 8, and 12 and follows the format of the science practices defined in the framework. It illustrates how relevant research (e.g., Smith et al. 2004) can be used as an opportunity to assess content in greater depth-available research on student learning is used to inform the generation of related performance expectations across grades. The exhibit includes examples of performance expectations for a possible learning progression for states of matter. These illustrative performance expectations do not denote a sense of content priority or importance and are not a complete representation of the research currently available.

Certain ways of knowing and reasoning (cognitive demands) underpin these four science practices. In this section, the four cognitive demands-\"knowing that,\" \"knowing how,\" \"knowing why,\" and \"knowing when and where to apply knowledge\"-are discussed briefly (see the specifications for more information). The goal is to further clarify the descriptions of the science practices, to facilitate item specifications and item writing, and to provide a framework for interpreting students' responses. That is, the set of four cognitive demands can be used as a lens to facilitate item development and to analyze student responses (Li NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK andShavelson 2006;Shavelson, Ruiz-Primo, and Wiley 2005), thereby checking expectations regarding the science content and practice(s) that are being tapped by a given assessment item. 10 \"Knowing that\" refers to declarative knowledge. This cognitive demand sets up the expectation that students should know and reason with basic science facts, concepts, and principles (e.g., density is mass per unit volume) and that they should be able to recall, define, represent, use, and relate these basic principles as appropriate. This cognitive demand corresponds most closely to the science practice of Identifying Science Principles. \"Knowing how\" refers to procedural knowledge. This cognitive demand sets up the expectation that students can apply the science facts, concepts, and principles in doing science. For example, students should know how to perform simple (routine) and complex procedures such as systematically observing and recording which objects sink and float in water, using a balance scale, measuring an object's mass, calculating an object's density, and designing and interpreting the results of an investigation (e.g., manipulating one variable and holding others constant). Procedural knowledge underlies much of the science practice of Using Scientific Inquiry as defined in this framework. \"Knowing why\" refers to schematic knowledge. This cognitive demand sets up the expectation that students can explain and predict natural phenomena as well as account for how and why scientific claims are evaluated, argued and justified, or warranted (explaining and reasoning with principles and models). That is, this cognitive demand deals with students' understanding of how the natural world works (such as why some things sink and others float in water), why light is essential to the propagation of most plants, or why the Moon changes phases. This cognitive demand overlaps considerably with the science understanding expected in the practice of Using Science Principles and also in the practices of Using Scientific Inquiry and Using Technological Design. The last cognitive demand, \"knowing when and where to apply knowledge,\" or strategic knowledge, is commonly talked about as transfer of current knowledge to new situations (tasks or problems). Strategic knowledge involves knowing when and where to use science knowledge in a new situation and reasoning through the novel task to reach a goal. Strategic knowledge sets up the expectation that students can take their current knowledge and apply it to a somewhat novel situation. Such adaptation of knowledge to a particular problem and context underlies especially the practices of Using Scientific Inquiry and Using Technological Design. The cognitive demands are related, not independent (similar to the science practices). That is, when explaining \"why,\" a student will need to call on \"knowing that\"; at times, in justifying \"why,\" a student may have to call on \"knowing how.\" In addition, depending on the novelty of the task, strategic knowledge (knowing when and where to apply knowledge) may be called into play. Nevertheless, these related cognitive demands can be distinguished, and it is helpful to do so for item development and interpretation of student responses.

Chapter three addresses the nature of science largely through a discussion of the science practices (particularly Using Science Principles and Using Scientific Inquiry). The relationship between science and technology is partially addressed in a discussion of the Using Technological Design practice. The history and nature of science not only clarify facets of science practices but also the human aspect of science and the role science has played in various cultures. Students can see that science changes, and new conclusions can be reached based on new empirical data (e.g., development of the theory of plate tectonics, use of gaps in early versions of the Periodic Table to \"discover\" new elements). The reciprocal relationship between science and technology can be seen, for example, in that scientists use technological tools to empirically test proposed explanations for questions about the natural world and engineers develop adaptations to the natural world to address human problems, needs, and aspirations based in part on science. When items are written to particular content statements, they may be framed in these contextual components of science content. Aspects of the history and nature of science and the relationship between science and technology should thus be incorporated into the contexts of assessment items as shown below."}, {"section_title": "JUSTIFICATION FOR VARIATION IN TYPES OF ITEMS", "text": "Issues of time and cost are paramount in any assessment. Accordingly, most of the item formats on the NAEP Science Assessment will be traditional selected response and short constructed response. However, some more complex items (e.g., hands-on performance tasks) should be part of any science assessment. Responses to complex items often correlate positively and cluster with responses to simpler items. However, complex items are recommended in the framework for the following reasons: \u2022 Items may correlate positively with one another, but they do not necessarily measure the same thing; that is, positive correlations can arise even when the cognitive demands of the assessment items vary. Research has shown that items vary in their cognitive demands for different kinds of knowledge and reasoning (e.g., Leighton 2004). \u2022 The NAEP Science Assessment signals the kinds of responses to tasks, problems, and exercises, along with the kinds of knowledge and reasoning, that should be expected of students as a result of what is taught in the science curriculum (consistent with the National Standards and Benchmarks). NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK For these reasons, the framework calls for a variety of item types for the 2009 NAEP Science Assessment (see the specifications for further details and explanation)."}, {"section_title": "DEFINITIONS OF TYPES OF ITEMS", "text": "The framework distinguishes selected-response from constructed-response item formats. For selected-response formats, students respond to a question by selecting the answer they believe to be most scientifically justifiable from a given set of alternatives. In contrast, with constructed-response formats, students respond to a question by \"generating\" or \"constructing\" a response. The constructed-response might be a single word, a short answer, an essay explanation, a summary of a laboratory investigation using concrete materials, or typed responses to a computer simulation. In addition to these two main item formats, there are combination items that generally require more than one response. These include item clusters, POE item sets, hands-on performance tasks, and interactive computer tasks. These combination items can use an all-selected-response format, an all-constructed-response format, or a mixture of these two main item formats. Following are the main types of items to be used on the 2009 NAEP Science Assessment: 1. Selected response -Individual multiple-choice items 2. Constructed response -Short constructed-response items -Extended constructed-response items -Concept-mapping tasks 3. Combination -Item clusters -POE item sets -Hands-on performance tasks -Interactive computer tasks Item clusters and POE item sets may use selected-response items, constructed-response items, or both. For example, a set of POE items might include a multiple-choice item in which students select a prediction and a short constructed-response item in which students are asked to write a justification for their prediction. Hands-on performance tasks and interactive computer tasks also may use selectedresponse items, constructed-response items, or both. In recording their answers, students may be asked to respond to both selected-response and constructed-response items. For example, 12th graders might be asked to manipulate a computer simulation of a chemical reaction, a multiple-choice question could ask students to choose the correct mass of a reaction product, and a short constructed-response question could ask students to describe how mass is conserved in chemical reactions."}, {"section_title": "SELECTED-RESPONSE ITEMS", "text": "Selected-response items include individual multiple-choice items.

Students read, reflect, and then select an answer from, for example, four alternatives provided. The alternatives include the most scientifically justifiable response (the answer) as well as three \"distractors.\" The distractors should appear plausible to students but should not be scientifically justifiable; when feasible, the distractors should also draw from current understanding about students' mental models and learning progressions. Whenever possible and especially when the focus is on using science principles or \"knowing why\" (schematic knowledge), naive conceptions, explanations, and predictions of the natural or manmade world should serve as distractors. Of the following two multiple-choice items, both require identifying science principles and both tap the cognitive demand \"knowing that\" (declarative knowledge). The first item taps simple factual content. The second item taps more conceptually sophisticated content.

Such items generally present a situation within or across content areas and require students to analyze the situation, choose and carry out an alternative plan for addressing it, and interpret their response in light of the original situation. Students may also be given an opportunity to explain their responses, reasoning processes, or approach to a problem situation. However, care must be taken (especially with 4th graders and English language learners) to ensure that language ability is not confused with science ability. The following item involves reasoning with mental models (on carbon cycling) and thus attempts to probe the practice of Using Science Principles and taps into the cognitive demand of \"knowing why.\""}, {"section_title": "Concept-Mapping Tasks", "text": "Concept-mapping tasks may be considered a complex item type because of the cognitive demands placed on students. Concept maps can be used as a reliable and valid assessment of students' ability to make connections among science principles (Ruiz-Primo and Shavelson 1996a). Thus, concept-mapping tasks tap a science ability that is difficult to measure by other means. These tasks address the practice of Identifying Science Principles and the cognitive demand of \"declarative knowledge,\" in particular the organization of this knowledge. In a concept-mapping task, students should be given a set of six to eight concept terms and be asked to construct a map linking pairs of terms with directed arrows. Students should label each arrow with a word or phrase that explains the relationship between a pair of concept terms. An arrow-linked pair of concept terms is called a proposition. Students' concept maps can be evaluated as to the accuracy of propositions in their maps. The following textbox provides an illustrative set of instructions for a concept-mapping task and a sample student response. See the specifications for information about scoring concept maps. NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK Another approach to probing students' conceptions of the natural world is to develop a cluster of ordered multiple-choice items. These items track students' performance along a learning progression from naive understanding through more reasoned naive conceptions to full and scientifically justified understanding. In this approach, the progression is first described and then divided into levels so that multiple-choice items can be designed specifically to assess the performance level that a student (or group of students) has reached. As noted earlier, constructed-response formats are not precluded for use in item clusters."}, {"section_title": "POE Item Sets", "text": "POE item sets ask the student to predict, observe, and/or explain as follows: A situation is described; the student's task is to provide a prediction for what will happen (sometimes with justification) and/or to provide an explanation for what appears to be an anomaly.

For example, the following POE item was used with middle school students and focuses on prediction based on a mental model of buoyancy: As noted earlier, a POE item can take either a selected-response or a constructedresponse format. In the selected-response format, students choose from a set of possible alternatives (based on known alternative mental models). In the constructed-response format, the student's task is to write out (with justification) a prediction or an explanation. In the POE selected-response item above, students are asked to choose among a set NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK of predictions for whether the parts of the block will sink or float. They can choose an answer from several alternatives that include naive conceptions. This item could be extended to further probe students' mental models of buoyancy. Students could be asked to justify their answers by selecting from a number of possible explanations; again, these alternatives could include the correct explanation along with distractor explanations based on naive conceptions. Or, instead of using a multiple-choice format, students could be told that the full block sinks in water and be asked to write their prediction (with justification) as to what will happen when the two parts are placed in water. Or, students could observe a simulation or video of what happens to the full block and the two parts and then be asked to explain what they have observed."}, {"section_title": "Hands-On Performance Tasks", "text": "Using hands-on performance tasks, students manipulate selected physical objects and try to solve a scientific problem involving the objects. These exercises, if carefully designed, can probe students' abilities to combine their science knowledge with the investigative skills that reflect the nature of science and inquiry. In large-scale assessments such as NAEP, uniform administration must be ensured. In the past, this has been accomplished through the use of standardized performance assessment kits, with each exercise proctored and scored by trained personnel. Special accommodations may be necessary for some students. A particularly cogent criticism of most hands-on performance tasks administered in large-scale assessments is that, rather than tap into students' ability to inquire into a problem, typical performance assessments instead measure students' ability to follow step-bystep instructions to arrive at the expected answer. Assessment developers are likely to create these \"recipe\" types of exercises because they must take into account the vast differences in students' participation in science courses and their experiences. Given these differences, the absence of structure might produce unanticipated responses that could be problematic for the assessment either at the time the data are collected or when students' performances are scored by raters. Although both the concern for structure to make largescale assessment manageable and the criticism of highly structured performance tasks are well taken, there is evidence that valid performance exercises can be designed, developed, administered, and scored without encountering major problems (e.g., Ruiz-Primo and Shavelson 1996b;Shavelson, Baxter, and Pine 1991). In designing hands-on performance tasks, it is important to keep the following considerations in mind: The degree to which students engage in some aspect of scientific inquiry depends on who selects the problem to be studied, who selects the procedures to be carried out in tackling the problem, and who selects the answer. The NAEP assessment should provide students with a challenging problem. However, students must have the opportunity to determine scientifically justifiable procedures for addressing the problem and arriving at a solution. Indeed, the problem to be solved involves setting forth procedures that manipulate the variable of interest, control extraneous variables, and provide solid data to be used in arguing for and justifying a problem solution. In addition to NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK allowing students to determine the procedures for carrying out the experiment, NAEP hands-on performance tasks should be \"content rich\" in that they require knowledge of science principles to carry them out. In brief, any hands-on performance task included in the NAEP assessment should present students with a concrete, well-contextualized task (problem, challenge); laboratory equipment and materials; and a response format that leaves the exercise process open. Students' scores should be based on both the procedures created for carrying out the investigation and the solution (Shavelson, Baxter, and Pine 1991). The assessment, then, should provide the problem that draws on science principles and practices (performance expectation of interest) and leave students free to design and carry out the exercise to arrive at an answer or solution. The following item, designed for fifth graders, is an example of such a task."}, {"section_title": "P8.16, Using Scientific Inquiry", "text": "Source: Persky et al. 2005.

A fundamental aspect of inquiry is the design, conduct, and interpretation of empirical investigations to answer a question or test a hypothesis. Although a full assessment of inquiry is not possible on any test that is given on demand, hands-on performance investigations (HPIs) attempt to approximate this aspect of inquiry under time, space, cost, and logistical constraints. For this reason, HPIs have been a part of the NAEP Science Assessment since 1996. However, HPIs have been criticized as being expensive, logistically difficult, and too highly structured. On the other hand, ICTs or, in this case, interactive computer investigations (ICIs), are logistically simpler, less expensive, and less structured. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore whether ICIs and HPIs are exchangeable. The question is not whether ICIs could replace HPIs either on NAEP or in the classroom-they should not. Even if these two approaches produce similar performances and scores, each affords somewhat different opportunities; simulations cannot be exchanged with actual practice. This is a question of assessment: can the cost and logistical challenges of HPIs be reduced with the use of ICIs and still measure the same competencies with as much reliability and validity? Some research suggests that the two methods of assessing student inquiry are exchangeable to a fair degree (e.g., Pine, Baxter, and Shavelson 1993;Rosenquist, Shavelson, and Ruiz-Primo 2000). However, further research is needed on several different investigations to provide a satisfactory answer for large-scale assessment. Specifically, this study would address the following research questions: \u2022 Does the choice of an ICI or HPI limit the questions that may be asked? Specifically, is there something of value in an HPI that cannot be asked if an ICI is administered? \u2022 Are scores on HPIs and ICIs equally reliable? \u2022 To what extent does performance on an HPI predict performance on an ICI in the same investigation? \u2022 Do scores on HPIs and ICIs correlate somewhat equally with scores on another measure of science inquiry or achievement? \u2022 Are similar thinking processes evoked by HPIs and ICIs? \u2022 Do the answers to these questions depend on individual differences among students (such as gender, English proficiency, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographic location)? Variation in student access to computers is also an area of interest; this factor could be confused with other variables listed here."}, {"section_title": "Impact of Variation in Item Format and Language Demand on the Performance of English Language Learners and Students With Disabilities", "text": "English language learners and students with disabilities do not perform as well on standardized achievement assessments as other students. Recent studies, for example, have pointed to a systematic relationship between the linguistic complexity of the assessment and the test scores of English language learners (e.g., Abedi 2003) and students with certain disabilities, such as those related to reading and information processing. Science assessments, with their heavy reliance on verbal skills, may exacerbate performance disparities. In cases where this relationship is demonstrable and test items use complex language, the differences become sources of measurement error and construct irrelevant variance; therefore, the nature of the assessment item must be addressed. Until this dimension of the assessment item is more clearly understood, any interpretation of the performance of English language learners or students with disabilities on a content assessment is problematic; for example, language proficiency and science understanding cannot be separated. Preliminary results from several studies of scaffolded science assessments that are designed to minimize language complexity and provide alternative response modalitiesincluding graphic organizers or drawn representations of the concepts-indicate that research is needed to clarify the relationship between language complexity, scaffolded assessment items, and the performance of English language learners and students with disabilities. Specifically, this study would address the following research questions: \u2022 Can the language complexity of a content-based assessment be systematically measured? NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK \u2022 Can content-based assessment items be designed to minimize the language demand while conserving the content information obtained? \u2022 If the content-based assessment contains a graphic response modality, do English language learners and students with disabilities demonstrate higher understanding of the content concept being assessed relative to more linguistically demanding response modalities? \u2022 When the content-based assessment with a graphic response option is also computer based, is there a further benefit in terms of content concept conservation and the performance of these students?"}, {"section_title": "Computer Adaptive Testing To Assess the Development of Student Understanding of Earth Systems 11", "text": "A common critique of large-scale assessment is that its necessary reliance on easily scored, decontextualized, and simplified items has led to an impoverished range of potential learning activities from which valid and reliable measures might be derived (Resnick and Resnick 1992). Attempts to find alternatives include the following: \u2022 The facets approach (Minstrell 1998), which posits a strong model of facets of student knowledge for certain science topic areas and uses coordinated sets of multiple-choice items to hone in on students' particular conceptions and misconceptions; and \u2022 The progress variable approach (Masters, Adams, and Wilson 1990), which posits a learning progression and uses item response theory to scale students' responses to (typically open-ended) items to estimate the part of the learning progression in which students will most likely be located. This special study combines the strengths of each of these approaches to develop a new type of \"branching\" item that can be used to investigate the more complex types of knowledge structures and complex procedural steps involving contingencies such as those common in inquiry-related contexts, and yet maintain the efficiency of traditional multiple-choice testing. Specifically, the facets approach will contribute its strong knowledge structure and convenient scoring, and the progress variables approach will contribute the interpretational framework of the learning progression and the flexible statistical modeling available through recent advances in item response modeling (De Boeck and Wilson 2004). Together, these approaches allow the use of item bundles (such as those shown in exhibit 20) to provide both the usual result in terms of student ability estimation as well as potentially more educationally informative results such as the prevalence of particular classes of misconceptions among the student body. Specifically, this study would address the following research questions: \u2022 Can the \"branching\" item type be developed and delivered in a logistically efficient way for use in NAEP? \u2022 Can the information from sets of \"branching\" item bundles be used to provide reliable, valid, and useful information on both overall student ability in science and the classification of students into educationally useful categories? The study would focus on a specific Earth system that is of practical and environmental significance, such as the biogeochemical carbon cycle. Understanding this system and related environmental issues (e.g., global climate change) requires connected understandings in the Physical, Life, and Earth and Space Sciences, many of which are characterized in the framework. For example, students who understand global warming understand how photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and fossil fuel combustion affect carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere. This connected understanding can be tracked as a learning progression."}, {"section_title": "THE FRAMEWORK INCORPORATES KEY ATTRIBUTES OF EFFECTIVE ASSESSMENT", "text": "The framework should use assessment formats that are consistent with the objectives being assessed. It should be guided by the best available research on assessment item design and delivery. The framework should take into account student diversity as reflected in gender, geographic location, language proficiency, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and disability condition. The assessment should be designed and written so it is accessible by the majority of students and to minimize the need for special accommodations for both students with disabilities and English language learners. Students with special needs should be provided accommodations so they can participate in the assessment. The framework should reflect knowledge about the acquisition of key science concepts over time, based on research about how students learn. The existing research findings should make clear, when possible, the progression of science knowledge across the grade levels. Concepts should be represented in a manner that reflects how students progress through a discipline and across disciplines. Assessment items should reflect students' potential for applying concepts and more varied and complex situations over time. Critical content and skills should be articulated and assessed across grades 4, 8, and 12 (vertically) and across the fields of science (horizontally) by creating items that are deliberately layered to achieve these goals. An example of measuring similar constructs within and across subjects is the progression of increasingly sophisticated understanding NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK about energy from elementary school to middle school to high school in the content areas of biology, chemistry, Earth science, and physics. The NAEP assessment should continue to use a variety of assessment formats, including well-constructed multiple-choice and open-ended items as well as performance tasks. In addition, multiple methods of assessment delivery should be considered, including the appropriate uses of digital-based technology. The framework should consider using digital delivery systems for the assessment, including Web-based or CD-ROM formats. Embedded simulations that can represent scientific phenomena such as data, representations, and factors captured within laboratory experiments, along with the use of an adaptively designed series of assessment items, should also be considered. Advances in machine scoring of text should provide the opportunity for increased use of open-response format questions. The assessment format and delivery system employed should be accessible to the widest range of students.

NAEP 2009 SCIENCE FRAMEWORK Exhibits B-2 to B-4 present the preliminary achievement level descriptions for grades 4, 8, and 12 to clearly illustrate the science content and practices expected at each grade level. Planning committee members used their expert judgment to draft the preliminary descriptions and were partially guided by the following considerations: \u2022 Basic descriptions could be composed of both moderately challenging content and practice components. \u2022 Proficient descriptions could be composed of a mixture of highly and moderately challenging content and practice components. \u2022 Advanced descriptions could be composed of highly challenging science content and highly challenging components of a given science practice. The preliminary descriptions include only illustrative statements drawn from the framework's science content and practices. The statements are not intended to represent the entire set of objectives from the content and practice dimensions, nor do the preliminary achievement level descriptions denote a sense of priority or importance based on the statements selected. In addition, the descriptions should not be interpreted as assessment items or as suggestions for assessment items. Although adjectives are not explicitly included in every statement, each was written with the expectation that student performances would be \"good\" and \"reasonable.\" For example, the phrase \"design an investigation\" implies \"design an organized and logical investigation\" and \"propose a framework\" implies \"propose a rational framework.\" After the assessment is administered, broadly representative panels engage in a standardsetting process to determine the achievement level cut scores on the NAEP scale. The cut scores represent the minimum score required for performance at each NAEP achievement level. A second outcome of this standard-setting process is a set of paragraphs, derived from the preliminary achievement level descriptions, to be used to report the NAEP science results to the general public and other audiences. For each grade level, the paragraphs describe what students should know and be able to do at the Basic, Proficient, and Advanced levels in terms of the science content and practices identified in the framework.

As consumers eat producers, the carbon compounds are broken down and rearranged into carbon compounds used by the consumer organism. When any living organism dies, the carbon compounds are broken down and returned to the soil by decomposer organisms. Huge sediment layers of dead marine organisms, which once had chitin cell walls or shells, compress under the weight of continuing sediments and the ocean. Uplifting of these layers forms sedimentary cliffs and rocks. Weathering and erosion continue to change the carbon compounds into forms that will again be incorporated into living organisms. Producer, consumer, and decomposer organisms harness the chemical bond energy stored in food via cellular respiration. Cellular respiration releases carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. The score is based on evidence of: geochemical cycling of carbon."}, {"section_title": "TRE Web Search Task", "text": "In this task, students are asked to use a search engine to determine why scientists use large helium gas balloons to explore outer space and the atmosphere instead of using satellites, rockets, or other such tools. One open-ended question and several multiple-choice questions are presented to students. Students are scored on how well they performed the search, the quality of the bookmarked pages, and how well the questions were answered. A complex scoring framework is used to assess students' proficiency on the task. A \"student model\" is created that describes the \"theory\" of how different skills are linked together. For this task, there are five component skills: problem solving in technology-rich environments, computer skill, scientific inquiry skill, exploration, and synthesis. An \"evidence model\" is created that describes how the students' responses are connected to each of these skills. Once students begin the task, every action is recorded and connected to one or more skills in the student model. Then, a three-step process is used to evaluate this record. The first step is feature extraction, which shows what action the student took, when the action was taken, and any value that was associated with that action. The second step is feature evaluation, which gives the scores for the actions taken based on developed rules that show the best way to complete the task. The third step is evidence accumulation, which systematically combines responses into summary scores that detail the inferences that can be made from the students' responses. This task incorporates a multifaceted evaluation process that can uncover the many skills involved in a single task or module. Thus, this module can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of students' skills and aptitudes than traditional test questions.

There are four modules in which students use a series of map visualizations and other data to reach and to present their final conclusions. Ultimately, students are asked to create a presentation to one state, recommending that the state apply for federal funds marked for solar energy use. Module 1 asks the student to review and apply background information on the conditions that both optimize and reduce solar energy production. They are also asked to conduct simple analysis using the ArcView map visualization program. Module 2 asks the student to explore several datasets to identify states with high incoming solar radiation and to manipulate the ArcView program and its map calculator tool. The student uses the ArcView program to generate visualizations and to calculate which states will generate the best monthly and annual electricity yields from solar panels. Module 3 asks the student to determine what other data may be necessary to create the most compelling recommendation to the states.

In many countries, teachers are expected to assess students' work during extended projects. Often their judgments of student achievement are made during ongoing classroom activities that are part of the regular curriculum. The teachers' assessments are incorporated into an overall score that also includes results of the short, timed tests. In some countries, a defined percentage of the total score is based on teachers' judgments about achievement associated with investigative projects. This study, then, might include both a national sample of students and an exploration of what other countries do under similar circumstances. Specifically, the study would address the following research questions: \u2022 What methods can be or have been developed to assess student achievement with respect to the ability to conduct extended scientific investigations? \u2022 To what extent are shorter investigations interchangeable for the extended investigation and to what extent are they not interchangeable?
