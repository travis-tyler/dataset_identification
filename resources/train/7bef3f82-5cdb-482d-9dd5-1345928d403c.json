Moreover, our previous integrated persistent feature (IPF) works well on an rs-fMRI cohort while it has not yet been studied on metabolic brain networks. To address these issues, we propose a novel univariate network measurement, kernel-based IPF (KBI), based on the prior IPF, to quantify the difference between IPF curves. In our experiments, we apply the KBI index to study fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging data from 140 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 280 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 280 healthy normal controls (NC). The results show the disruption of network integration in the progress of AD.

Its clinical manifestations include long-term memory loss, cognitive decline, language disorders, and other symptoms. AD seriously affects the normal life of the elderly. However, the pathology of AD is not yet clear [1] . Some existing imaging technologies are used to explore the mechanisms of human brain function. Compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been demonstrated to be a more precise predictor of both AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and is more suitable for monitoring disease progression [2] . It collects and measures changes in glucose metabolism values in brain regions or local brain cells. The signals are then converted into effective three-dimensional images and the connectivity between brain regions are analyzed.\nThe topological organization of metabolic brain networks have been successfully characterized in many cases using various measures based on graph theory [3] [4] [5] , such as characteristic path length (CPL) [6] , global efficiency [7] , modularity (Mod) [7, 8] , and network diameter (ND) [9] , to name but a few. Specifically, in patients with AD and MCI, several research groups have reported topological alterations in the whole-brain connectome, including a loss of small-worldness [10] , a redistribution of hubs [9, 11] , and a disrupted modular organization [12] . Traditionally, weighted networks usually require defining a set of thresholding values before quantifying network topology [13] [14] [15] , which may result in inconsistent network features when the thresholding values vary. Generally, the choice of threshold is rather arbitrary and there are no widely accepted criteria [16, 17] .\nRecently, persistent homology [18] in algebraic topology has been studied to detect persistent structures generated over all possible thresholds [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] in brain network analysis. There have been significant efforts to model evolution of brain networks and to link network topology to network dynamics. This method constructs multiscale network for all possible thresholds wherever the persistent topological features over the evolution of the network changes are identified. Its ability to handle noisy data and provide homological information has turned it into a successful tool for the analysis of brain network structures [24] . One typical application of persistent homology is in a Betti number plot (BNP) [18] , which has been successfully applied to the brain network research on epilepsy [20] , autism spectrum disorder, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [19, 23] . As BNP ignores the association between persistent features and forthcoming thresholding value changes, we proposed an integrated persistent feature (IPF) by integrating an additional feature of connected component aggregation cost with BNP, and applied it to measure an AD network using resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in our prior study [25] . However, both BNP and IPF applied linear regression analysis for computing the slope of the plot over all thresholds as a univariate network index. Such a slope-based approach may not accurately characterize the changes of persistent features over graph filtration because the curves are not strictly linear. Moreover, our previous IPF works well on an rs-fMRI cohort though it has not been used to study metabolic brain networks yet.\nIn this paper, we borrow the idea of kernel methods [26, 27] on persistent homology and propose a kernel-based IPF (KBI) index based on our prior work on IPF. We hypothesized that our KBI index may help to better reveal the difference between brain networks. With the cross-sectional FDG-PET imaging data of 140 AD, 280 MCI, and 280 normal control (NC) individuals, we set out to test this hypothesis by computing the KBI indices that measure the differences between AD, MCI, and NC groups. We further perform statistical inference and classification to validate the power of KBI."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "In this section, we use FDG-PET data to evaluate statistical power and classification performance of our proposed KBI index for the analysis of brain metabolic networks related to AD.

At present, it is difficult to put forward the evaluation criteria of these methods, and few studies have compared them comprehensively. Although the Pearson correlation that we used in this study may be the most practical scheme to define the connectome in AD studies, there is still debate about the choice of connectivity definition [29, 30] . Therefore, we performed four other connectivity definitions to explore more potentials in defining connectivity network. They were Kendall correlation [31] , Spearman correlation [32] , partial least squares [33] , and Granger causality modeling [34] . The obtained p-values of our proposed KBI with these distance functions are shown in Table 3 . There was no significant difference if Granger causality modeling was used, while the other three methods detected at least one significant difference. It should be noted that none of these methods performed significantly better than Pearson correlation (Table 1) in our current dataset. Moreover, when we checked all measures to discriminate AD, MCI, and NC by these methods, we found that the three-label classification accuracy of BNP (88.3%) was improved greatly if the partial least squares method was applied, while the performances in other cases have not been improved significantly.

The detailed statistical significances of between-group difference on HOA-110 are presented in Table 4 . Again, our proposed KBI achieved better statistical power. In the metabolic network construction, the common practice is building a group-wise brain network for each group as there is only one summarized value (average SUV) in each ROI. However, we notice that some studies [37] constructed subject-wise networks by dividing each ROI of a subject into blocks to obtain the correlation distance between any two ROI. Thus, subject-wise networks were constructed. We did not study this method in as it would require additional discussion that would exceed the scope of this paper.\nIn addition, we defined the connectivity between two brain regions as 1-Pearson correlation in Equation (1) in our study. Although some existing studies [19, 23] also define such kinds of connectivity in analyzing brain network properties, the common practice in brain network analysis based on graph theory is to directly specify the Pearson correlation as the edge weight. To assess the effect of different connectivity definitions on other graph-based measures, we performed statistical inference on the brain networks whose edges were defined as directly based on Pearson correlation, and the statistical p-values of graph-based measures are shown in Table 5 .

Then, although the subject-wise network is more convenient, efficient, and useful than group-wise network for brain network analysis, as we discussed in our prior study [25] , we only measured the group-wise metabolic brain network according to regular practice in PET data analysis. In future, we will validate the KBI in a subject-wise metabolic network. Finally, this study was based on cross-sectional PET analysis, and we compared their network indices.

In computer graphics, polygon meshes, as a class of graphs with particular connectivity restrictions, are extensively used to represent the topology of an object [42] ; however, the mesh representation may not be the most suitable representation for analyzing PET images because of connectivity restrictions [43] . Here, we extend polygon meshes to general graphs by relaxing the connectivity restrictions. Such graphs are easier to construct and are flexible enough to capture metabolic information. We construct a weighted network by encoding the metabolic information through an adjacency matrix W = {w ij }. The node corresponds to the brain regions, and the edge corresponds to the interregional correlation of brain metabolism.
