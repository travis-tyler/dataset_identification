[{"section_title": "FOREWORD", "text": "Any report on education and education systems is, at its heart, a story about people, places, and the times in which they exist. U.S. Doctorates in the 20th Century is about doctoral students, the institutions that provided their education, and the factors-intellectual, scientific, social, political, and economic-that effected change during the most significant and tumultuous period in American graduate education. It is a story told primarily with numbers, in this case, the most extensive and reliable data about those who earned the doctoral degree during this period. The thoughtful narrative adds a human dimension to the tables, charts, and graphs. The number and kinds of students seeking doctoral degrees during the last 25 years of the 20th century changed dramatically and included more women, minorities, and international students. As knowledge in many fields strained traditional discipline boundaries, new interdisciplinary programs as well as entire new fields developed. The costs associated with graduate education, and the way students paid for their education, became more complex. Career options available to doctoral graduates broadened, and traditional patterns of postgraduate employment changed. These and other changes, shifts, and trends are documented in this publication. U.S. Doctorates in the 20th Century continues the work begun in its companion volume, A Century of Doctorates, published in 1978, and extends the story of American doctoral education to the end of the 20th century. It is an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the nature and scope of doctoral education in the United States. Jules B. LaPidus, Ph.D. President Emeritus Council of Graduate Schools x The availability of new types of data on doctorates, the significant changes in doctoral education known to have occurred in the past 25 years, and the close of the 20th century make this a good time to reexamine the long-term trends in U.S. doctoral education. NSF's Division of Science Resources Statistics commissioned this report to explore these trends and to make the results available to the public. Cosponsors of the report are the National Institutes of Health, the National Endowment for Humanities, the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The volume is organized into chapters, beginning with an introduction. Chapter 2 traces the development of doctoral education in the United States from its beginnings in the last half of the 19th century and presents general trends on numbers of institutions and doctorate recipients from the early 1900s to 1999. The third chapter addresses the fields of study in which Ph.D.s receive their doctorates, as well as Ph.D.s' demographic characteristics, including sex, citizenship status, race/ethnicity, age, disability status, marital status and dependents, and the educational attainment of their parents. The data presented in chapter 3 provide the background for the topics presented in chapters 4 through 6. Each of these four chapters begins with a summary of data highlights."}, {"section_title": "PREFACE", "text": "Chapter 4 begins the exploration of the educational path followed by Ph.D.s after they leave secondary school. It considers attendance at 2-year colleges; attainment of bachelor's, master's and professional degrees, including foreign bachelor's degrees; fields of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees, including field switching between the baccalaureate and the doctorate; the primary source of support in graduate school and in doctoral study; activity in the year before receipt of the doctorate; education-related debt; and the time required to earn the doctorate after receiving the baccalaureate. Chapter 5 continues this exploration by providing information on the leading undergraduate and graduate institutions involved in the education of Ph.D.s. The last chapter, \"After the Doctorate,\" examines the immediate plans of Ph.D.s for employment or further study after graduation, including how definite those plans are and whether the new graduates plan to stay in the United States. For those Ph.D.s with definite employment plans in the United States, the chapter describes their sector of employment, primary work activity, and geographic destination (state). For those Ph.D.s planning to pursue a postdoctoral appointment or other additional study, the chapter examines their financial support mechanisms (such as fellowships and research associateships), settings or sectors for the postdoctoral study, and sources of support."}, {"section_title": "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS", "text": "Inc.) generated the many detailed tabulations from the DRF that were the basis of the report's analyses. Maurya Green (SRS) conducted historical research and assisted in the preparation of figures and tables. Kevin Mitchell (Aspen Systems, Inc.) edited an early draft of the report. Mary Golladay, Mary Frase, and Cheryl S. Roesel (SRS) designed the final report and directed its production. Walter Schaffer and Charles Sherman (NIH), Nancy Borkow (USED), Jeff Thomas and Frank Shaw (NEH), and S.

Beatrice Clewell (Urban Institute), Lindsey Harmon, Jules LaPidus, James Maxwell (American Mathematical Society), Peter Syverson (Council of Graduate Schools), and NSF reviewers Robert Bell, Joan Burrelli, James Lightbourne, Joan Lorden, and Judith Sunley reviewed and provided valuable comments on the report. This report would not have been possible without the legion of people who have been involved with the SED over the years, particularly the doctorate recipients, now more than 40,000 each year, who have completed the SED. The authors extend special thanks to Lindsey Harmon, the author of A Century of Doctorates: Data Analyses of Growth and Change, published in 1978 by NAS/NRC. This work provided the authors with much of the historical context for doctoral education in the first three-quarters of the 20th century. xii The 20th century was a remarkable era in the history of the United States. This nation, which had been an emerging power on the international scene in 1900, had by century's end become the world's leading power. One of the many factors contributing to this strength was the growth of U.S. doctoral education. This report describes the history and growth of doctoral education in the United States from 1900 to 1999 and shows changes in the characteristics of persons who complete a doctoral education. It builds on a publication that examined trends in doctoral education in the first three-quarters of the 20th century: A Century of Doctorates: Data Analyses of Growth and Change, published in 1978 by the National Academy of Sciences and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the U.S. Office of Education (NAS/NRC 1978). A vast majority of Ph.D.s, however, graduated in the last 25 years of the century and are not represented in A Century of Doctorates. Moreover, the characteristics of recent doctorate recipients differ in many ways from those of Ph.D.s a generation earlier. The early 1970s marked the end of a long period of expansion in U.S. doctoral education that began after World War II. By 1974, the last year examined in A Century of Doctorates, major changes in doctoral education were just becoming established or would soon become evident: increased representation of women, minorities, and foreign nationals; interruption in the growth of doctoral awards in science and engineering fields; emergence of new fields, such as computer sciences; lengthening of the time it takes to complete doctoral study; expansion of the postdoctoral pool; and reduced academic employment opportunities after graduation. Some of these trends could not be identified in the earlier report because the relevant data had not yet been collected. Data on race and ethnicity, for instance, were not collected until the mid-1970s. Other useful information began to be collected during the 1980s and 90s. And data available to describe characteristics of doctorate recipients and the graduate education enterprise continued to increase in scope as additional questions were added to the federally sponsored Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), which was the data collection instrument for this report. Now, for example, it is possible to examine the disabilities of recent Ph.D.s, their debt status at graduation, their primary sources of support in graduate school and doctoral study, and their parents' levels of education."}, {"section_title": "DATA SOURCES", "text": "The primary source of data for this report was the Doctorate Records File, a data bank containing information collected on nearly all of the more than 1.35 million doctorate recipients who received degrees since 1920. For those who earned doctorates between 1920 and June 1957, the data bank contains limited information about their doctoral institution, field of study, graduation year, and sex; this information was gathered from public sources, such as institutional lists and commencement programs. Since July 1957, more detailed data have been collected annually through the SED, which is administered to all new Ph.D.s shortly before they graduate. The SED data are especially important because the doctorate recipients themselves provide the information. The result is unusually rich data on the demographic characteristics of doctorate recipients, their educational paths, the financial support they received during graduate school, levels of debt related to their education, and their immediate postgraduation plans. Three important secondary sources were used to supplement the information obtained from the Doctorate Records File. Data on doctoral graduates from 1900 to 1919 came from early annual and biennial reports of the U.S. Office of Education  and from 120 Years of American Education: A Statistical Portrait (USED/NCES 1993). The aforementioned A Century of Doctorates provided much of the historical context for the findings through 1974.\nThe doctoral data in this report came from two original sources: U.S. Office of Education annual and biennial reports for the years 1900 to 1919, and the Doctorate Records File for the years 1920 to 1999 (including the results of the Survey of Earned Doctorates for the years 1958 to 1999)."}, {"section_title": "DATA NOTES AND FURTHER INFORMATION", "text": "This report examines data on research doctorates.

The terms \"Ph.D.\" and \"doctorate\" are used in this report to refer to all such degrees. Data on nonresearch and professional degrees, such as the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.), Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.), Doctor of Psychology (Psy.D.), and Juris Doctor (J.D.), are not included. See appendix C for definitions and further explanation of key terms. Data in chapters 3 through 6 are taken from the Doctorate Records File and thus date from 1920. Although Survey of Earned Doctorates data were collected first in the 1957-58 academic year (referred to as 1958 in published reports), the trends based exclusively on SED data are discussed in 5-year cohorts beginning with 1960, and data for much of the report are grouped in 5-year intervals for ease of discussion.

At the threshold of the 20th century the United States had a small but vigorous graduate education enterprise rooted in a new kind of institution, the research university. The distinctive feature of the research university was the doctoral program. In 1900 most of the approximately 250 research doctorates conferred were from the dozen or so new research universities in the Northeast and Midwest. 1 The next 100 years of doctoral education were marked by growth and diversification. Doctoral education became available in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico as the number of institutions offering doctoral programs grew. The number of disciplinary fields in which scholarly study was offered at the doctoral level; the number of doctorates awarded annually; and the number of women, minorities, and foreign nationals earning doctorates also grew over the course of the century. By 1999 the number of research doctorates conferred annually had reached more than 41,000, with these representing nearly 400 institutions across the United States. Between 1900 and 1999 the U.S. graduate education system developed into an integral part of the social and economic structure of the country, contributing to the nation's economic standing and also constituting a significant component of the U.S. economy. By the end of the 20th century, a total of 426 institutions had awarded more than 1.36 million doctorates."}, {"section_title": "THE U.S. MODEL OF DOCTORAL EDUCATION", "text": "The United States is unique in the extent to which fundamental research is conducted at universities, typically with the assistance of graduate students. Doctoral education is organized around an intensive, real-world research experience that prepares students to be scholars capable of discovering, integrating, and applying knowledge (CGS 1990). The American system, in which universities conduct research and train doctoral students, has become a model for the world (NAS/NRC 1995). It has played a major role in the United States' strong record of innovation and economic growth and has helped this nation become the global leader in science and engineering (NSB 1998). American doctoral education produces cutting-edge knowledge and highly trained personnel who go on to fill specialized positions as teachers, researchers, and professionals in academe, industry, government, and nonprofit organizations. In 1999 just over half of new U.S. citizen Ph.D.s with job commitments went into higher education after graduation-48 percent to 4-year institutions and 4 percent to 2-year colleges. About 22 percent of new Ph.D.s found jobs in industry or planned to be self-employed. Eleven percent planned to take jobs in elementary or secondary schools, 9 percent in government (mainly within the federal government), and 6 percent in nonprofit organizations. A look at Nobel Prize winners during the 20th century illustrates the value of the U.S. doctoral system and the lasting influences of its graduates. Between 1901 and1999, 162 Americans with doctorates from U.S. universities received 164 Nobel Prizes: 57 prizes for physics, 41 for chemistry, 34 for physiology or medicine, 25 for economics, and 7 for peace ."}, {"section_title": "BEGINNINGS OF DOCTORAL EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES", "text": "For the greater part of the 19th century, most institutions of higher learning were small and church affiliated and provided a classical education in the liberal arts, producing ministers and other professionals. By the middle of the 19th century, new fields-especially in sciences and engineering-had been added to the curriculum or were being taught in separate institutions, such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (founded in 1865), or in separate schools within institutions, such as Harvard's Lawrence Scientific School (1847) and Yale's Sheffield Scientific School (1854). These were not set up to be graduate programs, however. Of necessity, Americans went to Europe, especially Germany, for advanced education, including the doctorate. It has been estimated that 10,000 Americans traveled to Europe in the 19th century to study, more than half in departments of philosophy, the forerunner of arts and sciences ; the others pursued professional studies, such as theology, law, CHAPTER 2. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND and medicine. Some of these students earned doctorates and then returned to the United States, where most became college professors and many became leaders in the effort to create American universities. In the mid-19th century, there were numerous proposals and some efforts to develop American universities with graduate programs. The year 1861 is significant not only as the beginning of the Civil War but also as the first year in which doctorates were conferred in the United States. In 1861, three earlier bachelor's graduates of Yale College received the Doctor of Philosophy degree from Yale's Sheffield Scientific School after completing 2 years of graduate study, passing final examinations in several fields, and submitting written dissertations . Although Yale awarded four more doctorates in the next 2 years, graduate programs did not begin in earnest until the 1870s (Goldin and Katz 1999). The growth in graduate education was driven by institutional developments and fueled by increasing demand for advanced education at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. The University of Pennsylvania was the second American college to award a doctorate, in 1871, followed by Harvard, which conferred two Ph.D.s and one Sc.D. in 1873 . In 1876 an African American was the first racial/ethnic minority to earn a doctorate in the United States, receiving a doctorate in physics from Yale. In 1877 the first woman received a doctorate in the United States. In the last quarter of the 19th century, a small group of research universities offering doctoral programs emerged in response to a growing demand for knowledge in an industrializing society. The First Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862 gave each state a large grant of public lands to sell for the purpose of founding a college that taught agriculture and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies, leading to an expansion of public universities in the 1870s (NASULGC 1999). Some of these land-grant institutions became early awarders of doctorates, defined in this report as having awarded doctorates before 1920. Chapter 5 discusses the contributions of these early awarders in terms of the number of doctorates they conferred throughout the 20th century. The Second Morrill Land Grant Act of 1890 led to the establishment of public colleges in southern and border states that did not already have colleges for blacks (USDA 2003). In addition, many of the schools that had been established between 1866 and 1890 to train black teachers were incorporated into the land-grant system under the Second Morrill Land Grant Act. These 18 colleges, known as the 1890 institutions, addressed barriers to higher education that resulted from segregation. Five of these institutions eventually granted doctorates: Alabama A&M University, Florida A&M University, North Carolina A&T State University, South Carolina State University, and Tennessee State University. The 1890 institutions make up nearly one-fifth of the group of institutions known as historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs (White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities 2002). About the same time, there was an increase in the number of new private colleges with graduate programs (Clark, founded in 1889;Stanford, in 1891;Chicago, in 1892) and reorganization of older ones (Harvard and Columbia). Johns Hopkins University, a private institution founded in 1876, focused primarily on graduate education and emphasized original research by faculty and research-based doctoral dissertations (Storr 1973:41;Geiger 1986:8). Other colleges adapted their graduate programs to the Johns Hopkins model, although they placed more emphasis on teaching. This process was reinforced as Johns Hopkins graduates became professors in other universities. By the end of the 19th century, the American model of doctoral education had been established. It was based in a research university with undergraduate and graduate programs taught by the same faculty. The faculty members were organized by discipline in departments that were closely linked to the disciplinary scientific societies and specialized scholarly journals that were founded between 1890 and 1905. The American doctoral program generally included several years of coursework, final examinations, a year or two of research, a language requirement, and a dissertation . Most recipients became faculty members in colleges and universities whose enrollments were expanding substantially. They were recruited to teach in their specialized area of scholarship. Despite these advancements, U.S. doctoral education was in disarray at the turn of the century. American students were still flocking to European universities for graduate study, and American universities were viewed with little respect by European universities. The problem was that, unlike in Europe, higher education in America was decentralized and largely unregulated; diploma mills proliferated, and even shaky institutions could call themselves \"universities\" and award Ph.D.s. Some institutions, for example, allowed Ph.D. candidates to pursue courses without showing up on campus and to take exams at home under supervision of a proctor. The lack of standards and consistency was hurting the reputations of the more demanding U.S. universities.  In an effort to improve the situation, in January 1900 the presidents of the University of Chicago, Harvard, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, and the University of California-Berkeley invited 14 of the leading doctorate-granting institutions to send representatives to a conference to consider \"matters of common interest relating to graduate study.\" According to the letter of invitation, the conference's goals were to 1) result in a greater uniformity of the conditions under which students may become candidates for higher degrees in different American Universities, thereby solving the question of migration, which has become an important issue with the Federation of Graduate Clubs; 2) raise the opinion entertained abroad of our own Doctor's Degree; 3) raise the standard of our weaker institutions. (AAU 2003) Thus was founded the Association of American Universities (AAU) (table 2-1). Over the years the number of AAU members has grown, by invitation, from the 14 founders to 59 U.S. universities and 2 Canadian universities. 2 More than two-thirds (110) of the American Nobel Prize winners in the 20th century who earned doctorates in the United States graduated from AAU's founding institutions . Harvard (24), Columbia (22), Chicago (17), and the University of California-Berkeley (14) had the most Nobel Prize winners among their doctoral graduates."}, {"section_title": "GROWTH IN DOCTORATE-GRANTING INSTITUTIONS", "text": "Although by 1900 research-based graduate training was a permanent component of American higher education, it was still concentrated in a small set of institutions. The 14 universities that founded the AAU were the leading doctorate producers at that time and accounted for nearly 90 percent of all doctorates awarded in 1900 . The number of doctorate-granting institutions increased steadily throughout the 20th century, from fewer than 50 institutions before 1920 to 392 in 1999 (figure 2-1). In 1999 the 59 AAU members awarded 51 percent of the doctorates. The top 10 institutions (based on the number of doctorates conferred), which awarded 86 percent of all doctorates in 1900, awarded less than 16 percent in 1999. The greatest growth in doctoral programs at U.S. institutions of higher education was in the 1960s and 1970s, after the Soviet Union launched the satellite Sputnik. That 1957 event triggered new national policies focused on increasing the number of research universities (PSAC 1960). The number of doctorate-granting institutions grew by 73 in the 1960s and by another 87 in the 1970s. By the mid-1960s, institutions with doctoral programs were in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (figure 2-2). The rate of growth in the number of new doctorate-granting institutions slowed in the 1980s and 1990s, although the number of doctorates awarded continued to rise. In the last half of the 1940s the regional concentrations of doctorate-granting institutions began to shift away from the Northeast and Midwest into the South and West (figure 2-3). In 1920, 75 percent of all doctorate-granting institutions were located in the Northeast or Midwest. By 1999, 44 percent were in these regions.  1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 1999  All institutions FIGURE 2-1.

The substantial growth of the general population in the South since the 1970s and in the West since the 1940s also contributed to the establishment of new institutions and new doctoral programs within existing institutions. According to the U.S. decennial censuses, the South's population represented about 31 percent of the total U.S. population until 1970 then rose to nearly 36 percent in 2000 . The West increased its share of the U.S. population every decadefrom less than 6 percent in 1900 to 22 percent in 2000. 3 Seven percent annual increases resulted in a near doubling of the annual production of doctorates every 10 years from 1870 to 1970. 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 1999 0 FIGURE 2-3.

"}, {"section_title": "GROWTH IN DOCTORAL AWARDS AND R&D SPENDING", "text": "The annual number of research doctorates awarded in the first two decades of the century ranged from a low of 293 in 1902 to a high of 667 in 1916. The number of doctorates surpassed 1,000 in 1923, grew to a peak of 33,755 in 1973, and then peaked for a second time at 42,683 in 1998 (figure 2-4). This growth represents an average increase of almost 7 percent per year through the early 1970s. 3 These long-term trends were affected in the short term by such major events as the two world wars and the Great Depression. Growth was slow at the beginning of the century and declined sharply during World War I. A spurt marked the 1920s, followed by another period of slow growth (but not a decline) during the Depression years of the 1930s. A large decline during World War II was followed FIGURE 2-2. Decade of first doctoral award in the 50 U.S. states, District of Columbia, andPuerto Rico: pre-1920 to 1960s by sharp increases from to 1950 and continued growth until 1955. By the mid-1950s, however, the pentup demand for doctorates following World War II had been spent (NAS/NRC 1978). The 1960s were characterized by a high rate of growth in annual production of doctorates, fueled by public and government reaction to the launching of the Soviet satellite Sputnik in 1957. This achievement prompted a buildup of the graduate education system in the United States through a variety of programs, including graduate fellowships funded under the National Defense Education Act of 1957 and fellowship and traineeship programs of the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Public Health Service. National expenditures for research and development (R&D), both federal and nonfederal, increased at an annual rate of about 8 percent in real terms between 1953 and 1969 (table 2-2). 4 Total funding for R&D in colleges and universities also increased rapidly during this period, as did federal support for academic R&D. Many graduate students were supported as research assistants on research grants and contracts. The annual number of doctorates awarded rose from 8,611 in 1957 to 33,755 in 1973, an increase of nearly 9 percent per year. Cutbacks in R&D funding began in 1969. With the moon landing achieved, energy programs reduced, and costs of the Vietnam War beginning to have an impact on the federal budget, R&D spending was reduced significantly during the 1969-75 period. Federal dollars for academic R&D declined in 1969 and stayed low through 1975. Federal research fellowship and training programs were reduced. The government's share of total academic R&D funding also declined and continued to do so to the end of the century, sliding from a high of 73 percent of all academic R&D funding in 1965-68 to about 58 percent in 1999. During the 1970s the academic labor market in most fields became saturated, and there was concern about overproduction of Ph.D.s. In addition, the end of draft deferments for graduate students during the Vietnam War (effective 1968) had a negative effect on graduate enrollments of men. 5 Together these conditions resulted in a significant reduction in doctoral awards in the 1970s. By the late 1970s the number of doctorates awarded annually had declined to about 31,000. This number remained almost flat from 1978 to 1985. 6 With the defense buildup and gains in R&D spending of the 1980s, increases in doctoral awards resumed in all major fields except education. The number of doctorates conferred rose from 31,297 in 1985 to 42,683 in 1998, although the average rate of growth-about 2 percent per year-was much slower than the rate of growth during the first three-quarters of the century. The relatively high rate of growth in doctorate production during the century means that most of the 1.36 million doctorates awarded between 1900 and 1999 were conferred in the last few decades of the century. More than half of all doctorates were awarded between 1980 5 The Selective Service Act of 1967 and Executive Order 11360 ended 2-S deferments for all graduate students except those enrolled in certain programs (mainly medicine and related fields). Graduate students who had been enrolled in fall 1967 were allowed to complete that academic year, after which their deferments ceased. Individuals receiving a bachelor's degree in 1968 were not eligible for further student deferments unless they enrolled in the graduate programs specified . 4 The discussion of total R&D and academic R&D is based on NSB 2002, 1:4-3-4-10, 5-3-5-13; 2:A4-5, A4-6, A5-2. 6 Institutions reacted in different ways to the retrenchment of the 1970s. The result was a redistribution of students among institutions. Many of the long-established, top-rated doctoral programs reduced or froze graduate enrollments. Institutions in lower tiers with newly created programs chose to continue their programs rather than dissolve them, which would have meant losing their substantial investment in developing the programs. Consequently, large numbers of graduate students shifted to institutions in the lower tiers . FIGURE 2-4.

Between 1920 and there was a notable change in the geographical distribution of doctorates conferred. The concentration of degree production in the Northeast and Midwest ended with the relatively greater development of doctorate-granting institutions in the South and West and the greater population growth in these regions after 1920 (figure 2-5).

In 1952 the number of public doctoral institutions surpassed the number of private doctoral institutions. One year later the number of doctorates produced by public institutions surpassed the number produced by private institutions (figure 2-6). By the 1970s public universities accounted for about two-thirds of the doctorates conferred each year, a proportion that held steady to the end of the century. Total doctorate production from 1920 to 1999, however, reflects the early concentration of degrees in the Northeast and Midwest (table 2-4). All but 3 of the top 10   \u2022 Fields of Study. More than 1.35 million research doctorates were awarded in the United States during the last eight decades of the 20th century-62 percent in science and engineering (S&E) and 38 percent in non-S&E. Although the number of S&E doctorates exceeded the number of non-S&E doctorates in every year, education was the largest major field from 1962 to 1999. \u2022 Sex. Men received about 73 percent of all doctorates awarded between 1920 and 1999. The rapid increase in the numbers of women earning doctorates, beginning in the 1960s, increased their share of doctorates from 15 percent in the early 1920s to 41 percent in the late 1990s. \u2022 Citizenship Status. In the late 1980s about one in four Ph.D.s was a foreign national; by the 1990s this proportion had increased to almost one in three. Most foreign doctorate recipients were on temporary visas, most were men, and most studied S&E fields. \u2022 Race/Ethnicity. Minorities accounted for nearly 14 percent of all S&E doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens in 1995-99, compared with about 6 percent in 1975-79, when data on race/ethnicity were first collected in the SED. Among U.S. citizens, minorities also increased their share of non-S&E CHAPTER 3. FIELD CHOICES AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF DOCTORATE RECIPIENTS \u2022 Age. Since 1960, the median age of doctorate recipients has increased about 2 years. The median age of Ph.D.s in 1995-99 was 33.7 years; in 1960-64 it was 31.8 years. In 1995-99 the recipients of doctorates in S&E fields were much younger (31.9 years old) than those who received doctorates in non-S&E fields (39.5 years old). \u2022 Disability Status. Nearly 4,700 Ph.D.s (almost 2 percent of all doctorate recipients in 1993-99) reported having one or more disabilities, with orthopedic (mobility) disabilities being the most common. \u2022 Marital Status and Dependents. Throughout the century, a majority of doctorate recipients were married at the time of graduation. The proportion of married graduates, however, declined from 75 to 60 percent between the early 1960s and 1995-99. The percentage of doctorate recipients with children or adult dependents (regardless of marital status) also declined in this period. Men were more likely than women to be married and have dependents. \u2022 Parents' Education. On the whole, the level of educational attainment for families of doctorate recipients is higher than the national average."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Research doctorates are differentiated by the field studied. Field of study has been a characteristic of doctorates awarded in the United States since 1861, when the first three U.S. doctorates were awarded. Those degrees, conferred by Yale, were in the fields of philosophy and languages, classics, and physics. The number of major fields and field specialties has grown to 363 since then. In this report, 12 major fields of study are used; these are categorized as either science and engineering (S&E) fields or non-S&E fields. Groupings within these two categories are shown in table 3-1. 1 list of field specialties annually and update it periodically. Appendix table A-1 shows the complete list of field specialties used in the SED, grouped by major field. The distribution of doctorates across S&E and non-S&E fields reveals a stable picture. In every year from 1920 to 1999, the number of doctoral awards in S&E fields was greater than the number in non-S&E fields (table 3-2). Of the 1,354,873 doctorates granted by U.S. institutions between 1920 and 1999, 62 percent were in major fields considered S&E and 38 percent were in fields considered non-S&E. The S&E share of degrees dropped below 60 percent only in the 1945-46 academic year, the 1970s, and the early 1980s. In 1999 Four of the top five major fields in 1995-99 were also in the top five in 1920-24, but only biological sciences held the same rank in both periods. Table 3-3 shows the top five major fields in 1920-24 and in 1995-99. The number of doctorates awarded in each major field from 1920 to 1999 is shown in figure 3-1.

Subsequently, after some years of fluctuation, the field began another period of dramatic growth in the late 1980s. Biological sciences was one of the largest doctoral fields throughout the 20th century, with 167,179 doctorates awarded between 1920 and 1999. 3 In 1999 European universities conferred 54,000 S&E doctorates, and Asian universities conferred 21,000 S&E doctorates. European universities awarded more doctorates than either the United States or Asia in each of the broad areas of S&E. U.S. universities conferred more doctorates in all science fields in 1999 than did Asian universities but conferred fewer in engineering (NSB 2002, 1:2-41-2-42). 2 Data in chapters 3 through 6 are taken from the Doctorate Records File and thus date from 1920. Although Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) data were collected first in the 1957-58 academic year (referred to as 1958 in published reports), the trends based exclusively on SED data are discussed in 5-year cohorts beginning with 1960. Data are grouped in 5-year intervals for ease of discussion and to permit \"smoothing\" of data for small groups. The demographic characteristics of doctorate recipients also changed substantially over the course of the century. Except in certain fields, the participation of women in doctoral education increased significantly relative to that of men. Racial and ethnic minorities also made substantial percentage gains in doctoral awards, although the absolute numbers of doctorates received by minorities remained low compared with whites. The number and percentage of doctorates awarded to non-U.S. citizens increased sharply in the 1980s and 1990s. 2 Other characteristics of doctorate recipients-their ages at graduation, disability status, likelihood of being married and having dependents, and the educational attainment of their parents-are also examined here."}, {"section_title": "FIELDS OF STUDY", "text": "Fields of study are not static; they change as research advances the frontiers of knowledge, as shown by the influence of quantum mechanics on physics and the influence of plate tectonics on geology.

Most of this decline can be attributed to chemistry, a specialty (detailed field) of physical sciences. Chemistry's share of all doctorates fell from 18 percent in 1920-24 to 5 percent in 1975-79, where it has remained. The other detailed field of physical sciences, physics and astronomy combined, also accounted for a smaller share of doctorates in the last three decades of the century, but its decline was not as severe as that of chemistry.

Long-term trends in the demographic characteristics of doctorate recipients-sex, citizenship status, and race/ethnicityare examined here. 6 SEX Throughout the 20th century men earned the majority of doctorates and accounted for much of the substantial increase in total doctorate production (figure 3-2). For the period 1920-99 men received 73 percent of all doctorates awarded and women received 27 percent. Most of the growth in doctorate production among men in the late 1980s and the 1990s resulted from the large increases in the numbers of foreign men seeking graduate education in the United States, not from greater numbers of U.S. men receiving doctorates. The percentage of male doctorate recipients who were foreign nationals rose from 22 percent in 1980-84 to 38 percent in 1990-94. Changes in public policies after World War II created a more favorable climate for growth in doctorate production, noted first among men, than existed in the prewar years. In the 1950s the number of men earning doctorates surged (figure 3-2). This trend can be largely attributed to the G.I. Bill, enacted in 1944, which afforded returning World War II veterans the opportunity and financial support to begin or continue their education. A second period of substantial growth in doctorate production by men occurred in the post-Sputnik era, from the 1960s to the early 1970s. Among the contributing factors were new or expanded federal programs for graduate fellowships and traineeships as well as student deferments during part of the Vietnam War. In the 1970s concerns about a possible oversupply of Ph.D.s led to modification or curtailment of some federal and private programs that supported graduate students, and the 5 This major field includes doctorates in business management and administrative services, communications, and other professional fields, such as architecture and environmental design, library science, public administration, and social work. 6 A listing of the country of citizenship of non-U.S. citizen Ph.D.s by visa status can be found with the supplemental tables for this report on the NSF website at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06319/.

The end of draft deferments for graduate students in 1968 was another major factor in the sharp decline in doctoral awards to men starting in the early 1970s. Trends in doctorate production for women were distinctly different from those for men. The period of dramatic growth in doctorates earned by women began in the 1960s and continued to the end of the century. Almost 43 percent of all doctorates awarded to women between 1920 and 1999 were awarded in the 1990s. The proportionate gains for women were truly remarkable: women's share of all doctorates conferred rose from 15 percent in 1920-24 to 41 percent in 1995-99 ( figure 3-3). Yet at the close of the century, women were still underrepresented relative to their presence in the college-educated population. In 1999 women constituted 43 percent of all Ph.D.s, compared with 48 percent of the U.S. population 25 and older with 4 years of college (U.S. Census Bureau 2000, table 251). In 1960 women earned 1,042 doctorates; in 1999 they earned 17,493 doctorates. A convergence of influences accounts for this growth: the general increase in the young adult population as the baby boomers came of age, the women's movement, affirmative action policies, and targeted federal and private investments to increase the number of women with advanced degrees. Foreign women entering the United States for graduate education also contributed to growth in doctorate production by women. In the early 1960s 11 percent of all female Ph.D.s were foreign nationals; by the late 1990s the figure was about 21 percent. From 1920 to 1999 more than twice as many men received S&E doctorates as received non-S&E doctorates (figure 3-4). It was only during the last period in the century, 1995-99, that women earned more doctorates in S&E fields than in non-S&E fields. From 1920-24 to 1995-99, women's share of all S&E doctorates awarded increased from 13 to 33 percent, and women's share of all non-S&E doctorates awarded increased from 19 to 55 percent (figure 3-3).

Moreover, many students who eventually pursue a doctorate do not enter graduate school immediately after receiving a bachelor's or master's degree. Many graduates enter the workforce and only later decide to undertake doctoral studies. In some fields, such as education, specific kinds of work experience may be required before the doctorate is awarded. These factors, among others, contribute to the total elapsed time between receipt of the baccalaureate and receipt of the doctorate.  1975-79 1980-84 1985-89 1990-94 1995- During the 1950s and 1960s, concerted efforts were made to reduce the time required to earn a doctorate, and the data indicate that there were declines in the age of new Ph.D.s during that era. Between 1970 and 1999, however, the age of Ph.D.s at graduation rose (figure 3-18). Doctoral students graduating in 1995-99 were, on average, nearly 34 years old, almost 2 years older than those graduating in 1960-64. Reflecting variations by field, recipients of doctorates in S&E fields were substantially younger than their non-S&E colleagues throughout this period, and the differences in their ages increased beginning in 1975-79. Over the 40-year period from 1960 to 1999, the difference between the ages of men and women at graduation narrowed. In 1960-64 female Ph.D.s were almost 5 years older than male Ph.D.s, but by 1995-99 the gap between the average ages of male and female Ph.D.s was less than 2 years (figure 3-19)."}, {"section_title": "DISABILITY STATUS", "text": "Statistics on the disabilities of Ph.D. recipients began being collected in the SED in 1993. Nearly 4,700 individuals with self-reported disabilities were awarded doctorates between 1993 and 1999-accounting for close to 2 percent of all doctorates awarded in that period, substantially below the percentage of disabled persons in the U.S. population. In 1997 about 13 percent of the U.S. population 22 to 44 years old had some kind of disability, and nearly 8 percent were severely disabled (U.S. Census Bureau 2000, table 222). Among Ph.D.s graduating in 1993-99, orthopedic (mobility) disabilities were the most common, reported by 28 percent of those with disabilities, followed by visual (19 percent) and auditory (14 percent) disabilities.

PATH TO THE DOCTORATE INTRODUCTION", "text": "For students whose ultimate goal was to earn the doctorate, opportunities and options expanded in the second half of the 20th century. Many doctorate recipients still went directly from secondary schools to full-time study at 4-year colleges or universities for the baccalaureate, then immediately to universities with long-established graduate programs for full-time doctoral study. That pattern began to change, however, in the years following World War II. Some of the factors that influenced the path to the doctorate were structural changes in U.S. higher education, draft deferments during the Vietnam War, more postbaccalaureate options, consequences of the changed mix of U.S. graduate students, and growing internationalization of U.S. doctoral education. This chapter reviews the undergraduate and graduate experiences of Ph.D.s."}, {"section_title": "ATTENDANCE AT 2-YEAR COLLEGES", "text": "The rapid expansion of 2-year colleges during the second half of the 20th century brought opportunity for higher education closer to most high school graduates. Low tuition costs and flexible schedules, designed to accommodate both part-time and full-time students,  drew large numbers of students. By 1972 these institutions were enrolling the majority of first-time college freshmen, and they did not relinquish that lead until 1986 (USED/NCES 2002, table 182). In fall 1999, 45 percent of first-time college freshmen were attending 2-year colleges. About 9 percent of all Ph.D.s who graduated in the late 1970s and early 1980s reported that they had attended 2-year colleges, a slightly higher percentage than in the early 1970s (figure 4-1). The percentage of S&E Ph.D.s reporting attendance at 2-year colleges decreased in the late 1980s and the 1990s, whereas the percentage of non-S&E Ph.D.s increased except for a brief period during the 1980s. In 1995-99 non-S&E Ph.D.s were almost twice as likely as their colleagues in S&E fields to have attended 2-year colleges (12 percent compared with 6 percent, respectively); for Ph.D.s in all fields the figure was 8 percent. By major field, percentages ranged from a high of 15 percent in education to a low of 4 percent in engineering (figure 4-2). Trends in the proportions of Ph.D.s reporting attendance at 2-year colleges were affected by the growing presence of foreign nationals receiving doctorates from U.S. institutions. The surge in male foreign students during the 1980s and 1990s was undoubtedly a factor in the percentage of male Ph.D.s who attended a 2-year college (figure 4-3). By 1995-99 attendance at a 2-year college among those who received doctorates was more common for women than for men (9 percent compared with 7 percent, respectively), whereas the opposite was true in the early 1970s. More than 11 percent of all U.S. citizens awarded doctorates in 1995-99 had attended 2-year colleges, up from about 10 percent in the late 1970s (figure 4-4). Reports of attendance at 2-year colleges increased for American Indians/Alaskan Natives, blacks, and whites. These colleges played an especially prominent role in the education of American Indians/Alaskan Natives and Hispanics who eventually earned doctorates. More than one-fifth (22 percent) of American Indians/Alaskan Natives and about one-sixth (16 percent) of Hispanics who received doctorates in 1995-99 reported attendance at 2-year colleges (for Hispanics who received doctorates in 1975-79, the proportion was even higher, 21 percent). The percentages for blacks and whites were lower; the figure was lowest for Asians/Pacific Islanders (about 6 percent of those graduating in 1995-99, down from 8 percent in 1975-79).    1935-39 1945-49 1955-59 1965-69 1975-79 1985-89 1995-99 1920-24 before or concurrently with the doctorate, although remaining small, doubled from 1 percent of Ph.D.s in 1960-64 to 2 percent in 1995-99. 1 Reasons for field switching may include the emergence of new fields, such as computer sciences, and the relation of a baccalaureate to a doctoral field. In the cases of education and professional and other fields, the doctorate adds competencies to complement degrees in subject-area fields. In 1995-99 more than one-half of the doctorates in computer sciences, education, and professional and other fields were awarded to individuals SOURCE: NSF/NIH/USED/NEH/USDA/NASA, Survey of Earned Doctorates and Doctorate Records File. 1960-64 1965-69 1970-74 1975-79 1980-84 1985-89 1990-94 1995- Men switched fields between the baccalaureate and the doctorate less often than women did. The amount of field switching by men and women changed little between the early 1960s and the late 1990s (figure 4-12). In each of the three citizenship groups, however, changes did occur.  2 Information on all modes of support can be found in the annual summary reports of SED survey results (NORC 1998, NAS/NRC 1968."}, {"section_title": "BACCALAUREATES, MASTER'S DEGREES, AND PROFESSIONAL DEGREES", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "FIELDS OF BACCALAUREATE, MASTER'S DEGREE, AND DOCTORATE", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Year of doctorate", "text": "field of engineering Ph.D.s (91 percent), engineering was the second largest master's degree field of Ph.D.s in the fields of physics and astronomy (6 percent); chemistry (6 percent); earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences (6 percent); mathematics (3 percent); and computer sciences (12 percent).\n"}, {"section_title": "FINANCIAL SUPPORT", "text": "The availability of financial support influences students' decisions about whether to pursue degrees beyond the baccalaureate. The kind of support available to students also affects the time it takes to complete additional degrees. Most doctoral students rely on several kinds of support for their graduate education. A study of S&E Ph.D.s who graduated in 1995 found that doctorate recipients used an average of 2.5 modes of support during graduate school (NSF 2000). More than 40 percent of these S&E Ph.D.s relied on three or more different sources of support, whereas 16 percent received support from only one source. The number of sources and the kinds of support used by these Ph.D.s varied by field of doctorate, sex, citizenship status, and race/ethnicity. Research assistantships, teaching assistantships, and personal resources mixed in a variety of ways to form the most common combinations of support for S&E Ph.D.s graduating in 1995. Source-of-support questions in the SED have been changed several times, resulting in multiple code schemes that prevent the use of all source-of-support data in examining long-term trends. Information about the primary source of support, however, comes from a separate item and is coded consistently in the database, allowing a limited analysis of primary sources over time (because of survey changes, this analysis must be restricted to the 1980-81, 1996-97, and 1998-99 Ph.D. cohorts 2 ).  examined (57 percent in 1980-81, 58 percent in 1996-97, 61 percent in 1998-99). Another third or more of doctorate recipients in 1980-81 (38 percent), 1996-97 (36 percent), and 1998-99 (32 percent) relied on personal resources-loans, support from family members, and their own earnings and savings-as the primary source of support for their graduate education, but with variation by field. Personal resources were the principal mode of support for more about half (53 percent) of Ph.D.s in non-S&E fields compared with about one-fifth (20 percent) of those in S&E fields. The remaining percentage of doctorate recipients in each of the cohorts discussed above relied on other sources of support, such as state and foreign support (5 percent in 1980-81, 6 percent in 1996-97, 7 percent in 1998-99)."}, {"section_title": "ACTIVITIES IN YEAR BEFORE RECEIVING DOCTORATE", "text": "The activities of doctoral students in the year before graduation are consistent with the patterns of support reported for doctoral study, which show heavy reliance on personal resources and such mechanisms as assistantships and fellowships. Full-time employment in the year before the doctorate was received declined substantially after the early 1970s, when 44 percent of Ph.D.s were employed full time, to 35 percent in 1995-99. Part-time employment, in contrast, more than doubled between the 1970-74 and 1995-99 periods, from 5 to 12 percent (table 4-2). Reliance on assistantships in the year before receiving the doctorate became more common and reliance on fellowships less common between the early 1960s and late 1990s. .

About onefifth of all Ph.D.s in 1998-99 owed more than $20,000, whereas about 7 percent owed that amount in 1988-89. The pattern of rising debt was most notable in non-S&E fields. The percentage of non-S&E Ph.D.s with education-related debt above $20,000 more than quadrupled between 1988-89 and 1998-99, from about 5 to 22 percent.

Some of these factors are matters of personal choice or necessity. Others are related to characteristics of doctoral programs in specific fields and in particular institutions or to eligibility requirements for certain types of financial support funded by the federal government. Whether or not a master's degree is required can also affect the pace of graduate study. In addition, external events, such as wars, can postpone or interrupt a person's education, thereby increasing the time it takes to earn the doctorate.  Over the course of the 20th century, there was a gradual increase in the time it took students to earn their doctorates. This upward trend is evident in all three ways that time can be measured from available data: (1) total time to doctorate (TTD), the total elapsed calendar time between receipt of the baccalaureate and receipt of the doctorate, including time not enrolled in school; (2) registered time to doctorate (RTD), the time in attendance at all colleges and universities between receipt of the baccalaureate and receipt of the doctorate, including enrollment not related to the doctoral program; and (3) postbaccalaureate time to doctorate (PTD), total elasped calendar years between the first postbaccalaureate attendance at the institution that awarded the doctorate and receipt of the doctorate. 3 PTD includes time spent in a master's degree program if these studies were at the same institution that granted the doctorate."}, {"section_title": "FIELD OF DOCTORATE", "text": "Between 1920-24 and 1995-99 the median overall TTD rose from 7 years to 11 years (figure 4-14). The computation of RTD requires additional data elements collected only in the Survey of Earned Doctorates, so RTD is available only for the last four decades of the century. Between the periods 1960-64 and 1995-99, the median overall RTD grew from 5 years to 7 years (figure 4-15). The fact that TTD rose more sharply than RTD in recent decades means that Ph.D.s were spending more time out of school before completing their doctorates. Both TTD and RTD were substantially shorter for S&E Ph.D.s than for non-S&E Ph.D.s. The increases for both measures were greater in non-S&E than in S&E fields. The third measure, PTD, can be computed only for doctorate recipients who graduated in 1993-99. Although data from this measure cover just 7 years, it appears that the time spent in graduate work at the doctorate-granting institution (median PTD of 6 years), is changing little despite changes in the other measures. Moreover, the results for 1993-99 show little difference in PTD among the major fields. For the 1995-99 cohort, the median PTD was the same (6 years) for S&E fields and non-S&E fields in the aggregate (table 4-4). There was some variation by subfield, but only humanities Ph.D.s, at a median of 7 years, exceeded the overall median PTD. There was greater variation by field in TTD and RTD. Historically, chemistry Ph.D.s have had the shortest times to completion of the doctorate. In 1995-99, their median TTD was 7 years and their median RTD was 6 years. Master's degrees were least common among chemistry Ph.D.s, so their shorter times to completion may be partly explained by a greater tendency to move directly into a FIGURE 4-15.

In contrast, the field of education typically requires students to have several years of work experience in elementary or secondary schools before receiving the doctorate, with the result that the time between baccalaureate and doctorate is relatively long compared with other fields.

Furthermore, fields differ in terms of the availability of financial support for full-time graduate study, and members of the various demographic groups tend to favor some fields over others. The interactions of all these elements are ultimately reflected in measures of the elapsed time it takes to complete the doctorate. Generally, time-to-doctorate, as measured by both TTD and RTD, has been considerably shorter for men than for women, shorter for temporary residents than for permanent residents and U.S. citizens, and among U.S. citizens, shorter for Asians/Pacific Islanders than for other racial/ethnic groups. The gaps between women and men in TTD and RTD have narrowed over the years (figure 4-16). Men's TTD and RTD increased 2 years between the periods 1960-64 and 1995-99, to 10 years for TTD and to 7 years for RTD, whereas women's TTD remained about the same and their RTD increased from 6 to 8 years. The differences in time-to-doctorate for men and women correspond to the differences in the median times for S&E and non-S&E fields. Compared with men, women were more concentrated in non-S&E fields than in S&E fields. Consequently, women's time-to-doctorate measures are more similar than men's to the pattern for non-S&E fields. TTD and RTD increased for each citizenship group between 1960-64 and 1995-99, with the increases largest for permanent residents (figure 4-17). Temporary residents, with their heavy concentration in S&E fields, took less time in 1995-99 to complete their doctorates than permanent residents and U.S. citizens did. An analysis of time-to-degree for various demographic groups, which incorporated information for students who did not complete degrees, showed that foreign Ph.D. students have higher completion rates as well as lower average times to degree completion . Reliable race/ethnicity data first became available in 1975. Since then, among U.S. citizens the median RTD has increased for every racial/ethnic group, and the median TTD has increased for every group but Asians/   (figure 4-18). Among racial/ethnic groups in 1995-99, Asians/Pacific Islanders-highly concentrated in S&E fields-had the shortest median TTD (9 years) and the shortest median RTD (7 years).

The year in which an institution conferred its first doctorate provides one measure of the dynamics of the doctoral enterprise. Yale University conferred the first three U.S. doctorates in 1861. From that beginning, the number of doctoral institutions grew to 50 during the first two decades of the 20th century (figure 5-6). A total of 426 institutions awarded doctorates between 1861 and 1999. Over the years, a few of these institutions closed, and some merged with other institutions or discontinued their doctoral programs. A few institutions with small doctoral programs did not confer doctorates every year. In the period 1995-99, 401 institutions awarded doctorates; 392 institutions awarded doctorates in 1999. The greatest 5-year period of growth was from 1970 to 1974, when 62 institutions granted doctorates for the first time.  -99 1990-94 1985-89 1980-84 1975-79 1970-74 1965-69 1960-64 1955-59 1950-54 1945-49 1940-44 1935-39 1930-34 1925-29 1920-24 Pre-1920 Number of institutions   0  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90 100 Because it usually takes many years before new doctoral institutions award a large number of doctorates, the institutions with older, established doctoral programs remained prominent, and newer institutions only gradually increased their share of doctorates. Thus, even as new institutions joined the doctoral pool, the 50 institutions that granted doctorates before 1920 continued to award the majority of doctorates up to the final quartercentury. Their share of doctorates slowly diminished over the course of the century but was still about 40 percent in 1995-99 ( figure 5-7).

The First and Second Morrill Acts gave a strong impetus to the expansion of public colleges in the 19th century. The First Morrill Act of 1862 led to the establishment of what became known as land-grant universities (NASULGC 1999). The Second Morrill Act of 1890 expanded the 1862 system of land-grant universities to include black colleges in 17 southern and border states (USDA 2003). After World War II there was further rapid growth of public higher education, particularly at the doctoral level. The majority of doctoral institutions in the first half of the century were privately controlled; in the last half of the century, public institutions were in the majority and by the 1990s represented 54 percent of all doctorategranting institutions. There was a corresponding shift in the share of doctorates awarded by public and private institutions, and this shift occurred in both S&E and non-S&E fields (figures 5-8, 5-9). Among the top 50 institutions of Ph.D.s graduating in 1995-99, 15 were privately controlled, compared with 29 in the early 1920s (appendix table B-13). With the growth in public institutions and their share of degrees at all levels, increasing percentages of Ph.D.s earned both their baccalaureate and their doctorate at public institutions (figure 5-10). The percentage of doctoral degrees awarded by public institutions was similar among men, women, U.S. citizens, and foreign nationals (table 5-9).

Research I institutions were also prominent in the education of foreign students, awarding doctorates to nearly three-fourths of non-U.S.-citizen Ph.D.s, compared with two-thirds of U.S.-citizen Ph.D.s. Of the U.S. racial/ethnic groups, Asians/Pacific Islanders were the most likely to hold doctorates from Research I institutions (76 percent), and blacks (56 percent) and American Indians/Alaskan Natives (54 percent) were the least likely ( figure 5-13)."}, {"section_title": "LEADING DOCTORAL INSTITUTIONS", "text": "Although 426 institutions awarded doctorates in the 20th century, Ph.D.s were highly concentrated in a relatively small number of institutions.

There was no overlap in the top 5 institutions of S&E and of non-S&E Ph.D.s in the overall period from 1920 to 1999. Although the number of S&E doctorates awarded by the top 5 institutions for S&E Ph.D.s in 1920-99 was much larger than the number of non-S&E doctorates awarded by the top 5 institutions for non-S&E Ph.D.s, the cumulative shares of doctorates for these institutions were similar. The top 5 institutions on the S&E list conferred 13 percent of all S&E doctorates in 1920-99, a figure only slightly higher than the 11 percent of non-S&E doctorates awarded by the top 5 institutions on the non-S&E list.

Most doctoral institutions have from their beginnings awarded degrees to men. For example, in 1920-24, 97 percent of the 60 doctorate institutions awarded doctorates to men, whereas 70 percent awarded doctorates to women. With the large increase over the decades in the number of doctorate-granting institutions and the removal of many barriers to the entry of women into doctoral programs, nearly all institutions were awarding doctorates to women by the end of the century. In 1995-99, 394 (about 98 percent) of the 401 doctorategranting institutions of that period awarded doctorates to women, and all of them awarded doctorates to men.

These Ph.D.s were about evenly divided between work and study commitments.   1970-74 1975-79 1980-84 1985-89 1990-94 1995- 1970-74 1975-79 1980-84 1985-89 1990-94 1995-    Because these numbers and percentages represent only those non-U.S. citizens who reported definite plans to stay in the United States after graduation, estimates may be conservative. The restriction to definite plans is necessary when examining long-term trends because until 1990, location was captured in the survey item on postdoctoral affiliation, which was generally completed by only those Ph.D.s with definite plans. Beginning in the 1990s doctorate recipients were asked to report location separately, resulting in more complete data on the intended locations of new Ph.D.s. Data from the 1990s show that a substantial number of non-U.S. citizens who did not report commitments did report intentions to remain in the United States.  1970-74 1975-79 1980-84 1985-89 1990-94 1995-99 1970-74 1975-79 1980-84 1985-89 1990-94 1995-  those in non-S&E fields to undertake such study (figure 6-11).

Further study is most prevalent in biological sciences. Of the biological sciences Ph.D.s graduating in 1995-99 with U.S. postgraduation commitments, 79 percent (13,903) had plans for postdoctoral study, up from 54 percent (6,100) in the 1970-74 period. The proportions of new Ph.D.s undertaking postdoctoral study in the combined field of physics and astronomy and in chemistry were also high, each being about 60 percent in 1995-99. The proportions of U.S. citizens and permanent residents reporting postgraduation study commitments in the United States rose for each racial/ethnic group between 1975-79 and 1995-99. Demographic differences among Ph.D.s with postgraduation study commitments generally reflect the field concentrations of individual groups.

By the early 1970s, however, the academic labor market was becoming saturated with Ph.D. faculty. Moreover, growth in enrollments did not continue at the rates of the 1960s, when the entry of the baby boomers caused enrollments of undergraduate students to increase rapidly. Nearly 67 percent of new Ph.D.s who graduated with work commitments in 1970-74 were hired into academic positions. By the early 1980s, academic job commitments among new Ph.D.s had declined to about 50 percent, and the percentage remained close to this mark to the end of the century (46 percent in 4-year institutions and 4 percent in 2-year institutions in the 1995-99 period). The number of new Ph.D.s with academic positions also fell, from 57,802 in 1970-74 to 38,807 in 1995-99, although the numbers were higher in the 1990s than in the 1980s ( figure 6-19).

A trend away from the academic and government sectors and toward employment commitments in industries and businesses (including selfemployment) and \"other\" sectors (elementary and secondary schools, nonprofit organizations) characterized all demographic groups ( figure 6-20). In 1995-99 female Ph.D.s (57 percent) were still more likely than male Ph.D.s (44 percent) to go into academe, but the level of academic commitments was about 21 percentage points lower for both groups than it was in 1970-74. The relatively small differences in the proportions of academic appointments among the three citizenship groups in the early 1970s had widened by the late 1990s. In the period 1970-74 about two-thirds of U.S. citizens were hired into academe, with hires of temporary residents and permanent residents trailing by only 2 and 6 percentage points, respectively. In 1995-99 a slim majority of U.S.-citizen Ph.D.s obtained academic appointments, compared with about two-fifths of permanent residents and about one-third of temporary residents. The size of the disparity between U.S. citizens and foreign nationals is fairly recent. Academic commitment levels for the three citizenship groups remained relatively close-above 50 percent-into the mid-1990s. In fact, in the three 5year periods from 1980 to 1994, the percentages of temporary residents going into academe were larger than those of other citizenship groups of new Ph.D.s. work commitments in these other fields ranged from 14 percent (social sciences) to 45 percent (the combined field of mathematics and computer sciences). The mid-1990s brought a surge of industrial employment among both permanent and temporary residents. This sudden change may reflect the concentrations of non-U.S.-citizen Ph.D.s in engineering and computer sciences, fields that were particularly linked to the very large number of new technology jobs that were created during the 1990s. Although U.S.-citizen Ph.D.s were increasingly drawn into industry (including selfemployment), job commitments in this sector were proportionally higher among non-U.S. citizens. In 1995-99 the share of postgraduation work commitments to industry was 50 percent among permanent residents and 60 percent among temporary residents, compared with 21 percent among U.S. citizens. Decreasing academic employment and increasing employment in other sectors appeared as a pattern also among racial/ethnic groups of U.S. citizens and permanent residents (figure 6-21). The distribution across employment sectors for racial/ethnic groups reflects the different field concentrations of these groups. In both the 1970-74 and 1995-99 periods, S&E Ph.D.s were more likely than non-S&E Ph.D.s to obtain jobs in industry (table 6-3).

Consistent data on field specialties became available in 1958, when the first Survey of Earned Doctorates was administered. The earlier data were obtained from public sources, such as commencement programs, so the fields tend to be broader. Fields in table A-1 are grouped according to the classification scheme used by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in its reports. Science and engineering, as defined by NSF, includes the following major fields: agricultural sciences; biological sciences; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; mathematics and com-puter sciences; physical sciences (astronomy, chemistry, physics, and miscellaneous related fields); psychology; social sciences; and engineering. The major fields in non-science and engineering, as defined by NSF, are education, health sciences, humanities, and professional fields/other. Other agencies and organizations often classify the fields differently. The most prominent difference between the NSF scheme and the schemes used by others is the treatment of health fields. These fields, considered to be non-S&E by NSF, are commonly grouped by other agencies with biological and agricultural sciences under the \"life sciences\" rubric, or with biological sciences under the \"biomedical sciences\" rubric.   1920-99 1960-99 1960-64 1965-69 1970-74 1975-79 1980-84 1985-89 1990-94 1995 Science and engineering  835,221 740,221 38,267  66,183  94,862  90,804  91,690

terms used in this report and explanatory information on the treatment of certain variables. For convenience, the Doctorate Records File is referred to as the DRF throughout the section, and the Survey of Earned Doctorates is referred to as the SED. The degree information in the DRF reflects the first degree earned by the individual at each level, as applicable: first baccalaureate, first master's degree, first professional doctorate, and first research doctorate. Survey forms for any subsequent research doctorates are retained but are not entered into the DRF. Doctorate recipients report their immediate postgraduation plans for employment or additional study. This report focuses on Ph.D.s who reported definite plans at the time they completed the SED, which is usually shortly before graduation. Ph.D.s with definite plans include those who reported they had signed a contract or had otherwise made a commitment for a new position as well as those who reported they were returning to or continuing in a position held before graduation. Most analyses in this report are further restricted to commitments in the United States. Age. The age of a doctorate recipient at graduation. In this report the standard practice is to use the median to report the age of doctorate recipients. Half of the Ph.D.s are older than the median age, and half are younger. The year of birth is required for this computation. The month of birth is used when available. Carnegie Classification. A system of classification of postsecondary institutions established by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Carnegie classifications are based on highest degree conferred, fields in which degrees are conferred, number of programs, enrollment, research support, and selectivity of admissions criteria. The classifications are updated periodically by the Carnegie Foundation to reflect changes in the characteristics of institutions. This report used the 1994 Carnegie update to describe the institutions that awarded doctorates in the 1990s. The Carnegie categories are as follows: Research I and II, Doctoral I and II, Master's I and II, Baccalaureate I and II, Associate of Arts (not applicable to this report), Religion and Theology, Medical, Other Health, Engineering, Business, Fine Arts, Law, Teachers College, Other Specialized (e.g., maritime academy, military institute), and Tribal College (not applicable to this report). A majority of the doctorate-granting institutions are classified as Research (126) or Doctoral (109) institutions, and they account for the vast majority of doctorates awarded in the United States. In 1990-99, Research I institutions conferred 68.3 percent of all doctorates; Research II institutions, 11.5 percent; Doctoral I institutions, 10.6 percent; and Doctoral II institutions, 4.4 percent. Although a substantial number of doctorate-granting institutions fall into the \"other\" Carnegie categories, together they awarded 5.3 percent of all doctorates in the 1990s; these institutions were aggregated and presented as the \"other\" Carnegie group in this report. Citizenship status. Most citizenship data are presented as reported by the doctorate recipients or as provided by the institutions that granted the doctorates. The following logical assumptions were made in certain situations: \u2022 Ph.D.s who graduated in 1920-57 were assumed to be U.S. citizens if their baccalaureate institution was not foreign. This procedure was also used to impute citizenship status in this report's predecessor, A Century of Doctorates: Data Analyses of Growth and Change (NAS/NRC 1978). \u2022 All Puerto Ricans were counted as U.S. citizens, as they legally hold U.S. citizenship. \u2022 American Indians/Alaskan Natives who did not report their citizenship status were assumed to be U.S. citizens. Over the years, only a handful of American Indian Ph.D.s have reported themselves as citizens of Canada, Central America, or South America. \u2022 Temporary visa status was assumed if citizenship status was missing but a foreign country of citizenship was reported. Debt status and level. Included is debt that is directly related to the doctorate recipient's undergraduate and graduate education and is still owed at graduation. Education-related expenses include tuition and fees, APPENDIX C. TECHNICAL NOTES living expenses and supplies, and transportation to and from school. Doctorate-granting institution. Any postsecondary institution in the United States that awards research doctorates (as defined below) and is accredited by an agency recognized by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education is a doctorate-granting institution. Currently there are about 400 doctorate-granting institutions. The number can fluctuate from year to year for various reasons: (1) additional institutions become doctorate-granting, (2) some institutions with small programs do not award doctorates every year, and (3) a few institutions eliminate their doctoral programs altogether. The institutions that awarded doctorates before 1920 (the first year of data in the DRF) were determined from annual reports of the U.S. Office of Education (USEO 1869(USEO -1916. The 1909 report, which provided summary data on earlier years, was used to definitively identify doctorate-granting institutions for the years up to 1909. The 1909 report excluded some institutions that had been included in earlier reports, presumably to correct for invalid information in prior years. Because some of the reported institutions had awarded very few doctorates and had done so sporadically, the list of pre-1920 awarding institutions was declared final only after a comparison with the early 1920s data in the DRF. Institutions that awarded doctorates in 1900-19 (according to Office of Education reports) and also in 1920-24 (according to the DRF) make up the pre-1920 list of doctorate-granting institutions. This group of institutions is discussed in chapter 5. Employment commitment. Definite plans for any kind of employment other than a postdoctoral appointment for study or training are considered employment commitments. Military service counts as employment."}, {"section_title": "Field of doctorate.", "text": "Field is the specialty field of doctoral degree as reported by the doctorate recipient or obtained from the institution's commencement program or graduation list. There are about 280 fields on the SED Specialties List grouped under the following headings: agricultural sciences, biological sciences, computer and information sciences, education, engineering, health sciences, humanities (subdivided into history, letters, foreign languages and literature, and other humanities), mathematics, physical sciences (subdivided into astronomy, atmospheric science and meteorology, chemistry, geological and related sciences, physics, and miscellaneous physical sciences), professional fields (subdivided into business management and administrative services, communications, and other professional fields), psychology, and social sciences. The same list is used for reporting baccalaureate and master's degree fields as well as postdoctoral study and employment fields. The SED survey form and Specialties List can be found in appendix D of the annual Doctorate Recipients from United States Universities: Summary Report (NORC 1998, which is available at http:// www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/docdata.htm. This report categorizes the fields as science and engineering (S&E) or non-science and engineering (non-S&E) according to the scheme that NSF uses in its publications. Other agencies may classify the fields differently. The major difference between NSF's classification and those of other agencies is the exclusion of health fields from the S&E rubric; NSF places health fields within the non-S&E group, along with education, humanities, and professional fields. Other agencies include health fields with biological and agricultural sciences under the heading \"life sciences\" or with biological sciences alone under the heading \"biomedical sciences.\" the institution and if the recipient could not be assumed with great certainty to be male or female based on his or her name. There are 1,886 Ph.D.s of undetermined sex in the DRF, all but two of them graduates in the 1990s. These individuals are excluded from all percentages based on recipients' sex shown in this report. The restriction on definite plans is necessary when examining long-term trends because, up to 1990, location was captured as part of \"postdoctoral affiliation,\" which was generally completed by only those Ph.D.s with definite plans. In the 1990s the SED asked for location separately, resulting in more complete data on the intended locations of new Ph.D.s, whether or not they had commitments at graduation. The data from the 1990s show that a substantial number of non-U.S. citizens did not report commitments but did report intentions or aspirations to remain in the United States. Although there is no way to determine how many actually stayed on after graduation, it is fair to assume that a goodly number did. Table C-1 compares the 1995-99 aggregate data for non-U.S. citizens who reported definite postgraduation plans to stay in the United States (the population analyzed in chapter 6 and shown in table 6-2 and figures 6-8 and 6-9) with the corresponding data for all non-U.S. citizens who reported location, including those who did not have commitments at the time they completed the SED. Study commitment. Definite plans involving a postdoctoral fellowship, research associateship, traineeship, or any other postdoctoral study or training supported by an organization or the doctorate recipient are considered study commitments. Time to doctorate. This report includes three different measures of time to receipt of the doctorate, which are reported as medians. Half of all Ph.D.s take more time than the median to complete their doctorate, and half take less. \u2022 Total time to doctorate (TTD) measures the total elapsed calendar time between receipt of the baccalaureate and receipt of the doctorate, including time not enrolled in school. TTD can be computed only if the baccalaureate year is known. Months are included in the calculation when available. \u2022 Registered time to doctorate (RTD) measures the time in attendance at all colleges and universities between receipt of the baccalaureate and receipt of the doctorate, including enrollment not related to the doctoral program. RTD can be computed only if the doctorate recipient provides all years of attendance after receipt of the baccalaureate. \u2022 Postbaccalaureate time to doctorate (PTD) measures the total elapsed calendar time between the first postbaccalaureate attendance at the  institution that awarded the doctorate and receipt of the doctorate. PTD includes time spent in a master's degree program if these studies were at the same institution that granted the doctorate. Year of doctorate. The SED collects data for the academic year, which begins on 1 July of one calendar year and ends on 30 June of the next year. Academic years are identified in reports by the calendar year in which they end. For example, data reported as 1999 include all graduations from 1 July 1998 through 30 June 1999. Graduations that took place in the last six months of calendar year 1999 were part of the 2000 SED and are not included in this report. The data for graduations from 1920 through 1957 were obtained from public sources, such as commencement programs, and were recorded in the DRF by calendar year. Because the second half of calendar year 1957 is part of the 1958 SED, an adjustment is required to make both years represent a full 12 months in tabulations. The standard procedure is to double-count the number of doctorates awarded in the last half of calendar year 1957. This six-month period was counted once in calendar year 1957 and once in academic year 1958 (the SED data collection period) for this report, but only for trends showing the 1950s as one or more data points. The total number of doctorates awarded in 1900-99 or 1920-99 reflects the actual number of doctorates awarded in those years, that is, with no double-counting of the number of doctorates awarded in the last six months of calendar year 1957."}, {"section_title": "U.S. OFFICE OF EDUCATION REPORTS", "text": "Data on the number of doctorates awarded from 1900 to 1919, in total and by sex, were obtained from 120 Years of American Education: A Statistical Portrait (USED/ NCES 1993). These data came originally from a series of annual reports published by the U.S. Office of Education (USEO 1869(USEO -1916  Chapter 5 examines the role of institutions that awarded doctorates before 1920. The pre-1920 group of institutions was determined from the Office of Education reports. The 1909 report presented summary data for the years 1878-1909, excluding some institutions that had appeared in earlier reports. The assumption is that it was correcting for invalid data published previously. The 1909 report was used as the definitive source of doctorategranting institutions up to 1909."}, {"section_title": "DOCTORATE RECORDS FILE AND SURVEY OF EARNED DOCTORATES", "text": "The Doctorate Records File (DRF) is a virtually complete data bank on more than 1.35 million doctorate recipients. For the years 1920-57, public sources, such as commencement programs and institution lists, provided limited information, mainly baccalaureate institution and year; doctoral institution, field, and year; and sex of recipient (which, if not obtained from the institution, was coded based on the recipient's name). are slightly higher than those in the SED. Differences can be attributed largely to the inclusion of nonresearch doctorates, primarily in the fields of theology and education, in the Completions Survey. The differences between the two surveys were fairly consistent from 1960 to 1999, with ratios of IPEDS-to-SED counts ranging from 1.01 to 1.06. Because a respondent to the SED may not classify his or her specialty exactly as reported by the institution in the Completions Survey, the difference in the number of doctorates for a given field reported by the two surveys may be greater than the difference for all fields combined. The SED covers about 50 kinds of research doctorates. Most recipients earn the Ph.D. degree (85-89 percent annually since 1973, when kind of degree was first tracked). The Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) is the second most common degree, received by 7-11 percent of doctorate recipients each year from 1973 to 1999. Professional doctorates, including those in medicine, law, dentistry, veterinary medicine, osteopathy, and psychology, are not covered in the SED. The kind of professional doctorate and year of receipt, however, are captured for recipients of research doctorates who earned professional doctorates either before the research doctorate or concurrently. Because the DRF is a census of individuals rather than degrees, only the first doctorate is entered into the database. Every year, the names and social security numbers of new doctorate recipients are compared with the same information on all earlier DRF records to ensure that there are no duplications in the database. Any records of second (or third) doctorates earned by a recipient are removed from the DRF, but hard copies of the survey forms for additional doctorates are retained. Data on predoctoral degrees of doctorate recipients also reflect the first degree at each level. The SED cycle includes all graduations during the academic year (1 July to 30 June) and is identified by the year in which the cycle ends. Thus the 1999 SED collected data from doctorate recipients who graduated between 1 July 1998 and 30 June 1999. The graduate schools distribute the SED forms to students, who then complete the surveys and return them to the SED coordinator at their institution for transmittal to the survey contractor. Since 1997 the National Opinion Research Center of the University of Chicago has administered the SED for the sponsoring federal agencies. The National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences administered the SED from its inception, in 1958, through the 1996 cycle. Doctorate recipients provide information about their demographic characteristics, educational history from high school to doctorate, sources of financial support in graduate school (or in the doctoral program), debt status at graduation, and immediate postgraduation plans. Thanks to the cooperation of the graduate schools and the extremely high participation rates of doctoral graduates, the DRF is the richest source of doctoral data in the nation. Government agencies, academic institutions, and industry use the SED results to address a wide range of policy, education, and human resource issues. The authors of this report have strived to showcase the wealth of available data by presenting long-term trends when possible, and recent data when not, for nearly every variable in the DRF. More than 500 tables were generated, reviewed, and analyzed for this project, and data from many are displayed in figures and tables within the report. As a supplement to the printed volume, detailed trend tables showing doctoral awards by field of doctorate and by state and institution, baccalaureate institutions of Ph.D.s, and country of citizenship of non-U.S. citizen doctorate recipients, by visa status, are available on the NSF website at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06319/."}, {"section_title": "Response Rates", "text": "The SED has enjoyed excellent response rates throughout its more than 40-year history. Both unit and item response rates have been very high and relatively stable since the first survey, in 1958. Basic information on nonrespondents can be obtained from institutions or commencement programs, so records exist for all doctorate recipients. However, response to the SED is measured by the percentage of doctorate recipients who complete the surveys themselves (selfreport rate), thereby providing details that are not available from any other source. The SED's goal is a stable self-report rate of 94-95 percent. This rate was achieved or surpassed in all but 9 of the 42 surveys processed between 1958 and 1999. The self-report rate dropped below target for the first time in 1986 and stayed below target through 1990. The 1991-95 surveys achieved the target level, but the self-report rate declined again in 1996-99. A little less than 92 percent of all doctorate recipients completed the survey in the last three surveys of the century, 1997-99. Because records are constructed from public information for Ph.D.s who do not complete the SED questionnaire, certain items are available for all doctorate recipients: name, doctoral institution, field of doctorate, month and year of graduation, and kind of doctorate. The institution provides this information in its commencement program or graduation list. A 95 percent item-response-rate target is set for eight critical items: date of birth, sex, citizenship, country of citizenship (for non-U.S. citizens), race/ethnicity, baccalaureate institution, baccalaureate year, and postdoctoral location. If missing, these items are followed up through letters to self-reporting respondents or, for Ph.D.s who did not complete questionnaires, through requests to institutions. The response rates for these items often exceed the overall self-report rate for the survey because of institutional responses and information on baccalaureate degrees available from commencement programs. Rigorous follow-up on critical items has been conducted since 1990. Follow-up requests for race/ethnicity, postdoctoral location, and country of citizenship (if foreign) were made for the first time in the 1990 SED, increasing the completeness of these items from that time forward. From 1990 to 1996, all critical items except postdoctoral location surpassed the 95 percent target. Response for every critical item except sex and foreign country of citizenship fell below target during subsequent years with transfer of the administration of the SED to a new contractor. The target item response rate for all noncritical survey items is 90 percent. During much of the 1990s, most noncritical items either met or were within 2 percentage points of the target response rate. Fewer items attained a 90 percent response rate during the contractor transition period. Five noncritical items, if missing, are added to the follow-up requests for Ph.D.s missing critical items: birthplace, high school graduation year, high school location, master's degree institution, and year of master's degree. Throughout the SED's history, a few items have had, and will continue to have, lower response rates because they are not applicable to all individuals (e.g., master's degree information), or because they seem complex or confusing to some doctorate recipients (e.g., timelines from college entrance to doctoral graduation, sources of support). Some items with below-target response rates in the first half of the 1990s surpassed the target in 1996, when the questionnaire was reformatted to be more respondentfriendly. Two items are particularly relevant to this report: (1) primary source of support, in which the 1996 response rate was 13.0 percentage points higher than in the previous survey, and (2) primary work activity after graduation, in which the response rate rose 6.5 percentage points. Moreover, response to these items held steady or increased during the transfer of the SED to a new contractor, despite a decrease in the overall self-report rate for the SED and decreases in response rates for many other items. Although both unit and item response rates in the SED have been relatively stable through the years, fluctuations can affect data comparability. This is especially true for the items on citizenship and race/ethnicity, for which very small fluctuations in response may result in increases or decreases in counts that do not reflect actual trends. The percentages shown in the figures and tables in this report are based only on the number of doctorate recipients who responded to the applicable survey items (including some logical assumptions based on other items, as explained in the section \"Definitions and Explanations\") or for whom information was obtained from a public source. The overall response rate for any crosstabulation of data is no greater than the lowest response rate for the items involved in the tabulation. Table C-2 shows the nonresponse rates for the items analyzed in this report and displayed in figures and tables. For items covering a long time span, the overall nonresponse rate for the entire period is given, even though the data may be displayed annually or in 5-year periods in figures and tables. For items that are analyzed for only two or three select time periods, the nonresponse rate for each period is given."}]
