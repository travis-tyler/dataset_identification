[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: Across Eastern Africa, croplands cover 45 million ha. The regional economy is heavily dependent on small holder traditional rain-fed peasant agriculture (up to 90%), which is vulnerable to extreme weather events such as drought and floods that leads to food insecurity. Agricultural production in the region is moisture limited. Weather station data are scarce and access is limited, while optical satellite data are obscured by heavy clouds limiting their value to study cropland dynamics. Here, we characterized cropland dynamics in Eastern Africa for 2003-2015 using precipitation data from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and a passive microwave dataset of land surface variables that blends data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) from 2002 to 2011 with data from AMSR2 from 2012 to 2015 with a Chinese microwave radiometer to fill the gap. These time series were analyzed in terms of either cumulative precipitable water vapor-days (CVDs) or cumulative actual evapotranspiration-days (CETaDs), rather than as days of the year. Time series of the land surface variables displayed unimodal seasonality at study sites in Ethiopia and South Sudan, in contrast to bimodality at sites in Tanzania. Interannual moisture variability was at its highest at the beginning of the growing season affecting planting times of crops, while it was lowest at the time of peak moisture. Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from the simple surface energy balance (SSEB) model was sensitive to track both unimodal and bimodal rainfall patterns. ETa as a function of CETaD was better fitted by a quadratic model (r 2 > 0.8) than precipitable water vapor was by CVDs (r 2 > 0.6). Moisture time to peak (MTP) for the land surface variables showed strong, logical correspondence among variables (r 2 > 0.73). Land surface parameters responded to El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole forcings. Area under the curve of the diel difference in vegetation optical depth showed correspondence to crop production and yield data collected by local offices, but not to the data reported at the national scale. A long-term seasonal Mann-Kendall rainfall trend showed a significant decrease for Ethiopia, while the decrement was not significant for Tanzania. While there is significant potential for passive microwave data to augment cropland status and food security monitoring efforts in the region, more research is needed before these data can be used in an operational environment."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Across Eastern Africa, croplands cover 45 million ha [1] . Ethiopia (ET) and Tanzania (TZ) are the two major crop producing countries in the region, accounting for 14 million ha and 13 million ha of available for plant growth is dependent on atmospheric conditions and seasonality [30] . These factors (and others), in addition to moisture, contribute to the long history of food insecurity in Eastern Africa.\nTo address issues of food insecurity, we need a comprehensive understanding of cropland dynamics for major commodity crops. Cropland dynamics includes the land use and land cover change in cropland regions as observed at coarser spatial resolutions that cannot resolve crop type due to spatial heterogeneity and spectral mixing. Land surface phenology (LSP) plays an important role in monitoring cropland dynamics. LSP deals with the timing of vegetated land surface dynamics as observed by satellite remote sensors, particularly at spatial resolutions and extents relevant to meteorological processes in the atmospheric boundary layer [31, 32] . Phenological studies integrate climate-biosphere relationships as the timing of vegetation lifecycle events is influenced by temperature and precipitation [33] [34] [35] [36] . Remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [37] have been widely utilized for agricultural mapping and monitoring [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . The Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET), which is funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), uses NDVI-based measures of cropland activity as part of its integrated early warning system for food security and drought monitoring in food-insecure regions of the world, such as Eastern Africa, Western Africa, Southern Africa, Central America and the Caribbean, and Central Asia [43] . FAO's Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) uses NDVI data to detect vegetation health as a proxy for crop production [44] . Land surface dynamics in tropical Eastern Africa are less well characterized than those in the major crop growing regions of developed nations. We used our previous experience of using passive microwave data to track temperate cropland dynamics in the spring wheat belts of the Northern Hemisphere [45] [46] [47] as reference areas to contrast with the cropland dynamics of tropical Eastern Africa.\nMany studies have used vegetation indices (VIs) derived from visible and near infrared (VNIR) sensors to study LSP in terms of days of the year [48] [49] [50] , but far fewer using thermal time [31, [45] [46] [47] 51, 52] . However, tropical croplands generally do not have temperature constraints; rather, they are strongly dependent on rainfall and moisture for crop growth and development. Therefore, to characterize LSP and land surface seasonality (LSS) in the region, we have used moisture time measured as cumulative water vapor-days (CVDs) based on a spatially continuous variable-atmospheric precipitable water vapor-that is available from passive microwave data.\nIn addition, the skies over Eastern Africa are obscured by heavy seasonal clouds and dust contamination, reducing insolation, and surface air temperature as well as limiting intensive observation of the vegetated land surface by VNIR sensors. To characterize cropland dynamics in Eastern Africa, specifically in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and the newer nation of South Sudan, we used a blended dataset of enhanced land surface variables produced from the passive microwave radiometers AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS) and AMSR2 (hereafter simply AMSR) [53] , rainfall data from TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission), and ETa (actual evapotranspiration) data estimated from the simple surface energy balance model (SSEB) [54, 55] ."}, {"section_title": "Study Region, Data and Methodology", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Region", "text": "Across Eastern Africa, croplands cover 45 million ha. Our study focuses on croplands in the two major crop producing countries in the region, Ethiopia (ET) and Tanzania (TZ), and South Sudan (SS). Ethiopia and Tanzania contain 14 million ha and 13 million ha of croplands, respectively. South Sudan, however, remains a bit of a mystery; it is still too new and torn by civil strife to appear in the FAO agricultural databases.\nSpecific AMSR pixels were selected in these countries in a two-step process. We first developed cropland cover stability map in Eastern Africa for cropland class (12) from the International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) land cover scheme using the MODIS fractional land cover layer in MCD12C1 for [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] [2009] [2010] [2011] [2012] .

The MODIS land cover product, which has a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees, could not resolve finely fragmented croplands in the study region. Thus, while we used the MODIS data as general guidance, we used the finer resolution imagery available in Google Earth Image to select and check visually our study sites.

Note that these land cover classes constitute nearly all of the land cover in the study area.

The tree cover and bare ground were raster layers with proportion of these covers per pixel (1-100%) in 2010, while the water layer was a thematic layer where the ground was persistently water from 2000 to 2012. The tree cover and bare ground that were within the AMSR study pixels were averaged separately. Proportion of waterbodies within the AMSR pixel were also calculated. Thus, a given AMSR pixel can have proportional tree cover, bare ground, water, and residual land cover. Any residual percentage of land cover could be cropland, shrubland, grassland, and other land cover class. Note that croplands can appear as bare ground much of the year. Moreover, since we purposely selected AMSR pixels dominated by croplands as evident in Google Earth imagery, the residual land cover should be mainly cropland, but there could also be a mixture of grassland and shrubland. Among our study pixels, there are two sites (92 and 98) that have a considerable proportion of waterbody-25% and 30%, respectively (Figure 2b ). These sites are located near Lake Tana, the largest lake in Ethiopia. There are some other sites with up to 30% of tree cover and bare ground combined."}, {"section_title": "Data", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Remote Sensing Data", "text": "We have primarily used variables retrieved from the passive microwave data of AMSR-E and AMSR2. The AMSR-E was launched onboard the NASA-EOS Aqua satellite in May 2002 and operated successfully for more than 9 years before it stopped properly functioning in October 2011, due to failure of the rotating antenna's spin mechanism. Since May 2012, its measurement legacy has been continued by AMSR2, which is the improved version of AMSR-E with similar functionality. AMSR2 is onboard the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission 1st-Water (GCOM-W1) \"SHIZUKU\" satellite. We used the blended AMSR-E/AMSR2 dataset developed by the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) at the University of Montana [53] . The NTSG filled the gap between the AMSR-E and AMSR2 sensors using brightness temperature observations from the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) onboard the Chinese FengYun 3B (FY3B) satellite that was launched in November 2010 [53] . The AMSRs record observations twice daily (daytime~1330 and nighttime~0130). The gridded data products have a spatial resolution of 25 km. The NTSG-blended AMSR dataset includes up to two observations per day from June 2002 to December 2015 of surface air temperatures (ta;~2 m height), fractional open water inundation (fw), vegetation canopy transmittance (tc) at 10.65 GHz, volumetric soil moisture (vsm; \u22642 cm soil depth), and atmosphere precipitable water vapor (V) for the total column [53, 58] . The data set will continue to be extended as long as AMSR2 continues to produce data (J.S. Kimball, personal communication). These products are critical in regions where meteorological stations are sparse and high quality rainfall measurements are missing or unavailable [59, 60] , such as Eastern Africa. The finer temporal resolution of passive microwave datasets is also another significant advantage to monitor cropland dynamics, given the rapid pace of plant growth and development. The major drawback of passive microwave datasets is their coarse spatial resolution (25 km) relative to the region's characteristic small farm field sizes and fragmented croplands. [61] .

Land cover % values are labeled on the respective bars.\nThe second dataset used in this study is rainfall data from TRMM, which combines active and passive microwave sensors. A joint US-Japan space mission, TRMM was launched in November 1997 to monitor and study tropical rainfall (50 \u2022 N-50 \u2022 S latitude), and officially ended in April 2015. Its measurement legacy has been continued by the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission launched on February 2014. The TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) version 7 (TRMM 3B42 (V7)) is a rainfall dataset developed by NASA that provides TRMM-adjusted gridded rainfall rate (mm/h) estimates from multiple satellites at 3-hourly temporal and 0.25-degree spatial resolution [62] . We used the daily accumulated rainfall product that is derived from the 3-hourly product (TRMM 3B42 (V7)-daily) [63] . We also used the NOAA Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) long-term monthly rainfall data [64] for the regional rainfall trend analysis.\nWe used actual evapotranspiration (ETa) data estimated from the simple surface energy balance model (SSEB) [54, 55] . These data have a 1 km spatial resolution and a 10-day (dekadal) temporal resolution. The data used as input to the SSEB model include the MODIS 8-day Land Surface Temperature product at 1-km resolution (MOD11A2); the MODIS 16-day NDVI product at 250-m resolution (MOD13Q1), and the global 1-degree reference evapotranspiration (ET 0 ) based on NOAA's 6-hourly Global Data Assimilation Systems (GDAS) model output.\nWe used the monthly time series of the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST.v2) Ni\u00f1o3 index from NOAA National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center [65] to identify El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a events during our study period. To identify positive and negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) phenomena, we used the Dipole Mode Index (DMI) time series from Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), which is based on the Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) dataset [66] ."}, {"section_title": "Crop Production Data", "text": "We gathered crop production and yield data for the Amhara Region of Ethiopia at two administrative levels: woredas (smaller) and zones (larger).

The woreda level data were collected by the Amhara National Regional State Bureau of Agriculture (ANRS BoA) for 2014.

These zones include South Wollo, East Gojjam, North Wollo, South Gondar, North Shewa, West Shewa, and Arsi. The reports are for \"private peasant holdings\" by season of production, organized at three levels (national, regional, and zonal levels), and each level includes crop area, crop production, and yield by crop type. More than 85% of Ethiopian population is a rural resident dependent mainly on small holder subsistence agriculture. Commercial farms in Ethiopia are few and are limited to the remote peripheral lowlands of the country.

We applied an 8-day retrospective moving average filter to the daytime and nighttime AMSR data separately, to minimize data gaps due to orbit and swath width. We then averaged the daytime and nighttime values for all variables except surface air temperature (ta) to obtain one value per 24 h. The ta time series were processed into growing degree-days (GDDs), the daily thermal-time increment above a certain threshold (base temperature) for plant growth [31, 71, 72] . GDDs were calculated from the AMSR air temperature (ta) data with a base temperature of 0 \u2022 C (=273.15 K) as follows:\nwhere t ASC and t DES are ascending and descending pass temperatures, which corresponds roughly to the maximum and minimum daily temperatures. We have previously modeled the seasonal course of NDVI in temperate croplands as a quadratic function of accumulated growing degree-days [45] [46] [47] . However, for the moisture-limited croplands of Tropical Eastern Africa, this approach is not appropriate since temperature is not the key limiting factor in the timing and progress of crop growth.\nTo illustrate the differential seasonality of croplands, Figure 3 displays GDDs and precipitable water vapor (V) at two cropland sites, one in Zegie, Ethiopia, and the other in Saratov, Russia, and reveals the quasi-periodic behavior of GDD versus V in both croplands. At the tropical site, a larger dynamic range of V and smaller dynamic range of GDD within the year is evident compared to the temperate site ( Figure 3 ). This pattern reflects that moisture is the key limiting factor in the tropical croplands, and temperature is limiting in the temperate croplands.

Brown & de Beurs [27] successfully applied a quadratic model in Western Africa croplands to characterize cropland NDVI as a function of accumulated relative humidity. Rainfall in Eastern Africa is erratic and sporadic. From a daily TRMM rainfall data, we calculated 8-day retrospective cumulative rainfall for our study. In contrast, precipitable water vapor (V) is a continuous spatiotemporal field. Thus, we analyzed the time series of biophysical and climatic variables as a function of precipitable water vapor. Cumulative water vapor days (CVDs) are the simple summation of AMSR V throughout the whole year. That is, the passage of days is weighted by the quantity of V occurring that day:\nwhere Vt is daily precipitable water vapor at time t. The concept is analogous to the use of accumulated growing degree-day (AGDD) to study cropland dynamics in the temperature-limited temperate croplands.

The concept is analogous to the use of accumulated growing degree-day (AGDD) to study cropland dynamics in the temperature-limited temperate croplands. Vegetation optical depth (VOD) was calculated as the negative logarithm of vegetation transmittance (tc) at 10.65 GHz: VOD = \u2212log e (tc) = \u2212ln(tc).\nThe actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimates were a retrospective summation for every 10 days (dekad). To match the time scale, we produced comparable AMSR and TRMM dekadal datasets by summing the daily data. We compare the ETa data with the AMSR and TRMM datasets. We have cumulative annual ETa and V data (designated as CETaDd [Cumulative ETa Dekad] and CVDd [Cumulative V Dekad]) to characterize all our study variables as a function of CETaDd and CVDd:\nCETaDd t = CETaDd t\u22121 + ETa t (4)\nwhere ETa is dekadal actual evapotranspiration, and V t is dekadal atmospheric precipitable water vapor at time t.\nTo characterize the seasonal progression of moisture, we fitted the ETa from SSEB model product and V from AMSR as a quadratic functions of CETaDd and CVDd, respectively:\nwhere the intercept \u03b1 is the start of observation period ETa/V value, the linear parameter \u03b2 affects the slope, and the quadratic parameter \u03b3 controls the curvature. Our model is an arched quadratic in shape; thus, the sign of the \u03b2 coefficient is positive, while the sign of the \u03b3 coefficient is negative.\nAt sites with two rainfall seasons, the ETa and V time series display bimodal patterns. At these sites, we fitted two separate quadratic models, one for each rainfall season. From the observed data, the breakpoints for these two rainfall seasons were more or less similar in time and space, but different between the northern and southern hemispheres. Therefore, for the quadratic model fit, we divided the observations into two growing season phases. The first phase for Ethiopia and South Sudan ran from DOY 001-201 (1 January-20 July) and the second phase ran from DOY 202-365 (21 July-31 December). In Tanzania, the phases ran from DOY 182-052 (1 July-21 February) and DOY 053-181 (22 February-30 June).\nWe modeled characteristics of each biophysical and climatic variable in terms of cumulative moisture time. We determined peak height (PH) of each variable using the seasonal maxima, and the corresponding moisture time to peak (MTP) was measured in CVDs. We also calculated the PH lag time between biophysical and climatic variables.\nFor the ENSO analysis, we standardized the Ni\u00f1o3 index data using a 30-year (1986-2015) climatology to obtain the mean and standard deviation [19, 73] . We then filtered the standardized data using a 5-month retrospective moving average [19] (Figure 11 ). If the index value exceeded \u00b11 for at least two consecutive months in the rainy season, that year was labeled as El Ni\u00f1o for positive deviations or La Ni\u00f1a for negative deviations [19] . A similar approach was applied to the DMI time series with the positive (or negative) IOD mode indicated by the DMI remaining above 1 (or below \u22121) for at least two consecutive months in the rainy season [19] . Any given year may experience a positive (El Ni\u00f1o) or negative (La Ni\u00f1a) or neutral ENSO mode and a positive or negative or neutral IOD mode. Therefore, there are nine possible combinations of these events in a given year (Table 1) . We examined crop production and yield data for the Amhara Region of Ethiopia at two administrative levels: woredas (smaller) and zones (larger). Some zones were also included from the Oromia Region, Ethiopia. We used the assumption that crop biomass and crop evapotranspiration are linked to crop production to link cropland LSP to crop production and yield statistical data in the region. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) for the growing season VOD as a proxy for crop biomass and the AUC for the growing season VOD diel difference (VODdd) as a proxy for crop evapotranspiration: VODdd = VOD DSC \u2212 VOD ASC , where VOD DSC and VOD ASC are the descending and ascending VOD, respectively. We calculated separate AUCs for the VODs derived from the ascending and descending orbits, in addition to the average VOD. We assessed the relationship between the growing season maximum VOD and the crop production data, since growing season maximum NDVI has corresponded with crop production data in past research [74] . Actual evapotranspiration data from the simplified surface energy balance (SSEB) model was used to link it with crop production and yield data. One way to determine the AUC cut-points (the points to start and end the integration) was using the variation of volumetric soil moisture (vsm). The vsm starts to rise continuously as the main rainfall season began, and then starts to drop as moisture was drawn down by growing crops. The moisture started to rise again as the crops dried out ( Figure 4 ). The AUC was integrated between these soil moisture cut points, and the crop production and yield data were linked to the AUCs using simple linear regression.\nRemote Sens. 2017, 9, 914 10 of 30\nWe examined crop production and yield data for the Amhara Region of Ethiopia at two administrative levels: woredas (smaller) and zones (larger).

Even though crop production statistical data lower level of aggregation and AMSR data spatial resolution were comparable in size, they may not necessarily overlap each other. Therefore, before trying to link crop production and the derived LSP and LSS metrics (AUC, maximum VOD, and rainfall), we normalized these variables by area.

Even though the effect of El Ni\u00f1o and positive IOD may have been expected to cancel each other out [15, 25] , the severe drought of 2015 might be due to the three months of the El Ni\u00f1o event occurring before the positive IOD mode (in 2015 NINO3 > 1 occurred three months earlier than DMI > 1; Figure 16 ).

[90] found that there is evidence of VOD signal saturation at higher biomass levels, but less is known about the diel difference of the VOD.\nThe Zone level CSA (Central Statistical Agency) crop production statistical data substantial increment in the highland agricultural areas of the Amhara and Oromia Regions for 2003-2010 was not supported by the VODdd AUC data ( Figure 13 ). In some parts of Ethiopia 2010 was a flood year; however, the increment of the VODdd AUC in 2010 may have arisen the more even distribution of rainfall throughout the rainy season that, in turn, may have supported good crop growth and production. Consistently lower values for crop production, cultivated area, and VODdd AUC time series in the North Wollo Zone may result from it being drier and more degraded than other study sites. Not surprisingly, North Wollo is one of the more food-insecure zones in Ethiopia [91] . The VODdd AUC time series data appear to differentiate between drier and more mesic Zones: trajectories for the drier North and South Wollo Zones clustered with lower VODdd AUC values, in contrast to the clusters of the more mesic zones (Figure 13c) .\nIn general, rainfall, VODdd AUC, VOD AUC, and VODmax did not exhibit noticeable increases during the study period (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) . However, small holder agricultural crop production from the Ethiopian CSA in these zones has reportedly more than doubled in just eight years. Based on this governmental report, crop production grew at an annual rate of 6.5%, while the population growth was 2.6% over the same period of time. Yet, a paradox arises in that while crop production has apparently increased, millions have been food-insecure every year during the study period, including more than 10 million in the 2015 drought year [85, 86] .\nUncertainties in the national statistical data are not well characterized. In Ethiopia, administrative offices below the federal level lack organized historical datasets, and access to data at these offices is difficult. However, we also acknowledge that uncertainties also arise in the remote sensing data due to the mixture of other land covers with croplands within the 625 km 2 of each AMSR pixel, and potential biases arising from differences in the areal distribution of croplands within woredas that were not addressed by the normalization procedures.\nFAO-harvested area and crop production country-level data [1, 92] for Ethiopia and Tanzania were analyzed to better understand agricultural activity in the region. Note that such data are mainly collected from governmental agencies and thus may be subjected to bias. In Eastern Africa, institutional changes have been affecting agricultural land ownership and crop production through land policy reforms. Even though these institutional changes happen over longer time spans, they brought some apparently abrupt changes on the agricultural sector ( Figure 17 ). In contrast, rainfall variability has been the major driver for short-term fluctuations in agricultural crop production [28, 93] . Table A1 .\nIt is not clear why harvested area in Ethiopia drastically fell in the early 1970s, if those decreases are indeed real. However, some literature has claimed that around the end of Haile Selassie's rule , land was distributed by the crown to members of the military and those who were loyal to the regime, resulting in a concentration of land in the hands of few in the society [94] . Some of this cropland may have been idled as a result of institutional change, as has been observed elsewhere [33] .\nThe FAO long-term data showed a tremendous crop production increment in Ethiopia in the 1990s and onwards compared to that of Tanzania. Generally, the production growth rate can be modeled using an exponential growth rate (r 2 = 0.78 for Ethiopia and r 2 = 0.90 for Tanzania; Figure 18 ). However, in Ethiopia since 2009, the increment has accelerated beyond exponential growth. Crop production as a function of harvested area is well fitted with a linear curve for Tanzania for 1961-2014, but with an exponential curve for Ethiopia for 1961-2008. However, since 2009, production statistics accelerated while harvested area saturated, and the exponential growth curve can no longer explain this correspondence, which casts doubt on the reported crop production figures.\nThe crop production and yield data showed a general correspondence with climate modes in both countries. The climate modes were annual averages to align them with crop production and yield data. This may have an adverse effect on the seasonal dynamics of climate modes that positive and negative extremes that occur in a given year may cancel out each other. Crop production and yield was at its minimum during El Nino/La Nina and positive/negative IOD years, while there were larger crop productions and yield during normal ENSO/IOD years ( Figure 19 ).

"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "text": "The economies of Eastern Africa are heavily dependent on traditional rain-fed agriculture that is vulnerable to extreme weather events, such as drought and floods. Even in the absence of conflict, this region has been one of the most food-insecure parts of the world over the past three decades or more. Weather station data are scarce and difficult to obtain, while optical satellite data are limited by obscuring clouds. Satellite passive microwave data are less sensitive to clouds and atmospheric effects. Therefore, we explored using passive microwave data to study cropland dynamics in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and South Sudan. Since crop production in the region is moisture limited, seasonal dynamics of the microwave datasets were characterized as functions of cumulative moisture, in contrast to the commonly used day-of-year or accumulated growing degree-days in temperate areas.\nThe microwave data were able to track cropland dynamics in time and space. Soil moisture was sensitive to rainfall and crop cover: it started to rise when rainfall commenced and attain its peak during the peak rainfall season, then sharply dropped during the active vegetation growth period due to soil moisture drawdown by growing vegetation, and finally started to rise once the vegetation senesced. Interannual variability of soil moisture was higher during the beginning of the growing season, affecting planting times for croplands. Precipitable water vapor was able to capture seasonal and intra-seasonal atmospheric water vapor across cropland sites. It was also able to differentiate unimodal and bimodal growing seasons in the study region. \nThe economies of Eastern Africa are heavily dependent on traditional rain-fed agriculture that is vulnerable to extreme weather events, such as drought and floods.

Precipitable water vapor was able to capture seasonal and intra-seasonal atmospheric water vapor across cropland sites. It was also able to differentiate unimodal and bimodal growing seasons in the study region.\nActual evapotranspiration (ETa) derived from simple surface energy balance model was sensitive to rainfall dynamics. It tracked well both the unimodal and bimodal spatial and temporal rainfall patterns in the region. Both the unimodal and bimodal ETa time series were fitted by the quadratic model better than with cumulative vapor days. Moisture times to peak (MTPs) showed strong correspondence between and among land surface variables. The lags and co-occurrences between and among these land surface variables occurred in logical sequences.\nGlobal circulation patterns and climate modes linked to the Pacific and Indian Oceans, such as El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) modes affect rainfall in Eastern Africa. The biophysical and geophysical variables derived from passive microwave data responded to ENSO and IOD events occurring during the study period, including major floods (2006, 2010) and an extreme drought (2015) .\nThe correspondence between passive microwave land surface parameters and crop production and crop yield was not straightforward. The spatial resolution of satellite passive microwave data and the areal units of crop production statistical data in Ethiopia is roughly similar. We addressed the spatial overlay mismatch between the AMSR pixel and crop production area through an areal normalization process. However, key limitations of the crop production data include data uncertainty and the lack of high quality, long-term data at the woreda (district) level. Data access is highly centralized at the federal level. Crop production data from the Ethiopian Statistical Agency (CSA) is not well characterized, and access to data below the zone level is restricted. The correspondence between the passive microwave data metrics and crop production data at the woreda level was encouraging, but these data were made available from a regional agricultural office through personal communication.\nIn contrast, the correspondence between passive microwave data metrics with crop production data at zone level (using data from CSA) was very weak, with no correspondence at some sites. Note that the woreda level analysis is correspondence across space in one year (2014), while the zone level analysis is correspondence in time (2003-2008 & 2010) . According to the CSA, small holder peasant agricultural crop production data in the study zones in Northwestern Ethiopia has reportedly more than doubled in just eight years. This figure strains credulity given the interannual variation in precipitation. However, we acknowledge that the mixture of other land covers with croplands within the 25 km AMSR-E pixel may contribute to the discrepancies of the LSP product with crop production data. While the passive microwave products are found to be relevant for the study of cropland dynamics, additional study is needed to understand how they can best be used. Access to crop production and yield statistical data at the village level and the synergistic use of VNIR vegetation index data might complement such research efforts. Appendix A. Table A1 .

At the same time, there was huge national afforestation program, which may have reduced the area of marginal croplands. The \"Agriculture-Led Industrialization\" (ADLI) policy was declared, which aimed at giving more resources to farmers and farm activity compared to urban dwellers and industrial and tertiary activities [97] .
