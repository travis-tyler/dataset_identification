It contains a brief description of the data collection, along with information required to understand and access the data file."}, {"section_title": "A. The Common Core of Data", "text": "The CCD is a national statistical program that collects and compiles administrative data from state education agencies (SEAs) covering the universe of all public elementary and secondary schools and school districts in the United States. The Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey is one of five annual surveys that comprise the CCD. The other four surveys are the Local Education Agency Universe Survey, the State Nonfiscal Survey of Public Elementary/Secondary Education, the National Public Education Finance Survey, and the School District Finance Survey. The Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 9543) requires NCES to collect, acquire, compile and disseminate information about elementary/secondary education, and the CCD provides essential components about public education in the United States through use of administrative data. The scope of the CCD public school universe covers the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. Island Areas (American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Schools that are supported by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) and the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) are also included in the universe. SEAs report school-, agency-, and state-level education data for each school year through the U.S. Department of Education's EDFacts Submission System (ESS). While each SEA maintains its own public education data systems, NCES and SEAs work cooperatively to develop and accept common data items and definitions in the goal of producing consistent and comparable statistical data that are critical to NCES' mission to report complete statistics on the condition of education in the United States. The school universe serves as a basis for all other administrative data collections within EDFacts that collect data at the school level. These include data that are used by NCES to produce official statistics and data that are used by other offices within the Department of Education to administer federal education programs. Additionally, the school directory data are frequently used developing sampling frames for surveys such as NCES' National Assessment of Education Progress or the Schools and Staffing Survey. The school universe data are also useful to (1) chief officers of state education agencies, (2) policymakers in the executive and legislative branches of federal and state governments, (3) education policy and public policy researchers, (4) the press, and (5) citizens interested in information about public schools."}, {"section_title": "B. Revisions made in the 2a release", "text": "Data in version 2a of the CCD School Universe file has been extensively changed from the data published in version 1a. Version 2a includes data resubmitted by the SEAs after November, 2013, when NCES last extracted data for version 1a. Unlike version 1a, data in version 2a were not subject to suppression; all numeric values are as reported by the SEAs through EDFacts. The remainder of this document contains a user's guide and four appendixes. The user's guide contains information on CCD methodology, including certain conditions that are unique to this data file. \u2022 Appendix A-Record Layout lists each variable on the data file, the position of the variable on the data file, a description of each variable and the permitted values for that variable, where applicable. \u2022 Appendix B-Value Distribution and Field Frequencies indicates the number of blank, missing, not applicable and reported values for character variables. It also indicates the minimum, maximum, and mean value and number of missing, not applicable and suppressed values for each continuous variable as well as the frequency, percentage, cumulative frequency, and cumulative percent of all categorical variables. Appendix B also lists the frequency of suppressed values for the Membership, Teacher FTE and Free Lunch variables. \u2022 Appendix C-Glossary defines all of the CCD data items. \u2022 Appendix D-State Notes provides comments for data users on individual states."}, {"section_title": "II. Methodology and Technical Notes", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "A. Data Collection and Editing Procedures", "text": "The EDFacts Submission System (ESS) is the primary collection system for the CCD. Coordinators from SEAs submit the CCD data at the school, agency, and state levels. Prior to submitting CCD files into ESS, SEAs must collect and compile information from their respective local education agencies (LEAs) via administrative records systems within their state or jurisdiction. SEAs then assemble the data files per the reporting requirements and guidance available via file specifications provided by the Department of Education. For more information on the file specifications, visit www.ed.gov/edfacts. Once SEAs complete their submissions, CCD survey analysts review and verify the CCD for quality assurance. CCD survey analysts routinely verify data through edit and consistency checks, as well as checking SEA, LEA, or school public websites (if necessary), and then refer discrepancies to SEA coordinators for resolution. NCES does not contact LEAs or schools to verify data, except in unusual circumstances. Editing procedures are described in more detail later in this section. For the purposes of data submissions to EDFacts/CCD, the definition of a school is an institution that: \u2022 provides educational services; \u2022 has one or more grade groups (prekindergarten through 12) or is ungraded; \u2022 has one or more teachers; \u2022 is located in one or more buildings; \u2022 has assigned administrator(s); \u2022 receives public funds as its primary support; and \u2022 is operated by an education agency. The CCD school definition recognizes that this organization may encompass several locations but must have a single contact point, which is the mailing address entered on the CCD school record. This data file also includes: \u2022 schools that serve students on a part time basis, such as a vocational or technical school; \u2022 schools that serve students remotely--that is, the school providing instruction is located in a different location than where the student is located, such as distance learning, cyber learning, or virtual learning; \u2022 charter schools, including those that may be authorized by an entity other than an LEA; and \u2022 schools run by SEAs or another state agency, such as a juvenile justice facility or school designed to meet a specialized need. States report data to EDFacts on a reporting schedule throughout the year by submitting a series of data groups (or data files) through ESS. The school year (SY) 2012-13 EDFacts collection opened in January 2013, with the Directory file having a due date of January 31, 2013. NCES extracted the directory data from EDFacts between January 2013 and November 2013. CCD survey staff processed each state's submission on a flow basis, so the date of the extract for each state's file may vary depending on when SEAs completed their submission. Once a file was edited and verified for a particular state, CCD survey staff did not continue to incorporate late submissions or updates unless these late submissions or updates resulted in a major change of the reported data. Late submissions or update from SEAs may be included in subsequent file releases. The requested reporting schedule for the SY 2012-13 collection cycle is summarized in Table 1. The specifications for these data files are available online at http://www2.ed.gov/about/inits/ed/edfacts/file-specifications.html . NCES applies multiple types of editing procedures to ensure data quality. For example NCES performs an extensive matching procedure on the directory of schools to the directory from the prior year to ensure that the coverage of schools included in the directory is complete and accurate. NCES reviews the categorical variables for schools and changes in operating statuses to ensure that these meet with the business rules and data definitions established for reporting school data. At multiple points throughout the collection CCD survey staff contact EDFacts and CCD coordinators within each SEA and provide them targeted feedback about their data submissions. NCES asks state coordinators to address any data that appear to be in error or are anomalies in the data. Most often SEAs will submit corrected data or explain why the data are accurate. If an SEA provides no correction or adequate explanations for data anomalies, NCES may provide a logical correction to a data value (for example, replaced a reported total with the sum of detail component values) or suppress the data. For example, if a state reported enrollment of 12 th grade students that was substantially larger than the enrollment of 11 th grade students in the previous year, and the state could not explain the discrepancy or correct the data, NCES would suppress the reported number of 12 th grade students. NCES also applied additional edits across the school, LEA, and state-level data to reduce data anomalies and ensure consistency among the levels of data. For example, for a given LEA the teacher FTE counts at the school level may have summed to more than what was reported at the LEA level. If the SEA was unable to verify that this was accurate, explain the discrepancy, or resubmit a corrected data, NCES edited the FTE data at the school level to match the data at the LEA level by proportionally adjusting the counts. The EDFacts reporting guidance does not require states to report all data groups for all entities when those data values are not applicable; states are required to report for entities where the count is applicable (i.e., 0, missing, >0). However, some states do not follow strict adherence to the guidance. For the data files it publishes, NCES uses business rules based on EDFacts reporting requirements to set these values to '-1' (missing), '-2' ( not applicable), or zero. Once CCD survey staff complete the collection and review of the CCD directory data, Census Bureau staff clean and standardize the reported physical location addresses for schools and LEAs and then assign geographic elements (latitude, longitude, locale, congressional district, and county) based on the school location address."}, {"section_title": "B. Sources of Error and Technical Details about the SY 2012-13 file", "text": "Nonsampling error. Nonsampling error is the error in an estimate arising at any stage in the survey from sources exclusive of sampling error. Nonsampling error includes nonresponse error, data processing or data entry errors, or reporting error because respondents misinterpret survey questions, do not follow survey instructions, or do not follow the item definitions correctly. State education policies may differ in such a way that does not allow them to map their data exactly to the CCD definitions. Another source of nonsampling error may be variations in the reference period for the reported data. For example, CCD requests data for October 1 of each school year, but a state may report their information for another date because they were not able to capture the data for October 1. If specific discrepancies are known, these are provided in appendix D, State Notes. NCES attempts to minimize nonsampling error through the use of annual training of SEA coordinators, extensive quality reviews, and survey editing procedures. For example NCES performs an extensive matching procedure on the directory of schools to the directory from the prior year to ensure that the coverage of schools included in the directory is complete and accurate. NCES reviews the categorical variables for schools and changes in operating statuses to ensure that these meet with the business rules and data definitions established for reporting school data. Universe Scope. The scope of the Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe Survey includes all public schools providing education services to prekindergarten, kindergarten, grade 1-12, and ungraded students. In the SY 2012-13 CCD School Universe Survey file, there are 102,890 records-one for each public elementary and secondary school in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the four U.S. Island Areas, the DoDEA schools, and the BIE. Schools coded as being open in the SY 2011-12 file, but coded as closed in the SY 2012-13 file (1,576 schools), will be kept on the file for one year, and then removed (i.e., they do not appear in files for subsequent years). Closed schools are indicated by a value of '2' for the variable STATUS. Excluding these closed schools, there are 101,314 schools on the 2012-13 file. Of these 101,314 schools, 91,439 are regular elementary and secondary, 2,069 are special education, 1,446 are vocational/technical, and 6,360 are other/alternative schools. For a count of all school types, including closed schools, see Table B-3. Both the school and agency files include type variables that make these distinctions. See Appendix C: Glossary for the complete typologies. Coverage error. Coverage error is a source of nonsampling error that occurs when the measured universe of schools and agencies varies from the actual target universe; for example, the same agency or school could be reported twice (i.e. overcoverage) or an agency or school could be omitted (i.e. undercoverage). To minimize coverage error CCD survey analysts conduct an extensive review of the schools submitted by SEAs by matching to the universe reported in the prior year and ensuring that each school is only counted once and each school is accounted for with the appropriate operational status. Although longitudinal consistency is a key principle of the CCD, it is impossible for NCES to guarantee that state data coordinators follow CCD conventions regarding the deletion of closed schools or agencies and the addition of new ones. Errors may be more likely when there are cases of redistricting where the district boundaries change or if local education agencies merge or split or re-organize because these types of change make it more difficult to compare information for a given school or agency over time. The CCD asks states to report all free elementary/secondary public education in their state regardless of who administers the schools or districts. CCD coverage of traditional public schools and school districts is very complete (close to 100 percent). However, coverage of publicly funded education outside of traditional school districts has varying levels of coverage within different states and jurisdictions. Some states do not report schools that are administered by state organizations other than SEAs. Examples include charter schools authorized by an organization that is not a school district, schools sponsored by health and human services agencies within a state, and juvenile justice facilities. These schools may include schools for the deaf and blind, university lab schools, and other schools not covered by the authority of the SEA. In recent years EDFacts /CCD has increased efforts to work with other Department of Education offices as well as other federal agencies to use additional administrative data sources to identify schools that may be underreported by SEAs. Response. The DoDEA and American Samoa did not report data for SY 2012-13; however, NCES used historical CCD information and more current information from public websites for these education agencies to minimally include the schools from these entities in the school universe directory. Item response is described in appendix B: Value Distribution and Field Frequencies. This appendix lists the minimum, maximum, and mean value of each numeric variable as well as the total number of units and the number of units with missing data. Appendix B also lists the frequency of responses by option for each of the categorical values. Handling of data items without a positive reported data value. All data elements are either reported by the state or have been filled with a \"0,\" \"-1,\" \"-2,\" \"M,\" or \"N.\" \u2022 0 -There are not occurrences of this data element. A value was expected and reported, but there were no cases in the category. (For example, a high school having no 12 th graders would report 0.) \u2022 M (or -1 for numeric values) -Data are missing. A value was expected and none was reported. (For example, a school that has at least one 12 th grader but cannot report the number of 12 th graders would report -1.) \u2022 N (or -2 for numeric values) -Data are not applicable. A value was neither expected nor reported. (For example, an elementary school would report -2 for 12 th graders.) \u2022 In addition, schools that could not be assigned a geographic longitude/latitude were assigned a value of 0.000000. Note that starting with the SY 2002-03 CCD; all numeric fields contain a -1 to indicate \"missing\" and a -2 to indicate \"not applicable.\" Previously, numeric fields contained an \"M\" for missing and an \"N\" for not applicable. Character fields continue to use \"M\" for missing and \"N\" for not applicable. Since negative numeric values represent missing or non-applicable data and not actual data values, users may want to recode these before performing data analysis. The following SAS code can be used to convert negative values to \"missing\" in the SAS data file: data new; set sc122a; array remove (*) _numeric_; do i = 1 to dim (remove); if remove (i) < 0 then remove (i) = .; end; drop i; run; BIE Schools. There are 10 operating schools that are reported by both the Bureau of Indian Education and state education agencies, leading to duplicate records on the data file. These schools are run by BIE, but they also receive federal funds or federally funded services through the state. To avoid double counting of schools or students, NCES created the BIES flag. This flag has a value of either '1' or '2'; a value of '1' indicates a school reported by a state that is also reported by BIE. All other schools, including all BIE schools, have a value of '2' in this field. Users trying to match NCES tabulations should exclude records with a flag set to '1' from their analysis. New York City Schools. New York City is shown in NCES reports as a single school district. However, \"New York City Public Schools\" is reported in CCD as a supervisory union comprising multiple \"geographic districts\" and an additional \"special schools\" district. To aggregate NYC school data to the supervisory union, researchers must select schools with a state ANSI code equal to 36 and a supervisory union ID (UNION) equal to 300. See table D-1 for a list of geographic districts associated with the New York City Public School district."}, {"section_title": "C. Detailed Information about File Variables", "text": "This section includes detailed information specific to each variable on the file. The code in parentheses before the variable description indicates the variable name, which is also referenced in appendix A, Record Layout. (LEANM) Name of Education Agency. Each record includes the name of the agency that operates the school. NCES reviewed any record filling the 60 characters assigned, and may have edited the agency name to improve readability (i.e., applied standard abbreviations). (SCHNAM) Name of School. Each record has a school name. NCES reviewed any record filling the 50 characters assigned, and may have edited the school name to improve readability (i.e., applied standard abbreviations). (MSTREE) Mailing Street. This field may contain a street address or a P.O. Box number. In addition, some mailing addresses consist solely of a city and state, indicated by an \"N\" in the street address field. If mailing street, city, state, and ZIP Code fields were left blank or missing, data from the corresponding location address fields were inserted. (MCITY) Mailing City. There may be some valid cases in which a school may be located in one city and have a mailing address in another city. (MSTATE) Mailing State (P.O. Abbreviation). Each record contains a mailing state. There are instances where a school that is part of one state's education system reports a mailing address in another state; these situations have been confirmed by the reporting state. A list of schools that have a mailing state code different from their ANSI state code is included at the end of this document (see table 3). (MZIP, MZIP4) Mailing ZIP Code +4. Each record displays a mailing ZIP Code in this field. The +4 may be left blank if it is unknown. (PHONE) Area Code + Telephone Number. If a valid phone number was not provided for a school for the 2012-13 school year, NCES researched prior year data files to determine if a valid phone number was reported for the school in a prior year. If a valid number was found in a prior year, this phone number was carried forward to the 2012-13 data file. (LSTREE) Location Street. If the location street, city, state, and ZIP Code fields were left blank, data from the corresponding mailing address fields may have been inserted. In some instances, SEAs did not report physical locations for the location street field, but rather reported Post Office boxes and other addresses that did not represent the location of a school. In order to determine the physical location (and latitude and longitude coordinates) of these schools, NCES researched prior year's data files to determine if a valid location street address had ever been reported. If a valid location was found in a prior year, this value was carried forward to the current year's file. If no valid location was found in prior years, the SEA, LEA, or school websites were researched to find the physical location. If this search results in no identifiable address, LSTREE is set to 'M'. Beginning with the SY 2007-08, NCES began editing the reported school type if it did not agree with the CCD definition. For example, if a school name indicated that it focused primarily on the needs of students with disabilities or if the state reported that at least 80 percent of the students enrolled in the school had special education individual education programs (IEPs), NCES reclassified the school as a special education school 2 . Similarly, if a school name suggested that it was a vocational or alternative school, NCES researched the school through different resources (e.g., school website or education association) to determine if the school should be reclassified as a vocational or alternative school. NCES asks SEA Coordinators to review these reclassifications, and if the SEA provides evidence that a school met the CCD criteria for the originally reported type, NCES publishes the value reported by the SEA. Schools that were operational in the prior year, but turned into reportable programs for the current year were reported to EDFacts as Type 5-Reportable Program with an operational status of Closed. Closed entities remain on the CCD file for one year. In all other cases, NCES omits reportable programs from the school universe file. (STATUS) Operational Status Code. Each record contains a status code to reflect the school's operational status for the referenced school year. Valid responses include the following: 1 = School was operational at the time of the last report and is currently operational. 2 = School has closed since the time of the last report. 3 = School has been opened since the time of the last report. 4 = School was operational at the time of the last report but was not on the CCD list at that time. 5 = School was listed in previous year's CCD school universe as being affiliated with a different education agency. 6 = School is temporarily closed and may reopen within 3 years. 7 = School is scheduled to be operational within 2 years. 8 = School was closed on previous year's file but has reopened. Schools with an operational status code of \"2\" remain on the file for one year for historical purposes. Code \"6\" and \"7\" response options for the STATUS field were added to the CCD starting with the SY 2002-03 file. Code \"8\" response option for the STATUS field was added to the CCD starting with the SY 2005-06 file. (UNION) Supervisory Union Identification Number. This field was added for the SY 2011-12 collection. For supervisory union administrative centers and component agencies, this is a number assigned by the state to the union. Additionally, if the agency is a county superintendent, this is the ANSI county number. If no number was reported, the field will contain \"000.\" (ULOCAL) Urban-centric Locale Code. Locale code is a geographic indicator NCES applies for general description, sampling, and other statistical purposes. The locale assignment is based on the location of the school building and may not necessarily reflect the entire attendance area or the residences of all enrolled students. The designation of each school's locale is primarily based on its geographic location and proximity to densely populated urban areas. NCES assigns address geocodes (i.e., latitude and longitude coordinates representing address location) from the schools' location addresses reported in the CCD. NCES applies a standardization process to physical addresses reported by SEAs and then uses geographic information system (GIS) software to assign the latitude and longitude value based on the standardized address. The software then uses the latitude and longitude to evaluate the spatial relationship between the location of a school and the geographic criteria for each locale. The locale code categories are derived from urban and rural classifications and principal city definitions that are determined and published by the U.S. Census Bureau after each Decennial Census. The urban and rural classifications fall into three categories: \u2022 Urbanized Areas (UAs) of 50,000 or more people; \u2022 Urban Clusters (UCs) of at least 2,500 and less than 50,000 people. \u2022 Rural areas encompass all population, housing, and territory not included within an urban area. For more information on the urban and rural classifications and other geographic terms used in creating locale codes, please refer to Census's Geographic Terms and The 12 urban-centric locale code categories are defined below. Locale codes are divided into four main locale types (city, suburb, town, and rural) and each of the four locale types has three subtypes (large, midsize, and small for city and suburb locale types and fringe, distant, and remote for town and rural locale types). 33 = Town, Remote: Territory inside an urban cluster that is more than 35 miles of an urbanized area. 41 = Rural, Fringe: Census-defined rural territory that is less than or equal to 5 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is less than or equal to 2.5 miles from an urban cluster. 42 = Rural, Distant: Census-defined rural territory that is more than 5 miles but less than or equal to 25 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is more than 2.5 miles but less than or equal to 10 miles from an urban cluster. 43 = Rural, Remote: Census-defined rural territory that is more than 25 miles from an urbanized area and is also more than 10 miles from an urban cluster. (LATCOD) Latitude. This is determined based on the physical address reported in the directory file. Latitude is the north or south angular distance from the equator, with positive values going north and negative values going south. When combined with longitude, it reflects an estimation of where the school is physically situated on the street segment to which it was coded. Coordinate degrees, minutes, and seconds have been converted to, and are displayed in terms of, their decimal equivalent. The digits to the left of the decimal point represent the number of degrees from the equator, and the digits to the right of the decimal point represent the fraction of the degree carried out to six decimal places. For example, if a building's latitude is 30 degrees, 30 minutes north, then it is shown as 30.500000. There were no addresses that could not be found at the Census block level. If SEAs reported an additional school or updated a school address after the preliminary geographic coding process was completed the latitude for that school was set to a value of 0.000000. (LONCOD) Longitude. This is determined based on the physical address reported in the directory file. Longitude is the east or west angular distance from the prime meridian, with positive values going east and negative values going west. When combined with latitude, it reflects an estimation of where the school is physically situated on the street segment to which it was coded. Coordinate degrees, minutes, and seconds have been converted to, and are displayed in terms of, their decimal equivalent. The digits to the left of the decimal point represent the number of degrees from the prime meridian. The digits to the right of the decimal point represent the fraction of the next degree carried out to six decimal places. For example, if a building's longitude is 90 degrees, 15 minutes west, then it is shown as -90.250000. If SEAs reported an additional school or updated a school address after the preliminary geographic coding process was completed the latitude for that school was set to a value of 0.000000. (CONUM) ANSI County Code. This field was added to the school file starting in 2002-03. The values for this field are assigned based on the reported location address. (CONAME) County Name. This field was added to the school file starting in 2002-03. The values for this field are determined based on the reported location address. (FTE) Full-Time-Equivalent Teachers. A school's count of full-time-equivalent teachers is collected to the nearest hundredth. Some schools may report teachers, but no pupils, while other schools may report pupils in membership but no teacher FTE. These are valid records indicating situations in which more than one school provides services to pupils, but the pupils are attributed to a single school to avoid double counting, or where a teacher provides services to pupils at multiple schools. An example of the former situation might be a vocational school whose pupil membership is attributed to the high school that sends its pupils to obtain vocational services. Because teacher counts are collected at all three levels of the CCD files (school, agency, and state), one data anomaly is that the sum of teacher counts aggregated from the lower level to the state level may exceed the sum of teacher counts from a higher level aggregated to the state level (i.e., school FTE data aggregated to the state level may exceed agency-level FTE data aggregated to the state or state-level reported data). Beginning with SY 2008-09, if the sum of teacher FTE aggregated to the state level reported on the school file exceeded the sum of teacher FTE aggregated to the state on the agency file or exceeded state file reports, teacher FTE may have been edited on one or more of the three levels. School-level FTE aggregated to the agency level is allowed to exceed agency-level FTE reports. (GSLO, GSHI) Low/High Grade Span Offered. The lowest and highest grades offered in each school was calculated by NCES using two types of information reported by states: (1) binary 'grade offered' flags that indicate whether a given grade (e.g., prekindergarten, kindergarten, grade 1) was offered by the school; and (2) reports of enrollment by grade. (LEVEL) Level. A school-level code was added to the school file starting in SY 2000-01. This code indicates the instructional level of the school. The following codes were calculated from the school's corresponding low/high grade span (GSLO/GSHI) values: 1 = Primary (low grade: PK through 03; high grade: PK through 08) 2 = Middle (low grade: 04 through 07; high grade: 04 through 11) 3 = High (low grade: 07 through 12; high grade: 12 only) 4 = Other (any other configuration not falling within the above three categories, including ungraded and operational schools with nonapplicable grade spans) (MAGNET) Magnet School. If a state reports MAGNET = 2 for all its schools, then MAGNET is set to \"N\" (not applicable). Only states or jurisdictions other than the BIE can contain a value of \"1\" (\"Yes\") for this flag. (FRELCH) Free Lunch Eligible Students. This student count may be taken by a school at a different time than the membership count; therefore, free lunch and membership counts may not be comparable within a given school. In some states, a single school may provide the free lunch program for a cluster of schools; thus, the free lunch eligible count for the school providing services may over represent the school's total membership. (RACECAT) Race/ethnicities category indicator. The data item RACECAT is a race/ethnicities category indicator that indicates whether the state reported student enrollment counts by five race/ethnicity categories or seven race/ethnicity categories. Prior to SY 2008-09, NCES asked states to report student enrollment counts by five racial/ethnic categories. In SY 2008-09 and SY 2009-10, NCES gave SEAs the option to choose between 5-category reporting and 7-category reporting for the SY 2008-09, five states reported their race/ethnicity data in the seven categories and in SY 2009-10, fourteen states reported data in the 7-category reporting. Since SY 2010-11, the SEAs were required to report race/ethnicity data in seven categories. All states and jurisdictions that responded to the EDFacts collection system reported data in the 7-category reporting. The data item RACECAT contains two values: In the current file, for the states that reported five race/ethnicity categories (i.e., RACECAT=5), the variables related to the Asian race category include students who are Asian, Hawaiian Native, or Pacific Islander; for the states that reported seven race/ethnicity categories (i.e., RACECAT=7), the variables related to the Asian race category include Asian students only. In appendix A, Record Layout, the race/ethnicity categories represented by the five and seven reporting categories are followed by a notation of \"(5)\" or \"(7),\" respectively. Student membership (MEMBER), students by Grade (PK-12), by Race/Ethnicity, and by Sex. Membership is the count of students enrolled on October 1st of the school year. CCD collects membership counts at three levels: school, agency, and state. The summed total of student membership reported by states at one level may often be different from what was reported at one or both of the other levels. In general, the total student membership on lower level file should be less than or equal to the total membership on higher level files. A common reason for these differences is that SEAs report aggregate counts of students at the school-level counting each student at the school the student attends the majority of the time; for SEA and LEA-level membership, SEAs report aggregate counts of students at the LEA or SEA that is financially responsible for the student. For example, a regular school district may not be able to provide services to students with special needs and may instead pay tuition for students to attend private schools that provide services to students with special needs. These students are then counted in the regular school district, but are not included in the membership counts for any of the schools in CCD school file. For states with membership discrepancies that exceed five percent of the lower level membership, CCD survey staff routinely follows up with SEAs and asks SEAs to verify the reported membership and provide explanations of the differences. In school year SY 2008-09, CCD began implementing editing procedures to correct for cross file inconsistencies on a case by case basis. If an SEA could not provide a plausible explanation for why there were inconsistencies across the SEA, LEA, and school files, CCD survey analysts applied cross file adjustments to student membership at one or more levels to ensure that the sum of the lower level membership does not exceed the sum of the higher level membership.

The first two characters of the file name indicate the type of file (SC = School Universe, AG = Agency Universe, ST = State), the third and fourth characters indicate the file year (12 = 2012-13 CCD collection), and the fifth and sixth characters indicate the version number (1 = first version; A = released file). At a later date, NCES may release revised SY 2012-13 provisional and final files and these will have incremental version numbers (e.g. the second revised file is labeled 2a).

Guidelines for Using the Flat ASCII Data File", "text": "When using the flat ASCII data file, care should be taken to label the identification number variables (e.g., NCESSCH) as character fields. This is necessary in order to retain the leading zero in many of the identification numbers. It is necessary to keep the leading zeroes when merging these data with other files. This can be accomplished in Excel by using the 'Import Wizard' to select the ID fields and set them as text fields.
