Directed by the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, TIMSS also collects a rich array of information about the school and home contexts for learning mathematics and science. With data collection for the first time in 1995, and again in 1999 and 2003, the TIMSS data collection in 2007 will provide trend data on students' mathematics and science achievement at four points in time extending over a 12-year period. Countries that have participated in successive waves of TIMSS have access to unparalleled information about the improvement or decline in the mathematics and science achievement of their students. Central to the success of TIMSS has been participating countries' expertise in the areas of curriculum, measurement, and education, and their willingness to work together in the interests of improving mathematics and science education. The TIMSS 2007 Assessment Frameworks provides a template for IEA's work in the assessment of Mathematics and Science at fourth and eighth grades. Building on the frameworks prepared for the 2003 assessment, this document is the product of an extensive collaborative process involving many individuals and expert groups from around the world, most notably the TIMSS advisory groups in mathematics and science, the National Research Coordinators (NRCs) from more than 60 countries, and TIMSS staff at Boston College, Amsterdam, and Hamburg. The review process of consultation, collaboration and systematic review among representatives of the TIMSS countries, the mathematics and science research community, and other experts ensures that the document reflects the latest advances in thinking about large-scale comparative assessment of mathematics and science and embodies the interests of many individuals and countries around the world. Any project as ambitious as TIMSS 2007 requires significant financial support for its development and execution. Support for this project and the development of the framework document was provided by the National Center for Education Statistics of the US Department of Education, the US National Science Foundation, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programmme, and the participating countries. IEA is extremely grateful for their continued support. We are grateful also for the generous support provided for TIMSS by Boston College and the National Foundation for Educational Research for England and Wales. The work presented in this document represents the efforts of many individuals and groups. TIMSS derives the direction and leadership necessary to complete such a complex and ambitious project from IEA's TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center in the Lynch School of Education at Boston College. Together with the committed and able staff from the consortium of organizations that work to implement TIMSS, the Center's dedicated staff and consultants have played a vital role in developing the assessment frameworks. Crucial also has been the work of the TIMSS advisory groups in mathematics and science, and in particular that of TIMSS Mathematics Coordinator Graham Ruddock and TIMSS Science Coordinator Christine O'Sullivan. Taking special responsibility for mathematics and science, respectively, Alka Arora and Ebru Erberber each made major contributions to the frameworks document. Eugene Johnson and Pierre Foy adapted the TIMSS assessment design to the requirements of the 2007 assessment."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Overview of TIMSS", "text": "IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) provides information to improve teaching and learning in mathematics and science. TIMSS assesses achievement in mathematics and science at the fourth and eighth grades and collects a rich array of background information to address concerns about school resources and the quality of curriculum and instruction. Conducted every four years on a regular cycle, TIMSS provides countries with an unprecedented opportunity to measure progress in educational achievement in mathematics and science. As a project of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA), TIMSS has the benefit of drawing on the cooperative expertise provided by representatives from countries all around the world. The IEA is an independent international cooperative of national research institutions and government agencies that has been conducting studies of cross-national achievement since 1959. As of 2005, IEA had 62 institutional members. TIMSS 2007 is the most recent in the series of IEA studies to measure trends in students' mathematics and science achievement. The first cycle of TIMSS was in 1995 in 41 countries. The second cycle in 1999 involved 38 countries (26 were able to measure trends). Continuing the regular cycle of studies at four-year intervals, TIMSS 2003 involved more than 50 countries and approximately 60 countries are expected to participate in TIMSS 2007. Nearly 40 of these countries will have trend data, some covering more than a decade back to 1995. TIMSS data have had an enduring impact on reform and development efforts in mathematics and science education around the world, leading on one hand to continuing demand for trend data to monitor development and on the other to a need for more and better policyrelevant information to guide and evaluate new initiatives."}, {"section_title": "The TIMSS 2007 Assessment Frameworks", "text": "This publication, the TIMSS 2007 Assessment Frameworks, contains three frameworks and explains the assessment design that will serve as the basis for implementing TIMSS 2007. The Mathematics Framework and the Science Framework in Chapters 1 and 2, respectively, describe in some detail the major content and cognitive domains in mathematics and science to be tested at the fourth and eighth grades. The content domains and topic areas are described separately for the fourth and eighth grades with each topic area elaborated with specific objectives. Within mathematics and science, the cognitive domains are parallel across grades, but with different levels of emphasis. The Contextual Framework in Chapter 3 describes the types of factors and contexts associated with students' learning in mathematics and science that will be investigated via the questionnaires. Finally, Chapter 4 provides an overview of the Assessment Design, including general parameters for item development."}, {"section_title": "The TIMSS Curriculum Model", "text": "Building on earlier IEA studies of mathematics and science achievement, TIMSS uses the curriculum, broadly defined, as the major organizing concept in considering how educational opportunities are provided to students, and the factors that influence how students use these opportunities. The TIMSS curriculum model has three aspects: the intended curriculum, the implemented curriculum, and the achieved curriculum (see Exhibit 1). These represent, respectively, the mathematics and science that society intends for students to learn and how the education system should be organized to facilitate this learning; what is actually taught in classrooms, who teaches it, and how it is taught; and, finally, what it is that students have learned, and what they think about these subjects."}, {"section_title": "Exhibit 1: TIMSS Curriculum Model", "text": "Working from this model, TIMSS uses mathematics and science achievement tests to describe student learning in the participating countries, together with questionnaires to provide a wealth of information. The questionnaires ask about the structure and content of the intended curriculum in mathematics and science, the preparation, experience, and attitudes of teachers, the mathematics and science content actually taught, the instructional approaches used, the organization and resources of schools and classrooms, and the experiences and attitudes of the students in the schools."}, {"section_title": "The Development Process for the TIMSS 2007 Assessment Frameworks", "text": "Introduction and Science Frameworks were expanded to provide specific objectives for assessing students at the fourth and eighth grades. An international panel of mathematics and science education and testing experts provided guidance for the general form the assessment frameworks should take and representatives from national centers in the participating countries were asked to play an important role in contributing critiques and advice as the frameworks were developed. Using an iterative process, successive drafts were presented for comment and review by the TIMSS 2003 National Research Coordinators (NRCs), national committees within participating countries, and expert panel members. The participating countries completed detailed questionnaires, providing valuable feedback about the topics included in their curricula and the suitability and desirability of assessing particular topics at the fourth and eighth grades. As such, the frameworks do not consist solely of content and behaviors included in the curricula of all participating countries. The aim of the thorough consultation on curriculum within countries was to ensure that goals of mathematics and science education regarded as important in a significant number of countries were included. Beginning with TIMSS 2007, IEA and the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center have decided to update the TIMSS Assessment Frameworks with every cycle. Updating the frameworks regularly provides participating countries greater opportunity to review and provide information about the frameworks and results in more coherence from assessment to assessment, permitting the frameworks, the instruments, and the procedures to evolve gradually into the future. For TIMSS 2007, the frameworks were discussed by the NRCs at their first meeting. Participating countries also consulted with their national experts and responded to questionnaires about the possibility of combining some content areas receiving low priority in previous assessments to improve the potential for measuring trends over time in content areas. The questionnaires also attempted to garner each country's views about adding or deleting particular assessment topic areas and objectives. Revised on the basis of input from the participating countries, the frameworks were reviewed in-depth by the TIMSS 2007 Science and Mathematics Item Review Committee (SMIRC). Using an iterative process, the frameworks as further revised by SMIRC were once again reviewed by the NRCs and updated finally prior to publication. The TIMSS 2007 Assessment Frameworks document closely resembles that for TIMSS 2003. Since it is crucial to have continuity in a study designed to measure trends in educational achievement over time, this is very appropriate. However, there are some notable revisions. In the Mathematics and Science Frameworks, the content domains are presented separately for the fourth and eighth grades, and there has been a concerted effort to better reflect fourth-grade curricula. At both grades, there was an effort to consolidate the major content areas and adjust the assessment topic areas and objectives to make them more appropriate and feasible in the context of a large-scale international assessment. The cognitive domains in the Mathematics and Science Frameworks also have been revised for TIMSS 2007. To increase the potential for analyzing and reporting the mathematics and science results according to cognitive domains, the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics provided support to examine and refine the mathematics cognitive domains used in TIMSS 2003. The issue of reporting results for cognitive domains in both mathematics and science was discussed by the NRCs, and the SMIRC mathematics and science experts worked to recast the cognitive domains in mathematics and science, respectively, to develop a classification scheme that encompassed the important cognitive domains assessed by TIMSS while sharpening the distinction among mutually exclusive categories. These revisions were reviewed by the TIMSS 2007 NRCs in parallel with the updates to the content domains. has been modified to ensure that students have ample response time and to have a more straightforward booklet design. In the discussions about updating the frameworks held by the NRCs and the SMIRC as well as by the IEA and TIMSS management and technical groups, the emphasis has been on improving the quality of measurement in the assessments for TIMSS 2007 and on increasing the utility of results for participating countries. This includes assessing content appropriate to the students and important to their future lives, ensuring adequate response time for students, increasing operational feasibility, and maximizing the potential to improve reporting achievement in the content and cognitive domains assessed."}, {"section_title": "More About TIMSS 1", "text": "To be particularly relevant to decision-making and implementing school policy, TIMSS assesses students at two important educational milestones -at the end of four years of formal schooling (end of primary school) and the end of eight years of formal schooling (end of lower-secondary education). Because TIMSS studies the effectiveness of curriculum and instruction in relation to student achievement, it is important for TIMSS to assess mathematics and science achievement at the same point in schooling across countries. That is, for fair comparisons, students should have had the opportunity to learn mathematics and science for an equivalent number of years of formal schooling. TIMSS data complement IEA's Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) conducted at the fourth grade. By participating in TIMSS and PIRLS, countries can have information at regular intervals about how well their students read and what they know and can do in mathematics and science. TIMSS also complements the OECD's Programme for International Student Achievement (PISA), which assesses the mathematics, science, and reading literacy of 15year-olds. With each cycle, TIMSS releases test questions to the public and then replaces these with newly developed questions. To develop the new questions, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center works with representatives from the participating countries to develop items that measure objectives in the frameworks and adhere to the TIMSS guidelines. The items then undergo an extensive review process involving numerous experts in education, mathematics, science, and measurement, including the SMIRC and the NRCs. The items are field tested in each of the participating countries and then reviewed again by SMIRC and the NRCs prior to selection for data collection. The tests contain questions asking students to select appropriate responses or to solve problems and answer questions in formats requiring them to construct their own answers. Beginning in TIMSS 2003, an effort was made to place more emphasis on questions and tasks that offer better insight into students' analytical, problem-solving, and inquiry skills and capabilities. Subsequent to instrument development and production, TIMSS is administered to representative samples of students in the participating countries. An enormous amount of energy is devoted to ensuring high quality data. Attention is given to meeting rigorous standards every step of the way through sampling, translation verification, instrument production, test administration, scoring, database construction and documentation, analysis, scaling, reporting, technical documentation, dissemination of the database, and training in how to use the data for secondary analyses. TIMSS is a major undertaking of the IEA, and together with PIRLS, comprises the core of IEA's regular cycles of studies. IEA has entrusted responsibility for the overall direction and management of the project to its TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College. In carrying out TIMSS, the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center works closely with the IEA Secretariat in Amsterdam on country membership and translations verification, the IEA Data Processing Center in Hamburg on database creation and documentation, Statistics Canada in Ottawa on sampling, and Educational Testing Service in Princeton, New Jersey on the psychometric scaling of the data."}, {"section_title": "What is the value of TIMSS?", "text": "TIMSS helps countries monitor and evaluate their mathematics and science teaching across time and across grades.

They also should be able to relate diversity of characteristics to the survival or extinction of species in changing environments. Students are expected to start considering evidence for the history and"}, {"section_title": "Overview", "text": "Students should be educated to recognize mathematics as an immense achievement of humanity, and to appreciate its nature. Nevertheless, learning mathematics for its own sake is probably not the most compelling reason for universal inclusion of mathematics in school curricula. Prime reasons for having mathematics as a fundamental part of schooling include the increasing awareness that effectiveness as a citizen and success in a workplace are greatly enhanced by knowing and, more important, being able to use mathematics. The number of vocations that demand a high level of proficiency in the use of mathematics, or mathematical modes of thinking, has burgeoned with the advance of technology, and with modern management methods. This chapter contains the framework for the TIMSS 2007 mathematics assessments at the fourth and eighth grades. At both grades, the mathematics assessment framework for TIMSS 2007 is organized around two dimensions, a content dimension specifying the domains or subject matter to be assessed within mathematics (for example, number, algebra, geometry, and data and chance at the eighth grade) and a cognitive dimension specifying the domains or thinking processes to be assessed (that is, knowing, applying, and reasoning). The cognitive domains describe the sets of behaviors expected of students as they engage with the mathematics content. The content and cognitive domains are the foundation of the TIMSS 2007 fourth-and eighth-grade assessments. The content domains differ for the fourth and eighth grades, reflecting the nature and difficulty of the mathematics widely taught at each grade. There is more emphasis on number at the fourth grade than at the eighth grade. At the eighth grade, two of the four content domains are geometry and algebra, but since geometry and algebra generally are not taught as a formal subjects in primary school, the domain assessed at the fourth grade focuses on geometric shapes and measures and introductory algebra concepts are included as part of number. At the fourth grade, the domain pertaining to data focuses on reading and displaying data whereas at eighth grade it includes more emphasis on interpretation of data and the fundamentals of probability (called \"chance\"). The cognitive domains are the same for both grades, encompassing a range of cognitive processes involved in working mathematically and solving problems right through the primary and middle school years. Exhibit 2 shows the target percentages of testing time devoted to each content and cognitive domain for both the fourth-and eighthgrade assessments. Each content domain has several topic areas (i.e., number at eighth grade is further categorized by whole numbers; fractions and decimals; integers; and ratio, proportion, and percent). Each topic area is presented as a list of objectives covered in many participating countries, at either fourth grade or eighth grade as appropriate. The content and cognitive domains for the mathematics assessment are discussed in detail in the following sections. The content domains for the fourth grade are presented first, followed by those for the eighth grade. The cognitive domains, applicable to both grades, then follow. Example mathematics items and tasks are presented in Appendix B.\nIn today's world, some understanding of science is imperative if citizens are to make informed decisions about themselves and the world in which they live. Every day they are faced with a barrage of information, and sifting fact from fiction is possible only if they have the tools to accomplish this. It is important, therefore, to make certain that students leaving high school are equipped with a fundamental understanding of science such that the decisions they make are informed decisions. Students in the early grades have a natural curiosity about the world and their place in it, thus it is appropriate for them to start to learn the basics of science at a young age. This knowledge and understanding should be built upon throughout their schooling so that when as adults they are faced with making decisions that relate to such diverse issues as the treatment of diseases, global warming, and applications of technology, they are able to do so from a sound scientific basis. In parallel with mathematics, the science assessment framework for TIMSS 2007 is organized around two dimensions, a content dimension specifying the domains or subject matter to be assessed within science (for example, biology, chemistry, physics, and Earth science at the eighth grade) and a cognitive dimension specifying the domains or thinking processes to be assessed (that is, knowing, applying, and reasoning). The cognitive domains describe the sets of behaviors expected of students as they engage with the science content. The content and cognitive domains are the foundation of the TIMSS 2007 fourth-and eighth-grade assessments. The content domains differ for the fourth and eighth grades, reflecting the nature and difficulty of the science widely taught at each grade. There is more emphasis at the fourth grade on life science than on its counterpart, biology, at the eighth grade. At the eighth grade, physics and chemistry are assessed as separate content domains, and receive more emphasis than at fourth grade, where they are assessed as one content domain, physical science. The cognitive framework, however, is the same for both grades, encompassing a range of cognitive processes involved in learning science concepts and knowledge and engaging in scientific inquiry right through the primary and middle school years. Exhibit 6 shows the target percentages of testing time devoted to each science content and cognitive domain for the fourth-and eighth-grade assessments. The content and cognitive domains for the science assessment are discussed in detail in the following sections. The content domains for the fourth grade are presented first, followed by those for the eighth grade. The cognitive domains, applicable to both grades, then follow. Example science items and tasks are presented in Appendix C.\nLearning takes place within a context, and not in isolation. There are numerous contextual factors that effect students' learning. For example, type of school, school resources, instructional approaches, teacher characteristics, student attitudes, and home support for learning contribute heavily to student learning and achievement. For a fuller appreciation of what the TIMSS achievement results mean and how they may be used to improve students learning in mathematics and science, it is important to understand the contexts in which students learn. TIMSS in every cycle collects a range of information about these contexts for learning, together with assessing students' performance in mathematics and science. The TIMSS 2007 Contextual Framework encompasses five broad areas on which information is collected: \u2022 Curriculum\nThe TIMSS 2007 international assessment of student achievement comprises written tests in mathematics and science together with a set of questionnaires that gather information on the educational and social contexts for achievement. Central to the TIMSS mission is the measurement of student achievement in mathematics and science in a way that does justice to the breadth and richness of these subjects as they are taught in the participating countries, and that monitors countries' improvement or decline by tracking trends in student performance from one assessment cycle to the next. This requires an assessment that is wide ranging in its coverage of mathematics and science and innovative in its measurement approach. To maximize the information provided to educators and policy makers, TIMSS reports student performance in the major content domains of the subjects (i.e., number, algebra, geometry, and data and chance in mathematics at the eighth grade and biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science in eighth-grade science) as well as performance in mathematics and science overall. In addition, TIMSS in 2007 will for the first time report student achievement by cognitive domain -i.e., knowing, applying, and reasoning. These ambitious coverage and reporting goals make for enormously valuable information for policy decisions, teacher education, and instructional practices, but pose significant challenges for data collection, analysis, and reporting. A major consequence of TIMSS' ambitious assessment goals is that there are many more questions on the assessment than can be answered by a student in the amount of testing time available. Accordingly, TIMSS 2007 uses a matrix-sampling approach that involves packaging the entire assessment pool of mathematics and science questions into a set of 14 student achievement booklets, with each student completing just one booklet. Each question, or item, appears in two booklets, providing a mechanism for linking together the student responses from the various booklets. Booklets are distributed among students in participating classrooms so that the groups of students completing each booklet are approximately equivalent in terms of student ability. Using Item-Response Theory (IRT) scaling techniques, a comprehensive picture of the achievement of the entire student population is"}, {"section_title": "MATHEMATICS FRAMEWORK", "text": "Mathematics Content Domains -Fourth Grade The content domains described in the mathematics framework for the fourth grade and the target percentages of testing time devoted to each are shown below in Exhibit 3.

Like any teaching tool, calculators need to be used appropriately, and policies for their use differ across the TIMSS countries. Also, the availability of calculators varies widely. It would not be equitable to require calculator use when students in some countries may never have used them. Similarly, however, it is not equitable to deprive students of the use of a familiar tool. After considerable debate on the issue, TIMSS 2003 introduced calculator use in the eighth-grade mathematics assessment. For newly developed items, calculators were not required, but were permitted if participating countries wanted to allow their students to use them. Based on a study conducted as part of TIMSS 2003 where the same items were given before the break when calculators were not permitted and in the session after the break when calculators were allowed, it was found that even without specifically planning nearly all the TIMSS mathematics items could be answered just as easily without the use of a calculator. That is, performance was not significantly different with or without a calculator for all except five items. Also, of the students who had calculators (63 percent), the vast majority (47 percent) reported that although they had calculators, they used them very little or not at all. Based on the experience in TIMSS 2003, for TIMSS 2007 eighthgrade students will be permitted to use calculators for the entire assessment. As with previous TIMSS assessments, fourth-grade students will not be permitted to use calculators. The aim of the TIMSS guidelines for calculator use is to give students the best opportunity to operate in settings that mirror their classroom experience. Thus, if students are used to having calculators for their classroom activities, then the country should encourage students to use them during the assessment. On the other hand, if students are not used to having calculators or are not permitted to use them in their daily mathematics lessons, then the country need not permit their use. In developing the new assessment materials, every effort will be made to ensure that the test questions do not advantage or disadvantage students either way -with or without calculators."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics Cognitive Domain -Fourth and Eighth Grades", "text": "To respond correctly to TIMSS test items students need to be familiar with the mathematics content being assessed, but they also need to draw on a range of cognitive skills. Describing these skills plays a crucial role in the development of an assessment like TIMSS 2007, since they are vital in ensuring that the survey covers the appropriate range of cognitive skills across the content domains already outlined. The first domain, knowing, covers the facts, procedures, and concepts students need to know, while the second, applying, focuses on the ability of students to apply knowledge and conceptual understanding to solve problems or answer questions. The third domain, reasoning, goes beyond the solution of routine problems to encompass unfamiliar situations, complex contexts, and multi-step problems. These three cognitive domains are used for both grades, but the balance of testing time differs, reflecting the difference in age and experience of students in the two grades. For fourth and eighth grades, each content domain will include items developed to address each of the three cognitive domains. For example, the number domain will include knowing, applying, and reasoning items as will the other content domains. Exhibit 5 shows the target percentages of testing time devoted to each cognitive domain for both the fourth-and eighth-grade assessments.

The more relevant knowledge a student is able to recall and the wider the range of concepts he or she has understood, the greater the potential for engaging a wide range of problem-solving situations and for developing mathematical understanding. Without access to a knowledge base that enables easy recall of the language and basic facts and conventions of number, symbolic representation, and spatial relations, students would find purposeful mathematical thinking impossible. Facts encompass the factual knowledge that provides the basic language of mathematics, and the essential mathematical facts and properties that form the foundation for mathematical thought. Procedures form a bridge between more basic knowledge and the use of mathematics for solving routine problems, especially those encountered by many people in their daily lives. In essence a fluent use of procedures entails recall of sets of actions and how to carry them out. Students need to be efficient and accurate in using a variety of computational procedures and tools. They need to see that particular procedures can be used to solve entire classes of problems, not just individual problems. Knowledge of concepts enables students to make connections between elements of knowledge that, at best, would otherwise be retained as isolated facts. It allows them to make extensions beyond their existing knowledge, judge the validity of mathematical statements and methods, and create mathematical representations. This cognitive domain covers the following behaviors:\nKnowing refers to students' knowledge base of science facts, information, concepts, tools, and procedures.

Representation of ideas forms the core of mathematical thinking and communication, and the ability to create equivalent representations are fundamental to success in the subject. The problem settings are more routine than those aligned with the reasoning domain. The routine problems will typically have been standard in classroom exercises designed to provide practice in particular methods or techniques. Some of these problems will have been in words that set the problem situation in a quasi-real context. Though they range in difficulty, each of these types of \"textbook\" problems is expected to be sufficiently familiar to students that they will essentially involve selecting and applying learned procedures. Problems may be set in real-life situations, or may be concerned with purely mathematical questions involving, for example, numeric or algebraic expressions, functions, equations, geometric figures, or statistical data sets.

This cognitive domain covers the following behaviors:\nThe questions in this cognitive domain are designed to involve the direct application of knowledge and understanding in straight forward situations. To measure applying, TIMSS 2007 will include items that require students to compare, contrast, and classify, to interpret scientific information in light of a science concept or principle, and to use and apply their understanding of science concepts and principles to find a solution or develop an explanation. Items aligned with this cognitive domain will involve the direct application or demonstration of relationships, equations, and formulas in contexts likely to be familiar in the teaching and learning of science concepts.

They make cognitive demands over and above those needed for solution of routine problems, even when the knowledge and skills required for their solution have been learned. Non-routine problems may be purely mathematical or may have reallife settings. Both types of items involve transfer of knowledge and skills to new situations, and interactions among reasoning skills are usually a feature. Problems requiring reasoning may do so in different ways, because of the novelty of the context or the complexity of the situation or because any solution to the problem must involve several steps, perhaps drawing on knowledge and understanding from different areas of mathematics. Even though of the many behaviors listed within the reasoning domain are those that may be drawn on in thinking about and solving novel or complex problems, each by itself represents a valuable outcome of mathematics education, with the potential to influence learners' thinking more generally. For example, reasoning involves the ability to observe and make conjectures. It also involves making logical deductions based on specific assumptions and rules, and justifying results. This cognitive domain covers the following behaviors:\nReasoning is involved in the more complex tasks related to science. A major purpose of science education is to prepare students to engage in scientific reasoning to solve problems, develop explanations, draw conclusions, make decisions, and extend their knowledge to new situations. In addition to the more direct applications of science concepts exemplified in the applying domain, some problem-solving situations involve unfamiliar or more complicated contexts that require students to reason from scientific principles to provide an answer. Solutions may involve breaking down a problem into component parts, each involving the application of a science concept or relationship. Students may be required to analyze a problem to determine what underlying principles are involved; devise and explain strategies for problem solving; select and apply appropriate equations, formulas, relationships, or analytical techniques; and evaluate their solutions. Correct solutions to such problems may stem from a variety of approaches or strategies, and developing the ability to consider alternative strategies is an important educational goal in the teaching and learning of science. Students may be required to draw conclusions from scientific data and facts, providing evidence of both inductive and deductive reasoning and of an understanding of the investigation of cause and effect. They are expected to evaluate and make decisions, weigh advantages and disadvantages of alternative materials and processes, consider the impact of different scientific endeavors, and evaluate solutions to problems. By the eighth grade, in particular, students should consider and evaluate alternative explanations, extend conclusions to new situations, and justify explanations based on evidence and scientific understanding. Considerable scientific reasoning also is involved in developing hypotheses and designing scientific investigations to test them, and in analyzing and interpreting data. Abilities in this area are introduced at a very basic level in primary school and then further developed throughout students' science education in middle and secondary school. Some items in this cognitive domain may focus on unified concepts and major conceptual themes, requiring students to bring together knowledge and understanding from different areas and apply it to new situations.

As such, students at fourth grade are expected to be able to distinguish between living and nonliving things, compare and contrast physical and behavioral characteristics of major groups of common organisms, and relate body structures of such organisms to their function. Students are expected to know and be able to compare the life cycles of organisms such as the butterfly and frog; however in the areas of reproduction and heredity, knowledge is restricted to a very basic understanding that organisms of the same kind reproduce and that offspring closely resemble their parents. Students are expected to be able to associate physical features and patterns of behavior of plants and animals with the environment in which they live and to provide examples of physical and behavioral characteristics that make some plants and animals better suited to particular environments. Students also should be able to demonstrate a rudimentary knowledge of bodily responses to outside conditions. The study of ecosystems is essential to understanding the interdependence of living organisms and their relationship to the physical environment. Basic concepts related to ecosystems, including energy flow and the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors, are expected to be introduced in the primary school science curriculum. Students' understandings may be demonstrated through descriptions of specific relationships between plants and animals in common ecosystems. Some understanding of the ways in which human behavior can affect the environment also is expected of fourth-grade students, especially in relation to pollution. Finally, fourth-grade students are expected to have a rudimentary knowledge of human health, nutrition, and disease. They should demonstrate familiarity with common communicable diseases and also be able to relate diet and personal habits to their effect on health.\n\nPhysical Science: Electricity and Magnetism 1.

It is important to note, however, that in an international assessment such as TIMSS the organization of science topics into these domains does not correspond to the structure of science instruction in all countries. In many countries, for example, science is taught as general science or integrated science whereas in others science is taught as separate subjects such as biology, physics, and chemistry. Additionally, some of the topics included in the TIMSS 2007 science framework may in some countries be taught in other courses, such as health education, social studies, or geography. The content domains are shown in Exhibit 8 together with the target percentage devoted to each domain. Each content domain has several main topic areas; each of which is presented as a list of objectives covered in the science curriculum in the majority of participating countries. The sections below describe each of the science content domains, give an overview of the topic areas to be covered in each domain, and provide a set of assessment objectives for each topic area. These objectives are written in terms of behaviors to be elicited by items that exemplify the understandings and abilities expected of students at eighth grade.\n\nchanges in Earth's life forms over time by the comparison of living species and fossil records. The study of ecosystems is essential to understanding the interdependence of living organisms and their relationship to the physical environment. At the eighth grade, students should show introductory level understanding of the interdependence between populations of organisms that maintains balance in an ecosystem. They are expected to represent the flow of energy in an ecosystem, recognize the role of organisms in the cycling of materials, and predict the effects of changes in ecosystems. The effect of human activity on ecosystems is an important aspect of understanding the interdependence of living organisms and the environment. Eighth-grade students are expected to demonstrate knowledge of human health, nutrition, and disease.

Describing these skills plays a crucial role in the development of an assessment like TIMSS 2007, since they are vital in ensuring that the survey covers the appropriate range of cognitive skills across the content domains already outlined. This section outlines the skills and abilities associated with the cognitive dimension. The cognitive dimension is divided into three domains based on what students have to know and do when confronting the various items developed for the TIMSS 2007 assessment. The first domain, Knowing, covers facts, procedures, and concepts students need to know, while the second domain, Applying, focuses on the ability of the student to apply knowledge and conceptual understanding in a problem situation. The third domain, Reasoning, goes beyond the solution of routine problems to encompass unfamiliar situations, complex contexts, and multi-step problems. These three cognitive domains are used at both grades, however the percentages vary between fourth and eighth grade in accordance with the increased cognitive ability, maturity, instruction, experience, and breadth and depth of understanding of students at the higher grade level (see Exhibit 9). Thus the percentage of items that involve knowing is higher at the fourth grade while the percentage of items that ask students to engage in reasoning is higher at the eighth grade. For fourth and eighth grades, each content domain will include items developed to address each of the three cognitive domains. For example, the life science content domain will include knowing, applying, and reasoning items, as will the other content domains. While some hierarchy is imposed in the division of behaviors into the three cognitive domains, a range of difficulty levels is expected for items developed for each of the cognitive domains.

The goal of scientific inquiry is to provide explanations of scientific phenomena that help us understand the underlying principles governing the natural world. At the fourth-and eighth-grade level, students are not expected to be formulating and testing fundamental theories, but they should be able to pose scientific questions or hypotheses of limited scope that can be investigated. At these grade levels, scientific inquiry involves students in the process of questioning, planning, and conducting investigations to gather evidence, and formulating explanations based on observations and in light of scientific understanding. The understandings and abilities required to engage in this type of scientific investigation are important in developing citizens who are literate in the methods, processes, and products of science. They are also precursors of the more advanced types of inquiry directed at furthering scientific knowledge that are important in preparing future scientists. Given that the scientific inquiry process is an integral part of learning and doing science, it is important to assess students' understandings and abilities required to engage in this process successfully. Scientific inquiry is treated as an overarching assessment strand in the TIMSS 2007 framework. It overlaps all of the fields of science and has both content-and skills-based components. Assessment of scientific inquiry includes items and tasks requiring students to demonstrate knowledge of the tools, methods, and procedures necessary to do science, to apply this knowledge to engage in scientific investigations, and to use scientific understanding to propose explanations based on evidence. These processes of scientific inquiry promote a broader understanding of science concepts as well as reasoning and problem-solving skills. It is expected that students at both grade levels will possess some general knowledge of the nature of science and scientific inquiry, including the fact that scientific knowledge is subject to change, the importance of using different types of scientific investigations in verifying scientific knowledge, the use of basic \"scientific methods\", communication of results, and the interaction of science, mathematics, and technology. In addition to this general knowledge, students are expected to demonstrate the skills and abilities involved in five major aspects of the scientific inquiry process: These aspects of scientific inquiry are appropriate for both fourthand eighth-grade students, but the understandings and abilities to be demonstrated increase in complexity across grades, reflecting the cognitive development of students. The learning of science in the fourth grade is focused on observing and describing, and students at this level are expected to be able to formulate questions that can be answered based on observations or information obtained about the natural world. To obtain evidence to answer these questions, they should demonstrate a grasp of what constitutes a \"fair test\", and be able to describe and conduct an investigation based on making systematic observations or measurements using simple tools, equipment, and procedures. They also are expected to represent their findings using simple charts and diagrams, apply routine mathematical computations of measured values, identify simple relationships, and briefly describe the results of their investigations. Conclusions drawn from investigations at the fourth grade are expected to be written as an answer to a specific question. By the eighth grade, students should demonstrate a more quantitative and formalized approach to scientific investigation that involves more evaluation and decision-making. They are expected to be able to formulate a hypothesis or prediction based on observation or scientific knowledge that can be tested by investigation. They are expected to demonstrate an understanding of cause and effect and the importance of specifying variables to be controlled and varied in well-designed investigations. They may also be required to make more decisions about the measurements to be made and the equipment and procedures to use. In addition, students at this level are expected to use appropriate terminology, units, precision, format, and scales. They should also demonstrate more advanced data analysis skills in selecting and applying appropriate mathematical techniques and describing patterns in data. Eighth-grade students may be expected to evaluate the results of their investigation with respect to the sufficiency of their data for supporting conclusions that address the question or hypothesis under investigation. The assessment of both fourth-and eighth-grade students' ability to provide explanations based on evidence from scientific investigations provides another measure of their understanding and application of related science concepts. By the eighth grade, it is expected that students will be able to formulate explanations in terms of cause-and-effect relationships between variables and in light of scientific understanding.

The nature and extent of the mathematics and science goals to be attained in school are important to policy makers and curriculum specialists in all countries. Also important is how these goals are kept current in the face of scientific and technological advances, and how the demands and expectations of society and the workplace change. As a related issue, curricular documents can include policies about using technology (e.g., calculators, computers, and the internet) in the schools and classrooms. Although mastery of the subject is a major focus of mathematics and science curricula in most countries, countries differ considerably in how the curriculum specifies that mastery should be achieved. For example, acquiring basic skills, understanding mathematical concepts and principles, applying mathematics to \"real-life\" situations, communicating mathematically, reasoning mathematically and problem solving in novel situations are approaches to teaching mathematics that have been advocated in recent years and are used to varying degrees in CONTEXTUAL FRAMEWORK different countries. 1 In science, focus on the acquisition of basic science facts, the understanding and application of science concepts, emphasis on formulating a hypothesis, designing and conducting investigations to test a hypothesis, and communicating scientific explanations are teaching strategies that are emphasized in some countries more than in others."}, {"section_title": "2", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ORGANIZATION OF THE CURRICULUM", "text": "The way the education system -national, regional, and local -is organized has a significant impact on students' opportunities to learn mathematics and science. At the school level, the relative emphasis on and amount of time specified for mathematics, science, and other subjects up through various grade levels can greatly affect such opportunities. Practices such as tracking, streaming, and setting can expose students to different curricula. In science, teaching the major components of science as separate subjects can result in different experiences for students compared with the science-as-single-subject approach."}, {"section_title": "MONITORING AND EVALUATING THE IMPLEMENTED CURRICULUM", "text": "Many countries have systems in place for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the curriculum and for assessing the status of their education systems.

Further, the sustainability of school computer systems, and the continuity of support staffing may be as important as the acquisition of the computers. The effective and efficient use of computers requires suitable training of teachers, students, and school staff. Use of computers can also be enhanced by providing access to the internet for educational purposes. Factors limiting computer use include the lack of appropriate software and hardware, software not congruent with the curriculum, lack of teacher training and support, and lack of funding for computer repair and maintenance."}, {"section_title": "SCHOOL SOCIAL CLIMATE", "text": "A school's social climate comprises the values, cultures, safety practices, and organizational structures that cause it to function and react in particular ways. Respect for individual students and teachers, a safe and orderly environment, constructive interactions among administrators, teachers, parents, and students all contribute to a positive school climate. A supportive school climate helps to build better morale among teachers and students and that leads to higher student achievement. Although a safe and orderly school environment does not in and of itself guarantee high levels of student achievement, student learning can be more difficult in schools where student discipline is a problem, where students are regularly absent or late to class, or where they fear injury or loss of personal property. For validation purposes, it is important to collect information about school climate as perceived by teachers, students, and principals.

The methods might include the completing of specified courses, passing exams, supervised practical experience, obtaining a university degree, serving a probation period, and completion of an induction program. In some countries there may be alternative methods of being certified, especially in subject areas with a shortage of teachers. The relative emphasis on content knowledge and pedagogic approach of trainee teachers, and how teacher education programs keep abreast of the changes brought about by rapid advances in science and technology, are important features of teacher preparation programs. They employ different teaching methods to prepare teachers to teach their subject matter and to enable them to become broadly educated, reflective, professional educators. Developing a lifelong positive attitude toward learning also may be an important facet of teacher education.

There is evidence to show that multiple layers of access to the internet, for example at schools, in libraries, and at home, is important. For countries in which students do have ready access to the internet, it is important that they be taught how to use the information, and how to evaluate its truth or worth. Besides giving students access to the internet, computers can serve a number of other educational purposes. While initially limited to learning drills and practice, they are now used in a variety of ways including tutorials, simulations, games, and applications.

As in the TIMSS 2003 assessment, TIMSS 2007 has 28 blocks in total, 14 containing mathematics items and 14 containing science items. Student booklets were assembled from various combinations of these item blocks. Following the 2003 assessment, half of the mathematics blocks and half of the science blocks were secured for use in measuring trends in 2007. The remaining blocks were released into the public domain for use in publications, research, and teaching, to be replaced by newlydeveloped items in the TIMSS 2007 assessment. Accordingly, the 28 blocks in the TIMSS 2007 assessment comprise 14 blocks of trend items (seven mathematics and seven science) and 14 blocks of new items developed for 2007. As shown in Exhibit 10, the TIMSS 2007 mathematics blocks are labeled M01 through M14 and the science blocks S01 through S14. Blocks with labels ending in odd numbers (01, 03, 05, etc.) contain the trend items from the 2003 assessment, and those ending in even numbers the new items developed for use for the first time in TIMSS 2007. Although the general arrangement of items into blocks follows the 2003 approach, based on experience from that assessment the estimated amount of time needed by students to complete a block was increased -from 15 to 22.5 minutes at eighth grade and from 12 to 18 at fourth grade. Consequently, the 28 blocks of eighth-grade items contain an estimated 10\u00bd hours of testing time and the fourth-grade blocks, almost 8\u00bd hours. From past experience with TIMSS, National Research Coordinators from participating countries agreed that the testing time for any one student should not be increased from previous assessments. Thus, as in the past, the assessment time for each student booklet had to fit into 90 minutes for eighth grade and 72 minutes for fourth grade. An additional 30 minutes for a student questionnaire also was planned at each grade level."}, {"section_title": "TIMSS 2007 Block Design for Student Achievement Booklets", "text": "In choosing how to distribute assessment blocks across student achievement booklets, the major goal was to maximize coverage of the framework while ensuring that every student responded to sufficient items to provide reliable measurement of trends in both mathematics and science. A further goal was to ensure that trends in the mathematics and science content areas could be measured reliably. To enable linking among booklets while keeping the number of booklets to a minimum, each block appears in two booklets. In the TIMSS 2007 design, the 28 assessment blocks are distributed across 14 student achievement booklets (see Exhibit 11). The same booklet design is used at both fourth and eighth grade, although the eighth-grade blocks contains 22.5 minutes of assessment items and the fourth grade blocks 18 minutes. Each student booklet consists of four blocks of items, two blocks of mathematics items and two of science items. In half of the booklets, the mathematics blocks come first, followed by the science blocks, and in the other half the order is reversed. Additionally, two of the blocks in each booklet contain trend items from 2003 and two contain items newly developed for TIMSS 2007. For example, as may be seen from Exhibit 11, students assigned Booklet 1 complete two blocks of mathematics items, M01 and M02, and two blocks of science items, S01 and S02. The items in blocks M01 and S01 are trend items from TIMSS 2003, while those in M02 and S02 are items new for TIMSS 2007. Similarly, students assigned Booklet 2 complete two science blocks, S02 and S03, followed by two mathematics blocks, M02 and M03. S02 and M02 contain the new items and S03 and M03 the trend items. As summarized in Exhibit 12, each student completes one student achievement booklet in two parts, followed by a student questionnaire. The individual student response burden for the assessment is similar to TIMSS in 2003, i.e., 72 minutes for the assessment and 30 minutes for the questionnaire at fourth grade, and 90 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively, at eighth grade. Countries participating in TIMSS aim for a sample of at least 4,500 students to ensure that there are enough respondents for each item. The 14 student booklets are distributed among the students in each sampled class according to a predetermined order, so that approximately equal proportions of students respond to each booklet."}, {"section_title": "Question Types and Scoring Procedures", "text": "Students' knowledge and understanding of mathematics and science are assessed through a range of questions in each subject. Two question formats are used in the TIMSS assessment -multiple-choice and constructed-response. At least half of the total number of points represented by all the questions will come from multiple-choice questions. Each multiple-choice question is worth one score point. Constructed-response questions generally are worth one or two score points, depending on the nature of the task and the skills required to complete it. However, building on the TIMSS 2003 special initiative to develop problem solving and inquiry tasks (known as PSIs) funded by the US National Science Foundation, TIMSS 2007 will have extended reasoning tasks or item sets of related problems. In particular, these reasoning tasks address the thinking skills described in the reasoning cognitive domain in the mathematics and science frameworks, respectively. For the reasoning tasks or item sets, the number of possible points, typically three to six points, depends on the requirements for students to successfully complete the task. In developing assessment questions, the choice of item format depends on the mathematics or science being assessed, and the format that best enables students to demonstrate their proficiency. Multiple-Choice Questions. Multiple-choice questions provide students with four response options, of which only one is correct. These questions can be used to assess any of the behaviors in the cognitive domains. However, because they do not allow for students' explanations or supporting statements, multiple-choice questions may be less suitable for assessing students' ability to make more complex interpretations or evaluations. In assessing fourth-and eighth-grade students, it is important that linguistic features of the questions be developmentally appropriate. Therefore, the questions are written clearly and concisely. The response options also are written succinctly in order to minimize the reading load of the question. The options that are incorrect are written to be plausible, but not deceptive. For students who may be unfamiliar with this test question format, the instructions given at the beginning of the test include a sample multiple-choice item that illustrates how to select and mark an answer. Constructed-Response Questions. For this type of test item students are required to construct a written response, rather than select a response from a set of options. Constructed-response questions are particularly well-suited for assessing aspects of knowledge and skills that require students to explain phenomena or interpret data based on their background knowledge and experience. The scoring guide for each constructed-response question describes the essential features of appropriate and complete responses. The guides focus on evidence of the type of behavior the question assesses. They describe evidence of partially correct and completely correct responses. In addition, sample student responses at each level of understanding provide important guidance to those who will be rating the students' responses. In scoring students' responses to constructed-response questions, the focus is solely on students' achievement with respect to the topic being assessed, not on their ability to write well. However, students need to communicate in a manner that will be clear to those scoring their responses. In addition, scoring guides are designed to enable, for each item, identification of the various successful, partially successful, and TIMSS in 1995TIMSS in , 1999TIMSS in , or 2003 to track their progress in mathematics achievement, and a comparable science scale provides the same information for science. At the fourth grade, the TIMSS 2007 mathematics and science scales link to 1995 and 2003 but not 1999, since the TIMSS 1999 assessment did not include fourth grade. In addition to the achievement scales for mathematics and science, TIMSS constructs scales for reporting student performance in each of the mathematics and science content domains.
