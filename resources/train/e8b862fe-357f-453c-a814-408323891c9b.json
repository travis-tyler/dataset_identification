While Barnett et al. report that over half of all 4 year olds attend public preschools in 9 states, a number of states still invest very little in early education. In the South, however, a number of states have chosen to place a high priority in expanding preschool access by funding large-scale public programs. The state of Georgia was the first in the U.S. to offer state-funded pre-kindergarten to all students regardless of income.\nTheir program began in 1993 and is funded by the state lottery. More recently, other states have created public pre-kindergarten programs. Some of the southern states include Florida, West Virginia, and South Carolina. Not all programs are of equal quality, however, and early childhood researchers specifically have noted concerns about the quality of programs like Florida's that satisfy relatively few quality standards thought be important by early education researchers (Barnett et al.) The details of various state initiatives including expenditures, eligibility and program quality characteristics are described in annual reports published by the National Institute on Early Education and Research.\nDespite the fact that preschool programs for four year olds are the fastest growing category of public spending on education (Barnett and Yaroszref) , children from lower-income families and children from rural areas are less likely to participate in early education programs.\nThere are important consequences for children and schools that are relevant for policymakers and residents of rural areas. First, some children who enter elementary school not ready for school end up struggling throughout their educational career with lower achievement and a higher probability of high school dropout. This results in lower earnings for these children in adulthood and also may generate social costs. Research from longitudinal studies of high-quality preschool programs provided to children from economically-disadvantaged children indicates that these interventions generate significant social benefits in terms of higher earnings of participants, higher tax revenues, and lower costs to the public for criminal behavior and income support programs (Temple and Reynolds; Heckman and Masterov) .\nSecond, poor school readiness increases schooling costs through higher rates of grade repetition and increases in higher special education spending (Temple and Reynolds) . Local school districts bear a significant portion of these school remediation costs, which can result in higher local property taxes and adverse consequences for school quality as financial resources that could be used to reduce class sizes or provide higher salaries to teachers are used to address the consequences of early learning difficulties (e.g., Belfield).\nVariation in preschool.enrollment rates between rural and nonrural areas Information from a nationally-representative data set on childhood called the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study -Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) are used to investigate differences in early education participation before kindergarten entry. The ECLS-K data have been used in a number of studies of the achievement of elementary education students in the early years of formal schooling. Parents are asked at kindergarten entry about the education and care arrangements that were made for the child in the year before kindergarten in 1998. The findings reported in this study incorporate geocoded information on the local of individual students by census tract from the restricted version of the ECLS-K data to examine the variation across rural and nonrural areas in early education enrollment.\nAlthough the public access version of the ECLS-K data set contains some information on rural locations, this public information comes from a general question asked to a school district administrator about the rural, suburban, or urban location of the school district. The restricted data allows the rurality indicators to be measured based on characteristics of the census tract in which each student resides. Cromartie and Bucholtz discuss various ways of describing rurality.\nHere the rural-urban codes created by the Economic Research Service of the USDA are employed (USDA 2005) . These RUCA (Rural Urban Commuting Area) Codes range from 1-10 and delineate metropolitan and nonmetropolitan census tracts based on location within urbanized areas, small towns, and rural areas following the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) definitions of urban and rural places. Instead of designating rural areas at the county level, the RUCA codes utilize information on commuting patterns within a census tract to better delineate the rurality of each location based on labor market commuting patterns between rural and nearby urban areas. In the estimation reported below, the rural designation is assigned to census tracts given a RUCA code of 4 -10.\nInterestingly, the subjective rural designation made by the school administrator for the district as a whole generates a slightly higher count of rural students in the data set. Using the sample of 14,539 used in the analyses below and using the sampling weights provided in the ECLS-K data set, 20% of students were considered rural using the school administrator's definition while just under 18% of the students are considered rural using the RUCA codes based on census tracts. This similarity in means masks the actual differences between the two measures. When looking more closely at the data to see how the two measures match up, it turns out that 30% of the students are assigned different rural indicators under the two measurement schemes. This current paper appears to be the first to illustrate rural/nonrural differences in preschool participation using student-level census tract information rather than the subjective district-level designation provided in the public use data. A recent publication by Grace et al. containing analyses of various rural vs. nonrural differences in education outcomes and student and school characteristics employs the public use definition of rural as provided by the school adminstrator. Table 1 highlights some differences across rural and nonrural children in their participation in early childhood education programs in the year before kindergarten. From a larger set of parental responses to questions about early education and child care decisions, I created five categories of early education and care. These categories are mutually exclusive, so that the proportions across each row sum to one. The categories of preschool or childcare center or prekindergarten include children who participated in these programs at least twice a week. In total, 18% of the children had participated in pre-kindergarten programs while another 47% had either enrolled in preschool or attended a child care center. Another 10% participated in the federallyfunded Head Start preschool program. The children included in parental care only or relative or nonrelative home care (including home-based daycares) did not participate in preschool (at all or more than once a week.). Because this information came from parental reports, it is possible that there is some overlap between pre-kindergarten and preschool and between preschool and enrollment in a childcare center. Pre-kindergarten programs differ from regular preschool in that pre-kindergarten often is offered by public school systems, but is it possible that some parents do not distinguish between the two terms. For this research, pre-kindergarten was kept distinct from preschool because of the great variation across regions in the availability of the former and the importance of pre-k programs in recent state policy initiatives. At the same time, the decision was made to merge the categories of preschool with daycare center because many daycare centers offer some preschool-like programming for four year olds.\nAdding the last two columns together in each row gives a measure of the proportion of children who did not participate in an early education program in the year before kindergarten.\nThis amount is 25% for all U.S. children. There is notable regional variation. The proportion of children with no early education experience before entering kindergarten is significantly higher for children in rural and remote rural areas (31 and 32%) and slightly higher (34%) for remote children in low-income families. Across regions, both the rural West and South have higher rates (36 and 31%) of rural children having no participation in formal early education settings. Table 1 also provides information on rural gaps in preschool participation by family income and by maternal education. The income variable used in this study is an income-to-needs ratio which takes into account family income and the size of the household and compares that to the level of income that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggests is required to avoid poverty. This income-to-needs ratio is commonly used to represent family income in studies based on ECLS-K data (e.g., Fryer and Levitt; Magnuson et al.) . For rural students living in families in the lowest quartile of the income-to-needs ratio, 31% enter kindergarten without a preschool education. Using the most remote and isolated definition of rurality based on census tracts with a RUCA code of 10, it can be seen that 34% of those students enter kindergarten without prior preschool participation. Because only 2% of the sample live in these remote rural areas, the remainder of the analysis focuses on the broader definition of rural (with RUCA codes 4-10). Maternal education makes a difference in enrollment decisions as mothers with college degrees are more likely to enroll their children in preschool regardless of rural status. Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the explanatory variables that will be used to estimate the determinants of the early education and care decision in the year before kindergarten and shows how these factors differ across rural and nonrural students. The variables that are used to explain why some students get an early formal education and why some do not include family income, child gender, a series of race and ethnicity indicators, and parent and family characteristics. As will be explained below, some of these explanatory variables are considered as risk factors for low school readiness and other variables reflect the families need for child care.\nThere are statistically significant rural/nonrural differences for the majority of explanatory variables. Note that the omitted category for race is White and the omitted category for region is West.\nThe determinants of the various early education and care decisions are estimated using a multinomial logit model that considers each of the five unordered choices (Greene) . For the ith individual, yi is the observed early education or care outcome out of a total of J possibilities.\nAssuming that the J choices are numbered 0 -5, the model can be written as:\n( 1) Pr(y i = j) = exp(X i B j )/(1 + \u2211 j J Exp(X i B j )) for j = 1,2,3,4 and\nThe objective is to estimate the unknown parameters contained in Bj. The equations that are estimated provide the probabilities for the set of five choices for a family with characteristics described in the vector X i . Some of these covariates represent maternal and family characteristics that often predict poorer school performance. Maternal characteristics such as low levels of education, teenager at birth of child, unmarried status, and a large number of other children in the home are frequently used to construct risk indices for child wellbeing and school performance (e.g., Temple and Reynolds; Magnuson et al.) . Policymakers may find it important to understand how early education decisions are correlated with these characteristics as the consequences of not participating in early education before kindergarten are likely to be more serious for students from more disadvantaged backgrounds. Additional variables such as maternal work experience, the presence of other adults in the home, and relationships with grandparents help explain the need for different types of childcare. Table 3 contains results from the multinomial logit estimation of the factors associated with the parents' choice among the five early education and care options. The estimates reported in the table are the average of the marginal effects for each individual child. These marginal effects sum to zero across the row as they show the effect of a one unit change in a regressor on the various choice probabilities for the five possible outcomes. As in the previous tables, the data were weighted by the appropriate sample weight so that the sample is representative of all US children entering kindergarten. The first row shows that there are clear rural/nonrural differences in early education and care experiences for U.S. children. Compared to nonrural children, children in rural areas are less likely to participate in pre-kindergarten but somewhat more likely to participate be enrolled at least twice a week in a regular preschool or childcare center.\nSpecifically, rural children have almost a 12 percentage point lower probability of enrolling in a pre-kindergarten program. They have a 3.8 percentage point higher probability of being in parental care only. Overall, rural children are more likely than nonrural children to have no participation in formal early learning programs as they are more likely to be taken care of by relatives or others in home daycares or by their own parents. Children from higher income families are more likely to be enrolled in pre-kindergarten.\nMaternal education is a strong predictor of early care and education decisions. Consistent with the mean differences reported in Table 2 , the results of this multivariate analysis indicate that children with more highly-educated mothers are more likely to have participated in preschool programs before kindergarten entry. Children of mothers' with a college degree have a 7\npercentage point lower probability of being in parental care only in the year before kindergarten.\nImportantly, children with college-educated mothers have a 25 percentage point higher rate of participation in a preschool or child care center program. Given that even without preschool experience maternal education is known to be a predictor of school readiness, this suggests that the unequal distribution of early education and care participation experiences may serve to exacerbate gaps in school readiness for children with college vs. non-college educated mothers.\nWorking mothers appear to be more likely to have children who are taken care of by relatives or by others in a home-based daycare. For mothers who indicated that they had worked at least at some point during the child's first 5 years, they have a 10.6 percentage point higher probability of relying on non-center based care\nSignificant regional differences exist as children residing in both the Midwest and the South are more likely to participate in early education programs. Compared to children residing in the western part of the United States, children in both of these regions are more likely to participate in pre-kindergarten programs and are less likely to be taken care of solely by parents or by others in home daycare settings. In the South, for example, children have a 2.4 percentage point lower probability of receiving parental care only. In both the South and the Midwest, children are more likely to participate in pre-kindergarten programs."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Early education experiences can benefit children by improving school readiness and fostering both cognitive and noncognitive skills that may ultimately have an impact on educational attainment and economic wellbeing (Heckman) . While most of the research on the longer-term benefits of early education have focused on urban children, certainly children residing in rural areas could also be expected to benefit from good quality early education programs. The quality of rural schools could also improve as fewer children enter school requiring costly remediation. This paper examines differences in early education and child care decisions for children in the year before kindergarten In addition to establishing the existence of rural gaps in participation rates in various types of preschool and care settings, this research demonstrates how early education decisions vary by various family socioeconomic characteristics. Both rural children and children with less educated mothers are less likely overall to participate in preschool programs in the year before kindergarten.\nIn addition to providing benefits to students and to local schools, investments in early education for rural students could potentially serve as an engine for local economic development.\nPolicies to promote human capital investments for young children have caught the attention of the business community both nationally and at the state level because of the possibility that early education investments may promote the productivity of firms and ultimately lower taxes. Taking into account the social benefits of crime reduction, higher tax revenues, and lower reliance on government transfer programs found in a long-term follow up of the well-known Perry Preschool program that was offered to disadvantaged youth in the 1960s, Rolnick and Grunewald estimate the internal rate of return from investments in the high-quality preschool program to be over 15%.\nEconomic development researchers have started to consider preschool investments as part of a portfolio of possible development tools. At the state level, Bartik compares the effectiveness of preschool investments to traditional development subsidies. He claims that both types of state government development strategies can increase state earnings, but from a national perspective preschool investments are more likely to be effective in increasing total earnings. Unlike with preschool investments, a sizeable portion of the benefits from state-level business subsidies arises from labor and capital merely moving from one state to another. Of course, expansion of early education and care programs also offers additional economic development benefits through facilitating greater labor force participation by women (Warner) .\nWhile the general importance of education to rural economic development has been discussed by various researchers (Beaulieu and Gibbs; Gibbs; and Kilkenny and Johnson.) , some difficulties exist in making the case for increased public investments in rural preschool programs.\nWhile policies that increase access to high quality early education programs in rural areas may in general improve lessen the adverse consequences of rural poverty, improve the quality of rural schools, and help attract and retain desirable employers and skilled workers, long-term studies of the effects of preschool reveal that a large source of the high rate of return for preschool consists of reduction in social costs of crimes, higher earnings for program participants, and higher tax receipts resulting from these higher earnings (Temple and Reynolds) . Given the nature of the positive externalities resulting from these investments in human capital, there may not be an incentive for a particular rural community or school district to invest in preschool education programs. To the extent that a significant portion of the benefits of early education are not realized until the preschool participants reach adulthood, the existence of significant population mobility (especially for more educated rural residents) makes it unlikely that any single rural community would be able to recover enough of the future benefits to cover the upfront costs.\nHence early education policies are more appropriately made by states or by the federal government.\nAs more data become available on early education participation, more research is needed to see how the access of preschool programs for rural children has changed in recent years given the increases in state-funded preschool programs offered in many states. More recent data are becoming available soon from a younger cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study who were born in 2001. The 2010 Census of the Population also will contain detailed information about preschool participation. Because of the accessibility issues for rural children, especially those in more remote locations, it is possible that expansions in state-funded preschool programs may widen existing rural gaps in participation if states find it easier to serve urban and suburban students.
