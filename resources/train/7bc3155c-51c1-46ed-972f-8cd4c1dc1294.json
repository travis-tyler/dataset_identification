[{"section_title": "", "text": "T here is accumulating evidence that the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are preceded by a long preclinical phase in which pathologic protein aggregation occurs in the brain (1) (2) (3) (4) . \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) plaques are estimated to develop $15-20 years before the onset of cognitive impairment, and neurofibrillary tangles begin to accumulate at least 5 years before symptom onset (2, 3) . Substantial neurodegeneration is apparent in mildly symptomatic individuals (1) . These observations, together with the failure of clinical trials in symptomatic individuals, illustrate the urgent need for additional biomarkers that characterize the preclinical stage of disease and enable treatment before the brain undergoes irreversible neurologic damage (2) (3) (4) .\nAnalytes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) reflect the brain proteome and are a rich source of biomarkers. The levels of A\u03b2 42 , tau, and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau 181 ) in CSF are related to AD by their association with the presence of A\u03b2 plaques deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal cell death (5) (6) (7) (8) . Similarly, changes in CSF Visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1), a neuronal calcium-sensor protein employed as a marker of neuronal injury (2, 9) , and chitinase 3-like 1 (cartilage glycoprotein-39; YKL-40), an inflammatory biomarker (10) , have also been associated with AD. Additionally, both ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio and YKL-40-A\u03b2 42 ratio have been shown to be strong predictors of conversion from cognitively normal to very mild to mild cognitive impairment over a 3-to 4-year period (1, 10, 11) . Despite this evidence, there is a need for additional biomarkers to identify and characterize the \"preclinical\" stage (pathology present with cognition intact) of the disease and to track the effectiveness of therapies. A challenge for clinical trials is to identify a target population of individuals with a high risk for converting from cognitively normal to impaired over a relatively short period of time. At the present time, elevated ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio is used in some clinical trials to select such individuals. Other predictive biomarkers are needed both for the selection of patient cohorts for clinical trials and for monitoring disease progression and the success of disease-modifying treatment outcomes. Ultimately, biomarkers will enable early intervention in individuals before they present with symptoms, with the goal of delaying the onset or preventing the cognitive decline seen in AD before the brain is irreversibly injured (2) .\nTwo features of AD result in misclassification of subjects and severely reduce the power of traditional clinical measures in the search for novel biomarkers: 1) 30% of cognitively normal individuals show Alzheimer's-type neuropathology by age 75 years (2, 3, 12, 13) , and 2) current clinical diagnostic methods are only 83% accurate as defined by neuropathologic confirmation at autopsy (14) . To identify new CSF analytes associated with AD, we took a novel approach by developing a quantitative measure of \"caseness,\" employing the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b242 ratio as an endophenotype for AD. This status-independent criterion avoids the misclassification of controls and cases and is a continuous quantitative trait. Both of these characteristics improve the power of this approach over traditional clinical measures."}, {"section_title": "Methods and Materials", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "In participants enrolled in the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Knight-ADRC; N \u00bc 311), diagnosis was based on criteria from the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (15) .

Analytes were log-transformed to approximate a normal distribution, and outliers were removed. The associations with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio were tested using linear regression models, adjusting for age at lumbar puncture (LP); sex; and APOE genotype, encoded as five levels based on the genetic risk (\u03b522 \u00bc 0; \u03b523 \u00bc 1; \u03b533 \u00bc 2; \u03b524 \u00bc 3; \u03b534 \u00bc 4; and \u03b544 \u00bc 5). For analyses using the combined datasets, we included study as a covariate. We used two approaches to correct for the multiple testing associated with examining 64 analytes: Bonferroni correction and simpleM. For 64 tests, the Bonferroni corrected p value corresponding to p \u00bc .05 is p \u00bc 7.81E-04. Because this method is most likely too conservative given the correlation structure of the analyte measurements, we also extended and applied the simpleM method (22) Table 1C was obtained by selecting the subset of analytes identified as significant in each study (Table 1A ,B). We constrained this list to the analytes that were also significant (p \u03fd 5.0E-2) when the identified models were applied to the other study. The principal component analysis was performed in R running the method prcomp (package stats, v2.14.1). The random forest results were obtained executing the function randomForest (implemented in the package randomForest, v4.6-6) to grow 1000 trees, and the importance measure was calculated by the mean decrease in accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 Ratio Confers More Statistical Power to Identify CSF Analytes Associated with AD We first evaluated the statistical power of the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio measure compared with the CDR at LP, using CSF levels of VILIP-1 (9) and YKL-40 (10), which had previously been measured and shown to be associated with CDR and CDR-sum of boxes in the Knight-ADRC study (11, 20, 23) . The CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio was previously shown to be a strong predictor of both the conversion of cognitively normal subjects to very mild or mild dementia (11) and the rate of decline across time in individuals with very mild dementia (24) . The CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio is strongly associated with CDR at LP (p \u00bc 5.05E-16).\nWe employed linear regression models to analyze the association of CSF VILIP-1 with the log-transformed levels of CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio and observed a much stronger association than with CDR (p \u00bc 3.18E-17 vs. p \u00bc 3.80E-05). The CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio remained more powerful than CDR even when converted to a dichotomous variable using two partitioning criteria. First, we split the subjects by the median value of CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio; second, we compared the subjects from the upper tercile to the lower two terciles (intended to resemble the CDR distribution of the Knight-ADRC series). Both logistic models that included the CSF ratio showed much stronger associations (p \u00bc 7.11E-08 and p \u00bc 4.00E-09, respectively) than the CDR model (p \u00bc 3.80E-05).\nSimilarly, the association of YKL-40 with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio was stronger than CDR (p \u00bc 8.99E-09 vs. p \u00bc 7.76E-04, respectively). We also tested the normal quantile transformed CSF ratio and the same two dichotomous representations for YKL-40. In every case, the test that included the CSF ratio was more statistically significant than the CDR model (p \u00bc 9.42E-06 and p \u00bc 3.04E-05 partitioning by the median tercile and by the upper tercile, respectively). Together, these analyses provide a strong rationale for our subsequent use of the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio for novel biomarker discovery.\nCorrelation Structure of CSF Analytes. We applied stringent quality criteria to the CSF analyte measurements, selecting only analytes that were measurable in \u03fe90% of the subjects in each series (N \u00bc 311 for the Knight-ADRC series and N \u00bc 293 for the ADNI series). This criterion was met by 64 CSF analytes.\nAnalysis of the correlation matrix for the combined measurements of both datasets showed clear patterns in the analyte levels (Table S2 in Supplement 2). The hierarchical clustering method identified 10 clusters containing 48 of the CSF analytes, with a within-cluster correlation r 2 \u03fe .50. Six clusters included 2 analytes, and the other four clusters included 3, 4, 9, and 20 analytes ( Figure S1 in Supplement 1). The remaining 16 CSF analytes showed only weak correlations to other analytes in the dataset (mean r 2 \u00bc .16, and maximum r 2 \u00bc .35). CSF Analytes Associated with ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 Ratio. Next, we tested for association between each of the CSF analytes and the ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio. There were 13 analytes that were significantly associated with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio (p \u03fd 1.0E-3) and exhibited the same direction of effect in the Knight-ADRC and the ADNI series (Table 2; see Table S3 in Supplement 1 for the complete list of the analytes evaluated). Of these CSF analytes, 11 showed a mean r 2 \u00bc .58 with each other (Figure 1 ), whereas the other two, Sortilin (SORT1) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand R3 (TRAIL-R3), exhibited a slightly lower correlation (r 2 \u00bc .49 and r 2 \u00bc .48, respectively) ( Figure 1 ). In both series, CSF heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) was the most significantly associated analyte (p \u00bc 4.77E-18 for Knight-ADRC and p \u00bc 7.40E-18 for ADNI) and was associated with higher levels of H-FABP in individuals with CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratios indicative of AD (Figure 2A ). The regression coefficients for the two studies (Table 2) \nTo investigate whether these associations were apparent in individuals without dementia and individuals with dementia, we combined the subjects from both studies and stratified them by the presence or absence of cognitive impairment. There were 236 subjects with a CDR \u03fe 0 and low CSF A\u03b2 42 levels, which we employed as a proxy for brain A\u03b2 42 deposition (16) (cutoff \u00bc 500 pg/mL for the Knight-ADRC study and 192 pg/mL for the ADNI study). To evaluate the impact of A\u03b2 42 deposition, we further stratified the 300 cognitively normal subjects (CDR \u00bc 0) by CSF A\u03b2 42 levels, distinguishing the 192 \"clean\" controls from the 105 preclinical subjects with lower CSF A\u03b2 42 levels. Each of the 13 CSF analytes was significantly associated (p \u03fd 5.0E-4) in every stratum (Table 3 ). The analysis of covariance analysis revealed that the effect size for CSF H-FABP was significantly lower in controls compared with the inferred preclinical and clinically assessed cognitively impaired individuals (p \u00bc 4.44E-04 and p \u00bc 5.87E-03) and that there was no significant difference in the effect observed in the preclinical and symptomatic cases ( Figure 3) ; this is Stepwise optimization in (A) the Knight-ADRC study and (B) the ADNI study. (C) A minimal model that includes the analytes commonly selected in the Knight-ADRC study and the ADNI study.\nACE, angiotensinogen; ADNI, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; ANGPT2, angiopoietin 2; APOA, apolipoprotein A; CXCL9, CXC motif chemokine ligand 9'; FasL, Fas ligand; H-FABP, heart, fatty acid binding protein; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; Knight-ADRC, Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center; MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor; SAP, serum amyloid P; TNFRII, tumor necrosis factor receptor two; TRAILR3, TRAIL receptor 3; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. reflected in the different levels of CSF H-FABP among the strata. Although H-FABP levels distinguish cognitively impaired individuals from preclinical AD (p \u00bc 5.05E-03), the levels of H-FABP are not significantly different in preclinical individuals compared with clean controls, indicating that early A\u03b2 plaque deposition does not affect the association of CSF H-FABP with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio. The association of these analytes with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio is robust to the presence of clinically assessed cognitively impaired individuals with uncharacteristic high levels of CSF A\u03b2 42 (Table S4 in Supplement 1). In contrast, the plasma levels of these analytes were not significantly associated with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio (p \u03fe .05) in either the Knight-ADRC series or the ADNI series (consistent with the null correlation between the CSF and plasma levels of each analyte) (Table S5 in Supplement 1)."}, {"section_title": "CSF H-FABP Is Associated with ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 Ratio", "text": "To determine whether each of the novel analytes provided independent information to predict the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio, we combined the subjects from both studies and evaluated joint models that included CSF H-FABP and other CSF analytes from the candidate set, one at a time. Only hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) remained significant after inclusion of CSF H-FABP in the model (p \u00bc 8.56E-06) ( Table S6 in Supplement 1).\nIt has been reported previously that CSF APOE, which is also associated with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio (Table 2) , is associated with AD (17) . To determine whether the previously reported association of CSF APOE levels with CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio is independent of the other analytes, we extended the models to include CSF APOE. Only CSF angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) and CSF angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) showed a decrease in the significance of their association (p \u00bc 3.53E-03 and p \u00bc 3.34E-02), whereas the other CSF analytes remained significant (p \u03fd 1.0E-3) (Table S6 in Supplement 1), indicating they are capturing additional information. Similarly, the joint analysis of CSF H-FABP and VILIP-1 (9) or YKL-40 (10) demonstrated that CSF H-FABP provides nonredundant information to the predictive model for CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio (Supplement 1).\nTo determine whether CSF H-FABP levels were a strong predictor of future conversion to CDR \u03fe 0, we compared the Table 2 for analytes and their expansions.\nassociation of CSF H-FABP levels with CDR at LP and CDR after a mean of 4 years following LP. We tested the association of CSF H-FABP with CDR at LP and found that it was significantly associated in the ADNI study but marginally associated in the Knight-ADRC study (p \u00bc 1.55E-04 and p \u00bc 8.66E-02, respectively) ( Figure 2B ). We also evaluated the association with the latest available evaluation of CDR (mean elapsed years, 4.29; SD, 2.30 years) and found it to be significant for the Knight-ADRC study (p \u00bc 3.72E-03; 36 converted from CDR \u00bc 0 to CDR \u03fe 0) and for the ADNI study (p \u00bc 6.17E-05; mean elapsed years, 3.90; SD, 1.92 years). We observed a similar trend when we analyzed the CDRsum of boxes (25) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (26) . In the ADNI study, H-FABP levels were strongly associated with both endophenotypes at LP and the latest available evaluations, whereas in the Knight-ADRC study, H-FABPH levels were significantly associated (p \u03fd .05) only for the latest evaluations (Table  S7 in Supplement 1).\nTo test whether the messenger RNA expression of H-FABP is also associated with CDR, we measured the messenger RNA levels in parietal lobe tissue from 112 subjects (73 AD cases and 39 controls) (27) We investigated whether multivariate models would detect analytes that did not show strong evidence of association in single-analyte models. Our approach included a discovery phase in which we made use of stepwise regression analysis to optimize a multivariate model for the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio in one of the datasets, which was followed by a replication phase, in which the model was applied in the second dataset. The multivariate model optimized for the Knight-ADRC dataset (Table 1A) showed an increased R 2 (.14 for the discovery set and .12 for the ADNI study). It included H-FABP and HGF as well as CSF vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), thrombomodulin, and adiponectin (Table 1A) . The model optimized for the ADNI dataset (Table 1B ) also increased the R 2 for both datasets (.20 and .08 for the ADNI and the Knight-ADRC dataset, respectively). This model also selected H-FABP, HGF, VEGF, and MIF. We constructed a multivariate model with these four analytes and observed that all of them remained significantly associated with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio in the two datasets (Table 1C) , reflecting an increased goodness of fit for the model (increment of R 2 \u00bc .08 for the Knight-ADRC dataset and increment of R 2 \u00bc .09 for the ADNI dataset). To evaluate whether the correlation among the analytes produced spurious results, we applied principal component analysis to these selected analytes and evaluated a multivariate model with the values rotated. We found that all of them remained significant (p \u03fd .05), indicating that these analytes provide additional information regardless of their correlation.\nIn the single-analyte analysis, CSF MIF levels show a trend toward association with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b242 ratio (Table S3 in Supplement 1). Although CSF VEGF is mildly positively associated in the single-analyte analysis (Table S3 in Supplement 1), it has a negative effect in the multivariate model. The stratified analysis revealed that the change of direction occurs only in the cases ( Figure S2 in Supplement 1).\nThe random forest method was also used to analyze these datasets, and it also highlighted the importance of H-FABP, MIF, HGF, and VEGF. These analytes are among the top six for the Knight-ADRC dataset. The analytes H-FABP, HGF, and MIF are among the top eight analytes for the ADNI dataset (Table S8 in Supplement 1)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The goal of this study was to identify novel CSF biomarkers for AD using a discovery dataset collected by the Knight-ADRC study and a replication cohort ascertained by the ADNI. Although the ascertainment and structure of the datasets are quite different, we were able to identify several biomarkers that showed consistent effects across the two datasets. The Rules Based Medicine Discovery Multi-Analyte Profile 1.0 panel includes 64 analytes that are not totally independent of one another. We used the correlation structure of these analytes to approximate the number of independent tests and consequently used this number to adjust our p values for multiple testing. We employed this information to understand the apparent excess of analytes associated with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio.\nA novel feature of our study is the use of the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio as the outcome variable in our analyses rather than comparing the levels of the test analytes in cases versus controls. The CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio provides several key advantages over the more traditional approach. It captures the progression of the disease before the onset of clinical symptoms by correcting the misclassification of control subjects with A\u03b2 plaques. In addition, this method correctly assigns individuals with clinical dementia who do not have AD. In a traditional analysis, these individuals would be included as cases, but they are analyzed as non-AD dementias when using the ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio. We believe that each of these factors contributes to the gain in statistical power of the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio that we observed comparing its performance with the usual case-control model in the evaluation of the CSF levels of VILIP-1 and YKL-40.\nThe analytes associated with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio were correlated with CSF ptau 181 but not A\u03b2 42 (Figure 1 ), indicating that they do not reflect the very early A\u03b2-related events in the development of the disease, but they do discriminate between preclinical and symptomatic AD. Query of the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (30) failed to identify any pathway that characterized the candidate set of analytes.\nThe CSF levels of H-FABP, the most significant analyte, were consistently associated with the ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio in both the Knight-ADRC and the ADNI datasets, even when the model included other reported biomarkers, such as CSF VILIP-1 and YKL-40. Two previous studies reported the association of CSF H-FABP with AD in other smaller cohorts (31, 32) . In the current study, we show that this association is present even at very early stages of the disease, as demonstrated by the analysis of cognitively normal subjects with evidence of A\u03b2 plaques. One limitation of our analysis is that although both studies are longitudinal, the novel biomarkers have been measured only in cross-sectional data. We are unable to address the role of FABP as a novel AD biomarker across the entire course of disease at the present time. Despite this limitation of our study design, we used the available longitudinal data to show how CSF H-FABP can be employed to predict the conversion from cognitive normality to cognitive impairment. It still remains to be determined whether addition of H-FABP in a model including both CSF ptau 181 and A\u03b2 42 levels improves the accuracy of predicting conversion to symptomatic AD. Subjects in different terciles for the CSF H-FABP-A\u03b2 42 and the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratios suggest this trend, but the studies included in our analysis did not provide statistical power to test this hypothesis.\nIn contrast, H-FABP levels do not predict progression from CDR = .5 to CDR \u03fe .5, but it is noteworthy that the number of subjects in this analysis is small (N = 81) compared with the analysis of conversion from CDR = 0 to CDR \u03fe 0 (N = 219). Based on these results, we believe that H-FABP may be a very useful biomarker in staging preclinical AD.\nThe protein H-FABP is a member of a family of proteins characterized as lipid chaperones (33) that transport lipids to specific compartments in the cell or outside the cell (33) . It has been demonstrated that in vitro fatty acids induce A\u03b2 assembly and modulate the rate of tau polymer assembly (34) . Genetic studies have implicated several genes involved in lipid metabolism as risk factors for AD, including APOE (35) and ABCA7 (36) .\nThe multivariate analysis of the Multi-Analyte Profile 1.0 panel of analytes identified distinct complex models for the Knight-ADRC and the ADNI datasets. Nevertheless, these models included a common subset of analytes. This subset of selected analytes includes CSF H-FABP as well as HGF, which was reported previously to discriminate AD subjects from subjects with other neurodegenerative disorders (32) . Similarly, VEGF was reported to discriminate controls from moderately severe AD cases but not from mild AD cases (31) . We confirmed the role of these analytes in our dataset by demonstrating an association with CDR at LP.\nIn conclusion, the use of the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio as an endophenotype of AD led to the identification of a set of 13 correlated analytes associated with the disease in two independent cohorts. This set of candidate analytes is extended by two additional analytes, which are significantly associated only in the context of multivariate models. Despite the differences in our two datasets (the ADNI study has many symptomatic individuals and fewer nondemented controls, whereas the Knight-ADRC study is largely composed of controls and inferred preclinical AD samples), these analytes were consistently associated with the CSF ptau 181 -A\u03b2 42 ratio and AD. Our analysis suggests that these analytes capture distinct information from that identified by the traditional analytes (CSF A\u03b2 42 and tau/ptau 181 ) for the disease and describe novel facets of disease pathogenesis. Analysis of the role of these analytes as novel biomarkers of AD pathogenesis in additional datasets would help to determine the specificity of these changes to AD. Longitudinal analyses also would enable characterization of the temporal sequence of analyte changes in the pathologic cascade of AD."}]
