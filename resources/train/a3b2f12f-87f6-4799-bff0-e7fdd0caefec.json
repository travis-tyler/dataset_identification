[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The ocean is a large and dynamic carbon reservoir that is tightly connected to the atmosphere via the solubility and reactivity of CO 2 in seawater (Sigman and Boyle, 2000). It has long been thought that the high-latitude oceans, in particular the Southern Ocean, may exert a dominant influence on oceanatmosphere carbon exchange (e.g. Sarmiento and Toggweiler, 1984;Siegenthaler and Wenk, 1984). This dominance stems from the with the sea surface (i.e. upwells), and where most water also last makes contact with the sea surface (i.e. is exported from) (Gebbie and Huybers, 2011). The Southern Ocean is therefore the deepocean's main 'window' on the atmosphere. The Southern Ocean is currently a High-Nutrient-Low-Chlorophyll region, where the total nutrient pool remains underutilized, and where export productivity does not, on average, keep pace with the upwelling of high-pCO 2 deep-waters (Sigman et al., 2010). For these reasons, it has been proposed that the Southern Ocean has played a central role in past (glacial-interglacial and millennial-scale) CO 2,atm variations, whether via changes in air-sea exchange, buoyancy forcing and mixing in the upper water column (e.g. Stephens and Keeling, 2000;Watson and Naveira Garabato, 2006), wind-driven upwelling (Anderson et al., 2009;Toggweiler et al., 2006), or iron-fertilization driven export productivity (Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2014). Today, upwelling in the southern high-latitude ocean dominates the austral winter season, whereas biological sequestration of carbon prevails in austral summer (Takahashi et al., 2002). The oceanic role in variations in CO 2,atm is linked to the balance between these two processes (Metzl et al., 1999;Takahashi et al., 2002) and varies spatially in the southern high-latitude ocean (Marinov et al., 2006). A strong evasion of CO 2 dominates Antarctic waters south of the Polar Front (PF), whereas strong export production in the sub-Antarctic Zone (SAZ) north of the PF sequesters carbon (Marinov et al., 2006). The location of the divide between these regions might have been affected by shifts of the Southern Ocean frontal system, which has been shown to amount to \u223c5 \u2022 change in latitude over glacial-interglacial transitions (Gersonde et al., 2003;Kohfeld et al., 2013). These frontal shifts can be tracked by changes in planktonic foraminifer assemblages in the surface ocean (Barker et al., 2009;Weaver et al., 1998). However, a paucity of well-resolved and well-dated marine records that bear on the seasonal differentiation of upwelling, air-sea gas exchange and export productivity has so far hampered our understanding of how these factors may have contributed to past changes in the surface ocean pCO 2 and thus CO 2,atm , in particular on millennial timescales. The stable oxygen and carbon isotope composition of stenotopic planktonic foraminifera has previously been used for reconstructing seasonal variations in hydrography and stratification of the upper water column. The difference between \u03b4 18 O ( \u03b4 18 O) of coexisting surface-and deep-dwelling foraminifera has been linked to the temperature and salinity structure of the water column (Mortyn et al., 2002;Mulitza et al., 1997;Niebler et al., 1999). Similarly, the \u03b4 18 O of planktonic foraminifera calcifying in the same water depth but different seasons may relate to seasonal temperature and water-\u03b4 18 O variability at that water depth (Peeters et al., 2002;Williams et al., 1981). Planktonic \u03b4 13 C reflects the \u03b4 13 C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the ambient water in which the foraminifer calcifies (Spero, 1992), with possible additional impacts of temperature, carbonate ion  3 ) concentration, photosynthetic symbiont activity or changes in the isotopic composition of the foraminifer's diet for example (e.g. Bemis et al., 2000;Spero and Lea, 1996). Winter upwelling in the Southern Ocean supplies additional respired nutrients and therefore acts to deplete the \u03b4 13 C of DIC (\u03b4 13 DIC) in the surface ocean. In contrast, photosynthesis during summer utilizes isotopically light DIC and thus enriches the \u03b4 13 DIC of surface waters. Abiotic effects, e.g. the air-sea exchange of CO 2 , additionally influence surface water \u03b4 13 DIC (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1995). If these influences are taken into account, or are invariant, nutrient gradients in the upper water column can in principle be derived from the \u03b4 13 C difference ( \u03b4 13 C) between coexisting surface-and deep-dwelling foraminifera (Mulitza et al., 1998). Similarly, seasonal changes in \u03b4 13 DIC can be inferred from planktonic foraminifera with different calcifying seasons but a similar depth habitat (Jonkers et al., 2013). Here, we present centennially resolved stable isotope records of G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) from marine sediment core MD07-3076Q (44 \u2022 9.2 S, 14 \u2022 13.7 W, 3770 m water depth) from the sub-Antarctic Atlantic in order to assess possible links between seasonally differentiated changes in upwelling, air-sea exchange and export productivity and millennial-scale changes in CO 2,atm during the last glacial and deglacial periods. We interpret these changes in the light of variations in the position of the fronts inferred from planktonic foraminifer census counts. Moreover, we test our assumptions on habitat depth and calcifying season of both planktonic foraminifera based on a meridional transect of compiled core-top stable oxygen and carbon isotopes in the South Atlantic before applying them to the down-core record. A synthesis of all available, high-resolution CO 2 records transferred to the newly established AICC2012 age scale (Veres et al., 2013) allows a direct comparison of hydrographic changes in the surface ocean with changes in CO 2,atm ."}, {"section_title": "Study area", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Regional hydrography", "text": "Marine sediment core MD07-3076Q has been retrieved from the eastern flank of the mid-Atlantic ridge (Fig. 1a). It is located within the modern SAZ, which is confined by the sub-Tropical Front (STF) to the north and by the sub-Antarctic Front (SAF) to the south (Fig. 1a). The STF coincides with the 10-12 \u2022 C-isotherms at 100 m depth, whereas the position of the SAF is described as the northern boundary of the low-salinity tongue of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) in surface waters (Orsi et al., 1995). The SAZ is defined by a distinct sub-surface salinity minimum associated with the formation of AAIW further to the south (Orsi et al., 1995). The PF further to the south ( Fig. 1a) coincides with a subsurface temperature minimum of about 2 \u2022 C (Belkin and Gordon, 1996). South of the PF, wind-driven Ekman transport leads to the upwelling of CO 2 -and nutrient-rich water masses in the Antarctic Divergence Zone, which coincides with the southern limit of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Orsi et al., 1995)."}, {"section_title": "Modern planktonic foraminifer assemblages", "text": "At present-day, the cold-water species N. pachyderma (s.) dominates the region south of the SAF ( Fig. 1; B\u00e9, 1969;Hemleben et al., 1989;Kohfeld et al., 1996). The highest abundance of Turborotalita quinqueloba coincides with the abundance maximum of N. pachyderma (s.) ( Fig. 1; B\u00e9, 1969;Niebler and Gersonde, 1998). G. bulloides is very abundant in the SAZ (Fig. 1) and is indicative of cold and nutrient-rich water masses of upwelling regions ( Fig. 1; e.g. B\u00e9, 1969;Peeters et al., 2002). High abundances of N. pachyderma dextral (d.) occur in upwelling regions and north of the STF (Fig. 1). Globigerina inflata shows a wide distribution from the sub-Tropical to the Antarctic Zones ( Fig. 1; Niebler et al., 1999) and is characteristic for the transitional zone between sub-Antarctic and sub-Tropical waters (B\u00e9, 1969). Globorotalia truncatulinoides and Globigerina falconensis both thrive in sub-Tropical waters ( Fig. 1; B\u00e9, 1969;Niebler et al., 1999).

In the southern PF Zone, N. pachyderma (s.) dwells slightly deeper than G. bulloides (King and Howard, 2005). High abundances of G. bulloides have been found at depths of fluorescence peaks and maximum chlorophyll concentrations (Mortyn and Charles, 2003), which suggests an association of G. bulloides with phytoplankton blooms and an enhanced availability of food. An increase in the abundance of G. bulloides in the SAZ primarily occurs during spring, which is linked to a decrease of the mixed layer depth (MLD) and the associated shoaling of the chlorophyll maximum (King and Howard, 2003). In contrast, N. pachyderma (s.) has been shown to calcify in the SAZ mostly during summer, which reflects its preference for very shallow MLDs and high surface chlorophyll concentrations that occur during intense summer density stratification of the water column Howard, 2003, 2005). The modern MLD (World Ocean Atlas (WOA) 2009; Locarnini et al., 2010) in the SAZ decreases from 250 m in austral winter to 70 m during austral summer. The season of maximum fluxes of G. bulloides shifts from spring in the SAZ to late spring and summer in the southern PF Zone Howard, 2003, 2005). The flux of N. pachyderma (s.) remains strongest during austral summer in the southern PF Zone and south of the PF (Donner and Wefer, 1994;Howard, 2003, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Stable isotopes", "text": "Stable isotopic analyses on G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) have been performed on 30 and 40 individuals from the 250-300 \u03bcm and 212-250 \u03bcm size fractions, respectively.

The radiocarbon-dated sediment section of MD07-3076Q is based on a calibration of 59 radiocarbon dates with the IntCal04 and Cariaco datasets (Hughen et al., 2006;Reimer et al., 2004) using variable reservoir ages corrections (Skinner et al., 2010). It has been shown that a calibration with a different atmospheric reference dataset (and accordingly revised reservoir age corrections) makes a negligible difference to the chronology (Skinner et al., 2014). The radiocarbon ages have been transferred to calibrated calendar ages using the Bayesian statistical software package BCHRON (Haslett and Parnell, 2008). Chronostratigraphic constraints can also be derived from the alignment of SST estimates in MD07-3076Q based on foraminiferal Mg/Ca ratios (Mashiotta et al., 1999;N\u00fcrnberg et al., 1996) or N. pachyderma (s.) abundances (Govin et al., 2009) with the Antarctic temperature proxy \u03b4D in the EPICA Dome C (EDC) ice core. Mg/Ca-derived SSTs have been shown to closely match Antarctic temperatures as shown by their representation of a gradual warming of the southern high-latitudes in synchrony with inter-hemispheric heat transport associated with the bipolar seesaw (Barker et al., 2009). In contrast, rapid changes in planktonic foraminifer assemblages have been suggested to relate to rapid adjustments of the oceanic fronts during Antarctic warming periods rather than to temperature changes of the ambient water masses alone (Barker et al., 2009). We therefore align minima in the abundance of N. pachyderma (s.) in MD07-3076Q to warming phases over Antarctica, i.e. maxima of the first derivative of the EDC \u03b4D record (Fig. 2), applying the AICC2012 chronology (Veres et al., 2013). The resulting age model produces an excellent match between Mg/Ca SSTs and the EDC \u03b4D temperature proxy ( Fig. 2), consistent with the expectations outlined above. Where they overlap, the N. pachyderma (s.) abundance-based chronology and the radiocarbon-based age model are in excellent agreement (Fig. 2). They deviate from each other by 500 \u00b1 400 years on average, which is within uncertainties of the age models ( Fig. S1). This lends credibility to the applied stratigraphic alignment during MIS 3, beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating. Prior to 27 ka BP, a lack of reservoir age constraints and increasing uncertainties of the atmospheric calibration curves result in relatively large uncertainties of the radiocarbon-based chronology (Skinner et al., 2010). We therefore use the radiocarbon age model for the upper core section (<27 ka BP) and rely on the agedepth markers resulting from the alignment of N. pachyderma (s.) with the rate of change in Antarctic temperature for the older core section (>27 ka BP) ( Fig. 2, Table S2). Absolute chronological uncertainties amount to about 1200 \u00b1 400 years for the period between 27 and 10 ka BP (Skinner et al., 2010). Mean age uncertainties of the N. pachyderma (s.)-based chronology between 68 and 27 ka BP strongly depend on the tiepoint density and amount to about 1600 \u00b1 500 years (Fig. S1)."}, {"section_title": "Gas age scales of CO 2 records from Antarctic ice cores", "text": "In order to facilitate comparisons of our marine data with records of CO 2,atm , we have compiled all of the available highresolution ice core CO 2 data from the last deglacial and glacial periods ( Fig. S2) and placed them on the AICC2012 age scale (Veres et al., 2013) as described in the SOM.  Bemis et al. (1998) (13-chambered G. bulloides) and Mulitza et al. (2003) (N. pachyderma s.) ( Fig. 3). Planktonic \u03b4 18 O pred has been calculated based on seawater-\u03b4 18 O after Schmidt et al. (1999) and seasonal SST extracted from WOA 2009 (Locarnini et al., 2010). The relative constant offset of planktonic \u03b4 18 O from near-surface water \u03b4 18 O pred north of the PF may be explained by gametogenic encrustation (Kohfeld et al., 1996;Kozdon et al., 2009), the CO 2\u2212 3 effect (Spero et al., 1997) and/or other disequilibrium effects, which are not considered by the species-specific palaeotemperature equations (Bemis et al., 1998;Mulitza et al., 2003). The suggested change in depth habitat of N. pachyderma (s.) in the southern PF Zone south of Tasmania appears to be associated with the PF in the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean, where a marked divergence of both planktonic \u03b4 18 O signatures in core-top sediments is observed (Fig. 3). Given the evidence of an overlapping depth habitat of G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) north of the PF indicated by closely matching core-top \u03b4 18 O values ( Fig. 3), the offset in \u03b4 13 C values of both planktonic species in core-top samples north of the PF suggests that G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) calcify their test in different seasons, which has been observed south of Tasmania (King and Howard, 2003). In line with these data, we assume that north of the PF G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) predominantly calcify during spring and summer, respectively. Equilibrium \u03b4 13 C (\u03b4 13 C eq ) of inorganically precipitated calcite is expected to be enriched by 1h relative to seawater \u03b4 13 DIC (Romanek et al., 1992). At present, the spatial and seasonal variability in surface water \u03b4 13 DIC in the Southern Ocean north of the PF is very small (Fig. 3), as biotic (photosynthesis, respiration) and abiotic processes (kinetic fractionation effects during the air-sea exchange of CO 2 , temperature-dependent isotopic air-sea CO 2 equilibration) (Lynch-Stieglitz et al., 1995) cancel each other out (Gruber et al., 1999). However, south of the PF surface water \u03b4 13 DIC is lower in spring than in summer and autumn, indicative of the influence of upwelling of \u03b4 13 C-depleted water masses during the spring (Fig. 3). The surface water \u03b4 13 DIC maximum seen in all seasons in the vicinity of the SAZ reflects enhanced air-sea exchange of CO 2 (Gruber et al., 1999), which is related to the maximum in zonal wind stress (Fig. 3)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Comparison between South", "text": "Core-top carbon isotopes of G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) in the South Atlantic disagree with calcite \u03b4 13 C eq during the expected season and habitat of G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) and are generally lighter by 1.5 to 2.5h (Fig. 3). It has been suggested that temperature (e.g. Bemis et al., 2000), CO 2\u2212 3 (Spero et al., 1997) and dietary effects (Spero and Lea, 1996) account for this observed \u03b4 13 C disequilibrium (Kohfeld et al., 2000). The effect of calcification temperature on the metabolic rates of shell calcification and carbon uptake amounts to a decrease of planktonic \u03b4 13 C by 0.13h per 1 \u2022 C warming (Bemis et al., 2000;Spero and Lea, 1996).

In summary, \u03b4 18 O-and \u03b4 13 C gradients between G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) should faithfully record seasonal hydrographic changes of the upper water column north of the PF, with G. bulloides reflecting spring and N. pachyderma (s.) representing summer conditions, as well as the temperature-, salinity-and nutrient structure of the upper water column during summer south of the PF, given the following assumptions hold true: i) each foraminifer's broad habitat preference and dominant geochemical controls have not changed greatly over time, and ii) the seasonality and depth habitat of planktonic foraminifera south of Tasmania and in the sub-Antarctic Atlantic region are similar."}, {"section_title": "Planktonic \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 13 C during the last deglaciation and MIS 3", "text": "During periods of rising CO 2,atm during the last deglacial and glacial periods, \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 13 C of G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) diverge by up to 0.6h and 1h, respectively (Fig. 5).

In contrast, during periods of Antarctic warming in MIS 3 and the last deglaciation, planktonic assemblages suggest the preponderance of sub-Antarctic conditions resembling modern hydrographic conditions in the SAZ, which points at a southward retreat of the PF and SAF from the core site.

Both \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 13 C of G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) show a marked divergence during these periods in contrast to intervals of low or decreasing CO 2,atm levels, with the exception of AIM 1 (Fig. 5). Assuming the same seasonal habitat preferences of G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) as in the modern SAZ Howard, 2003, 2005), the negative excursions of \u03b4 13 C of G. bulloides during intervals of rising CO 2,atm would document a marked depletion of surface water \u03b4 13 DIC during spring in comparison to today. This could be caused by stronger vertical mixing and enhanced upwelling of CO 2 -and nutrient-enriched water to the surface ocean in winter and spring in the Antarctic Divergence Zone, leading to positive fluxes of CO 2 from the Southern Ocean to the atmosphere during this season and potentially contributing to net rises in CO 2,atm . An alternative interpretation might be that a habitat shift to greater water depths could result in more depleted G. bulloides \u03b4 13 C (Fig. 3). However, this is relatively unlikely as such a deepening of the G. bulloides habitat is not observed in modern sediment trap or plankton tow studies anywhere in the Southern Ocean today and is also inconsistent with observed lighter G. bulloides \u03b4 18 O. Hence, we argue that winter-time upwelling of nutrients and concomitant decrease in density stratification of the upper water column cause the decrease in \u03b4 13 C of G. bulloides, which lends support to the hypothesized link of enhanced vertical mixing in Fig. 6. Planktonic assemblage changes over the last 68 ka observed in MD07-3076Q: a) cumulative changes in planktonic foraminifer assemblages, b) the \u03b4D variability recorded in the EPICA Dome C (EDC) ice core (Jouzel et al., 2007) on the AICC2012 age scale (Veres et al., 2013), and relative changes in the abundance of c) N. pachyderma (d.), d) G. falconensis, e) G. truncatulinoides, f) G. inflata, g) G. bulloides, h) N. pachyderma (s.) and i) T. quinqueloba; dashed lines mark time intervals of warming in Antarctica. the southern high-latitude ocean and millennial-scale CO 2,atm rises during the last deglaciation and MIS 3 (e.g. Sachs and Anderson, 2005;Watson and Naveira Garabato, 2006). These observations are consistent with deglacial planktonic \u03b4 13 C excursions observed in sediment cores from the Pacific and equatorial region (Siani et al., 2013;Spero and Lea, 2002). They further agree with millennial-scale changes in surface ocean stratification and associated vertical mixing in time with changes in CO 2,atm , which have been inferred from bulk sediment nitrogen isotope data in the sub-Antarctic Pacific (Robinson et al., 2007) and millennial-scale pulses in the export production of biogenic opal in the Southern Ocean south of the PF (Anderson et al., 2009). While the \u03b4 13 C of G. bulloides decreases during millennial-scale rises in CO 2,atm , that of N. pachyderma (s.) increases (Fig. 5). We suggest that the rise in \u03b4 13 C of N. pachyderma (s.), which occupies a well-stratified water column during summer-time, reflects primarily an increase in export productivity (driving more complete nutrient depletion in summer) and secondarily an increase in air-sea gas exchange efficiency (driving the \u03b4 13 DIC of seawater to more positive values). Superficially, an increase in the export productivity in the central sub-Antarctic Atlantic might appear to be inconsistent with the proposed dust-driven reduction in nutrient utilization and therefore the export productivity observed in the Cape Basin in time with millennial-scale rises in CO 2,atm (Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2009Ziegler et al., 2013), and would also act against a proposed increase in the upwelling of nutrientrich deep water with a high potential pCO 2 (Anderson et al., 2009) by tending to draw down CO 2,atm . However, these apparent conflicts may be resolved through the seasonal differentiation of these processes in the southern high-latitudes: increased upwelling and sub-surface nutrient supply as recorded by G. bulloides \u03b4 13 C in the sub-Antarctic Atlantic cause a depletion of surface water \u03b4 13 DIC and an enhanced nutrient availability primarily in spring, which would not necessarily influence N. pachyderma (s.) \u03b4 13 C during summer. Therefore, a lower nutrient utilization and decreased export production associated with reduced iron fertilization during intervals of rising CO 2,atm inferred from decreases in G. bulloides \u03b4 15 N (Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda et al., 2014) might occur during the spring season only, as we assume G. bulloides to predominantly thrive during the spring season (Section 4.1). Hence, strong gradients between G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) \u03b4 13 C might indicate the strong seasonal contrast of winter/spring-time upwelling of CO 2 -rich water masses as well as the summer-time increase in nutrient utilization and biological export production in the surface ocean. The fact that these seasonally differentiated changes coincide with increasing multi-annual average CO 2,atm would imply a dominant control of vertical mixing in the Southern Ocean and the related upwelling of CO 2 -rich water masses during austral winter/spring on annually integrated Southern Ocean CO 2 fluxes and thus, on CO 2,atm variations. Above, we have interpreted the observed \u03b4 13 C between G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) in terms of the primary controls on the \u03b4 13 DIC of seawater in the modern seasonal habitats of each species. Alternatively, these changes might be related to the processes that cause each foraminifer's isotopic signature to deviate from that of its ambient seawater (Section 4.1). However, we propose that such changes are unlikely to be the primary control of the observed \u03b4 13 C between G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.)  (Fig. 4), and surface water temperatures in spring would have to be warmer than in summer to account for the observed changes in planktonic \u03b4 13 C. These scenarios are rather unlikely. A combination of the various factors would also struggle to account for the full range of observed \u03b4 13 C, as their effects on planktonic \u03b4 13 C partly work in opposite directions (Kohfeld et al., 2000). Taken together, the observed variations in planktonic stable oxygen and carbon isotopes therefore suggest a significant impact on net annual marine CO 2 release due to enhanced vertical mixing in the southern high-latitude ocean during winter-and spring-time, as well as increased ocean-atmosphere CO 2 exchange throughout the remaining annual cycle. While enhanced nutrient supply from the sub-surface seems to have led to increased nutrient availability and enhanced CO 2 release during winter and spring, the opposite may have occurred in the summer, when nutrient availability was reduced. If the observed reduced nutrient availability translates into enhanced nutrient utilization and thus export production, the latter would imply that export productivity changes in the sub-Antarctic Atlantic in the summer did not exert a dominant control on CO 2,atm ."}, {"section_title": "Antarctic warming event 1", "text": "During AIM 1, \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 13 C of G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) change sign, in contrast to what is observed during preceding periods of CO 2,atm rise during MIS 3. This remains an enigma that we are unable to completely account for. One simple explanation would involve a swap of the calcifying seasons of G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.), which would be surprising as there is no analogue of this habitat change in the modern Southern Ocean. AIM 1 appears to be associated with a 'regime shift' in planktonic foraminifer assemblages and hydrographic conditions that probably reflects the transition into peak glacial conditions at the study site (Fig. 6). The approach of the sea ice margin to the core site during that time and the resulting influence of meltwater on the surface ocean density stratification, the nutrient budget and the air-sea CO 2 flux (Nelson and Smith, 1986;Sedwick and DiTullio, 1997) could in principle have led to 'nomodern-analogue' changes in the seasonality of G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.), and therefore the observed \"anomalous\" isotopic signatures."}, {"section_title": "LGM", "text": "The transition towards peak glacial conditions during the LGM is linked to an enrichment of N. pachyderma (s.) \u03b4 18 O in comparison to G. bulloides (Fig. 5), which indicates markedly different hydrographic conditions in the SAZ during the LGM compared to MIS 3. In fact, N. pachyderma (s.) \u03b4 18 O matches that of the thermocline-dweller G. inflata, which points at a habitat shift of N. pachyderma (s.). A strong \u03b4 18 O divergence between G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) is observed in core-top samples from the sub-Antarctic Atlantic south of the PF today (Fig. 3). The strong \u03b4 18 O divergence of G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) during the LGM thus implies the very strong influence of polar waters and an associated salinity-driven density stratification of the upper water column at the core site. A strong pycnocline therefore appears to have 'capped' the southern high-latitude ocean in summer during the LGM, at least as far north as the SAZ. This would have resulted in a year-round isolation of the sub-surface from the atmosphere, reducing the evasion of CO 2 to the atmosphere and leading to a drawdown of CO 2,atm (e.g. Fran\u00e7ois et al., 1997;Stephens and Keeling, 2000), consistent with evidence for expanded winter sea-ice and enhanced summer melt (Gersonde et al., 2003) as well as northward shifted westerlies ."}, {"section_title": "Comparison with planktonic records from the Cape Basin", "text": "Above, we have argued on the basis of the \u03b4 13 C between G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) from the central sub-Antarctic Atlantic that enhanced vertical mixing in winter/spring and more effective air-sea CO 2 exchange in summer has a significant impact on millennial-scale CO 2,atm variability. In order to test this proposition, we compare our data with planktonic stable isotope records from other sediment cores from the South Atlantic (locations are shown in Fig. 1): RC11-83 (Charles et al., 1996), TNO57-6 (Hodell et al., 2003), TNO57-10-11 (Hodell et al., 2000), and TNO57-21 (Mortyn et al., 2002). We smoothed the individual \u03b4 13 C records by a 1 ka-running average, detrended them by subtracting a 15 ka-running mean and calculated planktonic speciesspecific \u03b4 13 C stacks as mean of all available records (available from the Pangaea database). To allow a direct comparison of the sediment records, we apply the most recent age scale for core TNO57-21 (Barker and Diz, 2014), which is based on the GICC05 age scale (Svensson et al., 2008) and which is equivalent to the Antarctic age scale AICC2012 (Veres et al., 2013) used in this study. Age control of RC11-83 prior to 41 ka is rather sparse, with only one tie point at the MIS4/3 boundary (Charles et al., 1996). We thus transferred the RC11-83 chronology on the GICC05 age scale (Svensson et al., 2008) based on the proposed chronostratigraphic alignment of benthic \u03b4 13 C of RC11-83 and TNO57-21 (Ninnemann and Charles, 2002;Piotrowski et al., 2008). The original radiocarbon-based age model is applied to the core section younger than 28 ka BP for RC11-83. The originally reported age models are used for sediment core TNO57-6 (Hodell et al., 2003) and TNO57-10-11 (Hodell et al., 2000). The different planktonic \u03b4 13 C records exhibit common millennial-scale features, which points at a regional consistency of hydrographic changes in the sub-Antarctic Atlantic. Decreasing or minimum G. bulloides \u03b4 13 C values in RC11-83 and TNO57-21 coincide with intervals of rising CO 2,atm during MIS 3 as observed in MD07-3076Q (Fig. 7). G. bulloides \u03b4 13 C in TNO57-6 generally follows the same trend and shows a \u03b4 13 C G. bulloides minimum during AIM 1. Peaks in N. pachyderma (s.) \u03b4 13 C observed in MD07-3076Q during rising CO 2,atm are similar to those observed in TNO57-6, though the resolution is generally low. However, the N. pachyderma (s.) \u03b4 13 C record of RC11-83 strongly deviates from MD07-3076Q and close-by sediment cores TNO57-6 and Fig. 7.

TNO57-10-11, which may relate to inter-regional differences in the controls on planktonic \u03b4 13 C during summer, in particular in the Cape Basin. Overall, the stacked G. bulloides \u03b4 13 C values clearly decrease during intervals of increasing CO 2,atm , when the N. pachyderma (s.) \u03b4 13 C stack (omitting the \"anomalous\" RC11-83 N. pachyderma (s.) \u03b4 13 C record) generally shows marked increases (Fig. 7), which suggests that hydrographic changes inferred from proxy analyses in MD07-3076Q are not just localized phenomena, but may reflect basin-wide impacts. Moreover, a strong depletion in \u03b4 13 C of G. bulloides is observed during AIM 1 in RC11-83, TNO57-21 and TNO57-6, in contrast to MD07-3076Q (Section 5.2.3), suggesting that the \"anomalous\" observation in MD07-3076Q during AIM 1 is indeed a more localized phenomenon. These observations point at consistent hydrographic changes in the central and Southeast sub-Antarctic Atlantic during the last deglacial and glacial periods emphasizing the importance of seasonally differentiated impacts of the carbon cycling in the southern high-latitude ocean on CO 2,atm over millennial time scales."}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "We present high-resolution \u03b4 18 O and \u03b4 13 C data from G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) in conjunction with planktonic foraminifer census counts from the central sub-Antarctic Atlantic core MD07-3076Q, with accurate age control over the last deglacial and glacial periods. Absolute chronologic uncertainties respectively amount to 1600 \u00b1 500 years and to 1200 \u00b1 400 years during MIS 3 and the last deglaciation, respectively. By accounting for the CO 2\u2212 3 -, temperature-and dietary effects on planktonic carbon isotopes, we show that compiled core-top G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) \u03b4 13 C data from the South Atlantic and the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean are consistent with modern surface water \u03b4 13 DIC of the expected seasonal depth habitat of each foraminifer species. G. bulloides and N. pachyderma (s.) are thus interpreted to occupy (and record via their geochemistry) near-surface habitats in the SAZ during spring and summer, respectively Howard, 2005, 2003). This provides a basis for reconstructing past changes in surface water \u03b4 13 DIC and its seasonal variability by means of planktonic stable isotopes. Distinct decreases in G. bulloides \u03b4 13 C during intervals of rising CO 2,atm indicate the depletion of surface water \u03b4 13 DIC, and therefore enhanced upwelling of CO 2 -and nutrient-rich water masses during winter and spring in the Antarctic Divergence Zone. Simultaneously, rising N. pachyderma (s.) \u03b4 13 C may indicate enhanced air-sea CO 2 exchange and/or reduced nutrient availability in summer. With the exception of N. pachyderma (s.) \u03b4 13 C in RC11-83, the observed patterns in planktonic isotopes in MD07-3076Q are consistent with available records from the Cape Basin, suggesting that they may be of basin-wide relevance. Enhanced upwelling of sub-surface CO 2 -rich water during winter and spring, as well as enhanced air-sea exchange during summer, would thus have played a key role in driving past changes in surface ocean pCO 2 and therefore CO 2,atm on millennial time scales. Our data also suggest a marked difference in the hydrography of the Southern Ocean during the LGM, versus MIS 3 and the deglaciation. Following AIM 1, significantly enriched \u03b4 18 O values of N. pachyderma (s.) would indicate a deeper habitat of N. pachyderma (s.) in summer, in clear contrast to MIS 3 conditions. This could indicate a strong density stratification of the upper water column extending as far north as the SAZ during the LGM, perhaps associated with more extensive winter sea ice and a more intense summer melt season (Gersonde et al., 2003) as well as northward shifted westerlies (Toggweiler et al., 2006). This could have greatly diminished ocean-atmosphere CO 2 exchange and thus helped to draw CO 2,atm levels down to their minimum LGM levels. To sum up, in addition to underlining the important role that hydrographic changes in the Southern Ocean likely played in millennial-scale CO 2,atm variability during the last deglaciation and MIS 3, our findings emphasize the significance of seasonally differentiated impacts of upwelling, air-sea gas exchange efficiency, surface ocean density stratification and export productivity on annually integrated fluxes of CO 2 from the Southern Ocean to the atmosphere and therefore changes in CO 2,atm . Our data suggest that during MIS 2 a year-round reduction in air-sea gas exchange due to a strong density stratification in the upper water column helped to drive CO 2,atm concentrations to their minimum LGM levels, and that enhanced winter/spring upwelling has played a pivotal role in millennial-scale CO 2,atm pulses during MIS 3 and the last deglaciation."}]
