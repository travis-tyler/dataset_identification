[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: This study addresses the water quantity and quality implications of greenhouse gas mitigation efforts in agriculture and forestry. This is done both through a literature review and a case study. The case study is set in the Missouri River Basin (MRB) and involves integration of a water hydrology model and a land use model with an econometric model estimated to make the link. The hydrology model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT) is used to generate a multiyear, multilocation dataset that gives estimated water quantity and quality measures dependent on land use. In turn, those data are used in estimating a quantile regression model linking water quantity and quality with climate and land use. Additionally, a land use model (Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model with Greenhouse Gases, FASOMGHG) is used to simulate the extent of mitigation strategy adoption and land use implications under alternative carbon prices. Then, the land use results and climate change forecasts are input to the econometric model and water quantity/quality projections developed. The econometric results show that land use patterns have significant influences on water quantity. Specifically, an increase in grassland significantly decreases water quantity, with forestry having mixed effects. At relatively high quantiles, land use changes from cropped land to grassland reduce water yield, while switching from cropping or grassland to forest yields more water. It also shows that an increase in cropped land use significantly degrades water quality at the 50% quantile and moving from cropped land to either forest or pasture slightly improves water quality at the 50% quantile but significantly worsens water quality at the 90% quantile. In turn, a simulation exercise shows that water quantity slightly increases under mitigation activity stimulated by lower carbon prices but significantly decreases under higher carbon prices. For water quality, when carbon prices are low, water quality is degraded under most mitigation alternatives but quality improves under higher carbon prices."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [1] indicates greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) are a main driver of climate change, and the agriculture and forestry (AF) sector can alter operations to reduce net emissions [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The logic for employing AF mitigation involves, among other things, the size of sectoral GHGEs. Estimates indicate AF is the source of 30% of global GHGEs predominately through emissions of methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide [9] . Additionally, an estimated 25% of historical carbon releases have come from the sectors mainly in the form of lost"}, {"section_title": "Land Use Change", "text": "Mitigation actions being undertaken to reduce GHGEs would change land use systems [47] [48] [49] [50] and in turn alter water resources. Land use change in an agricultural context involves transformations between cropping, pasture/range, forest, wetlands, or urban spaces. For mitigation, this generally involves movements to less intensive usages, with cropland moving to pasture/range, forestry or wetlands plus pasture moving to forest or wetlands.\nLand use change affects water use and water quality with the effect dependent on the original and final land uses along with irrigation status, vegetation mix, and production practices/input use. A number of studies have addressed the water quantity implications of land use change. Leterme and Mallants [51] show that groundwater recharge will increase when cropland is used for maize but will decrease if land is converted to pasture or forest, implying the more complete the land cover, the less the infiltration. Bhardwaj et al. [52] suggest that cropland movement into energy crops will increase water use. Water runoff is also altered when croplands are moved to forests, with runoff predominantly decreasing, indicating that larger plants use more water [15] . Frankenberger [53] examined how runoff is affected by land use in Indiana, finding on fields planted to corn or soybeans that with a 4-in rain, runoff volume fell from 97% to between 12% to 30% when the land was altered to forest, pasture, or turf grass. This is likely due to a combination of these land uses slowing runoff, possibly stimulating more infiltration and increased vegetative water use.\nWater quality is also affected by land use [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . Erosion is a major force and is altered by mitigation practices that alter tillage intensity or soil disturbance [8, [60] [61] [62] [63] . For example, erosion associated with the loss of soil carbon can be reduced by windbreaks, grassland replacement, and afforestation [8, 62] . Furthermore, water quality is impacted by rates of chemical or animal manure fertilization [64] [65] [66] . It is also altered by practices that alter water infiltration, like buffer strips [19, 67, 68] . The impacts on water quality are varied. For example, Pattanayak et al. [69] and Townsend et al. [70] showed afforestation leading to increased water quality, while Jackson et al. [15] reviewed cases exhibiting the opposite. Thus, impacts on water quantity and quality differ by situation and prior land use/management."}, {"section_title": "Bioenergy", "text": "Bioenergy is a mitigation alternative with biogenic feedstocks displacing fossil fuel use [2, 13] . The same would be true for water, where the direct effects involve water used in processing and production. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources [71] showed quantity can be an issue, with aquifers in Iowa being drawn down by 17.1 ft over 10 years when ethanol facilities were installed.\nQuality is also affected as bioenergy feedstock sources include conventional crops and their residues, energy crops, and animal wastes. Raising or recovering such feedstocks can alter runoff of chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and erosion along with vegetative water use and runoff volume [72] ."}, {"section_title": "Technological Progress", "text": "Technological progress is another mitigation strategy and can also influence water quantity and quality. This is particularly true when: (1) yield increases are achieved with approximately the same inputs as equal amounts that can be produced with smaller acreage and thus less inputs per unit product; and/or when (2) the same product can be produced with less inputs reducing chemical runoff. For example, recently US corn yields have risen without increasing nitrogen fertilization per acre due to such things as improvements in genetics, pest resistance, drought tolerance, and nutrient efficiency/application practices [14] .\nTechnology can also have quantity impacts when the amount of water used per acre or the land area of crops changes, although this can be either positive or negative. Quality impacts occur when the technological developments induce less input use or crop mix/management shifts that lower chemical input usage and erosion. Baker et al. [14] examined technology effects in a US setting, showing that a continuation of recent trends leads to both reduced GHG emissions and water quality improvements. However, the interrelationship is complex, with many possibilities having different water implications."}, {"section_title": "Empirical Investigation on Mitigation and Water", "text": "This study aims to examine the water implications of mitigation strategy use via a four-step process.

The average water quantity is around 7.2 mm per sub-basin per month, which is close to the value reported at the 75% quantile, meaning that 75% of the SWAT-generated MRB water quantities are below average.

On the other hand, grass coverage in areas exhibiting better water quality averages 40.2%, while it averages 15.7% in areas with the worst water quality.

Previous studies have found that agricultural land use has impacts on water quality [94] [95] [96] , while Sliva and Williams [97] found the opposite. In our analysis, the results show that moving from cropped land to either forest or pasture will slightly improve water quality at the 50% quantile but worsen water quality at the 90% quantile. An increase in cropped land use significantly degrades water quality at the 50% quantile. Previous studies have found that water quality is strongly influenced by agricultural land use and land use change [44, 59, 91, 95, 96, 98] . For example, Lee et al. [59] found that the proportions of land use of urban, agricultural, and forest are correlated with water quality in South Korea. Gunawardhana et al. [98] found that converting forested land to agricultural land degrades water quality in the Uma Oya catchment area in Sri Lanka. Miserendino et al. [99] and Tu [100] found that water quality increases as forest land increases, perhaps because of lower inorganic ions in forested land use [56, 58, 97, 101] . Urban area does not have significant impacts on water quality, Sustainability 2018, 10, 2367 14 of 22 which conflicts with the results from the study of DeFries and Eshleman [57] , Miserendino et al.

The quantity effect on water quality at the 75% quantile is negative and similar to results at the 50% quantile, and it implies that increasing water quantity will improve the higher part of the water quality distribution (WQI > 90% quantile) but worsen lower water quality below that (WQI < 75% quantile), perhaps due to runoff. Our result is consistent with Molina-Navarro et al. [91] at higher quantiles in showing that water quality is closely linked with water quantity.\nNext, we discuss the impacts of climatic factors. Notice that the impacts depend on current conditions since the estimated functions include squared terms for some climate variables. The result shows that water quality will worsen with lower precipitation levels and is improved as precipitation increases. Extreme precipitation has positive impacts on water quality probably since precipitation has dilution and flushing effects. On the other hand, extreme temperature degrades water quality. This is likely because extreme lower temperatures freeze water and slow down flows while extreme high temperatures cause higher evaporation or transpiration, in turn reducing water flows and resultant dilution.\nThe marginal effects from El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a have opposite results between the 50% and 90% quantiles, with the absolute magnitude at the 90% quantile being larger than that at the 50% quantile. Compared with the neutral phase, El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a significantly improve water quality at the 90% quantile, while both El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a have significant negative effects on water quality at the 50% quantile."}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Water Implications of Mitigation Strategy Choice", "text": "We now turn to examine the effects of mitigation efforts on water quantity and quality. We do this by using FASOMGHG model under different carbon prices to give us changes in: (1) afforestation; (2) crop fertilization; (3) crop tillage intensification; (4) crop management; (5) livestock enteric and manure management; (6) bioenergy feedstock incidence; and (7) forest management. The afforestation mitigation strategy converts crop and/or grasslands to forest, and the forest management strategy includes lengthened timber rotations, increased forest management intensity, and avoided deforestation. In simulating the effects at different carbon prices, we ran FASOMGHG one strategy at a time and later allowed the whole portfolio of strategies.\nThe runs were done under several hypothetical carbon price scenarios which contained rising prices. Specifically, the prices were initially set at $5, $10, $30, and $50 per metric ton CO 2 equivalent but then escalated at 5% per year. Additionally, we ran a baseline scenario with no carbon price. The considered shifts in land use were those under the carbon price scenario relative to those under the baseline scenario.\nThe version of FASOMGHG used has the conterminous United States divided into 11 regions. The Missouri River Basin consists of parts of the FASOMGHG regions of the Corn Belt, Northern Plains, and Rocky Mountains, and based on land use shares, we used 10.90% of the Corn Belt results, 45.72% of the Northern Plains, and 43.38%, of the Rocky Mountains.\nFASOMGHG generated many results, but here, we will only focus on those with implications for water. The FASOMGHG results for cropped land, grassland, and forested land plus the regression evaluations for the 50% quantile are reported in Table 6 . All the values use simulated land use changes during the five-year period beginning with 2025.

When carbon prices are only paid for crop fertilization reduction, the results show cropped land use increases by 0.83%, while grassland and forests decrease by 0.78% and 0.16%, causing an increase in water quantity and a decrease in water quality. The opposite effects occur for bioenergy, forest management, and the case where all strategies are allowed with water quantity decreasing but quality increasing. Similar results are found under the $10 at a 5% increase carbon price scenario. There, all the single strategy mitigation cases expand cropping but reduce grassland and forests."}, {"section_title": "Effects under the Higher Carbon Price Scenarios", "text": "In the higher carbon price scenarios (those starting with $30 and $50 prices), all the single strategy mitigation results and the simultaneous case decrease cropping and forests but increase grassland. In these scenarios, water quantity is decreased while water quality increases across the board. When forest management is the only available strategy, this causes the largest water quantity decrease and water quality increase across the individual strategies. The all strategies case causes yet a larger quantity reduction (1.05 mm per acre in the $30 case) and the largest increase in water quality. This suggests that stronger AF mitigation efforts will result in reduced water quantity but increased water quality. We also see diminishing effects on quantity and quality as prices go higher."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This paper reports water quality and quantity implications of agricultural and forestry climate change mitigation strategies. To do this, we did an empirical study in the Missouri River Basin investigating the effects of differing levels of mitigation incentives and involving four phases.\nFirst, we ran SWAT for 21 years, observing water quantity and quality effects on a monthly basis for the 13,437 hydrologic unit watershed levels. Then, we took those results and aggregated them to counties, in turn, doing a quantile regression estimation over panel data explaining the water quantity and quality effects of altered land use shares and climate. The result shows that an increase in grassland significantly decreases water quantity but increases quality, while changes in cropped land share have the opposite effect. We also found an increase in forested land share had mixed effects.\nThe third empirical phase examined the land use effects of an agricultural and forestry mitigation strategy adopted under alternative carbon prices. The fourth phase integrated the quantile regressions and the land use effects to project water quantity and quality effects of various carbon prices and mitigation strategies. The consequent results showed crop fertilization, afforestation, and livestock strategies generally led to increased water quantity and decreased quality under lower carbon price scenarios but led to the opposite result under higher carbon price scenarios. The results also showed that water quality is degraded under most mitigation alternatives except for the production of bioenergy feedstocks and the alteration of forest management. In these cases, these effects occurred when carbon price was low but was reversed with higher carbon prices.\nCollectively, the results imply that AF mitigation has varied effects on water quantity and water quality, depending on the carbon price or the extent of mitigation activity. Generally, water quantity is slightly increased under lower carbon prices but then is reduced when carbon prices go higher. Water quality results reveal mixed effects at lower prices but an improvement under higher carbon prices. We also see the magnitudes of improvement shrink as the carbon price goes higher.\nAuthor Contributions: B.A.M. had the original idea for the study and conducted literature review; C.-H.Y. collected data and carried out the analyses; both authors shared in drafting the manuscript, and both approve the final version."}]
