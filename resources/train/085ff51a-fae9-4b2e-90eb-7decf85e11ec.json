Data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) indicate significant declines in the populations of several species of songbirds, including several Neotropical migrants. These declines have been attributed to habitat destruction and fragmentation on the breeding grounds, in strategic migratory stopover sites, and on the wintering grounds. Using BBS data from the 1967-1989 period and universal kriging, we produced maps of abundance change for two declining species of wood warblers to test hypothetical spatial scenarios of decline over entire breeding ranges. These species were the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea) and the Prairie Warbler (D. discolor). We found considerable variability in the location of areas of decline when comparing successive 5-yr periods. In some comparisons, areas of decline were concentrated in the centers of abundance of these species, and in others, they were scattered throughout their range. We also found that the direction and intensity of population trends was quite sensitive to the methods used for calculating abundance. Our results indicate that, even for species where significant longterm declines have been reported, considerable variation exists in the direction of abundance change, both geographically and temporally. Although most of the long-term declines reported in particular species at local and regional scales are undeniable, gaps in our knowledge still prevent us from incorporating these trends into a global model of the annual cycle of Neotropical migrants.\nEcological Society of America"}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The recent declines in breeding populations of several species of Neotropical migrant landbirds revealed by the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) and several local studies have received considerable attention (Robbins et al. 1989 , Terborgh 1989 , Askins et al. 1990 , Hagan and Johnston 1992 , Finch and Stangel 1993 . Understanding the causes of the declines observed in Neotropical migrant songbirds is particularly challenging. The continent-wide distribution of most species implies that we have to rely on data collected by many different observers. In addition, the factors driving population trends of Neotropical migrants are likely to differ both in nature and intensity in the various portions of their breeding or wintering ranges. Finally, the long-term data sets required for these analyses also make it harder to obtain data collected in a rigorously standardized fashion.\nIn Wilcove and Terborgh (1984) examined potential scenarios of population decline by linking local and geographic-scale patterns of change in bird distribution. At the geographic scale, they distinguished between two possibilities: maintenance of the full geographic range of a species, or retraction from the periphery. It is possible to refine these geographic-scale scenarios of population declines by considering various patterns of change in abundance within the range of a species. A globally declining species could show (1) unchanged abundances throughout its remaining range, but with a range contraction, (2) a uniform decline in populations with no range contraction, (3) population declines at the periphery of the range only, (4) population declines at the center of the range, with or without range contraction, or (5) randomly distributed areas of decline throughout the range, with or without range contraction. This list of theoretical scenarios is not exhaustive. It simply identifies stages along a continuum of spatial patterns of decline in abundance."}, {"section_title": "59", "text": "In this paper, we examine the spatial pattern of change in the breeding populations of two species of wood warblers (Emberizidae, Parulinae), the Prairie Warbler (Dendroica discolor) and Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea), in which long-term continental declines have been reported by the BBS (Sauer and Droege 1992). Our intent is (1) to show how geographic-scale data on abundances can be used to analyze spatial and temporal patterns of population change in species that are believed to be declining, and (2) to present a geostatistical approach to achieve this goal. We averaged abundances across all BBS routes where a species was detected in each year to look at changes in average abundance for the 1967-1989 period. These averages did not include routes with zero abundance, and are therefore not sensitive to changes in the number of sites where a species was present. Trend surfaces of abundances of each warbler species for the entire 23-yr period were then obtained using universal kriging and the semivariance (see Semivariance analysis). Trend surfaces represent an estimate of the geographic pattern of abundance of the species obtained by interpolating abundance values among grid squares. We divided the data into five time periods (1967-1970, 1971-1975, 1976-1980, 1981-1985, and 1986-1989) and prepared maps of relative rates of population change between the five time periods by subtracting the logarithms of trend surfaces in adjoining time periods. BBS routes with zero abundance for each time period were included to produce these kriged maps. The rationale for selecting this approach is presented in the next section."}, {"section_title": "Semivariance analysis", "text": "It is clear that ecologists have a great need to incorporate spatial information into their data analyses. In addition to traditional spatial statistics, geostatistics provides quantitative tools for analyzing spatial data. Much of geostatistics is centered around the \"general regionalized variable model,\" or GRVM. This model was first explored by Matheron (1963) , and has since given rise to a large number of relatively detailed analyses (Haining 1990 , Cressie 1991 is not always equal to zero. That is, when a reasonable model is fit to the semivariances calculated as in Eq. 1, the model typically is not constrained to go through the origin. g(O) has been interpreted as the variability of the process being studied within a sampling unit. This is often referred to as the \"nugget variance,\" or \"nugget.\" The nugget can have two components (Cressie 1991). The first is due to error in the sampling process. For estimates of abundances obtained from censuses like the BBS, this would mean that the part of the nugget variance could be due to the inherent variability among observers in counting birds at different BBS routes. The second component is due to the discontinuous nature of the process in space. For birds, this would be related to the continuity of the habitat in which they were being counted. Since the habitat of a species is generally discontinuous in space, this is a likely component of the nugget variance for data like the BBS.\nSpecies of North American birds censused on the BBS vary considerably in their nugget variances ( The second interesting characteristic of the semivariogram is called the \"range.\" Essentially, the range is sampling distance between points where the semivariance reaches its maximum point. In most semivariance models, the semivariogram asymptotically approaches this maximum, and it represents the distance beyond which the spatial autocorrelation in the process being studied is effectively zero. Thus, it can be used to identify patterns of spatial independence. The range is only useful, however, if the process being modeled by the semivariance has certain statistical properties, such as stationarity (i.e., the process has a constant mean across space).\nSemivariograms from BBS data typically do not indicate the existence of an asymptotic maximum semivariance (Maurer 1994 ). Rather, they indicate that the maximum semivariance occurs at intermediate distances, and that points farther apart than this distance are actually more highly correlated (Fig. 2) . This increasing correlation with large distances separating sampling sites can be explained by the characteristic distribution of abundances across a geographic range. Generally a species is most abundant in one or a few places near the center of its geographic range, and its abundance decreases away from these points (Maurer and Villard 1994) . Abundances at points relatively large distances away from one another should be positively correlated because they represent peripheral sites in the geographic range. The semivariogram pro- "}, {"section_title": "Estimating patterns of spatial variation in abundance", "text": "The semivariance provides a method for developing maps of variation in abundance from a collection of sampled locations, such as in the BBS. The method, called \"kriging,\" interpolates abundances between census locations using the semivariance. Since the semivariance represents spatial covariation in the process being studied, it contains information about what values are likely to be obtained for points within the neighborhood of a sampled point. The phrase \"within the neighborhood\" is intentionally vague here, because the choice of this neighborhood is somewhat arbitrary. Kriging uses the semivariance to decide the size of the neighborhood. This is accomplished by minimizing the prediction error associated with the interpolated value (Cressie 1991), given a value for the semivariance.\nKriging is usually done in two parts. First, the sample semivariance given in Eq. 1 is used to estimate a functional form for the semivariance (i.e., a curve that represents the semivariance only as a function of distance). Second, the semivariance function thus estimated is used to determine the weights needed to define the contribution of each sampled point to the interpolation. Sample points close to the point for which an interpolation is to be generated contribute most to the interpolation, essentially defining a neighborhood. Computationally, it is often desirable to choose a limited number of sample points to perform the interpolation, since the weights from distant sample points are often negligible and the error associated with leaving them out is minuscule (Cressie 1991).\nAfter values interpolated by kriging are obtained, it is possible to obtain the standard errors associated with kriging predictions. Generally, for the kriging that we have done (e.g., Maurer 1994), standard errors tend to be highest at the edge of the geographic range of a species, and lowest in the vicinity of sample points within the regions of highest abundance for the species. This means that there is a higher degree of uncertainty associated with identifying the boundaries of a species' geographic range than with estimating its spatial pattern of abundance within those boundaries. This uncertainty is exacerbated in poorly sampled areas. Hence, we selected two species whose range corresponds to portions of the continent densely surveyed by the BBS. However, even with these heavily sampled species, apparently spurious isolines of abundance can be seen for both species at the northern edge of their range, as evidenced by the rectilinear sections of range boundaries (see Figs. 4 and 7) ."}, {"section_title": "TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL PATTERNS OF VARIATION IN ABUNDANCE", "text": "The average abundance of the Prairie Warbler declined gradually over the 1967-1989 period (Fig. 3), "}, {"section_title": "FIG. 4. Distribution of abundance of the Prairie Warbler (averaged for the 1967-1989 period). Contour lines represent 10% of maximum abundance (28 individuals per BBS route).", "text": "Areas in solid black indicate portions of the range where the species was estimated not to occur. although two periods of increase can be seen after 1979. During the 1967-1989 period, it was most abundant on the eastern and western slopes of the Appalachians, and its average abundance ranged between 0 and 2.8 individuals per BBS route virtually everywhere else in its range (Fig. 4) . Maps of population change ( (Fig. 7) . This center of abundance corresponds approximately to the Cumberland Plateau of the southern Appalachians. Areas of declining abundance were scattered throughout the range during the 1970-1980 period (Fig. 8A) , while they were concentrated in the regions of high abundance shown in Fig.  7 during the 1975-1985 period (Fig. 8B) (Fig. 6B) . These authors averaged abundance over 255 BBS routes where Cerulean Warblers were recorded at least once during that period, whereas our yearly averages were calculated based only on those 35-77 routes where the species was present in a given year. The trends recorded from both methods are especially different between 1985 and 1988. Our curve shows a sharp increase in 1986 followed by a decline, whereas average abundance remains very low according to the analysis of Robbins et al. (1992) (Fig. 6B) . Clearly, these different methods present different information on abundance trends. The decline seen in the Robbins et al. (1992) data set suggests that the number of routes with zero counts increased after the 1980 decline occurred. This implies that there was a shrinkage of the species range out of areas where it was formerly rare. The widespread areas with negative rates of change before 1980 (Fig. 8A) are consistent with this interpretation. It should be noted that BBS routes where Cerulean Warblers were not detected were also included in the kriging analyses.\nThe striking contrast in the abundance trends observed in the Cerulean Warbler using different methods demonstrates the sensitivity of these patterns to the quantitative approaches used. There is still considerable debate over the appropriate methods for analyzing large-scale population trends (e.g., James et al. At present, no predictions can be tested about the link between nonbreeding season mortality and spatial patterns of abundance change on the breeding grounds, since it is still unclear whether a population wintering in a particular region will migrate in the same flock or settle to breed in the same region the following spring, and vice versa. If there is a geographic correspondence between breeding and wintering populations, discrete areas of decline on the breeding grounds could be linked not only to breeding habitat alteration, but also to habitat destruction in specific regions on the wintering grounds. Conversely, if there is extensive mixing of breeding populations in the wintering range, wintering habitat alteration would be expected to have diffused, relatively undetectable effects on the breeding grounds (Wilcove and Terborgh 1984) , at least over short time scales.\nAn interesting approach to address this question is to examine the relative mixing of subspecies that have geographically discrete breeding distributions in the same wintering populations. Using this approach, Ramos and Warner (1980) found that several of the species wintering in their study area of Mexico were represented by two or more subspecies whose breeding range was sometimes distinct. Additional studies based or experimental studies of populations breeding in habitat fragments with populations breeding in continuous habitat provide useful information on the demographics underlying local population change. In addition to these studies, we suggest that more attention should be given to landscape-scale dynamics, not only on the breeding grounds but also on the wintering grounds. Little is known about the effects of habitat patchiness and fragmentation on survival rates of wintering birds.\nFocus on local and regional population dynamics can only provide part of the picture needed to develop a reliable understanding of how populations of Neotropical migrants respond to global environmental change (Root and Schneider 1993) . As shown by the results presented here, analyses of continental-scale population dynamics must recognize that processes and patterns at lower scales will be highly heterogeneous, Some of the major pieces of information missing in our current picture are continental-level censuses of wintering bird populations in Central and South America comparable to databases like the Breeding Bird Survey. Is geographic range fragmentation more or less evident on the wintering ranges of Neotropical migrants than on their breeding ranges? Are continental populations of these species increasing or decreasing on their wintering ranges? Answers to these questions will require cooperative efforts among conservation agencies of many countries. Such international conservation efforts have the potential to reap profound rewards in helping conservation biologists to develop a model of the annual cycle of Neotropical migrant birds, and a better understanding of how they might respond to global change."}]
