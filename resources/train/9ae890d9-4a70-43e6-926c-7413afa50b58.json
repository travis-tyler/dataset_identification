The parent questionnaire was available in both English and Spanish versions and was designed to collect information about factors that influence the educational attainment and participation of NELS:88 sample members and their transition from high school to postsecondary education and the work place. The parent questionnaire explored family background and socioeconomic characteristics, and the character of the home educational support system. These data provide a basis for understanding the effects on student educational outcomes of parental behaviors relating to student course selection, planning for postsecondary education, and participation in school activities and non-school extracurricular activities. The parent questionnaire collected data related to parental behaviors and circumstances about which the parent may be more knowledgeable than the teenager, such as parental education and occupation. The parent questionnaire also contained more sensitive items relating to income and family history and items relating to parents' educational expectations for their teenager. The parent data is the definitive data source for examining the relationship between student measures and family background and characteristics.

Unlike the base year parent survey, parent data were collected in the second follow-up study from a subsample of parents of NELS:88 student and dropout participants. During data collection, a parent subsample was selected according to the priority of the subgroup of the sample in which the parent's teenager was included. 1,601 parents were excluded thriugh the subsampling process leaving the final sample of 17,750 parents. Whereas 17,750 parents were included in the final sample, only 17,610 parents are included on the public use data file. The base year parent unweighted completion rate was 92.1 percent and the second follow-up parent unweighted completion rate was 93.2 percent. Of the 17,610 parents included on the second follow-up public use data file, a base year parent questionnaire was completed for 84.2 percent of the second follow-up respondents' teenagers, which means that 84.2 percent of the 1988 to 1992 student panel have parent data available in both 1988 and 1992. A special parent weight, F2PAQWT, has been constructed for use with the second follow-up parent data. F2PAQWT accounts for subsampling and adjusts for parent nonresponse. Chapter HI includes a complete discussion of the second follow-up parent weight."}, {"section_title": "13", "text": "F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual"}, {"section_title": "1.3", "text": "The Second Follow-Up Parent Survey Respondents Because the parent questionnaire was designed to be completed by only one parental respondent, the cover letter to the questionnaire and the questionnaire itself indicated that the parent or guardian who was most knowledgeable about the teenager's current situation should complete the questionnaire. Guided by this criterion, the parent respondent was self-selected. It should be noted that insofar as the parent questionnaire focused on general home and family issues, it should have made little difference which parent or guardian completed the questionnaire. Still the possibility exists that there may be, between the parents in two-parent homes, systematic gender or role differences in perceptions of family and school issues. Such differences may have influenced responses to, in particular, the more subjective items in the parent survey. In particular, a given teenager's parents may differ significantly in their responses to questions measuring their aspirations for the teenager. In the base year parent survey, the parent questionnaire was completed by the mother approximately 77.7 percent of the time, by the father 17.5 percent of the time, by other respondents such as a stepparent, grandparent, or other relative or guardian 4.0 percent of the time, and the remaining 0.7 percent were not identified. (These figures do not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.) Similarly, the parent questionnaire data used to construct the second follow-up data file was completed 78.5 percent of the time by the mother of the sampled teenager, 15.5 percent of the time by the father, 4.6 percent of the time by other respondents such as a stepparent, grandparent, or another adult relative or guardian, and the remaining 1.4 percent were not identified. Although the mother of the sampled student or dropout completed the majority of the base year and second follow-up parent questionnaires, it is difficult to ascertain whether the same respondent reported on the teenager in the base year and second follow-up. In both the base year and second followup parent questionnaires, respondents were asked to identify their relationship to the sampled student or dropout. Because the family of the teenager may have changed between 1988 and 1992, one cannot know definitively whether the same parent or guardian completed the parent questionnaire in both rounds. For example, if the data indicate that the grandmother of the teenager completed the questionnaire in the base year and second follow-up, the questionnaire does not elicit whether the same grandmother completed the questionnaire in 1992 as in 1988."}, {"section_title": "1.4", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Structure of the Parent Data File", "text": "The student and dropout samples constitute the basic units of analysis in the NELS:88 second follow-up. All other data sets, including the parent, teacher, and school components, are intended primarily to supplement the student and dropout data. Even though data for each respondent population can be analyzed separately, only the student and dropout data sets constitute representative stand-alone, national samples. While in various respects the parent data set after subsampling resembles a representative or probability sample of the parents of eligible students and dropouts who were in eighth grade in 1988, several features of the NELS:88 second follow-up parent component depart from the strict requirements of a probability sample. For example, a very small but unknown number of parents had more than one sampled student or dropout and therefore had more than one chance of being selected in the parent sample. Second, the parent sample was self-selected, and only one parent could participate. Finally, only if the student or dropout completed a questionnaire was a completed parent questionnaire included on the public or restricted use parent files. The primary purpose of the parent data file is to provide student and dropout-related contextual information that can be linked to individual records on the NELS:88 second follow-up student and dropout files. However, the parent data may be used for separate analyses using the parent questionnaire weight, F2PAQWT, included on the data file. Although analysis can be restricted, if the analyst chooses, to the parent sample only, it should be noted that the parent data used with the parent weight dczs not provide a strict probability sample of parents. Instead, after selecting an appropriate student group (e.g., panel sample student or dropout, twelfth-grade cross-sectional sample student or dropout), the NELS:88 second follow-up parent data can provide a nationwide cross-section of the \"self-defined\" most knowledgeable parent or guardian of that student group."}, {"section_title": "1.5", "text": "Organization of the Data User's Manuals NELS:88 data sets have been produced in both public use and restricted use form. The public use data files reflect alteration or suppression of some of the original data imposed to minimize the risk of statistical disclosure of the identity of responding individuals and institutions. The restricted use files preserve the original data free of all confidentiality edits. Data files with high disclosure potential, specifically the transcript file and the school effectiveness study file, are available in restricted form only. This manual may be utilized with both the public use and restricted use data files. Variables that were modified or suppressed on the public use files, but appear on the restricted use version of the data, are included in the codebook in their modified public use form. A more detailed discussion of measures used to preserve respondent confidentiality, and of procedures for gaining access to restricted use data, may be found in section 1.9 of this manual. However, the parent restricted use and public use files differ only slightly. F2BIRTHY (the year of the teenager's birth), has been recoded on the public use file, and race variables have been suppressed for the parents of a small number of teenagers to protect confidentiality. The restricted use parent file contains an additional population, students who were freshened in the first follow-up or second follow-up who dropped out prior to data collection, which was excluded from the public use file. In addition to documentation for the restricted use transcript and school effectiveness study data files, one manual has been produced to accompany each of the five public release files (student, dropout, parent, teacher, and school) for the NELS:88 second follow-up. Each manual furnishes the user with information and documentation about NELS:88 and the specific public release data file. A set of four data file user's manuals was also produced and released to accompany each of the four public release data files of the base year and each of the four public release data files of the first follow-up survey.

The first of the NELS projects, the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72), began in the spring of 1972 with a survey of a national probability sample of 19,001 seniors from 1,061 public, secular private, and church-affiliated high schools. The sample was designed to be representative of the approximately three million high school seniors enrolled in more than 17,000 schools in the spring of 1972. Each sample member was asked to complete a student questionnaire and a 69-minute test battery. School administrators were also asked to supply survey data on each student, as well as information about the schools' programs, resources, and grading systems.

In addition to background information, the NLS-72 base year and follow-up surveys collected data on respondents' educational activities, such as schools attended, grades received, and degree of satisfaction with their educational institutions. Participants were also asked about work experiences, periods of unemployment, job satisfaction, military service, marital status, and children. Attitudinal information on self-concept, goals, participation in political activities, and ratings of their high schools are other topics for which respondents have supplied information."}, {"section_title": "High School and Beyond of the 1980s: HS&B", "text": "The next major longitudinal study sponsored by NCES was High School and Beyond. HS&B was initiated in order to capture changes that had occurred in education-related and more general social conditions, in federal and state programs, and in the needs and characteristics of students since the time of the earlier survey. Thus, HS&B was designed to maintain the flow of education data to policymakers at all levels who need to base their decisions on data that are reliable, relevant, and current. Base year data collection was conducted in the spring of 1980. Students were selected using a two-stage probability sample with schools as the first-stage units and students within schools as the second-stage units. Unlike NLS-72, HS&B included cohorts of both tenth and twelfth graders. Since the base year data collection in 1980, four follow-ups of the HS&B cohorts have been completed: one in the spring of 1982; one in the spring of 1984; one in the spring of 1986, and (for the sophomore cohort only) one in the spring of 1992. The four NELS program cohorts (NLS-72 seniors, the HS&B sophomores and seniors, and NELS:88 eighth graders) are displayed in Figure 1-2 according to their initial and subsequent survey years and their modal age at the time of each survey. As illustrated, NLS-72 seniors were first surveyed   when these respondents were about thirty-two years of age. The HS&B cohorts have been surveyed at points in time that would permit as much comparison as possible with the time points selected for NLS-72. NELS:88 is designed to fit into this larger analytical scheme. The NELS:88 first follow-up sophomore class of 1990 parallels the HS&B sophomore class of 1980; similarly, the second follow-up senior class of 1992 will parallel the 1980 and 1982 HS&B, and 1972 NLS-72 senior classes."}, {"section_title": "1.7", "text": "The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88): Overview The base year of the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) represented the first stage of a major longitudinal effort designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by students as they leave elementary school and progress through high school and into postsecondary institutions or the work force. This study of the 1988 eighth-grade cohort collects data about educational processes and outcomes pertaining to student learning, predictors of dropping out, and the effects of schools on students' access to programs and equal opportunity to learn. The first follow-up in 1990 provided the first opportunity for longitudinal measurement of the 1988 baseline sample. It also provided a comparison point to high school sophomores ten years before, as studied in HS&B. The study captured the population of early dropouts (those who leave school between the end of eighth grade and the end of tenth grade), while monitoring the transition of the student population into secondary schooling. Freshening the NELS:88 sample to represent the tenth-grade class of 1990 makes trend comparisons with the HS&B sophomore cohort possible.' The second follow-up took place in 1992, when most sample members entered the second term of their senior year. The second follow-up provides a culminating measurement of learning in the course of secondary school, and also collects information that will facilitate investigation of students' transition into the labor force and postsecondary education after high school. Freshening the NELS:88 sample to represent the twelfth-grade class of 1992 makes trend comparisons with the senior cohorts that were studied in NLS-72 and HS&B possible. The NELS:88 second follow-up resurveyed students who were identified as dropouts in 1990, and identified and surveyed those additional students who left school after the first follow-up. The third follow-up is occurring in 1994, when most sample members will be in postsecondary education or in the labor market. The goals of the 1994 round are to provide data for trend comparisons with NLS-72 and HS&B, and to continue cross-wave comparisons with previous NELS:88 rounds. The third follow-up will permit researchers to assess the effect of eighth-grade and high school curricular experiences on postsecondary education choice. The third follow-up will provide the means by which access of individuals with different backgrounds to quality educational institutions can be examined. The third follow-up will facilitate study of the influences of high school education experiences on postsecondary education and employment opportunities and choices. Labor force participation, postsecondary persistence, curricular progress, and family formation are further research topics which will be explored by the third follow-up. Additionally, the third follow-up will provide a basis for Note, however, that the HS&B 1980 sophomore cohort in 1982 does not strictly constitute a representative sample of the nation's 1982 seniors, but rather a representative sample of 1980 sophomores two years later. Because of the sample freshening that took place in NELS:88 (but not in HS&B), the subset of NELS:88 sample members who were high school seniors in the spring of 1992 are nationally representative of seniors and are comparable to the NLS-72 and HS&B 1980 probability samples of twelfth graders. 2 1 7 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual assessing how many dropouts have returned to school and by what route, and will measure the access of dropouts to vocational training programs and to other postsecondary institutions. A fourth follow-up will take place in 1997 or 1998. 1.7.1 NELS:88 Study Objectives NELS:88's major features include the integration of student, dropout, parent, teacher, and school studies; the initial concentration on an eighth-grade student cohort with follow-ups at two year intervals; the inclusion of supplementary components to support analyses of geographically or demographically distinct subgroups; and the design linkages to previous longitudinal studies and other current studies. Multiple research and policy objectives are addressed through the NELS:88 design. The study is intended to produce a general purpose data set for the development and examination of federal educational policy. Part of its aim is to inform decision makers, education practitioners, and parents about the changes in the operation of the educational system over time, and the effects of various elements of the system on the lives of the individuals who pass through it. Specifically, NELS:88 focuses on a number of interrelated policy issues including: identification of school attributes associated with achievement; the transition of different types of students from eighth grade to secondary school; the transition of secondary students to postsecondary education or the work force; the influence of ability grouping and program type on future educational experiences and achievements; determinants of dropping out of the educational system; and changes in educational practices over time. One of the defining features of NELS:88 is the extensive attention it gives to the role of parents. The second follow-up parent survey (the parent survey was also conducted in 1988) gathered data on the effect of parents' attitudes and behaviors on educational or career choices, financial preparation for postsecondary education, the correlates of active parental involvement in the school, and the parent's role in the educational success of their children. Appendix C provides an overview of some of the key policy issues of education research and the second follow-up student, dropout, and parent items which are related to them. The NELS:88 design enables researchers to conduct analyses on three principal levels: crosswave, cross-sectional at a single time point, and cross-cohort by comparing NELS:88 findings to those of HS&B and NLS-72. The first of these levels provides NELS:88 with its primary objective: to serve the purposes of longitudinal measurement. The sampling and data collection designs give priority to maintaining and surveying a substantial number of base year sample members, as well as to sustaining overlapping but analytically distinct cohorts of sophomores and seniors.' Users of NELS:88 data will be able to study the effect of a wide variety of factors on students' educational and professional attainment. The longitudinal data gathered from students, and augmented through parent, teacher, school administrator, and school record (for example, academic transcripts) accounts of students' progression and development, will facilitate scrutiny of various facets of students' lives--their problems and concerns, their relationships with parents, peers, and teachers, and the characteristics of their schools--and permit examination of the impact of these factors on social, behavioral, and educational development. The second analytic level within NELS:88 is cross-sectional. By beginning with a cross-section of 1988 eighth graders, following a substantial subsample of these students at two-year intervals, and freshening the 1990 and 1992 samples to obtain representative national cross-sections of tenth and twelfth graders, the study also provides a statistical profile of America's eighth graders, high school sophomores, F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual and high school seniors. Figure 1-3 lists the NELS:88 survey components, instruments, and modal grades for the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up. Figure 1-4 illustrates the longitudinal design of NELS:88. Finally, NELS:88 has been designed to provide researchers with data for drawing comparisons with previous NCES longitudinal studies. After the release of NELS:88 first follow-up data, researchers were able to conduct trend analyses with the 1980 sophomore cohort of HS&B. With completion of the NELS:88 second follow-up, comparisons may be made among NELS:88, HS&B, and NLS-72 senior cohorts. To facilitate cross-cohort comparisons, many of the content areas contained in the HS&B base year survey were repeated in each wave of NELS:88, and data processing and file conventions have been kept consiste,nt, to the maximum extent feasible, with HS&B and NLS-72. For users specifically interested in conducting trend analyses of NLS-72, HS&B and NELS:88 data, further information on content and design similarities and differences between these three studies is presented in Appendix D of the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Student Component Data File User's Manual."}, {"section_title": "Base Year Study and Sample Design", "text": "The base year study design comprised four components: surveys and tests of students, and surveys of parents, school administrators, and teachers. A student questionnaire gathered information about basic background variables and a range of other topics including school work, educational and occupational aspirations, and social relationships. Students also completed a series of curriculum-sensitive cognitive tests to measure educational achievement and cognitive growth between eighth and twelfth grades in four subject areas--reading, mathematics, science, and social studies (history/government). One parent of each student was asked to respond to a parent survey intended to measure parental aspirations for children, family willingness to commit resources to children's education, the home educational support system, and other family characteristics relevant to achievement. A school administrator questionnaire was completed by school principals or headmasters. It gathered descriptive information about the school's teaching staff, the school climate, characteristics of the student body, and school policies and programs. Finally, selected teachers in two of the four subject areas completed a teacher questionnaire designed to collect data about school and teacher characteristics, evaluations of the selected students, course content, and classroom teaching practices. In the NELS:88 base year, a two-stage stratified probability design was used to select a nationally representative sample of eighth-grade schools and students. Schools constituted the primary sampling unit; the target sample size for schools was 1,032. A pool of 1,032 schools was selected through stratified sampling with probability of selection proportional to eighth-grade size and with oversampling of private schools. A pool of 1,032 replacement schools was selected by the same method. Of the 1,032 initial selections, 30 proved to be ineligible. Of the 1,002 eligible selections, 698 participated. An additional 359 schools (supplied by alternative selections available from the replacement pool) also participated, for a total school sample of 1,057 cooperating schools, of which 1,052 schools (815 public schools and 237 private schools) contributed usable student data. For 1,035 of these 1,052 schools, both student and school administrator data were received. In the NELS:88 base year design, students were the secondary sampling unit. The second stage--student sampling--produced a random selection of 26,4323 students among participating sampled schools, resulting in participation by 24,599 spring term 1988 eighth graders. On average, each of the participating schools was represented by 23 student Figure 1- environments, participation in classes and extra-curricular activities, current jobs, their goals and aspirations, and opinions about themselves. Following the base year design, a school administrator questionnaire was completed by school principals, and two teachers of each student were asked to complete a teacher questionnaire. First-time participants in NELS:88 completed a new student supplement, containing basic demographic items which were asked in the base year but not repeated in the first follow-up. The first follow-up also surveyed and tested youths who had dropped out of school at some point between the spring term of the 1987-88 school year and the spring term of the 1989-90 school year. The dropout questionnaire collected information on a wide range of subjects, including reasons for leaving school, school experiences, absenteeism, family formation, plans for the future, employment, attitudes and self-concept, and home environment. The selection of students in the first follow-up was implemented in two stages. The first stage of sampling involved the selection of 21,474 students who were in the eighth-grade NELS:88 sample in 1988.5 Because some sophomores were not in the country, or were not in the eighth grade in the spring term of 1988, the representative subsample of the eighth-grade cohort was augmented through a process called freshening. The goal was to provide a representative sample of students enrolled in the tenth grade in the 1989-90 school year. Freshening added an additional 1,229 tenth graders (of whom 1,043 were found to be eligible and still retained after final subsampling) who were not contained in the base year sampling frame. Several components were added to the first follow-up to increase its analytic power. One of these enhancements, the base year ineligible (BYI) study, was added to the first follow-up in order to ascertain the 1990 school enrollment status and the 1990 NELS:88 eligibility status of students who were excluded from the base year survey due to a language barrier or physical or mental disability which precluded them from completing a questionnaire and cognitive test. Any eligible students were included in both the first and second follow-up. In addition to the BYI study, the school effectiveness study, designed to sustain analyses of school effectiveness issues, was conducted in conjunction with the first follow-up. The within-school F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual The second follow-up, in addition to surveying students who were enrolled in school, surveyed and tested youths who had dropped out of school at some point between the spring term of the 1987-88 school year and the spring term of the 1991-92 school year. The dropout and student questionnaires collected information on a wide range of subjects, including reasons for leaving school, school experiences, absenteeism, plans for the future, employment, attitudes and self-concept, and home environment.  Two new components, the transcript and the course offerings components, were added to the NELS:88 second follow-up. These components provide archival data which describes the academic experience of high school students and the curricula offered by their schools. The complete high school transcript record was collected for 1) the contextual samplestudents attending sampled schools in the spring of 1992; 2) all dropouts, dropouts in alternative programs, and early graduates, regardless of school affiliation; and 3) triple ineligibles enrolled in the twelfth grade in the spring of 1992, regardless of school affiliation. Triple ineligibles are sample members who were ineligible for the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up surveys due to mental or physical disability, or language barrier. NELS :88 course-taking data will provide not only a baseline against which future student outcome measures can be compared, but will illuminate trends when contrasted to the 1982 HS&B high school transcript study, the 1987 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) transcript study, and the 1990 NAEP transcript study. The course offerings component provides curriculum data from second follow-up school effectiveness study schools through which school effects on student outcomes can be studied. The school effectiveness study (SES) was added to the first follow-up to provide a probability sample of tenth-grade schools, with a sizable and representative within-school sample of students, through which longitudinal school-level analysis (comparable to 1980-82 HS&B sophomore cohort analysis) could be conducted. In the first follow-up school effectiveness study, permission to conduct the study was gained from 251 schools and 248 of those schools were final first follow-up SES participants. The second follow-up school effectiveness study returned to 247 of the 251 cooperating first follow-up SES schools (one school became ineligible), conducting freshening on both longitudinal and SES sample members, and selecting additional students from the pool including students who transferred into the school since the 1989 selection of SES students. The second follow-up school effectiveness study was enhanced by the addition of archival data collected by the new course offerings component, and was further augmented by the administration of free response science and mathematics cognitive test items in SES schools. 1.8"}, {"section_title": "NE1S:88 Sponsors", "text": "The NELS:88 sponsor, the U.S. Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), provided federal agencies, states, and educational institutions with an opportunity to expand the scope of the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up studies and enrich them through a variety of means. Enhancements sponsored by various groups included: sample supplements for states to provide representative state samples, oversamples of specific student groups, supplemental questions for various data collection instruments, and supplemental questionnaires."}, {"section_title": "Sample Supplements and,Augmentations", "text": "Sample supplements and augmentations for the second follow-up were sponsored by various sources.

While this manual is specifically designed for use with the public release files, it is also appropriate for use with the restricted data. Because multilevel microdata (that is, individual-level data from multiple, linkable sources) carries with it some risk of statistical disclosure of institutional or individual identities, the NELS:88 data have been extensively analyzed to determine which items of information, used alone, in conjunction with other key variables, or in conjunction with public external sources such as school universe files, have significant disclosure potential. Variables that were found to pose significant disclosure risks were suppressed or altered to remove or substantially reduce such risks. For example, in some cases, continuous variables have been recast as categorical variables, or fine-grained categorical variables have been more grossly recategorized. In a few instances, data elements have been suppressed or changed. Because of this, a particular school or individual student might be characterized in terms of a certain variable on the restricted use version of the NELS:88 data, but be coded to missing on the public files, coded to an adjacent response category, or included in a code which collapsed two or more response categories. These suppressions and recodes have been clearly labelled in the codebooks included in each data file user's manual. While the extremely high value that is placed on confidentiality--not only by federal statute, but also by NCES and contractor standards--justifies these alterations of the data, it is recognized that some of these protections against disclosure may at times reduce the analysis potential of certain variables in the data set. For example, when only ranges of percentages are given for a variable, threshold points that may be important for some analyses may be obscured, or nonlinearities in relationships hidden. No 31 15 F2: Parent component Data File User's Manudl matter how thoughtfully continuous variables are transformed into categorical form, different cut points for the categories may be desirable, depending on one's particular analytic purposes. While most suppressed data will have only a negligible effect on most analyses, there are times when the suppressed information is critical. For this reason, NCES also makes restricted use data files available to qualified researchers with a proven need for the data in its restricted use form. To obtain the restricted use data, it is necessary for an organization to obtain a licensure agreement from NCES. The agreement must be signed by the principal investigator and by someone authorized to commit the organization to the legal requirements. In addition, each professional or technical staff member with access to the data must sign and have notarized an affidavit of nondisclosure.

Data Collection Instruments", "text": "This chapter provides a brief description of the survey instruments and cognitive tests used in the NELS:88 second follow-up. The data collection instruments for the second follow-up were similar in content and form to those utilized in the prior waves. The instruments included a parent, student, dropout, school administrator, and teacher questionnaire, and a cognitive test for students and dropouts. The new student supplement, added in the first follow-up to elicit demographic information from newly freshened students, was again administered in the second follow-up. An early graduate supplement was added for students who graduated from high school before their in-school data collection session in the spring of 1992. Instrument development was guided by the research objectives of NELS:88. Questionnaires were designed to meet the longitudinal goals of the study, and items were chosen based on their utility in predicting or explaining future outcomes as measured in the second follow-up or later survey waves. All of the questionnaires employed in the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up surveys were framed to provide continuity and consistency with earlier NCES education longitudinal studies, as well as to address new areas of policy concern and to reflect recent directions in theory. Where appropriate, NELS:88 drew test and questionnaire content from NLS-72, HS&B, and other NCES studies, such as the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the Schools and Staffing Study (SASS), to ensure a common standard of measurement that would permit comparisons with other important data sources, and maximize the utility of NELS:88 data. For example, NELS:88 mathematics tests were designed so that NELS:88 and NAEP test scores can be equated, and so that HS&B and NELS:88 mathematics test results can be equated as well. Appendix D of the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Student Component Data File User's Manual contains an outline of the items which overlap between the NELS:88 base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up student questionnaires, the NLS-72 base year student questionnaire, and the base year HS&B senior cohort student questionnaire. Appendix D of this manual contains a crosswalk between the questionnaire items in the NELS:88 base year and second follow-up parent surveys and the HS&B parent surveys. A field test of the NELS:88 second follow-up conducted in 1990 and 1991 examined survey instruments and procedures and played a key role in instrument development. Although the teacher component was not included in the second follow-up field test, the second follow-up field test did include six other survey components: the school administrator, student, the cognitive test battery, dropout, and parent surveys, and the transcript component.' Upon completion of field test data collection, the information uthered was used to inform planning for the main study. Analysis of field test data was also used to improve the measurement properties of test and questionnaire items, as well as to identify items which needed to be modified or deleted for reasons of instrument length or item format. A detailed description of the second follow-up field test can be found in the Field Test Report: National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 Second Follow-Up.' The content areas of the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up questionnaires are similar.

The objective of the parent questionnaire was to provide data that could be used primarily in the analysis of student behaviors and outcomes, and only secondarily as a data set by itself. The questions focused on family background and socioeconomic characteristics and on the character of the home educational support system. In addition, the parent instrument collected data related to parental behaviors and circumstances with which the student may not be familiar, such as parental education and occupation, and contained more sensitive questions about income, postsecondary educational costs and financial aid decisions, and religious affiliation. English and Spanish language versions of the questionnaire were made available to parents in the second follow-up as in the base year. The questionnaire was arranged thematically into six different sections. All parents were asked to complete the first five sections. Respondents who were asked to complete the sixth section of the questionnaire were parents or guardians who were 1) nonrespondents in the base year parent survey or 2) the parent or guardian of a sample member new to NELS:88 in the first follow-up or second followup. The content areas of these six sections are as follows: Information about the family's background. This section identifies the relationship between the respondent and the student or dropout sample member. Respondents identified the family size and composition and answered questions about their employment situation and occupation, race, and language background and skills. Information about the teenager's school life. This section elicits parental knowledge of key characteristics of the teenager's educational situation. The forms of interaction between the school and parent are included in this portion of the questionnaire. The teenager's family life. The third section of the questionnaire asks about the decision making process within the household and the kinds of interaction between the respondent and teenager. Included are sensitive questions about community life and drug and alcohol use by the teenager. The teenager's postsecondary plans. Parental aspirations for the teenager, preparations for postsecondary education, and plans for the teenager's transition to the workforce are covered. Financial information and educational costs. Family income and financial preparations for the teenager's postsecondary education are asked in this section. Supplemental questions for parents new to NELS:88. The final section of the questionnaire was only administered to parents who did not participate in the base year parent survey either because the parent or guardian was a base year nonrespondent or because the student was added to the sample in the first or second follow-up.

The second follow-up student questionnaire was available in both English and Spanish.' In addition to tin student questionnaire, students completed a series of cognitive tests which were also administered at their in-school or off-campus survey sessions. The combined tests covered four subject areas and included 116 items to be completed in 85 minutes.

Citizenship items included questions on the workings of the federal government and the rights and obligations of citizens. The geography questions touched on patterns of settlement and food production shared by other societies as well as our own. NORC's subcontractor, the Educational Testing Service (ETS), developed the cognitive test battery for the second follow-up. Six forms of the cognitive test battery were produced in the second follow-up, each comprising a different combination of mathematics and reading difficulty levels. Each sample member's test form was determined by his or her scores on the base year and/or first follow-up mathematics and reading tests; freshened students and first follow-up nonrespondents received the intermediate version of the second follow-up cognitive test battery. The purpose of the multilevel design of the second follow-up cognitive test battery was to guard against ceiling and floor effects which may occur when testing must span four years of schooling. This adaptive approach tailors the difficulty of the reading and mathematics tests to the ability of the respondent, thereby leading, given limitations in testing time, to a more accurate measurement than a single level design.

The dropout questionnaire collected data about the last school attended by the sample member and the school's climate, reasons for leaving school, and actions school personnel, parents, and friends took when the respondent :sopped going to school. Respondents also reported on F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual their likelihood of returning to and graduating from high school, and described their current activities, employment history, and future plans. The hour-long, self-administered questionnaire was normally completed with an interviewer present, at either a group or single survey session and was available in both English and Spanish. However, in some cases the dropout questionnaire was administered as a telephone interview. In addition to the dropout questionnaire, an 85-minute cognitive test battery was also administered to dropouts when possible. Because of the difficulty in collecting test data from dropouts, and because data from many dropouts was collected in telephone interviews which preclude testing, the NELS:88 second follow-up achieved a comparatively low 41.7 percent weighted cognitive test completion rate for dropouts. The dropout questionnaire was designed to facilitate comparisons with the NELS:88 second follow-up student questionnaire, the first follow-up dropout questionnaire, and the HS&B 1982 dropout questionnaire. This item overlap with the student questionnaire permits users to contrast factors such as school environment, family life, aspirations, and self-perceptions of students with the responses of dropouts.

The information obtained through the school administrator questionnaire provides supplemental data to that provided by the student questionnaire so that student outcomes can be considered in terms of school measures. In the second follow-up, a self-administered, forty-five minute school administrator questionnaire was completed by the school principal, headmaster, or other knowledgeable school official designated by the school administrator of NELS:88 schools. The questionnaire was divided into five content areas as described below: General school characteristics, such as grade span, school and twelfth-grade enrollment sizes, and school control and demographic characteristics.

Within each stratum, schools were selected with probabilities proportional to their estimated eighth-grade enrollment to achieve virtual self-weighting. In addition, schools were oversampled in certain special strata so that policy-relevant subgroups would be adequately represented in the sample. Within each school approximately 26 students were to be randomly selected (typically, 24 regularly sampled students and two, on average, OBEMLA-supplement Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander oversampled. students). In schools with fewer than 24 eighth graders, all eligible students were selected. Because of the incidence of small schools in the NELS:88 sample, the average--within school sample size for the base year--was 25 students (or 23 participating students). From a national frame of about 39,000 schools with eighth grades, a target sample size of 1,032 schools was set. Some 1,052 schools--815 public and 237 private--participated and provided usable eighth-grade student data. NORC's sampling frame was the school database compiled by Quality Education Data, Inc. (QED) of Denver, Colorado. The QED list contained information about whether a school was urban, suburban, or rural. NORC used this information for stratification purposes. The QED list did not at that time contain information about the racial/ethnic composition of individual public schools usable for the NELS:88 sampling frame. Racial/ethnic composition data were obtained from Westat, Inc. in its capacity as an NORC subcontractor for the NELS:88 base year study. As part of their work on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), Westat had obtained data from the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) and from other sources (e.g., district personnel) that identified those schools with a minority enrollment of greater than 19 percent. Use of this data set facilitated the explicit stratification and allocation of schools with very large percentages of black or Hispanic students.

First, the sample was to include approximately 21,500 students who were in the eighth-grade sample in 1988 (including base year nonrespondents). This longitudinal cohort was to be distributed across 1,500 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual schools. Second, the sample was to constitute a valid probability sample of all students currently enrolled in the tenth grade in the 1989-1990 school year. This entailed freshening the sample with students who were tenth graders in 1990 but not in the eighth grade during the 1987-1988 school year. Third, the first follow-up was to include a sample of students who had been deemed ineligible for base year data collection (because physical, mental, or linguistic barriers prevented them from participating) so that those able to take part could be added to the first follow-up student sample, and demographic and school enrollment information could be obtained for them. Longitudinal Cohort. The general sample design strategy for this component of the sample involved subsampling students selected for the base year with non-zero probabilities related to characteristics of their 1990 schools. Base year students who had dropped out of school between 1988 and 1990 were subsampled with certainty (their probabilities of selection were set equal to one). Base year students attending school in 1990 were subsampled with probabilities related to the number of other base year students attending the same school. Base year students who were reported to be attending a school with at least 10 other base year students were sampled with certainty. All other students were sampled with probabilities greater than zero, but less than one. Including nonrespondents, the NELS:88 base year sample comprised 26,432 students. Of these, 96 were deemed out of scope for the 1990 first follow-up (including students who had died or moved out of the United States). Among the remaining 26,336 students, 348 were found to have dropped out of school; all of these students were selected into the first follow-up with certainty (probability of selection equal to one).' Distribution of Students in Schools. It was determined that the remaining pool of 25,988 students were distributed among 3,967 schools.' As had been anticipated, the distribution of these students among schools was highly skewed. It was found that approximately 75 percent of the students (19,568 of 25,988) were attending approximately 23 percent (908 of 3,967) of the schools; each of these schools included at least 11 base year students. All of these 19,568 students were included in the first follow-up with certainty. The remaining 6,420 students were distributed among 3,059 schools with 10 or fewer members of the base year sample. Their sampling probabilities for the first follow-up depended on the number of base year students the school contained. The efficiency of this design relative to one with no subsampling at all was 66.5 percent.' These schools--or, more precisely, clusters of base year students--were subsampled to achieve the final NELS:88 first follow-up school sample, after the conclusion of the 1989 spring term.

For a very small number of sampled student and dropout participants, there was no adult parent or guardian who was responsible or knowledgeable about the teenager, and the parent of the sampled student or dropout was considered out of scope for the collection of a parent questionnaire. The small number of cases excluded from the parent survey for this reason fell into two general situations: the teenager had been married and living away from the teenager's biological family for several years; or the teenager's parent had been incarcerated for several years and the teenager was living independently. In both situations, there was no parent or guardian who could report on the student or dropout participant. Selection of the Parent Subsample. During the data collection period, a subsample of parents was selected to ensure that completion rates for key subgroup populations were comparable with other subgroups. The probability of a parent's selection for the subsample was determined by the priority of the subpopulation of the parent's teenager. Subsampling occurred when seventy percent of data collection was completed at which point all parents for whom a questionnaire had not yet been collected received a selection probability. Four subpopulations (parents of dropouts; parents of students attending private schools; parents of students who .-,;te white, attended public school, and whose socioeconomic status was in the lowest quartile; and parents of black students) were retained with certainty; their selection probability was set to 1.0.

The second sampling objective was to create a valid probability sample of students enrolled in tenth grade in the 1989-1990 school year; this goal was achieved by a process called freshening. The freshening procedure was carried out so that students who were not enrolled in the eighth grade in the U.S. in 1988 had a chance of being selected for the sample. The freshening process could yield zero, one, or more than one new sample member in a given school. A total of 1,229 new students 'vere added to the tenth-grade sample--on average, just less than one student per school. Some of these freshened students were dropped in the subsampling process described below either because they themselves were not included in the subsample or because the base year student to whom they were linked was not included. Some 1,043 students selected through the freshening procedure remained in the final first follow-up sample. Subsampling the Eighth-Grade Cohort and Freshened Sophomore Samples. After the initial selection of the longitudinal cohort, the combined longitudinal-freshened sample was further subsampled. The students dropped from the first follow-up as a result of subsampling were also excluded in the second follow-up. Two categories of sample members were subsampled: 1) students who had transferred out of the school from which they had initially been selected for the first follow-up sample; and 2) first follow-up nonrespondents who were classified as potential dropouts. NORC selected a 20 percent subsample of transfer students and a 50 percent sample of \"potential dropouts.\" Table 3.1.3-1 lists the first follow-up sample by race and means of entry into the sample.

The NELS:88 base year sample excluded students for whom the NELS:88 survey instruments would he unsui+lble (i.e., students with a mental disability and students who are not proficient in English) and students whose physical or emotional problems would have made participation in the survey unduly difficult. A final sample of 653 of these students were selected for a followback study of these students.

Additionally, it was necessary to reassess the eligibility status of selected students found in previous waves to he ineligible, and to include them in the cohort if they were determined to be eligible for the second follow-up. Second, to continue the examination of the dropping out phenomenon, dropouts were to be retained with certainty.

It was hoped that these goals could be achieved with minimal loss to both sample efficiency and effective sample size. Longitudinal Cohort. When second follow-up tracing of cohort members was completed, it was found that the first follow-up sample (that is, the sum of base year respondents and nonrespondents retained after first follow-up subsampling and first follow-up freshened students) was much more widely dispersed than had been anticipated. After eliminating the locations of the \"known\" dropouts' (N=1,564) from consideration (dropouts were sampled with certainty), the remaining eligible sample of students (N=18,726) was dispersed among 3,224 schools/locations. Including dropouts, there were 4,788 4 In the second follow-up, dropouts were defined differently for sampling purposes than for data collection purposes. (See the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Dropout Component Data File User's Manual, section 4.3.1 for further details regarding the definition of dropouts for data collection and assignment of questionnaire.) For sampling purposes, dropouts comprised all individuals who were classified in the first follow-up as ever having dropped out -that is, dropouts (individuals who were not enrolled in school in the spring term of 1990) and stopouts (spring term 1990 students with a recorded 1988-1990 dropout episode), regardless of their school enrollment status as of the second follow-up spring term 1991 tracing effort. In other words, dropouts who had since returned to school and stopouts who remained in school were still counted as dropouts for sampling purposes, along with institutionalized individuals and the additional dropouts identified during second follow-up tracing."}, {"section_title": "29", "text": "F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual locations. Once non-school locations associated with dropouts, early graduates, institutionalized sample members, home study students, and unlocatable sample members were subtracted from the total, there were 2,258 school sites. It was clear that even if no attempt were made to satisfy the second goal--retention with near certainty of Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians from the first follow-up sample--that the fifth goal of achieving a cluster of students in 1,500 schools could not be met without significant losses in sample efficiency, effective sample size, or both. Table 3.1.4-1 shows the distribution of students eligible for second follow-up sampling (excluding dropouts) by school size, as well as the number of schools with at least one sample member who was either Hispanic, Asian, or American Indian. The data in the table indicated that to achieve disproportionate retention of minority students most of the schools containing these students would have to be selected, leaving few additional sample selections to distribute among the remaining school sites and contradicting the initial sampling plan to include with certainty any school with at least five NELS:88 sample members enrolled at the school. After consideration of several alternative allocations--taking into account the negative effects of subsampling on sample efficiency, the strong desire to retain as many Hispanics, Asians, and American Indians as possible, and the substantial investment made in two prior rounds in obtaining student, parent, teacher, and school data for those students who would have been subsampled out--it was decided to include all first follow-up sample members in the second follow-up sample. Initial Selection of the Second Follow-Up School Sample. All first follow-up sample members remaining after subsampling were included in the second follow-up (all sample members dropped from the first follow-up due to subsampling were also excluded from the second follow-up). Additionally, the school administrator, teacher, and transcript components were limited to a maximum of 1,500 schools. For this reason it was still necessary to select a sample of schools, although the students falling outside that sample would not be excluded from the study. For students in the 1,500 schools selected, the full range of data--student, school administrator, parent, teacher, and transcript data--were collected; for the students in a school not among those selected, only student and parent data were collected. A total of 2,258 schools were identified in the second follow-up tracing of the NELS:88 first follow-up sample; 1,500 of these were targeted for contextual data collection. In the spring of 1991, interviewers traced students to schools, and all 1,030 schools identified as having four or more first follow-up sample members enrolled were included in the school-level sample with certainty (i.e., probability of 1.0). Prior to the fall of 1991 the contextual school sample was finalized through the following sampling process. A random sample of 45 of the 60 (probability =0.75) schools containing three sample members was selected. A random sample of 104 of the 160 (probability =0.65) schools containing two first follow-up sample members was selected for retention. Finally, a random sample of 321 of the 1,008 (probability =0.31845) schools identified as containing one first follow-up sample member was selected for retention in the sample. In the fall of 1991 interviewers confirmed the enrollment of students at schools previously identified as enrolling three or fewer NELS:88 students. School Sample for Freshening Purposes. Like the first follow-up student and school samples, the movement of students among schools resulted in a somewhat amorphous base from which to select schools and collect data. Students could have transferred any time between the time they were traced to a specific school in the spring of 1991 to the fall of 1991, when they were freshened in the fall of 1991, and when student and school administrator data were collected during the spring of 1992. It was possible for students to transfer to either a school that had been identified as a NELS:88 second follow-up sampled school or to a non-NELS:88 school.  20  65  43  22   21   55  43   12   22  40   31   9  23  32  27   5  24   22.   21   25   13   12   26  6  6  0  27   6   5   28   5  3   2  29   7  6   30  4  2  2   31   5  5   0   32  2   1   33   1   1   0  34   1   1    35  2  2   36   3  3    37   1   1   38   1   0   1   40   1  1   0   41   2   1   1   44   1   0   1   4 7   31 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual Note: known school-leavers are not included in the numbers above.

The second follow-up parent sample consisted of a subsample of the parents of student and dropout participants. While there is generally a one-to-one relationship between parents and the student and dropout participants, several features of the NELS:88 second follow-up parent sample depart from the strict requirements of a probability sample. For example, a very small but unknown number of parents had more than one sampled student or dropout participant and therefore had more than one chance of being selected in the parent sample. Second, the parent sample was selfselected, and only one parent could participate. Finally, the survey used a broad definition of parent or guardian as the person who is responsible for the teenager and is most knowledgeable about the teenager's current situation. Under this definition, persons such as a grandparent, aunt, uncle, or other adult relative completed a small percentage of parent questionnaires. The primary purpose of the parent data file is to provide student-related contextual information that can be linked to individual records on the NELS:88 student file. The parent questionnaire weight, F2PAQWT, included on the parent data files, should be used for these analyses since it corrects for subsampling of parents and adjusts for parent nonresponse.

Because separate final student and school weights have been provided, the construction of each will be considered separately in the following discussion. Base Year School Weights. The final school weight, BYADMWT, was derived using a multistage process. First, an initial weight--which represented the inverse of the school's selection probability--was attached to each school record in a file containing records for all eligible schools in the NELS:88 sample.

This weight allows analysts to generate national statistics using the school administrator and teacher data despite the bias against small cluster sizes in sample selection.

F2F1PNWT This panel weight applies to all sample members who completed both a first follow-up and a second follow-up questionnaire, regardless of base year status.

F2PAQWT This cross-sectional weight applies to all parents included in the final parent sample for whom data were collected during the second follow-up. The Second Follow-Up Parent Weight: Cross-sectional and Panel Analyses. The second follow-up parent weight, F2PAQWT, accounts for the subsampling of the parent sample during data collection. It can be used in cross-sectional and panel analyses either in conjunction with student or dropout data or as a stand-alone data set. When using F2PAQWT with only the second follow-up parent data, it is important that the analyst be aware of the caveats discussed in sections 1.4 and 3.1.5. F2PAQWT is not adjusted for base year parent nonresponse, and it does not account for cases where the base year parent responded but cannot be included in a panel analysis because the second follow-up parent did not respond. Since F2PAQWT is not calibrated for panel analyses, researchers should use caution if employing F2PAQWT in longitudinal analyses involving base year and second follow-up parent data. They should carefully assess bias, relative to the subpopulations of interest and their specific analytic goals. Process for Calculation of Second Follow-Up Weights. A basic four-step process was defined for the calculation of all eight questionnaire weights. The first step, developing a classification scheme, F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual was done at the beginning of the weighting process for all students in the sample. The values remained static and were used throughout the process for all weights. Steps 2 through 4 were followed for all weights, but the results of each were tailored according to the characteristics of each weight's specific population. Step 1. Develop a classification scheme. All sample members were divided into basic sample groups depending upon their status during data collection for each of the three rounds of NELS:88. Freshened students were assigned the status of their linked student for those rounds where they had not been in the sample. Students for whom status was unknown had their status imputed based upon the distribution of status across others in their base year, first follow-up, or second follow-up categories and, where group size permitted, race and gender were also considered. The eight basic classification categories for a single round are defined as: In this classification scheme, \"dropout\" (following the High School and Beyond definition) generally refers to a student who has left a diploma-granting high school program. This included members who were not pursuing an education at all, home study students, members who were continuing their education in a non-traditional setting (e.g., preparing for the GED examination), and institutionalized sample members. There are two exceptions to this general rule. First, early graduates were included in the \"in school\" category. Second, because sample members who attended non-traditional schools during the first follow-up were classified as students then, they were treated as such during the calculation of their first follow-up status. \"Ineligible\" refers to members who were not given the questionnaires due to a language barrier or a mental or physical incapacity. \"Expected grade\" means tenth grade in the first follow-up and twelfth grade or early graduate in the second follow-up. Step 2. Establish second follow-up design weight. The design weight reflects the selection probabilities for each case for a given population. Sample members may have multiple design weights that vary depending upon the weight that is being calculated. For the weights unaffected by school sampling (F2QWT, F2PNLWT, F2F1PNWT) and for the dropouts, early graduates, and ineligible twelfth graders in F2TRSCWT,7 the design weight used is equal to the first follow-up design weight. Second follow-up freshened students take on the first follow-up design weight of the student they were linked to in the freshening process. When sample members are included due to their association with a sampled school in F2TRSCWT and for all members in the F2CXTWT population, it is equal to the first follow-up design weight divided by their school's second follow-up selection probability. For students represented in the parent sample, the calculation of F2PAQWT uses the first follow-up design weight divided by the parent's second follow-up selection probability. Step 3. Adjust for second follow-up nonresponse. Nonresponse adjustment cells were based upon combinations of the classification values from step 1 as well as race (Hispanic, API, other, unknown), and gender for the members of that weight's population. The second follow-up design weight for each responding sample member was inflated by a factor equal to the inverse of the weighted response rate for their cell. This yielded their nonresponse adjusted weight. This step was performed independently for each weight calculated. For second followup freshened students the nonresponse adjusted weight serves as their final weight. Step 4. Perform multidimensional raking. Sample members who were not freshened in the second follow-up had their second follow-up nonresponse adjusted weight further adjusted through a raking step. The total sum of the weights and percentage distributions that were used in raking were developed as follows: a) Targets were developed that used the second follow-up expanded sample weight. The second follow-up expanded weight is a weight that was calculated for every sample member in order to estimate national dropout rates.' It was used in developing total sum of weights targets to ensure consistency in dropout rates derived when using questionnaire weights. These targets were calculated separately for each of the eight questionnaire weights and reflected the characteristics of each weight's inference population. Two types of target numbers were developed. The sum of expanded weights for a given questionnaire weight's inference population was used as the target total population for that questionnaire weight. Weighted frequency distributions using the expanded weights associated with a questionnaire 8 Included in the transcript data files are approximately 90 students who were ineligible in all three rounds of NELS:88 and were seniors in 1992. For sample members not freshened in the second follow-up, the process involved using a multidimensional raking procedure to adjust the second follow-up design weight where the marginal target categories were based on roster race (API, Hispanic, other, unknown) and gender, base year school type, base year school region, base year school urbanicity, and the status values from the classification scheme described above in step 1. Target margins for the expanded weight were calculated using the first follow-up expanded sample weight (a similar weight developed in the first follow-up for estimating the 1988-90 dropout rate) for students for whom one was calculated and first follow-up design weights for the first follow-up sample members who did not receive a first follow-up expanded weight (such as the freshened). Second follow-up freshened students have their second follow-up design weight as their expanded sample weight. This step was performed for the sample as a whole."}, {"section_title": "56", "text": "F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual weight's inference population were calculated for the following: dropout rates between base year and first follow-up; dropout rates between first follow-up and second follow-up; and first follow-up status (from step 1) and second follow-up status (from step 1). b) Additional percentage targets were developed for raking using first follow-up weights. Calculated independently for each of the eight weights according to the characteristics of each inference population, these targets used F1QWT for sample members who had been eligible for the first follow-up questionnaire or the first follow-up design weight for those who were not. Weighted frequencies calculated using these weights were used as target distributions. These target categories included race (white, black, Hispanic, API, American Indian, unknown), gender, base year school region, base year school type, and base year school urbanicity.

Survey Standard Errors. Because the NELS:88 sample design involved stratification, disproportionate sampling of certain strata, and clustered (i.e. multi-stage) probability sampling, the resulting 41 5 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual statistics are more variable than they would have been had they been based on data from a simple random sample of the same size. The calculation of exact standard errors for survey estimates can he difficult and expensive. Popular statistical analysis packages such as SPSS (Statistical Program for the Social Sciences) or SAS (Statistical Analysis System) do not calculate standard errors by taking into account complex sample designs. Several procedures are available for calculating precise estimates of sampling errors for complex samples. Procedures such as Taylor Series approximations, Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR), and Jackknife Repeated Replication (JRR) produce similar results.' Consequently, it is largely a matter of convenience which approach is taken. For NELS:88, NORC used the Taylor Series procedure to calculate the standard errors. Design Effects. The impact of departures from simple random sampling on the precision of sample estimates is often measured by the design effect (designated as DEFF). For any statistical estimator such as a mean or a proportion, the design effect is the ratio of the estimate of the variance of a statistic derived from consideration of the sample design to that obtained from the formula for simple random samples. The square root of the design effect (also called the root design effect, and designated as DEFT) is also useful. The following formulas define the design effects and root design effect: where DESIGN-SE designates the standard error of an estimate calculated by taking into account the complex nature of the survey design, and SRS-SE designates the standard error of the same estimate calculated as if the survey design was a simple random sample."}, {"section_title": "Base Year Standard Errors and Design Effects", "text": "Selection of Base Year Items.

The same selection criteria were used for all omponents in selecting the items for standard error and design effect analysis. The first criterion was whether a question had been used in the NELS:88 base year analyses of standard errors and design effects. For the parent component this overlap resulted in the inclusion of 11 items. For the remaining 19 items, policy relevance was the second criterion for selecting items. This criterion was applied in order to ensure that variables that are important to analysts, thus likely to have a higher frequency of use, were represented. These items consisted primarily of critical items in the parent questionnaire. Resu:ts. Standard errors and design effects were calculated for each of the parent questionnaire items for the parent sample as a whole and for selected subgroups. The subgroups were based on the student respondent's sex, race/ethnicity, school type (public, Catholic, or other private), socioeconomic status (lowest quartile, middle two quartiles, and highest quartile), and urbanicity (urban, suburban, and rural). Student characteristics were used so that design effects for subgroups could be compared with those calculated using items from the student questionnaire, and to emphasize that students are the units of analysis by design in the NELS surveys.

This suggests that the cluster effect is higher than in the base year survey, perhaps representing greater homogeneity of responding among parents in this subgroup. Compared to the NELS:88 base year parent survey, the mean design effect from the second follow-up parent survey is higher (mean DEFF =2.48 in the base year parent survey, and 3.68 in the second follow-up parent survey). Second follow-up parent survey subgroup mean design effects fluctuate in their distance from the corresponding base year parent survey mean design effects. The differences are small but generally consistent with the overall finding of slightly larger design effects for the second follow-up data. This result is also consistent with the finding that student design effects are larger in the second follow-up survey, compared to the base year survey.

In this section, other sources of nonobservational error are discussed. Nonobservational error results from measurements not being taken from a portion of the population.12 Several factors comprise nonobservational error, including nonresponse biases caused by unit and item nonresponse and undercoverage. Nonresponse is readily quantified. While many data quality factors are difficult to measure in the non-experimental context of large-scale survey administration, NELS :88 offers the possibility of comparing reports from multiple sources, thereby permitting some approximate but useful validity parameters. Following is a discussion of nonobservational error in the parent component in terms of nonresponse. A detailed discussion of student undercoverage appears in the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Student Component Data File User's Manual."}, {"section_title": "Second Follow-Up Unit Nonresponse", "text": "Unit nonresponse occurs when an individual respondent (such as a parent, student, or teacher) declines to participate, or when the cooperation of a school cannot be secured. In the base year, an analysis of school-level nonresponse suggested that, to the extent that schools can be characterized by size, control, organizational structure, student composition, and so on, the impact of nonresponding schools on the quality of the student sample is small (for details, see the Base Year Sample Design Report, pp. 33-39). School nonresponse has not been assessed in the second follow-up for two reasons. First, there was very little no school-level nonresponse--institutional cooperation levels approached 99 percent. Second, the second follow-up sample was student-driven, unlike the two-stage base year sample. Hence, even if a school refused, the individual student was pursued outside of school. The effect of student-level nonresponse within the responding schools was not assessed in the base year, although males, blacks, and Hispanics tended to be nonparticipants more often than females, whites or Asians. The effects of individual nonparticipation in the base year, first and second follow-ups will be systematically examined, and reported in future NELS:88 documentation."}, {"section_title": "Second Follow-Up Item Nonresponse", "text": "Analysis of survey error is important for understanding potential bias in making inferences from an obtained sample to a population. Sampling and nonsampling errors are the key constituents of total survey error. Sampling error is quantified through the standard errors and design effects for key variables. There are various sources and types of nonsampling measurement error, including estimate error or bias associated with unit (individual) nonresponse and item nonresponse. This section zeports specifically on nonsampling error as a function of item nonresponse. In addition to its role as a potential source of bias, item nonresponse also has the effect of diminishing the number of observations that can be used in calculating statistics from affected data elements and thus increases sampling variances. Since item nonresponse is an important potential and uncorrected source of data bias, it is necessary to measure its impact so that analysts can properly take potential response biases into account. Item nonresponse occurs when a respondent fails to complete certain items on the survey instrument. While bias associated with unit nonresponse has been controlled by making adjustments to case weights, item nonresponse has generally not been compensated for in the NELS:88 parent component data set. There are two exceptions to this generalization. The first exception is machine editing, through which, occasionally, certain nonresponse problems are rectified by imposing inter-item consistency, particularly by forcing logical agreement between filter and dependent questions. Thus, for example, the missing response to a filter question can often be inferred if the dependent question has been answered. Because the edited files were used in the nonresponse analysis reported below, this adjustment to item nonresponse is reflected in the results of the analysis. The second exception is that some key student and parent classification variables have been constructed in part from additional sources of information when student data are missing. Thus, data from school records (for example, student sex or race/ethnicity as given on the sampling roster) or other respondent sources (for example, the new student supplement) have been used to replace missing student or parent data. Because composite variables were not included in the nonresponse analysis, this adjustment of missing data is not reflected in the statistics reported below. A further point to note is that there may be some hidden nonresponse in the NELS:88 questionnaires that is impossible to quantify. This is the case because for a few questions, a \"mark all that apply\" format was used. While such a format results in slightly less burden on the respondent, it also makes it impossible to distinguish between a negative response and nonresponse. This conflation of negative response and nonresponse creates the potential for nonresponse biases that cannot be measured and thus cannot become the basis for precise warnings to users about the limitations of data. A final point to note is that, implicitly, unit nonresponse is a further source of missing item datathat is, nonparticipating parents complete no questionnaire items. Weights accommodate parent level nonresponse by projecting questionnaire data to the full student population, with appropriate adjustments for defined subgroups. However, they cannot compensate for the bias that arises if nonrespondents would have answered the questionnaire differently than respondents. For this reason, \"total response\" should be thought of as the survey (unit) response rate times the item response rate. (For example, given a 63 47 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual weighted 1992 parent response rate of 90.6 percent, and an item response rate of 94.9 percent, total response would be 85.9 percent.) Two main objectives inform this item nonresponse analysis. One objective is to quantify mean questionnaire nonresponse overall. A second objective is to describe nonresponse patterns in terms of questionnaire item characteristics. In order to realize the first objective, average nonresponse rates were calculated for each item, and were classified by mode of questionnaire administration. In order to fulfill the second objective, nonresponse was measured as a function of three characteristics: 1) position in the questionnaire; 2) topic; and 3) whether the item was contingent on a filter."}, {"section_title": "Population and Data File Definitions", "text": "Definition 1: \"Item\" For purposes of this analysis, \"item\" refers to each data element or variable. For a question composed of multiple subparts, each subpart eliciting a distinct response is counted as an item for item nonresponse purposes. Thus, a single question that poses three subquestions is treated as three variables. Definition 2: \"Response Rate\" NCES standards stipulate that item response rates (Ri) \"are to be calculated as the number of respondents for which an in-scope response was obtained (i.e., the response conformed to acceptable categories or ranges), divided by the number of completed interviews for which the question (or questions if a composite variable) was intended to be asked.\": Ri = weighted # of respondents with in-scope responses weighted # of completed interviews for which question was intended to be asked In-scope responses were considered to be valid answers (including a \"don't know\" response when this was a legitimate response option). Out-of-scope responses were multiple responses to items requiring only a single response, refusals, and missing responses."}, {"section_title": "Definition 3: \"Analysis Populations\"", "text": "Item nonresponse analysis population. All subsampled parents of an eligible student or dropout who completed a parent questionnaire, and whose teen completed a student or dropout questionnaire. Definition 4: \"Parent Questionnaire Data File\" The public use data elements with machine-edited, weighted data were used as the basis for the analysis. Nonresponse rates of composite and other constructed variables were not examined in this analysis. Definition 5: \"Nonresponse\" For the parent questionnaire several numerical reserved codes were used to categorize nonresponse. The reserved codes and definitions appear below. The first three--reserved codes 6, 7 and F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual 8--define out-of-scope or illegitimate nonresponse, and were used as the basis for this nonresponse analysis. 6 = Multiple Response. For an item that required one response only, the respondent marked more than one response, and the multiple response could not be resolved. 7 = Refused Critical Item. Respondent was unwilling to answer the question at the time of the questionnaire administration and upon nonresponse follow-up by survey administrators. 8 = Missing: The response datum is illegitimately missing. That is, a datum that should be present for this respondent is missing. 9 = Legitimate Skip. The response datum is legitimately missing. That is, owing either to responses to preceding filter questions or to other respondent characteristics data for this item should not be present for this respondent. Responses under reserved code 9 were not included in the nonresponse analysis. DK = \"Don't Know.\" \"Don't Know\" is often used as a nonresponse code. In the NELS:88 data set, \"Don't Know\" is embedded as a legitimate response category in some of the questionnaire items. For purposes of this analysis, \"Don't Know\" was not classified as a nonresponse. Item-Level Nonresponse. Table 3.4-1 shows descriptive statistics for parent questionnaire item nonresponse overall and for items grouped into categories depending upon their position in the questionnaire, the topic they addressed, and whether they were part of a skip or filter pattern. The mean item nonresponse rate for the NELS:88 second follow-up parent questionnaire is 5.1 percent. The second follow-up parent survey's mixed modes of administration contributed to the high rates of item response found. Some 9,639 questionnaires (58.8 percent) were self-administered. The relatively high degree of motivation demonstrated by these parents helped to counteract the lengthiness and demanding skip patterns of the parent questionnaire. Less motivated parents were guided through 6,756 (41.2 percent) questionnaires by a telephone interviewer. Mean telephone-administered parent questionnaire item nonresponse was 3.2 percent, while mean self-administered questionnaire item nonresponse was 6.2 percent. Item-Level Nonresponse by Item Placement and Characteristic: Parent Questionnaire. Respondent burden associated with the length of the second follow-up parent questionnaire contributed to item nonresponse. Mean item nonresponse in the final third of the parent questionnaire is 7.2 percent, compared with 5.3 percent in the first third and 2.9 percent in the second third. Self-administered parent questionnaires display a similar pattern. Items in the final third of self-administered parent instruments display a mean nonresponse rate of 8.6 percent, while items in the first and second thirds have nonresponse rates of 6.7 percent and 3.2 percent respectively. Questionnaires administered by telephone break this pattern. Items in the first third of telephone administered questionnaires have the highest nonresponse rate (4.0 percent), while items in the second and final thirds display nonresponse rates of 1.9 percent and 3.6 percent respectively.  Item Nonresponse by Topic. At 5.7 percent, mean item nonresponse in part two of the parent questionnaire, \"Your Teenager's School Life,\" is slightly higher than rates found in other sections. Overall, however, item nonresponse rates in the \"School Life\" section are quite low. The slightly elevated nonresponse rates in the \"School Life\" section may be a product of increased respondent burden associated with the long, dense lists of items contained in section two. Three factors probably contribute to the 8.4 percent mean item nonresponse rate found in the \"Financial Information and Education Costs\" section of the parent questionnaire. First, part five is the last section completed by all parents except those new to NELS:88 with the exception of locator information. Respondent fatigue decreased response to items in this section. Second, some respondents may have chosen not to answer the financial items in part five due to the sensitivity of those items. Third, a few respondents may have lacked the knowledge of their household's finances needed to answer items in part five. \"Part Six: Supplemental Questions for Parents New to NELS:88,\" is located at the en'i of the second follow-up parent instrument. Parents new to NELS:88 had, on average, lower SES aria lower educational attainment. These characteristics are often associated with higher nonresponse and may have interacted with the length of the questionnaire and the parent's perception of the burden of the 50 6 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual questionnaire. (For example, completing a self-administered questionnaire is a more arduous task for poor readers.) The effect of respondent fatigue on nonresponse in part six can be seen when selfadministered questionnaires (which on average impose more burden on respondents) are compared with telephone administered questionnaires. Telephone administered parent questionnaires display a mean part six item nonresponse rate of only 11.7 percent, compared with 17.1 percent in self-administered questionnaires. In self-administered questionnaires routing to part six depends on the respondent's answer to question 94b. If the respondent failed to answer this key filter item, it is quite possible that the respondent also failed to answer part six. Retrieval of parent data was conducted for only the critical items listed in Appendix H; however, data retrieval from parents who failed to answer 94b would have decreased the nonresponse for this item. Item Nonresponse by Dependence on a Filter Question. Second follow-up parent questionnaire nonresponse is over three times higher in items dependent on a filter question. This fact holds true whether the questionnaire was self-administered or telephone administered. In self-administered questionnaires items not dependent on a filter question had a mean nonresponsi rate of only 2.8 percent, compared with 9.8 in filtered items. Similarly, nonresponse in telephone administered items not dependent on a filter question was 1.5 percent, compared with 5.0 in items dependent on a filter question. Dependent items carry with them missing data from the corresponding filter item. Parent questionnaire filter items would probably have benefitted from the High School & Beyond practice of making nearly all filter items critical and thus subject to retrieval. The nonresponse rates reported here for items dependent on a filter question are inflated to the extent that the rates contain \"hidden skips.\" Hidden skips are those missing responses that would have been skips had the respondent answered the appropriate filter item. Unfortunately it is not possible to quantify hidden skips. Parent Survey Item-Level Nonresponse by Critical Items. The nonresponse rate for parent survey critical items is 2.4 percent, well below the rate found in the second follow-up student questionnaire (3.3 percent) or the second follow-up dropout questionnaire (4.2 percent). Of the parent instrument's 53 critical items three items (questions 95, 101A, and 101B) are located in the last section, \"Supplemental Questions for Parents New to NELS:88.\" Nonresponse rates for these three questions range from 8.6 percent to 19.0 percent. When questions 95, 101A, and 101B are excluded from analysis, the mean nonresponse rate for critical items drops to 1.8 percent. The item nonresponse rates for each of the critical items in the parent questionnaire are shown in Table 3.4-2. Summary and Conclusions. Second follow-up parent questionnaire item nonresponse rates benefitted from telephone administration of 6,756 questionnaires. Telephone administration of 41.2 percent of the questionnaires decreased, but did not eliminate, the effects of questionnaire length and filter items on item nonresponse. Mean weighted parent questionnaire total response, 85.9 percent, is well within the NCES standard. NCES's standard asserts that total weighted response (unit nonresponse multiplied by item nonresponse) should he at least 70 percent.   "}, {"section_title": "IV. Data Collection", "text": "This chapter describes the data collection procedures for all components of the NELS:88 second follow-up: parent, student and dropout, school administrator, teacher, and academic transcript and course offerings. The design of the second follow-up closely resembled that of the first follow-up and was executed in three phases which spanned two years. Self-administration and telephone administration were the primary modes of data collection for the components of the second follow-up. Although data collection did not occur for the parent component until the third phase of the study in 1992, pre-data collection activities related to the parent component were conducted in the first and second phases of the study in 1991. Phase three was conducted in 1992 and constituted the data collection effort. Figure 4-1 summarizes the activities conducted during the three phases of the second follow-up."}, {"section_title": "4.1", "text": "Second Follow-Up Pre-Data Collection Activities Phase 1. Conducted from January through June of 1991, phase 1 involved securing state, district, and school-level cooperation for the study as well as tracing sample members. State cooperation with NELS:88 was secured for all fifty states and the District of Columbia. District and school-level cooperation were secured for first follow-up schools with four or more sample members still in attendance in the spring of 1991. Tracing sample members served two purposes: defining the schools to be included in the second follow-up sampling process and locating sample members for data collection. As in the first follow-up, the second follow-up study was designed such that only students attending a school included in the second follow-up school sample would receive the full complement of contextual data including school administrator and teacher reports. To maximize the number of students to receive the full complement of contextual data, interviewers attempted to trace all sample members to either their first follow-up school of attendance or to a new school. Once students were traced to a school, the second follow-up school sample was drawn such that the greatest number of students would be included in the school sample and receive the full complement of contextual data. The second purpose of tracing related to data collection. Interviewers attempted to trace students to their first follow-up or new school of attendance, and prior to the beginning of phase 2 the sample of second follow-up schools was finalized. If an interviewer was unable to confirm school enrollment for a cohort member through the first follow-up school or a new school, the interviewer traced the sample member to a home address to confirm that the student was enrolled in a school or that the student had left school. Through tracing students to a first follow-up school, a new school, or a home address, and through the selection of the schools to be included in the second follow-up school sample, interviewers were able to forecast whether a student's data would be collected through a second follow-up school or if a sample member would need to be contacted separately during data collection. Confirmation of a sample member's enrollment status determined which type of questionnaire--student or dropout--the sample member would be administered during the data collection period. Phase 2. From September to December 1991, phase 2 pre-data collection activities occurred for all components of the study, and some phase 1 activities continued. District and school-level cooperation were verified again for any schools selected for the second follow-up sample for which cooperation was not gained in phase 1. Tracing continued for sample members who were not located during phase 1, and enrollment was confirmed for students who were traced to a school which was selected for the second follow-up school sample. Students attending a school not included in the second follow-up school sample and sample members who had left school were also traced again to their school of attendance or to a  Table 4.1-1 summarizes the results of district and school contacting and student tracing in phases 1 and 2. Interviewers visited each of the second follow-up schools to conduct activities in preparation for data collection for all components of the study. For student data collection, they scheduled in-school data collection sessions and worked with school personnel to identify how parental permission for surveying students would be gained for an individual school. Using school rosters, interviewers freshened the student sample to allow a random sample of twelfth graders who were previously excluded from the study because, for example, they were not in the U.S. or in the eighth grade in 1988, and did not have a chance to be selected for the base year sampling frame. Refer to Chapter III of the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Student Component Data File User's Manual for a complete discussion of freshening the student sample. a This column represents the portion of the phase I sampled schools (N=1,500) that had at least one core sample members still enrolled at the end of the school contacting phase (phase 2) of the study. These numbers reflect the schools at which cooperation with the study was gained rather than the NELS:88 schools whose students were included in the contextual sample. Data were collected for the contextual components (the parent, teacher, school administrator, academic transcript, and course offerings components). Interviewers collected parent address and telephone information for the parent survey. To identify the sample for the teacher survey, the names of the mathematics and science teachers of the student sample members were compiled. Course catalogs were collected, and interviewers collected samples of student transcripts to inform data collection and data preparation for the high school transcript component. Final Tracing Results. After the tracing of sample members was completed, 97.3 percent (N=20,623) of the 21,188 second follow-up sample members had been located. Figure 4-2 illustrates F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual the results of the second follow-up locating efforts. Of the 21,188 sample members, 83.3 percent were enrolled in high school, 8.2 percent were verified dropouts, 0.5 percent were identified by school officials as dropouts but were not confirmed as such, 4.1 percent were sample members who had already completed an alternative program, 1.3 percent were deemed ineligible to participate in the second followup study (e.g., deceased or moved out of the country), and 2.7 percent could not be located."}, {"section_title": "4.2", "text": "Second Follow-Up Data Collection Activities Phase 3. Data collection for the second follow-up was conducted from January through December 1992. Although the data collection periods of the individual components of the study were staggered, there was a high degree of overlap between the data collection periods of the individual components, and most data was collected from January through June of 1992, the spring term of the 1991-1992 academic year. Figure 4-3 shows the field periods of each component of the study. Most of the components of the survey utilized more than one mode of data collection, usually self-administration and telephone administration of the survey instruments. In some cases abbreviated versions of the instruments were implemented as discussed in Chapter II of this manual."}, {"section_title": "Parent Survey", "text": "In May 1992, parent questionnaires were mailed to all parents and guardians of students and dropouts who had completed a student or dropout questionnaire. The self-administered questionnaires instructed the parent or guardian who was most knowledgeable about the teenager's current living situation and educational plans to complete the questionnaire. Accordingly, the parent sample was selfselected. The timing of the second follow-up parent survey was different from the timing of the base year parent survey due to differences in the content of the questionnaires. Because the second follow-up parent questionnaire included questions on financial aid for postsecondary education and this information is not available to most families until late in the spring of teenagers' twelfth grade, the parent survey was not conducted at the same time as the student and dropout surveys. However, parent respondents were asked to refer to the spring of 1992 when completing the questionnaire. The base year parent survey was conducted concurrently with the student data collection. Two weeks after the questionnaires were mailed, a postcard reminder was mailed to all parents. For parents who had already completed the questionnaire, the postcard thanked them for their participation. For parents who had not yet returned their questionnaire, the postcard asked them to complete and return the questionnaire at their earliest convenience. Starting two weeks after the postcard reminder was mailed to parents, telephone interviewers began prompting nonresponding parents over the telephone for their completed questionnaire. Telephone interviews were attempted with a subsample of parents who did not respond to the postcard and telephone prompts. Figure 4-4 shows the mode of administration of the parent questionnaire for the 17,584 eligible parent participants and nonparticipants on the parent public use data file. To minimize mode effects between self-administration and telephone administration of the instrument, interviewers were trained to adapt the questions to make sense when read over the telephone. Additionally, parents were asked to read along in the questionnaire during the telephone interview if they had the copy of the questionn lire mailed to them.   (N=1,189) *In addition to the 17,584 eligible parents, 26 records are included on the file for parents who were initially eligible for data collection, yet it was discovered that these parents were out of scope for reasons described in section 3.1.5. The total number of parent records on the public use data file is 17,610. Targeting Special Parent Populations. Special steps were taken to ensure comparable completion rates for the parents of OBEMLA (Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander) oversampled students and dropouts. In the initial mailing of questionnaires to parents, both English and Spanish questionnaires were mailed to parents of Hispanic students and dropouts so that an Hispanic parent could complete the questionnaire in the language with which the parent was more comfortable. Spanish-speaking interviewers were trained to administer the questionnaire over the telephone in Spanish when necessary. Much as in the base year parent survey when 575 Spanish-language questionnaires (2.5 percent) were completed, 373 Spanish-language parent questionnaires (2.1 percent) were completed during the second follow-up. While a native language questionnaire was not available to parents of Asian students and dropouts, parents who spoke the most common Asian languages were prompted over the telephone for the return of the questionnaire by a native speaker. The languages in which these parents were prompted included Chinese, Japanese, Tagalog, Korean, and Vietnamese. In the respondent's native language, Asian telephone interviewers explained why the parent's participation in the study was important and encouraged them to seek the assistance of another adult for completing the English version of the questionnaire; however, no translation of the questionnaire into these languages was conducted over the telephone. The Telephone Number Management System. For parent data collected through telephone prompting and interviewing, the delivery of cases to the telephone staff was controlled and monitored by NORC's Telephone Number Management System (TNMS). The TNMS contained information about each case necessary for interviewers to contact and confirm that they were speaking to the parent or guardian of the sampled student. The TNMS stored information about respondents requiring interviewers with special language and interviewing skills and was also used to prioritize data collection from certain subpopulations."}, {"section_title": "Relationship between NELS:88 Second Follow-Up Parent Survey and Other Parent Surveys", "text": "Three basic contrasts may be drawn between the HS&B sophomore and senior parent surveys, the NELS:88 base year parent survey, and the NELS:88 second follow-up parent survey. Those contrasts involve 1) the sampling strategy for the respective parent surveys; 2) the time frame for data collection; and 3) the content of the questionnaires. Sampling differences involve both different strategies for selection of the parent sample (such as no subsampling or subsampling at different rates) and procedures for selection of the specific parent respondent within the parent sample. The HS&B base year surveyed a subsample of parents. Specifically, parents were selected from a sample of students who had completed the HS&B cognitive tests, within a sample of 312 of the 1,015 HS&B schools. Some 3,367 sophomore cohort parents and 3,197 senior cohort parents participated. In contrast, in the NELS:88 base year, there was no subsampling; however, only the parents of student questionnaire completers were included in the parent survey. Of 24,599 student participants, the parents of 22,651 students completed the NELS:88 base year parent questionnaire. In the NELS:88 second follow-up, the final parent sample consisted of 17,750 parents of whom 15,183 were parents of students, 1,734 were parents of dropouts, and 833 were parents of sample members in alternative (non-diploma granting) programs. In HS&B, the parent instrument was mailed to respondents. In most instances it was addressed to the mother of the sample member. From the HS&B base year student identification pages, parent names and addresses were obtained. If the student reported both a male and a female parent, the questionnaire was sent to the female parent. If only one parent was mentioned, the questionnaire was F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual sent to that parent. However, instructions did not prohibit the other parent from completing the questionnaire. A comparatively high proportion of HS&B parent questionnaires were completed by the father (36 percent for the senior cohort, 34 percent for the sophomore), although mothers were the majority of parent respondents (58 percent for seniors, 61 pi for sophomores) and a few questionnaires were completed by stepparents, grandparents, or guardians. In the NELS:88 base year, the student carried the questionnaire home to the parent, and instructions required the parent who was most familiar with the educational situation of the eighth grader to complete the questionnaire. In the NELS:88 base year, mothers completed 77.7 percent of the parent questionnaires, fathers completed 17.5 percent of the questionnaires, 4.0 percent of the questionnaires were completed by other respondents such as a stepparent, grandparent, or other relative or guardian, and the remaining 0.7 percent were not identified. (These figures do not sum to 100 percent due to rounding.) In the NELS:88 second followup, questionnaires were mailed to parents with similar instructions for respondent selection, and the breakdown of parental respondents was like the base year. The second follow -up parent questionnaires were completed 78.5 percent of the time by the mother, 15.5 percent of the time by the father, 4.6 percent of the time by other respondents such as a stepparent, grandparent, or another adult relative or guardian, and the remaining 1.4 percent were not identified. In both NELS:88 parent surveys, questionnaires were addressed to \"the parent or guardian\" of the sampled child and the cover letter asked the parent who was most knowledgeable about the child's current situation to complete the questionnaire. The time frame for data collection was somewhat different across the various parent surveys. Data collection for the NELS:88 base year parent survey took place primarily in the spring term of 1988, although some nonresponse follow-up and critical item retrieval continued into the summer. Given the stress in the questionnaires on the eighth-grade situation of the child, the goal of the NELS:88 base year was to collect this information before the end of the eighth-grade school year whenever possible. In contrast, the HS&B parent survey took place in the fall of 1980, several months after the end of the school year (data collection was conducted October to December, 1980; missing critical items were retrieved early in 1981). The heavy emphasis of the HS&B questionnaires on parents' preparation for financing postsecondary education argued for a later data collection schedule to reflect the postsecondary choices made by the senior cohort in the final months of high school. In the NELS:88 second follow-up, parent data collection took place primarily in the summer and fall of 1992. In contrast to the NELS:88 base year, a later data collection schedule was chosen for much the same reason as in HS&B; additional information about postsecondary choices and financing arrangements would be available at this later time. Finally, there are important differences in the content of the parent questionnaires. The IIS &B 1980 sophomore and senior parent surveys had considerable item overlap and both were fairly limited in their content. As noted above, they stressed the family's financial situation and financial planning for postsecondary education. NELS:88 base year questionnaires, on the other hand, gave less stress to financial information and planning for future educational costs, and more stress to family socioeconomic and linguistic background, parental relationships to and views of the school, the family life of the student, and parental expectations and aspirations for the child. The NELS:88 second follow-up questionnaire followed the model of HS&B in expanding the coverage of issues pertaining to financing postsecondary education, but also continued to explore themes of the NELS:88 base year parent questionnaire, including the nature of the home educational support system and of educational decision making in the family. Despite the limited overlap between the HS&E and NELS:88 second follow-up parent studies, some key comparison items are common to both. In particular, items on parental educational aspirations, such as how far in school the parent wants their teenager to go as well as some itemson family finances and postsecondary planning, provide parent data comparison points between 1980 and 1992 seniors. Refer to Appendix D for a crosswalk between the items in the NELS:88 and HS&B parent surveys. In-school Survey Sessions. From January to June 1992, in-school survey sessions were held in all cooperating NELS:88 schools still enrolling second follow-up sample members. Second follow-up data collection procedures were very similar to those used in the first follow-up. Student questionnaires and cognitive tests in math, science, reading, and social studies were administered in-school, group data collection sessions of approximately 9 students. Survey administration was usually conducted in a school classroom or library and consisted of several steps. Students first completed the student questionnaire, and, if applicable, the new student supplement or the early graduate supplement. Students who had transferred into or out of a school within the two weeks prior to the survey session were asked to report on their previous school of attendance. Transfer students who had been at the surveyed school for two weeks or longer were asked to report on their current school. After the students completed the student questionnaires, an 85 minute battery of cognitive tests was administered. The tests consisted of four timed sections devoted to mathematics, reading, science, and social studies (history/citizenship/geography). Once the test battery was completed, an attempt was made to retrieve missing (or inappropriately marked) questionnaire items before the student left the classroom. Interviewers reviewed the questionnaires to ensure that all critical items were completed. An oval indicating \"no retriev \"l\" was marked whenever the missing data could not be retrieved due to respondent refusal or inability to clarify a vague response. At the end of the survey session, arrangements were made to conduct make-up sessions for students who were scheduled but unable to attend the initial survey session or whose schedules required that they leave before completing both instruments. If fewer than five students were scheduled for a make-up session, school staff were asked to handle the arrangements and oversee its administration; however, to ensure respondent confidentiality, school staff were prohibited from reviewing the student questionnaire for completeness. When five or more students were scheduled for a make-up session or when school staff were unavailable to conduct a make-up session, interviewers arranged a return visit to the school. The second follow-up study attempted to collect a complete questionnaire and cognitive test from students and dropouts; however, for some student sample members only an abbreviated version of the student or dropout questionnaire was collected, or the cognitive test was not collected at all. Off-campus Survey Sessions. Off -campus survey sessions, typically attended by one to three students, were conducted primarily from March to July 1992. Students who were not enrolled in sampled schools, who had missed in-school data collection sessions, or who were enrolled in schools that had refused to participate in the study were invited to off -campus sessions and administered the student questionnaire and cognitive tests. Dropouts were also asked to attend these sessions and were surveyed alongside sample members who were currently enrolled in school. As with in-school survey sessions, off -campus survey sessions in the second follow-up were nearly identical to those in the first follow-up. If a sample member was unable to attend an off -campus group survey session, he or she was surveyed either over the telephone or in-person. When the student questionnaire was administered over the telephone, cognitive test data were not collected."}, {"section_title": "Dropout Survey", "text": "The NELS:88 second follow-up dropout survey sought to interview all sample members who had left school prior to graduation, including both first follow-up dropouts who had not returned to school 64 84 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual and sample members who dropped out after the first follow-up. All sample members appear on the student data file regardless of their spring 1992 enrollment status. Basic classification variables and test data appear for both students and dropouts, though dropout questionnaire data appear separately on the dropout component data file. School Enrollment Classification and Data Collection. In order to determine which sample members should complete a dropout questionnaire, school enrollment status was classified for all sample members during the spring of 1992. Four types of enrollment classifications were identified as illustrated by Figure 4-5. The first were high school students who were enrolled in a school which offered programs ending in the granting of a diploma. These students were administered the student questionnaire and the cognitive test battery. Early graduates were included in this classification, and were asked to report retrospectively on the school from which they graduated and to complete supplemental questions about their reasons for graduating early. The second type were sample members who dropped out of high school but later returned to a high school program to obtain a high school diploma. These sample members were administered the student questionnaire and, when possible, the cognitive test battery. The third type were sample members who dropped out of high school but went on to seek an equivalent to a high school diploma such as the General Educational Development test (GED). If an alternative completer had finished the requirements of his or her alternative program, a student questionnaire was collected from the student. If the alternative completer had not yet fulfilled the requirements for certification, the sample member was administered a dropout questionnaire. In both cases, the cognitive test battery was also administered when possible. The fourth type were dropouts. These sample members had left their high school by the spring of 1992 and were not working toward an alternative certification. Dropouts were administered a dropout questionnaire and, when possible, the cognitive test battery. Regardless of whether .a dropout completed a student or dropout questionnaire, data collection efforts for the dropout component of the second follow-up were similar to those in the first follow-up survey. Interviewers attempted to survey most dropouts in off -campus survey sessions with testing conditions similar to in-school sessions. For analytical purposes, sample members classified as alternative completers can be included or compared with either high school completers or dropouts. Additionally, alternative completers can be examined separately, depending on the needs of the analyst. For a complete description of the dropout component, see the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up: Dropout Component Data File User's Manual."}, {"section_title": "School Effectiveness Study", "text": "Because the NELS:88 second follow-up core study was conducted at 97.8 percent of the schools at which the school effectiveness study was conducted, data were collected for students in these schools using the same data collection procedures as second follow-up cohort students.

Unlike student cohort sample members, most 85 Note: A within-round dropout-returnee is, in NELS:88 parlance, a \"stopout.\" During the second followup, a stopout was defined as a sample member who had dropped out of school at some point in the 1990-1991 or 1991-1992 school years, but had returned to school by the spring of 1992. A similar definition was employed in the NELS:88 first follow-up. In the above diagram the term \"dropin\" refers to a sample member who dropped out of high school, then returned to high school (making the sample member a stopout as described above), and then dropped out of high school again for a final time.

In the 247 participating SES schools, SES sample members were administered the student questionnaire and cognitive tests. If SES students missed in-school data collection sessions, they were surveyed at off-campus survey sessions. Unlike the data collection procedures for the student cohort sample members, SES students who were no longer attending the school with which they were associated were not pursued or surveyed; however, enrollment status was gathered for these students from the SES schools. The parent, transcript, and course offerings components were also conducted for the SES sample members. A more detailed discussion of the school effectiveness study will be presented in forthcoming documentation, which will accompany the release of those data."}, {"section_title": "Followback Study of Excluded Students", "text": "In the first follow-up study, most classification changes were made for a sample of students who had been excluded from the base year study. Of the 618 base year ineligible sample members (BYIs), 580 were located and 312 were reclassified as eligible during the first follow-up. (Table 4.2.4-1 in the NELS:88 Second Follow-Up Student Component Data File User's Manual contains additional completion rate data for the BYI study.) In the second follow-up, the remaining ineligible students--BYIs who were ineligible in the first follow-up or more rarely, students who were eligible in the base year but who became ineligible in the first follow-up through the occurrence of some sort of incapacitation--were pursued as a part of the Followback Study of Excluded Students. The Followback Study of Excluded Students (FSES) of the NELS:88 second follow-up attempted to reassess the eligibility status and ascertain the enrollment status of students who: had been excluded because of linguistic, mental, or physical obstacles to participation when the baseline sample of eighth graders was drawn in the 1987-88 school year, and were subsampled into the Base Year Ineligible Study in the first follow-up; 2) were eligible in the base year but became ineligible in the first follow-up; or, 3) were identified as ineligible when selected through the freshening process in the first follow-up. If the students had since become eligible for NELS:88, the followback study attempted to survey them. The followback study continued the first follow-up base year ineligible study for several purposes. First, if the 5.3 percent of the potential base year sample declared ineligible differed in key characteristics or outcomes from the sample of students included in NELS:88, this difference could bias baseline results and subsequent longitudinal measurements. By learning more about these excluded students and their current school enrollment status, one might correct for potential undercoverage bias that could affect key national estimates, such as dropping out between eighth and twelfth grade. Second, an individual's eligibility status could potentially change. A student excluded on language grounds in 1988 or 1990 could have gained sufficient proficiency in English by 1992 to complete the student questionnaire. Like the complementary activity of sample freshening, the followback study of excluded students helped to generate a nationally representative sample of twelfth-grade students. Third, eligibility rules were modified in the first follow-up and retained in the second follow-up to allow for completion of the student questionnaire in Spanish in addition to English. By giving 1988 and/or 1990 excluded students who could complete a questionnaire only in Spanish the opportunity to do so in 1992, the revised eligibility rules of the first follow-up were successfully carried back to the base year cohort. 8 7 67 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual Data Collection Procedures. Data collection for the followback study of base year excluded students took place during the main study data collection effort between April and October 1992. Interviewers attempted to identify excluded students who were eligible to be added to the longitudinal sample in the second follow-up. They obtained the following information about the excluded student from the student's current school, school last attended, or the student's home: Sex (if unknown): male or female; Race/ethnicity (if unknown): white, black, Hispanic, Asian/PI, American Indian, other; School enrollment status: student, dropout, or dropout in alternative program; and, Eligibility: English/Spanish language proficiency, lack of mental or physical disability (i.e., ability to complete a questionnaire), reading ability level of at least eighth grade. After collecting the above information about the students, interviewers attempted to identify whether or not the student was capable of meaningful participation in the survey under normal conditions. To make this assessment, interviewers were instructed to obtain reports from persons with first-hand knowledge of the students, such as a special education teacher, a bilingual teacher, a language arts teacher, or a guidance counselor. Interviewers often spoke with several staff members to identify the staff member who was most qualified to assess whether or not the student could participate. Unless there were severe mental or physical disabilities or lack of facility with written English or Spanish and the member was unable to complete the survey instruments under normal circumstances, the student was considered eligible to participate in the study. Eligibility information was gathered for 95.7 percent of the excluded sample members. For excluded students who were identified as eligible, student or dropout questionnaires were administered either in-person or over the telephone. Cognitive tests were administered to a small percentage of these students. For students who remained ineligible, school enrollment status and other key characteristics were obtained."}, {"section_title": "School Administrator Survey", "text": "In February 1992, school administrator questionnaires were mailed to the principal or headmaster of selected NELS:88 schools with second follow-up sample members still in attendance. Completed selfadministered questionnaires and telephone interviews were collected from February through June 1992. For any interviews conducted after the end of the 1991-1992 academic year, school principals were asked to refer to the previous academic year. As in the first follow-up the school principal or headmaster could delegate all but one of the sections to another knowledgeable school official. The school principal was specifically required to complete the fifth section of the questionnaire on school governance and school climate. Two weeks after the school administrator questionnaire was mailed to principals and headmasters, a postcard was mailed to all principals asking them to return the questionnaire if they had not already completed and returned it. Two weeks after the postcard reminder was mailed, interviewers began prompting nonresponding principals over the telephone for the return of the questionnaire. About three weeks after each principal was prompted for the return of the questionnaire over the telephone, interviewers began calling nonresponding school administrators to attempt to collect the questionnaire 68 8 3 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual over the telephone. An abbreviated version of the school administrator questionnaire was administered to nonresponding principals near the end of the data collection period. Because questionnaires from school principals were completed in two different modes of data collection, by self-administration and telephone administration, a number of steps were taken to minimize any mode effects. Telephone interviewers were trained to adapt the questions in a way which made sense when asked over the telephone. If a principal had a copy of the questionnaire, he or she was encouraged to read along in the questionnaire as the interviewer asked the questions over the telephone."}, {"section_title": "Teacher Survey", "text": "The tea her survey was designed to articulate with the student cognitive tests and included one mathematics or science teacher of students at NELS:88 sampled schools when the student was enrolled in one of these classes. To minimize the amount of time between the c )11ection of the student and teacher data, either the fall or spring term teacher was selected depending on when student data were collected at a school, and the questionnaires were mailed to the teachers in two waves. The majority of sampled students at NELS:88 schools who were enrolled in a mathematics or science class were instructed by the same mathematics or science teacher during the entire 1991-1992 academic year. For students who had different mathematics or science teachers in the fall or spring term, the fall term teacher was mailed a questionnaire in early February if the in-school data collection session at a student's school was scheduled for a date before April 1, 1992. If the data collection session was scheduled on or after April 1, then the spring term teacher was mailed a questionnaire in early March 1992. Since most in-school data collection occurred during January through March of 1992, most students' fall term teachers were selected for the teacher survey and were mailed a questionnaire in early February. This design was based on the assumption that in the first three months of the spring term, the fall term teacher would be more familiar and able to assess the student than the spring term teacher would be. On or after April 1, it was assumed that the spring term teacher had sufficient exposure to the student in order to make a full assessment of the student and that three months after the beginning of the spring term, the fall term teacher might have difficulty recalling the student's performance. Mier identifying whether the fall or spring term teacher would be selected for the teacher survey, the subject area of a student's teacher report was determined. If the student was enrolled in only one class out of the two subject areas, mathematics or-science, then the one teacher was selected. However, if the student was enrolled in both subject areas, then the subject area of the teacher report was the same as the base year selected subject for the student. Some students who were enrolled in both a mathematics and a science class were added to the first or second follow-up through freshening. For the freshened students who were enrolled in both mathematics and science, the subject area of the student's teacher report was the base year selected subject of the student's linked partner in the freshening procedure. Two weeks after the teacher questionnaires were mailed, nonresponding teachers were prompted for the return of the questionnaire with a postcard reminder. Beginning two weeks after the postcard reminder was mailed to teachers, nonresponding teachers were prompted for the return of the questionnaire over the telephone.

School staff were asked to retrieve from alternate sources any data elements that were not included on the school's transcripts. Transcript preparers were also asked to note any transfers of students to new schools after data collection, to facilitate the pursuit of additional records from transfer schools. Two weeks after survey materials were mailed, nonresponding principals were prompted for the return of transcripts with a postcard reminder.

The scanning contractor converted the parent data to machine-readable form and supplied a raw data tape to NORC. After receipt of all scanned data, sequenced machine editing and visual inspection of the output began. The tasks performed included: resolving inconsistencies between filter and dependent questions, supplying the appropriate missing data codes for questions left blank, detecting illegal codes and converting them to missing data codes and investigating inconsistencies or contradictions in the data. Frequencies and crosstabulations for each variable were inspected before and after these steps to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of the automated mach'. le editing processes. Inconsistencies between filter and dependent questions were resolved in the machine editing process. In most instances, dependent questions that conflicted with the skip instructions of a filter question contained data that, although possibly valid, were superfluous. For instance, respondents sometimes indicated \"no\" to a filter question and theii continued to answer \"no\" to subsequent dependent items. When a filter question indicated that a subsequent question(s) should have been skipped, the dependent questions were set to the value \"legitimate skip,\" with one exception. In the exception, if the dependent questions were answered in a manner that was inconsistent with the filter but consistent across the dependent items, the filter was back edited (changed) to agree with the dependent responses. If a multiple response or no answer was given to a filter question, the question was assigned the suitable reserved code and all subsequent questions that might have been skipped were processed as if the respondent should have answered them. The frequency with which responses were recoded to a legitimate skip for each skip pattern was closely monitored. Frequency distributions of responses before and after editing were inspected. All filter questions and their respective dependent items were displayed in crosstabulations to verify the correctness of the recoding. After improperly answered questions were converted to blanks, the parent data were passed through a second step in the editing program that supplied the appropriate reserved codes for blank questions.

Constructed variables including statistical weights, special indicators or \"flags,\" and variables that are composites of one or more sources are added to the files in order to promote high caliber analyses of the NELS:88 data. Some items add information from study sources that would otherwise be unavailable to users; some items reference respondent properties to external standards that would be expensive for individual analysts to create; other items are recodes or combinations of internal questionnaire sources. Some composites have appeared in earlier rounds and represent a convenience for the analyst, rather than wholly new information Some of these constructed variables will be used by nearly all users, while others will be appropriate to those seeking insights into distinctive populations, relationships or events. Generally, the names of special flags, weights and other constructed variables that were created in the base year begin with BY; the first follow-up flags and weights begin with F1; and the second follow-up names begin with F2.'

In a very large, complex survey such as NELS:88 with multiple highly elaborated codebook text files, the Compact Disc (CD) medium provides the necessary capacity to carry a tremendous amount of data in a very compact and convenient form. CD-ROM is a form that can be copied to and read by a microcomputer. The information on CD-ROM is \"Read-Only.\" This feature protects the data on the disk from accidental alterations, such as a user unintentionally writing over the encoded information. In addition to numerous hardcopy codebooks that accompany magnetic tape releases on NELS : 88, ECBs are also now available to users. These permit users to search for variables based on key words and names. The ECB displays question text and frequencies for each variable in order to assist users in deciding which data elements may be useful in planned analyses. The ECB is also a tool for selecting variables for subsequent analysis, writing SAS or SPSS-PC code for file construction of the designated variables, and even generating a codebook of the chosen set of variables. More detailed information on the features of the NELS :88 ECBs and the survey waves and components for which ECBs are available appears in Chapter VII. 76 93 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual VII. Guide to the Data Files, Documentation, and CD-ROM Electronic Codebooks Fourteen NELS:88 study components are now available to users on magnetic tape or CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory) format. Magnetic tape and CD-ROM releases of the NELS:88 data contain files that are specific to one survey wave and one component, such as the second follow-up student component data. Table 7-1 displays these NELS:88 products, by study component and by survey year. The student and dropout data sets are the central units of analysis in NELS:88. Each of the student data files may be examined as an independent entity or may be combined for observation of the maturation of the original student cohort over time. Table 7-1 suggests that the student and dropout data files released in the second follow-up of NELS:88 may be combined with data from second follow-up surveys of parents, teachers and school administrators. The most powerful analyses are possible when students are viewed in the context of these fundamental influences across the four-year time frame that is now available. The NELS:88 files are designed to be merged and used to examine how different student and dropout outcomes relate to various structural patterns, as measured by parent, school, and teacher influences, and/or the ways in which these change over time. The contextual data files are dependent upon and subsidiary to the student and dropout files in NELS:88. The contextual data files cannot stand alone. The only exception is the base year school file, which is representative of eighth-grade American schools and their principals in 1988. Even for the base year and second follow-up parent surveys--which closely resemble probability samples of parents of the relevant student and dropout populations--there are some departures from the requirements of a stand-alone probability sample. In particular, some unknown number of base year and second follow-up parents had more than one sampled eighth grader, hence more than one chance of selection into the sample. In addition, in both the base year and second follow-up, only one parent was surveyed, and that parent was self-selected. In the second follow-up parent component data file, the parent questionnaire items and a number of additional pertinent constructs have been copied to the records of eligible parents (who were not subsampled out of the parent survey) of eligible, participating student and dropout sample members. Note that these parent records appear on the parent file even if the parent or guardian did not return a completed parent questionnaire. At the time of parent subsampling, four types of parents or guardians were retained with certainty (see section 3.1.5 for more information on these four types). Several types of sample members are included in the student files; therefore, the user must take care to select the set that is correct for the research question. Among the types of sample members in the student data set are: 1) students who were added in the first or second follow-ups to freshen the sample; 2) sample members who have participated in one, two or all three waves of the survey; and 3) Base Year Ineligible sample members who were found to be eligible and subsequently included in. the first and second follow-up surveys of NELS:88.1 Eight analytic populations, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, are now represented in the NELS:88 student sample. Different research questions apply to different student populations. In order to choose the correct NELS:88 student sample and produce accurate results, analysts must use the proper sample identification and questionnaire availability indicators as well as the correct statistical weight. Note however that the sample of reclassified Base Year Ineligibles (i.e., those found to be eligible in the first follow-up and second follow-up rounds) had not been released prior to the second follow-up."}, {"section_title": "99", "text": "F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual Since I;y definition dropouts could only be identified and studied after the initial round of the survey, there is no base year dropout component. The parent component was only conducted during the base year and second follow-up. Transcripts collected during .the second follow-up span the entire high school career. The transcript data are available in restricted use form only. The restricted use transcript file includes 236 studentlevel variables and 251 course-level variables. Section 7.1 provides an overview of the sample indicators and weights necessary for using the parent data. Section 7.2 includes a complete description of the content and organization of the second follow-up parent data files. Finally, section 7.3 offers an explanation of the hardcopy codebook and an introduction to the NELS:88 electronic codebooks. The method for naming variables follows a simple pattern. \"FT' refers to the second follow-up, \"Fl\" refers to the first follow-up, and \"BY\" refers to the base year. An \"F2\" in the prefix means that the variable has been created in the second follow-up for second follow-up sample members. This is an important distinction since some variables that measure the same concept have been created for data sets in more than one round of the survey. In addition, if new information becomes available--for example for students who have not heretofore participated in NELS:88--certain classification variables are revised to reflect this new information. The more recent the creation of a composite, the more likely that it contains the most accurate values. The record layout for the indicators and weight is included in Appendix I. Appendix K includes the second follow-up parent codebook which contains the frequencies for these items. Questionnaire Indicator and Statistical Weight. One of the first steps to take in carrying out a plan for research involves selection of the proper questionnaire availability indicators. Even tentative investigations that are not statistically weighted must utilize the appropriate indicators for cases with the specified items on the data file. F2PAQFLG permits selection of eligible parent cases (F2PAQFLG < 2) and/or eligible cases with parent data present (F2PAQFLG = 1). It is analogous to F2QFLG on the student files and similar indicators that have been constructed for the contextual sample (school administrator and teacher components) and the high school transcript study. Table 7.1-1 lists the student populations that are represented in the NELS:88 database and the different ways that NELS:88 parent data may be used in analyses with them. Table 7.1-2 links three of these groups to the flags and other special variables, including statistical weights, that must be used in order to select and analyze each of the student groups. Parent Component Statistical Weight. The NELS:88 data files are designed to be used as weighted data sets in all analyses. Due to the complexity of the NELS:88 sample design, estimation and inference will most likely be inaccurate if the data are analyzed on an unweighted basis. Clustering, multistage selection, and disproportionate sampling all contribute potential bias and various degrees of unreliability, which can only be avoided by using the weights provided to analyze specific subsets of the 101 79 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual  Use the second followup parent weight, F2PAQWT. Use the second followup parent weight F2PAQWT. F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual sample.' In order to accommodate analyses of the parent data, F2PAQWT has been constructed and added to the records on the second follow-up parent component magnetic tape and final CD-ROM releases. Refer to Chapter III for a full description of the NELS:88 second follow-up weights. Panel Analyses with Parent Data. Weights have not been constructed for all possible analytic purposes, including panel analyses with parent data. In instances where there is an analyzable population of interest for which no specific weight has been produced, some existing weights may provide reasonable approximations. It was for this reason that no separate parent weight was produced in the NELS:88 base year: base year parent data can be used with the base year student weight, BYQWT, with only minimal bias. However, because of parent subsampling in the second follow-up, a special weight, F2PAQWT, was created. F2PAQWT can be used to produce weighted estimates in analyses of 1992 NELS:88 participants, including cohort dropouts and 1992 seniors. However, the second follow-up parent weight exists only in a cross-sectional version. This poses a difficulty if one wishes to conduct longitudinal analyses of, for example, parent-reported changes in the home education support system between 1988 and 1992. No available weight can be used to provide precise population estimates for the longitudinal use of parent data. Use of the 1992 parent weight in conjunction with data from prior rounds can provide an approximation; however, since F2PAQWT was produced for another purpose, population estimates produced from it will contain biases in a panel analysis. Extreme caution must therefore be exercised if a researcher wishes to conduct a weighted analysis for which a specific weight has not been provided. In particular, the analyst must weigh how much bias will be introduced by substitution of another weight. Two checks that should be made are 1) examination of the sum of the weights to compare that sum to true population totals; and 2) analysis of nonresponse bias, that is of what groups are disproportionately excluded by the weighting strategy. The specific purpose and required degree of precision of the analysis must be taken into account. If subgroup estimates are central to the analytic plan, it is necessary to take into account bias at the subgroup level. In instances where more than one possible weight is available, the decision as to which is best to use should be guided by a comparison of the bias inherent in each alternative. Whatever weighting strategy is used, if the amount of bias is non-trivial, potential biases should be reported with the results. Table 7.1-3 shows the sum of the second follow-up parent weight, F2PAQWT, when it is applied to the subset of second follow-up parents who completed both a base year and second follow-up parent questionnaire versus all parents who completed a second follow-up parent questionnaire. While the characteristics of most concern are in large measure a function of analytic goals, and while these 2 Three student-level weights have been constructed for the second follow-up and are available on the student files: F2QWT is used for producing weighted twelfth-grade student statistics in cross-sectional analyses. F2F1 PNWT is used for producing weighted student panel statistics when both the first follow-up and second follow-up data are employed in analyses. F2PNLWT is used for producing weighted student panel statistics when all three rounds, the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up, are included in the analyses. In addition to the parent weight, there is also a contextual weight (for the school administrator and teacher files) and three transcript survey weights. A companion variable has been constructed for each of these statistical weights in order to select the appropriate cases."}, {"section_title": "1O5", "text": "F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual characteristics might best be viewed in combination rather than individually, Table 7.1-3 highlights race, SES quartile, and region for each group. When F2PAQWT is used in a panel analysis with base year and second follow-up parent data, the sum of the weights is 85.3 percent of the sum obtained when using only the second follow-up parent data. Analysts should examine the remaining 14.7 percent to see if it is randomly distributed or whether the missing data disproportionately affect certain groups and is therefore a potential source of bias. For example, while using F2PAQWT with the parent panel represents only 85.3 percent of 2.6 million parents, 89.2 percent of whites are represented but only 62.5 percent of American Indians and Alaskan Natives, 74.0 percent of Asians and Pacific Islanders, and 74.7 percent of Hispanics are represented. By SES quartile, 90.0 percent of the families in the highest quartile are represented but only 82.2 percent of the families in the lowest quartile are represented. By region, 91.7 petcent of students whose school is in the Midwest are represented, yet only 82.4 percent of students in the West are represented. The caveat that the analyst must assess for and be wary of bias is justified in these instances. Universe Variables. As in every longitudinal survey, the complexity of NELS:88 has increased with each successive survey wave. The changing numbers of cases delivered in each round may be one of several perplexing anomalies to users. The \"universe variables\" are designed to explain how the status of sample members has changed from one round to another. These variables appear on the student files but are explained here for researchers who may seek a better understanding of the NELS:88 student sample, and therefore, of the parent sample. Moreover, as is explained elsewhere in this chapter, the student and parent files are easily merged by means of the student ID number. The first of the universe variables, F2UNIV1, is a set of over one hundred mutually-exclusive categories that was designed to encompass each sample member ever in the study. It describes how and when the student sample member entered the NELS:88 cohort and the situation of the sample member in the base year, the first follow-up, and in the second follow-up. Abbreviations for the SAS and SPSS-X value label cards provide this information in the character lengths allowed by those programs (which are shorter than the labels displayed in the codebooks). These abbreviations are: For each valid category of this variable, the status of the sample member is indicated for the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up. Examination of the categories of the variable in Appendix K reveals that the status of sample members did change over time. For example, students ineligible for 83 1( 6 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual Refers to the region of the student's school in the second follow-up.

Other sample members moved out of the country in a later round and were defined as \"out-of-scope\" for that round. Some of these sample members had returned to the U.S.A. by the second follow-up and were once again in-scope for data collection. Similarly, students who were freshened in the first or second follow-up did not participate in the base year. Four additional universe variables are provided, each with a more limited descriptive mission than F2UNIV1. These variables account separately for the information that is combined in the first universe variable. F2UNIV2A reports how sample members initially entered NELS:88. Categories are base year eligible, base year ineligible, or freshened in either the first or second follow-up. F2UNIV2B reports the base year status of all sample members: freshened in either the first or second follow-ups (and thus not at that time an active sample member), in school and in the appropriate grade, ineligible in that round due to a mental, physical or a linguistic barrier. F2UNIV2C reports the first follow-up status of sample members. Categories are freshened in the second follow-up, in school and in the appropriate grade, in school but not in the expected grade for the cohort, dropout, ineligible for this wave, out-of-scope (deceased or not in the U.S.A. during this round of the study), or status currently unknown. Finally, F2UNIV2D reports on the second follow-up status of each sample member. Valid possibilities are in school and in the expected grade, in school but not in the expected grade, dropout, ineligible, out-of-scope or status unknown in this round of NELS:88."}, {"section_title": "7.2", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Content and Organization of the Data Files", "text": "The parent public use data file contains a record for a parent of each of 17,610 eligible, participating student sample members in the second follow-up survey, if the parent was not subsampled out of the component by criteria described in Chapter 111.3 The raw data file contains 423 variables drawn from the parent questionnaire, followed by the statistical weight, special indicators and composite variables.

Though both sets of numbers were randomly assigned to maintain confidentiality, the IDs contain embedded linking, stratum and PSU information.' Students added to the first or second follow-up through freshening were linked to a core sample member. The base year school ID of the linked student was used as the root of the added student's ID.

The record layout for the base year parent survey appears in Volume I of the NELS:88 Base Year: Parent Component Data File User's Manual: The layout shows how variables are ordered within the records for each parent respondent on the file. Items taken from the hardcopy questionnaire appear at the beginning of each parent data record, in the same order as they appear in the second follow-up parent questionnaire contained in Appendix G. The variables in the record layouts are identified by the SAS and SPSS-X variable names that have been designated for each data element. No more than eight characters may comprise a SAS or SPSS-X variable name. The first two characters of the variable names from the parent questionnaire indicate the survey wave in which the variable was created. Thus, BY in the prefix of the variable name indicates a base year questionnaire item, while F2 in the prefix of the name refers to the second followup.

Since research questions frequently require independent or control variables such as the urbanicity of the school, the socioeconomic status of the family, or the gender of the individual, a large set of classification variables has been carefully constructed and added to the records in most of the second follow-up component files. A description of the specifications used to create these composite variables for the parent component is found in Appendix J.6 Perusal of these sections may also suggest additional ways in which the data may be configured for analyses. This section introduces the composites that have been constructed for the parent component file of the second follow-up of NELS:88. Most composite variables are constructed from two or more sources. These may be combinations of questionnaire items from the same or different NELS:88 data files, in the base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up. Some composites are drawn from an external sampling resource that is unavailable to users, or utilize an external conceptual scheme in order to rank, order, or otherwise recode survey data. A few composites are sufficiently central to analyses that they are constructed in each round of the survey. Some values should change over time; for example, it is natural for family size to change over the four year data collection interval of the base year and second follow-up parent surveys. Some variables, such as school type, are quite stable over time for an individual school but the type reported between survey rounds may not be the same if the student sample member changes schools since the first report. Other constructs, such as student sample member gender, may be improved with new information as the survey continues. For example, the second follow-up report on basic demographics is enhanced when a former non-participant completes a new student supplement and questionnaire. Because the sources for composite construction and quality control checks tend to multiply as additional rounds of data are collected, the validity of certain classification variables is strengthened over time. The most recent round in which such a variable appears contains the best classification information for sample members. Composites of School-level Characteristics. The composites of school-level characteristics provide information on key characteristics of students' second follow-up school. \"G12\" in the prefix of the variable name indicates a characteristic of the twelfth-grade school the student attended, even if the student were actually attending a different grade in the school during the 1992 data collection. Schoollevel composites are also included on the student component data file for dropouts, and the identification number of the last school attended by the dropout is included on the restricted use dropout component data file. G12CTRL1 classifies the student's second follow-up school by type of control: public, Catholic or other private, with private schools divided into other religious, no religious affiliation, or affiliation unknown. G I2CTRL1 is primarily reported from the school administrator questionnaire and is checked against the QED sampling file for consistency. G12CTRL2 classifies the student's second follow-up schOol type into public, Catholic, private NAIS, and other private--not NAIS. The values for this variable were compiled from both QED and NAIS membership lists. This variable appears only on the restricted-use version of the NELS:88 data files. Appendix J also lists the flags and the statistical weight for the parent sample in the order in which they appear in the data records. G12URBN3 is a three-category composite that reflects the type of place in which the student's public school district, Catholic diocese, or, for other private schools, county is located. The categories are urban, Juburban and rural. The information was obtained from QED, or when missing, looked up in the U.S. Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1992 (112th edition), Washington DC, 1992, pages 896-904, and added to the files. This composite is analogous to the variable that was used in HS&B and in NELS:88 sampling. G12kEGON indicates in which of the four U.S. Census regions the student's second follow-up school is located (Northeast, Midwest, South, West). It is created by collapsing the values of the state in the school address. G12STATE is only available on restricted-use files. Composites of Student-level Characteristics. A number of variables that have been reliorted by the student sample member (and supplemented with other source materials as needed or available) are included on the parent data file. F2SEX and F2RACE1 record the gender aud race/ethnicity, respectively, of the student sample member. F2API and F2HISP contain more specific Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic membership categories of students. F2BIRTHM and F2BIRTHY give the birth month and year of the student sample members. F2HSPROG repeats the type of high school program reported by the student in the second follow-up student questionnaire. Two composites appear on the parent file that attempt to capture the student sample member's perception of how chance, versus one's own actions, affects the way that life unfolds. Both draw on items that are in the second follow-up student and dropout questionnaires. The first \"Locus of Control\" construct is designed to be as comparable as possible with similar variables that were created for the NLS-72 and HS&B surveys. In order to achieve this comparability, F2LOCUS1 comprises fewer items than F2LOCUS2. A standardized quartile (created by applying the student weight to scores) is represented in F2LOCU2Q. Similarly, two constructs that attempt to capture the student sample member's level of self-esteem appear on the parent files. The first, F2CNCPTI, is designed to be as comparable as possible to parallel items in NLS-72 and HS&B, while the second, F2CNCPT2, uses the full set of second follow-up student questionnaire items that are available for operationalizing the concept. The quartile, F2CNCP2Q, is a weighted reflection of the more elaborated self concept measure. Finally, F2STAT gives the participation status of the student in the second follow-up. F2F1DOST indicates the dropout status of the sample member given what was known at the time of the first follow-up. F2DOSTAT indicates the dropout status of the student sample member by the end of the second follow-up data collection. Parent and Family Composites. In addition to the F2PAQFLG that indicates the presence of a second follow-up parent questionnaire on the file, an analogous variable, F2BYPAFG, indicates whether a base year parent questionnaire is available. F2BYSPFG and F2SPANFG reveal whether or not the parent questionnaire was completed in Spanish or English in the base year or the second follow-up parent survey respectively. Family size in the base year is reported in F2BYFMSZ, which was constructed from base year parent data or student data. Base year marital status, F2BYPMAR, was created from the base year parent questionnaire (note that the categories were recoded to match the parallel second follow-up item). The F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual composition of the student sample member's family in 1988 is contained in F2BYFCMP, for which responses were drawn from the base year student questionnaire. Family composition reported by the parent respondent to the base year parent survey appears in F2F1FCMP, although the \"F 1 \" in the variable name reflects the fact that it was created in the first follow-up. Finally, a number of composites are constructed from the second follow-up parent survey data. The composition of the student sample member's family, F2FCMP, and the size of the family in 1992, F2FA4SIZ, are built entirely from second follow-up parent questionnaire items. On the other hand, the highest level of education achieved by the parent respondent, F2PARED, begins with second follow-up parent survey information but brings in other sources of data when the parent item is not obtainable. Three varieties of socioeconomic status have been constructed for the second follow-up data files. The first of these, F2SES1, and its quartile employ the original scales used in NLS-72 and HS&B and utilize base year parent survey data as the first choice in their complex formula. F2SES2 and its quartile, F2SES2Q, use the same occupational scale but employ second follow-up parent data when available as the preferred source for the required information. The third socioeconomic composite and quartile, F2SES3, are constructed with an updated occupational prestige scale and data from the second follow-up parent component."}, {"section_title": "Packaged Statistical Programs", "text": "The procedures recommended for analyses of NELS:88 data with SAS are outlined in Appendix E.

Two related types of codebooks are provided for NELS:88--a hardcopy and an electronic codebook. Both forms of the codebook chronicle the details analysts need to interpret properly the results of each item: the exact wording of the question that was presented to the respondent, the distribution of all legitimate answers among survey participants, the location and type of data element for each variable on the file, as well as names and labels provided for use with statistical software.

The result is a user-controlled subset of the variables that is fully equipped with the tools required for statistical analysis.

Thousands of NELS:88 variables, the extensive statistical software programs and commands that transform the data in analyses, and electronic versions of data user manuals reside on a single CD-ROM. All are accessible with the MS-DOS operating system and statistical and word processing software that the user is likely 92 113 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual already accustomed to working with a PC. Virtually all steps that must be undertaken prior to actual analysis runs on the data files may now be conducted within the ECB. The ECB software is designed to acquaint the user with the available survey measures and responses by means of on-line, fully documented codebooks. Users may browse through the documentation, searching on both variables names and labels and on question text to find items that are suitable for the research question at hand. The final version of the ECB includes weighted and unweighted frequency distributions. Users can move 4uickly in the ECB between questionnaire items, sample indicators, and composite variables within a component, or between components of the study, and may select up to 255 variables of interest per session. A window shows how many variables have been tagged at any one time. The process culls a set of variables, and only those variables, that are appropriate to the user's own research issue. Since variable names and labels are stored electronically on the ECB, onerous tasks such as typing in this information that were formerly necessary are eliminated. The ECB permits users to write SAS-PC or SPSS-PC program code and/or command statements in order to construct system files of the selected variables. Finally, a print file of a codebook containing the frequencies for only the tagged items is another option with the ECB. The print file may subsequently be used to generate individualized hardcopy codebooks of the selected variables which may provide a most convenient reference during subsequent data analyses. In order to use the new EC'S technology, the following are required: a NELS:88 Compact Disc; a CD-ROM reader, used to read or copy the NELS:88 CD-ROM to a personal computer; an IBM-compatible personal computer (PC), minimally a 286 system; approximately 10 Mb space on the PC for the full ECB system; and' a substantial amount of space for the data files. Although up to 165 Mb is required for all publicly-available base year, first follow-up, and second follow-up data sets, it is not necessary to copy and/or analyze all of these files simultaneously. The NELS:88 CD-ROM includes installation procedures, programs and files required by the codebook system, the raw data files and data user manuals (in WordPerfect format). Different Versions of the ECBs. Table 7.3.2-1 lists three versions of the NELS:88 ECBs that have been created for NELS:88. The base year school sample is representative of all schools in the nation enrolling eighth grades in 1988. On the first follow-up ECB which includes base year files, information reflecting these schools has been released at two levels of analysis: aggregated at the level of the school (one record for each school), as well as distributed at the level of the students who attended those schools (one record for each such student). However, the second follow-up ECB only includes the base year school data at the level of the student.  The 1994 release of the first follow-up data contains minor adjustments to the cases that are included on the files. For example, sample members found to have been sampled into the study in error have been deleted and base year ineligible students found to be eligible in the first or second follow-up have been added. A few of the initial first follow-up variables have also been updated on the final version. Such adjustments are possible in longitudinal studies as new information becomes available or technical advancements become feasible. Although Table 7.3.2-1 includes both the interim and final versions of the second follow-up CD-ROM, this manual primarily discusses the contents of the fmal version of the second follow-up CD-ROM. The final second follow-up CD-ROM encompasses all thirteen of the major component files through the second follow-up of NELS:88. Cognitive test variables on all three waves of the survey have been refined and the first follow-up cases have been enhanced by the deletion of ineligibles and the addition of survey-eligible BYI sample members. Both the restricted use and public use CD-ROMs display a weighted and an unweighted frequency window. A number of restricted use ASCII files are also available on a separate CD-ROM; these files will not be in the electronic codebook format. These files include 1) the transcript component data file, 2) all first follow-up and second follow-up School Effectiveness Study data files, 3) the second follow-up early graduate student supplement, 4) the cognitive test item file which is also on the restricted use CD-ROM that contains the ECB, 5) the expanded sample file, and 6) selected zip code-level community contextual variables.

In the base year survey, these included: several state augmentations; a supplement of hearing-impaired students, funded by Gallaudet University; a supplement of Reformed Christian schools that are members of the Christian Schools International Organization, funded by the Barnabas Foundation; and the NELS:88 Enhancement Survey of Middle Grades Practices, funded by the Office of Research in the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), through the Johns Hopkins University Center for Research on Effective Schooling for Disadvantaged Students (CDS). The first follow-up wave of NELS:88 also included supplemental components: the state augmentations, continued from the base year; the School Effectiveness Study, supported by funds from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and by NCES; and the Base Year Ineligible study (BYI), also sponsored by NCES. The second follow-up wave of NELS:88 included continuations of the bas. e year and first follow-up state augmentations; the school effectiveness study; the continuation of the first follow-up Base Year Ineligibles study; and the continuation of the Christian schools supplement.

Like F2SES1, F2SES2 utilizes the original occupational prestige scale used for NLS-72 and HS&B. This scale is known as the Duncan SEI and is included in Table J-1 below. F2SES2 is constructed using second follow-up parent questionnaire data (F2SES 1 uses base year parent data or, if missing, other early sources). F2SES2 has valid values only for cases where the second follow-up parent questionnaire was completed. If the second follow-up parent questionnaire was not completed, then F2SES2 was set to \"BLANK.\" The following second follow-up parent data were used: father's education level, mother's education level, father's occupation, mother's occupation, and family income (data coming from F2P101A, F2P101B, F2P13, F2P16 and F2P74).

The sources given below were used to construct the parent's education level for F2SES2, listed in order by priority from left to right:  Missing Note: although \"Homemaker/Housewife\" and \"Military\" were response options in the second follow-up parent questionnaire, these categories are not included in the Duncan or GSS scales."}, {"section_title": "F2SES2Q", "text": "F2SES2Q is the quartile distribution of F2SES2.

F2SES3, like F2SES2, uses second follow-up parent survey information to estimate socioeconomic status. Unlike F2SES2, however, F2SES3 utilizes a new prestige scale. Both F2SES1 (on the student component data file) and F2SES2 applied the Duncan SEI scores to respondent occupation as a J-12 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual measure of prestige. The Duncan scale had also been used by NLS-72 and HS&B surveys to estimate socioeconomic status and applies the 1970 Census Occupation Classification System. F2SES3 applies prestige scores that were developed at NORC in the 1989 General Social Survey (GSS). The GSS scale represents more recent occupational rankings by a national sample of adults than the older Duncan method. The GSS Prestige Scale uses the 1980 Census Occupation Classification System. There are some differences between the 1970 and 1980 Census Occupational Coding Classification Systems. For example, the sales manager title has been moved from the sales category to the management category. However, the proportion of sales managers in the total population as of 1990 is less than 1.5 percent, probably not enough to make a significant difference to prestige outcomes.' Another change is that the averages that apply to the NELS:88 occupation categories (such as FARMER, PROFESSIONAL, etc., listed in block letters in the NELS:88 occupation items) were used for F2SES3. The earlier versions of socioeconomic status took the average prestige scores of only the occupations listed after the major categories in the NELS:88 questionnaire. . Table J-1 contrasts the Duncan scores with the new GSS prestige scores for each occupational category used in NLS-72, HS&B, and NELS:88 questionnaires. The three professional categories listed in the questionnaire item--school teacher, accountant, and M.D and lawyer--share the same prestige scores in both the Duncan and the GSS scales and do not make contributions to prestige that are independent from each other. The crosswalk of prestige scores shows that the new method has both a tighter range of resulting prestige scores and more clustering of the .occupational categories by prestige scores. The correlations between F2SES2 and F2SES3 are nevertheless quite high (.98) since occupational prestige is only one of the dimensions of the socioeconomic status composite.\nF2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual CD-ROM: Compact Disc Read-Only Memory. A computer storage disk in the same physical form as an audio CD. A CD-ROM can store approximately 650 megabytes of digital data. NELS:88 data are available both in magnetic media, such as tapes, as well as in optical laser disc media, such as CD-ROM. Ceiling effect: The result of a cognitive test having insufficient numbers of the more difficult items. In a longitudinal study, ceiling effects in the follow-up testings can cause change scores to be artificially constrained for high ability examinees. More information (that is, smaller error of measurement) is obtained with respect to ability level if high ability individuals receive relatively harder items (and if low ability individuals receive proportionately easier items). The matching of item difficulty to a person's ability level yields increased reliability at the extremes of the score distribution where it is most needed for studies of longitudinal change. That is, the measurement problems related to floor and ceiling effects in combination with regression effects found at the extreme score ranges seriously hamper the accuracy of change measures in longitudinal studies. Hence one strategy employed in NELS:88 to minimize ceiling effects was to develop test forms that are \"adaptive\" to the ability level of the examinee. The multilevel tests used in the first and second follow-ups of NELS:88--with test assignment based on prior test performance--work to minimize the possibility of ceiling effects biasing the estimates of the score gains. (See entry for \"Floor effect.\") Certainty school: A first or second follow-up school attended by four or more NELS:88 sample members, as determined by tracing and data collection efforts. These schools are included in the sample with certainty (probability=1). All NELS:88 first follow-up sample members in the school at the time of data collection were included in the second follow-up. Closed-ended: A type of question in which the data provider's responses are limited to given alternatives, as opposed to an open-ended question. (See entry for \"Open-ended.\") Cluster size: The number of NELS:88 sample members attending a particular high school. Codebook: A record of each variable being measured, including variable name, columns occupied by each variable in the data matrix, values used to define each variable, unweighted frequencies, unweighted percents, and weighted valid percents. (See entry for \"Electronic Codebook.\") Cognitive test battery: One of the two parts of the Student Survey (the second part being the student questionnaire). Four achievement areas (mathematics, reading, science, and social studies [history /citizenship /geography]) were measured. Cohort: A group of individuals who have a statistical factor in common, for example, year of birth or grade in school or year of high school graduation. NELS:88 embraces three overlapping but distinct nationally-representative grade cohorts: 1987-88 eighth graders, 1989-90 high school sophomores, and 1991-92 high school seniors. Composite variables: A composite variable is one that is constructed through either the combination of two or more variables (socioeconomic status, for example) or calculated through the application of a mathematical function to a variable. Also called a \"derived variable\" or \"constructed variable.\" Confidence interval: A sample-based estimate expressed as an interval or range of values within which the true population value is expected to be located (with a specified degree of confidence). Contextual data: In NELS:88, the primary unit of analysis is the student (or dropout), and information from the other study components, referred to as the contextual data, should be viewed as extensions of the student data--for example, as school administrator, teacher, and parent reports on the student's school learning environment or home situation. Core school: School that was selected between Phases I and 2 of the second follow-up to receive the full complement (School Administrator, Teacher, Transcript) of study components, and for in-school data collection sessions. Core student: Students who are part of the primary cohort of NELS:88, in contrast to state augmentation or School Effectiveness Study students. The core students include those chosen as eighth graders in the 1988 Base Year Study and those added to the sample through freshening procedures during the first or second follow-up. Core study: The original NELS:88 study, in contrast to the study with additions and follow-up additions like the state augtnentation studies and the School Effectiveness Study. Course offerings: School-level summaries of courses offered; while in HS&B course offerings data were collected for all schools, in NELS:88 such data have been collected only for schools in the School Effectiveness Study. Cross-sectional survey: A cross-sectional design represents events and statuses at a single point in time. For example, a cross-sectional survey may measure the cumulative educational attainment (achievements, attitudes, statuses) of students at a particular stage of schooling (for example, eighth grade, tenth grade, or twelfth grade). In contrast, a longitudinal (o, repeated measurement of the same sample units) survey measures the change or growth in educational attainments that occurs over a particular period of schooling. The longitudinal design of NELS:88 generates--by means of sample \"freshening\"--three representative cross-sections (eighth graders in 1988, high school sophomores in 1990, seniors in 1992) and permits analysis of individual level change over time through longitudinal analysis and of group level and intercohort change through the cross-sectional comparisons. (See entry for \"Longitudinal or Panel Surwly.\") Data element: The most basic unit of information. In data processing it is the fundamental data structure. It is defined by its size (in characters) and data type (e.g. alphanumeric, numeric only, true/false, date) and may include a specific set of values or range of values. Design effect: A measure of sample efficiency. The design effect (DEFF) is the variance of an estimate divided by the variance of the estimate that would have occurred if a sample of the same size had been selected using simple random sampling. Sometimes it is more useful to work with standard errors than with variances. The root design effect (DEFT) expresses the relation between the actual standard error of an estimate and the standard error of the corresponding estimates from a simple random sample. Dropout: The term is used both to describe an event--leaving school before graduating--and a status--an individual who is not in school and is not a graduate at a defined point in time. The \"cohort dropout rate\" in NELS:88 is based on measurement of enrollment status of 1988 eighth graders two and four years later (that is, in the spring term of 1990 and the spring term of 1992) and of 1990 sophomores two years later. A respondent who has not graduated from high school or attained an equivalency certificate and who has not attended high school for 20 consecutive days (not counting any excused absences) is considered to be a dropout. In contrast, transferring schools--for example, from a public to a private school--is not 332 L-3 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual regarded as a dropout event, nor is delayed graduation (as when a student is continuously enrolled but takes an additional year to complete school). A person who drops out of school may later return and graduate: at the time the person left school initially, he or she is called a \"dropout,\" and at the time the person returns to school, he or she is called a \"stopout.\" Early graduate: A student who graduated from high school in less than the typical amount of time. For example, if a student graduated in December of his/her senior year (when the majority of his/her classmates graduate the following May or June), the student is categorized as an early graduate. In the main study data collection, early graduates were administered a special supplement in the student questionnaire along with the cognitive test battery. Electronic codebook (ECB): While hardcopy codebooks with item stems, response categories, associated response frequency distributions, unweighted percents, and weighted valid percents are contained within the NELS:88 user's manuals, NELS:88 data are also available on CD-ROM in an electronic codebook (ECB) format. For example, the electronic codebook created for the combined base year first follow-up NELS:88 data is a menu-driven system that allows users to perform functions such as the following: (a) search a list of NELS:88 BY-Fl database variables based upon key words or variable names/labels; (b) display weighted and unweighted percentages for each variable in the database; (c) display question text for each variable in the database; (d) select or tag variables for subsequent analysis; (e) generate SAS-PC or SPSS-PC+ program code/command statements for subsequently constructing a system file of the selected variables; and (f) generate a codebook of the selected variables. An electronic codebook is also being prepared for the NELS:88 second follow-up data, and will again be housed on a CD-ROM. ETS: Educational Testing Service. NORC's subcontractor for NELS:88 cognitive test development and evaluation. Fl: The NELS:88 first follow-up, conducted in 1990. F2: The NELS:88 second follow-up, conducted in 1992. File: Refers to a data file containing a set of related computerized records. Floor effect: The result of a cognitive test being too difficult for a large number of the examinees, causing the low ability examinees to receive chance scores on the first testing, and on subsequent testings if the test remains too difficult. Floor effects result in an inability to discriminate among low ability individuals at time one or time two, and there will be no reliable discrimination among examinees with respect to amounts of change. A possible solution, utilized in NELS:88, is to develop test forms that are \"adaptive\" to the ability level of the examinee, which tends to minimize the possibility of floor effects biasing the estimates of the score gains. Followback study of excluded students: A continuation in the NELS:88 second follow-up of a special substudy begun in the first follow-up as (see entry for) the base year ineligibles study. Freshening: A NELS:88 sampling procedure by which high school sophomores were added in the first follow-up who were not in the eighth grade in the U.S. two years before. This process was repeated in the second follow-up, adding high school seniors who were not in the eighth grade in the U.S. four years before, and not in the tenth grade in the U.S. two years before. This process ensured that the sample would be representative of the 1992 senior class by allowing 1992 seniors who did not have a chance for selection into the base year (or the first follow-up) sample to have some probability of 1992 selection. L-4 333 F2: Parent Component Data File User's Manual GED recipient: A person who has obtained certification of high school equivalency by meeting state requirements and passing an approved exam, which is intended to provide an appraisal of the person's achievement or performance in the broad subject matter areas usually required for high school graduation. (See entry for \"GED test\" and \"Alternative completer.\") GED test: General Educational Development test. A test administered by the American Council on Education as the basis for awarding a high school equivalent certification. HS&B: High School and Beyond. The second in the series of longitudinal education studies sponsored by NCES. The HS&B Base Year study surveyed sophomore and senior students in 1980. IEP: Individualized Education Program in special education for students with a mental or physical disability. IRT: Item Response Theory. A method of estimating achievement level by considering the pattern of right, wrong, and omitted responses on all items administered to an individual student. Rather than merely counting right and wrong responses, the IRT procedure also considers characteristics of each of the test items, such as their difficulty, and the likelihood that they could be guessed correctly by lowability individuals. IRT scores are less likely than simple number-right or formula scores to be distorted by correct guesses on difficult items if a student's response vector also contains incorrect answers to easier questions. Another attribute of IRT that makes it useful for NELS:88 is the calibration of item parameters for all items administered to all students. This makes it possible to obtain scores on the same scale for students who took harder or easier forms of the test. IRT also permits vertical scaling of the three grade levels (grade 8 in 1988, grade 10 in 1990, grade 12 in 1992). Item nonresponse: The amount of missing information when a valid response to an item or variable was expected. (See entry for \"Unit-nonresponse.\") LEP: Limited English Proficient. A concept developed to assist in identifying those language-minority students (individuals from non-English language backgrounds) who need language assistance services, in their own language or in English, in the schools. (See entries for \"NEP\" and \"LM.\") The Bilingual Education Act, reauthorized in 1988 (PL 100-297), describes a limited English proficient student as one who: 1) meets one or more of the following conditions: a) the student was born outside of the United States or the student's native language is not English; b) the student comes from an environment where a language other than English is dominant; or c) the student is American Indian or Alaskan Native and comes from an environment where a language other than English has had a significant impact on his/her level of English language proficiency; and 2) has sufficient difficulty speaking, reading, writing, or understanding the English language to deny him or her the opportunity to learn successfully in English-only classrooms.
