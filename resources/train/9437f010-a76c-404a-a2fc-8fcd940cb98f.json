Policy evaluators should consider all costs and benefits, including side effects and implementation costs. This report seeks to contribute to the performance evaluation of policies with regard to income objectives and is part of the OECD's long standing efforts to improve information in this area. It provides basic information on the distribution of support and income by farm size, farm type and region in a number of OECD countries. Taking into account various types of payments and market price support, it compares average levels of support and their share in farm receipts between different categories of farms. Using farm survey data, farm populations and categories are harmonised between countries, allowing to a certain extent for some cross-country comparison. Thirteen OECD countries and the European Commission provided data for this report. Although these countries and regions are diverse, a few general conclusions can be drawn on the characteristics of the main recipients of support and their income situation. In most countries examined, agricultural production and support are highly concentrated on the larger farms (measured by the value of gross agricultural output): the 25% largest farms produce 45 to 85% of gross agricultural output and receive 35 to 75% of all support. They also represent 50 to75% of all farm income, and their average income is well above the average of all farms. While support is unequally distributed and benefits mostly larger farms, which have a higher average farm income, its distribution is slightly less unequal than is the distribution of gross agricultural output. All other things being equal, support improves slightly equality in the distribution of gross receipts and income by farm size. As market price support is closely related to commodity production, its distribution is more unequal than that of payments. Taking into account off-farm sources of income reduces income inequalities by farm size, as smaller farms tend to rely more on off-farm sources of income than do larger ones. Net worth is also concentrated on larger farms but less so than output, support or income, while the distribution of farm liabilities is close to that of farm income or slightly more unequal, indicating that smaller farms have proportionally less debt than large ones. While the smallest farms receive a smaller proportion of all support, support, in particular payments, accounts for a larger share of their gross receipts. In many countries, support is concentrated on a few farm types (mainly crop, dairy and cattle farms) and there are large differences in concentration between market price support and total payments. This reflects differences in the support rate and composition by commodity, but also the share of specific farm types in the whole farm population. Indeed, differences in average support and income level are greater by farm type than by farm size. In many cases, however, support seems to reduce income differences between farm types. This is clear in EU member states where high income poultry, fruit and vegetables farms receive few payments, while low income grazing cattle and sheep farms are highly supported, particularly in less favoured areas. As some forms of support depend on commodity market conditions (market price support, and counter-cyclical payments in Canada and the United States), differences in support between farm types vary more between years than differences by farm size and region. Among types of regions, income differences are generally smaller and support seems to reduce them. Gini coefficients, which measure inequalities between individual farms without classifying them, confirm that support has only a slight redistributive impact on income. The distribution of support depends on the characteristics of policies, in particular its link to commodity production and the degree of targeting, which in turn affects the income transfer efficiency of support, i.e. the share of support transmitted to producers as additional income. This share of support varies by policy based on the portion that is captured by input suppliers and the downstream food chain. The transfer efficiency of support is not analysed in this report. The distribution of support also depends heavily on the structural characteristics of the farm population, all the more so when support is not precisely targeted. As a result, for a given policy, the distributional impact will differ by region or country. These considerations need to be taken into account when designing effective and efficient policies, and considering their equity. Improving the efficiency and equity of policies would require better targeting of income support, and thus better information on the income and wealth situation of the agricultural population."}, {"section_title": "Background", "text": "In many OECD countries, agricultural policies generate significant transfers from taxpayers and consumers to farmers, which in 2009 reached around USD 250 billion or 22% of farm receipts in the OECD area. Some agricultural policies have explicit or implicit distributional objectives, in particular those aiming to improve the income situation of farm populations or to reduce the production costs of farm operations. But other policies remunerate environmental services, i.e. policy transfers are related to the value of services provided or cost incurred in their provision. Whatever the policy objective, how support is distributed amongst farmers is of increasing interest in many OECD countries. As budgetary payments progressively replace market price support, support has become more visible and has therefore attracted public attention. As a result, more countries now publish statistics on the distribution of budgetary payments to farmers. There is little information on the distribution of market price support (MPS), 1 since budget expenditure related to MPS are not payments to individual producers, and the other part of MPS is paid by consumers. When support is linked to the volume of production, distribution is necessarily very unequal and large farms receive most of the support (OECD, 1999(OECD, , 2003. As structural changes lead to more production specialisation and concentration among farms, it increases inequality in the distribution of production-linked support. However, policy reform has changed the way in which support is delivered and the link to current production of specific commodities is often weaker in the policy mix. Does this mean that -decoupled\u2016 payments are more equally distributed? No dramatic changes should be expected given that payment levels often reflect past production patterns, but de-linking support from past commodity production support patterns offers opportunities to target specific objectives. Interest in the distribution of support can be driven purely by equity concerns, 2 more specifically the impact of support on the distribution of farm household income. Supporting or stabilising income is a major objective of agricultural policies in many OECD countries and it is useful to assess support policies with regard to this objective. But the distribution of support can also have an impact on economic efficiency. OECD worked on these issues in the early 2000s. In evaluating the performance of policies with regard to income objectives, a 2003 study (OECD, 2003) looked at the distribution of support by farm size in selected OECD countries using quartiles based on gross sales. 3 It compared the distribution of support (including market price support) and the distribution of income in order to evaluate the redistributive effects of market price support and budgetary payments on farm income. In this context, data needs and deficiencies were explored and it emerged that differences in the definitions of farms, farm households and income made comparison across countries very difficult. 1. MPS includes transfers from taxpayers and consumers that create a gap between domestic market prices and border prices. It is calculated by the OECD for a number of commodities and enters into the calculation of OECD Producer Support Estimates (PSE) (Box 2.1). 2. Equity has been recognised by OECD ministers as an operational criterion for the evaluation of agricultural policies (OECD, 1998). 3. Australia, Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Finland, Japan, Korea, Netherland, Switzerland and United States. The network has been operational since 2008. At its first meeting, participants decided to undertake work on the distribution of support. The consensus was to start with a relatively simple study to test the functioning of the network. An outline for a study was discussed at the second meeting of the Network on 29-30 September 2008. It was decided that the project would aim to answer the following questions: \uf0b7 How is support distributed amongst farms with different characteristics (e.g. farm type/specialisation, region, economic size or income)? \uf0b7 How does support affect the level and distribution of gross receipts, and thus income? \uf0b7 How are income and wealth components distributed? Precise terms of reference were agreed at the third meeting on 26 February 2009. Standard tables for collecting data were subsequently prepared by a group of participants and sent to all network participants. They have been revised subsequently to include more variables. This report draws on data received from countries or regions listed in Table 1.1. Compared to previous OECD work, this project updates the analysis and improves consistency across countries, as definitions were harmonised to the extent possible (see methodology section). It also provides additional information on a consistent basis by farm type and region. In terms of methodology, direct access to individual farm data allows market price support to be estimated for each farm and Gini coefficients to be computed directly from individual data. The following section describes briefly the methodology and data sources used in this analysis. Main finding are then presented and policy implications are drawn."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "To analyse the distribution of support, this study compares differences in average support by farm size, farm type or region. It also reports the share of total support received by a given category of farms (e.g. dairy farms or the 25% largest farms). To shed light on the redistributive impact of support, the distribution of support is compared with that of gross agricultural output and income (variables are defined in Box 2.1 and the paragraph above). In addition, differences in average support level/rate for specific groups of farms are compared with differences in income levels. As explained in Box 2.1, the relationship between support and income is a purely static and accounting one. This does not mean that in economic terms, all support ends up as additional net income for the farmer. Most forms of support have an impact on input use or prices so that part of support is captured by input suppliers and the downstream food chain. When support is coupled to current production, a significant share of support to farmers disappears in -resource costs,\u2016 the resource allocation distortions caused by support. Moreover the structure of food chains may lead to imperfect price transmission that results in part of the support being captured by the downstream food chain. As a result, the income transfer efficiency of most types of support is below one (OECD, 2003). In addition, this static analysis does not take into account adjustments in markets and farm households that would occur if support was removed. We cannot deduce from the relationship between support and income that if support was removed, income would decrease by an equivalent amount. For this analysis, a number of variables and indicators are computed from individual farm level data. To the extent possible, definitions of farms and farm groups were harmonised across countries, as were definitions of variables (e.g. farm income) and indicators (e.g. Gini coefficients) used in the analysis. While those efforts improve crosscountry comparability, they do not achieve perfect consistency as some national definitions are kept."}, {"section_title": "Definitions of population and aggregates", "text": "The network made it possible to improve the consistency of definitions across countries. A major problem when comparing EU farm statistics with North American or Asian statistics is that in the former, farms are narrowly defined with a significant number of smaller farms being excluded from the survey, while other countries usually impose very low farm size limits and include part-time and hobby farms in their survey. Farm definition has an important influence on distribution so it is crucial to reduce differences in order to be able to make comparisons. It was therefore decided to exclude smaller farms as long as the total farm population represented by the sample accounts for 90% of total agricultural sales. At the other end of the spectrum, no maximum limit was imposed and corporate farms were included (except for some variables like off-farm income). Farms in the population are ranked using quartiles defined on the basis of gross agricultural output. They provide, for example, information on the share of support received by the 25% larger farms. With regard to farm types, it was decided to keep national definitions and group them as follows: \uf0b7 field crops \uf0b7 nursery/greenhouse \uf0b7 fruits and vegetables \uf0b7 dairy \uf0b7 cattle (grazing and feedlots) \uf0b7 pigs \uf0b7 poultry/eggs \uf0b7 sheep/goats, and \uf0b7 others. Many farms have diversified production. Farms are generally assigned to the class type that accounts for the greatest share of farm receipts (Canada and United States) or gross margin (standard gross margin in the EU FADN). For some EU member states, a significant share of farms are classified in the -others\u2016 category, which generally groups mixed farms that do not have a dominant specialization. In terms of regions, participants decided on the appropriate regional level in their country, but it was suggested they could use the OECD definition of rural, intermediate and urban regions. 5"}, {"section_title": "Definition of variables and indicators", "text": "Variables and indicators were generally computed using individual data.

Total support (often referred to as \"support\" in the text) includes total payments and market price support. Total payments include budgetary transfers to farmers from agricultural policy and insurance payments, conservation payment in United States, first and second pillar payments of the Common Agricultural Policy in the European Union.

Due to the homogeneity of its farm structures and the characteristics of its product specialisation, Italy is an exception as the 25% smallest farms receive 22.5% of total support and 25% of total payments, while the 25% largest farms receive 35% of total support and 33% of total payments. This indicates that support is less concentrated than gross agricultural output in most countries. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 also show that the concentration of gross agricultural output varies significantly by country, with the highest degrees of concentration found in Estonia and the EU27. 10 Market price support (MPS) is generally more concentrated on the largest farms than payments because it is directly tied to production (Figure 3.1). This can also be illustrated graphically using concentration curves constructed on the basis of quartiles based on gross agricultural output (Box 2.2). Figure 3.3 shows that total payments are closer to the first diagonal (which represents an equal distribution) than MPS. There are significant differences between the distribution of payments and MPS among EU member states, which reflect differences in the structure of production and support. In Germany, the difference is small as first pillar payments, 11 which make up over three-quarters of all payments, closely follow the distribution of MPS. The implementation of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) in 2005 has hardly affected the concentration of first pillar payments. Although most payments are no longer linked to current farmed area or animals, they remain linked to past support (historical implementation) or to area managed by the farmer (regional implementation). In Italy, the distribution of payments is also very close to that of MPS. In Estonia, first pillar 9. The 25% largest farms are in the top quartile based on gross agricultural output. 10. In fact, diversity within the EU increased with enlargement. As a result, concentration of gross agricultural output is higher in the EU27 than in sub-groups of the Europena Union (EU15, EU10 and EU2). 11. For an overview of the CAP, see OECD (2011). payments, implemented as a single area payment scheme (SAPS) with the same rate for each hectare in a given year, are more unequally distributed than MPS. As the rate of payments increases every year during the ten year transition period following accession in 2004, inequality in the distribution of total support is expected to increase. The same is found for the EU2, which groups Bulgaria and Romania. In EU aggregates and the EU member states included in the analysis, second pillar payments are more equally distributed amongst farms of different size, in particular in Germany where the 25% largest farms receive 34% of those payments (compared to close to 60% of first pillar payments). In 2007, second pillar payments accounted for 40% of all payments in Estonia, 20% in England, around 15% in Germany, and around 10% in the Netherlands. A majority of second pillar payments are targeted to specific environmental outcomes, regions with specific handicaps or specific rural development projects (OECD, 2009b). As a result, those payments are less likely to be proportional to farm size. In most EU member states, second pillar payments are less concentrated than first pillar payments and both are less concentrated than MPS, except in Belgian Flanders and Italy (Figure 3.4). In France, second pillar payments are concentrated on the smallest farms: the 25% smallest farms receive around 35% of second pillar payments. Overall, support is unequally distributed by farm size, but less so than gross agricultural output and farm receipts in most cases. This indicates that support has a redistributional effect by farm size, which is larger for payments than for MPS. As illustrated by Figure 3.3, farm income is generally more equally distributed than gross agricultural output, but the difference is not only related to support. Most countries do not report information on off-farm income of farm households, either because they do not collect this information or because results were not representative for lack of responses. In the four countries that report total farm household income, it is clear that off-farm income reduces income inequalities by farm size, as smaller farms tend to rely more on off-farm income than larger ones (Figure 3.3). In individual EU countries which provided the information and in Canada, the distribution of farm liabilities is close to that of farm income, while in EU aggregates, is it more unequal. At the same time, the distribution of net worth is more equal than that of liabilities in all countries (Figure 3.5). This would indicate that smaller farms have proportionally less debt than large ones.                "}, {"section_title": "Differences by farm size", "text": "Another way to look at differences between farms is to measure the ratio between the average level of support and other income components for a farm group (quartile, farm type, region), and the average level of those variables for all farms. According to Figure 3.6, the 25% largest farms receive, on average, levels of support that are more than twice the average of all farms in most countries, except Denmark, Belgian Flanders and Italy where the ratio is around 1.5. 12 This ratio is close to three in the EU27. Average farm income for the 25% largest farms is about twice that of all farms or more: it is close to 2.5 times higher in Canada, England, Ireland and the United States; about three times higher in EU aggregates and even more in Estonia. But when reported their farm household income is closer to twice that of all farms. This shows that large farms have, on average, lower levels of off-farm income than smaller ones. The poor income performance of the 25% largest farms in Denmark is related to negative average farm income of large pig farms in 2007 (Annex Table C5). The situation was different in previous years. For example, the ratio between the average of the 25% largest farms and the average of all farms was 1.6 for farm income in 2006 compared to 0.7 in 2007 (Annex Table C3). In contrast, the 25% smallest farms receive on average total support which is less than half the average of all farms, while their average size is about a quarter of the average of all farms or less. The only exception is Italy where average support for the 25% smallest farms is close to the average of all farms. The ratio between the first quartile and all farms is generally lower for gross agricultural output, receipts and farm income than for support and in particular payments. This indicates that while smaller farms receive on average less support, it accounts for a higher share of their receipts: about two-thirds in Finland and Ireland, 50% in Estonia, 40% in England, 30% in France and the EU15, and 25% in Germany and the EU27 (Figure 3.7). The large share of payments for lower farm quartiles in Estonia reflects the low value of market receipts in smaller farms. In Ireland, it is due to the large number of small cattle farms and their dependence on payments, while in Finland the share of payments in gross receipts is high for all farms due to national payments, in particular in Northern regions. In the United States, all quartiles have about the same share of support in farm receipts (around 7%), but the 25% smallest farms have lower MPS and higher payments, while the 25% largest farms have higher MPS and lower payments than the average. Figure 3.7 also illustrates the large differences in the share of support in farm receipts between countries, whatever the farm size. 12. Although it is included in gross agricultural output, MPS is not reported separately for Finland, France and Spain. As a result, total support cannot be computed and discussion for these countries is restricted to the distribution of payments.    Source: Annex Table C4."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of support and income by farm type", "text": "The distribution of support by farm type varies by country. It also depends on the type of support. In many countries, total support and payments do not have the same distribution by farm type. In Canada and the United States, dairy farms, which account for around 15% of all farms and gross agricultural output, concentrate about 85% of market price support and 5% of payments. Crop farms in Canada account for about 40% of all farms and 25% of gross agricultural output, and concentrate about 40% of payments and less than 1% of market price support (Figure 3.8). In the United States, crop farms account for half of all farms and receive almost three-quarters of payments. Support is also concentrated on dairy farms in most of the ten EU member states included in this analysis: except in Italy, they receive between a quarter and two third of total support (22% on average in the EU27) and 30-75% of MPS (but on average for the EU27, they receive 24% of MPS). The concentration of support on dairy farms is particularly high in Denmark as this category includes significant beef production and associated support. Field crops receive a quarter to a third of support and a third of payments in Estonia, Finland, Germany and Italy but less than 15% of support in other EU member states represented, where livestock farms are more important. In the EU27, they receive 37% of total payments and 34% of total support. In the Netherlands, crop farms and cattle farms account each for around 15% of all farms and receive a proportional share of support and a slightly more than proportional share of payments (20%). But greenhouse, nursery and floriculture farms, which account for 13% of farms, receive only 5% of payments and 9% of total support. 13 In England, half of total payments go to mixed farms (others), which account for 38% of all farms and receive the same percentage of total support. This proportion is also high (above a quarter of support) in Estonia, Belgian Flanders, France, Germany and Italy. In Estonia and Germany, the distribution of total support is not so different from that of payments: In Germany, crop farms receive 25% of support and 29% of payments, while mixed farms (others), which account for about a quarter of all farms, receive around 30% of support and payments. In Estonia, crop farms receive about one-third of total support and payments, and mixed farms about a quarter of both variables. The share of support received by each farm type is also very close to the proportion of farm type in the total number of farms. In Finland, livestock farms receive proportionally more payments than crop farms, but first pillar payments are distributed in proportion to the number of farms in the population. The high share of support, in particular MPS, received by cattle farms in Belgian Flanders may be explained by the importance of dairy production in mixed cattle farms. In France, crop and grazing cattle farms receive a higher share of total payments than their share in the population, while in Ireland, this is the case for dairy, cattle and sheep and goat farms. 13. The rate of MPS for horticulture is assumed to be equal to the average of all crops.

In 2007, Canadian crop farms received about the same average payment as the average of all farms, but less support (Figure 3.9). This difference between support and payment is because dairy farms in Canada receive three times the average support of all farms, mainly in the form of market price support, although according to their average gross agricultural output, they are a little bit smaller in Canada (Figure 3.9 and Annex Table C5). This situation is relatively stable over the three years examined. In Canada, pig and poultry farms are twice the average size and, in 2007, they also received total support per farm higher than the average for all farms. This is specific to 2007; they received much less support in previous years. 14 This reflects the countercyclical nature of Canadian support, which is mainly based on the provision of safety nets to farmers. High levels of support in 2007 contributed to increasing the average farm income for poultry farms: it reached three times the average of all farms, but the average farm income of pig farms remained much lower than the average of all farms for the second consecutive year. Cattle farms are about average in size and income, but receive less support than the average of all farms. In terms of net worth, dairy and poultry farms in Canada are above the average of all farms, field crop farms are at the average level, and cattle and pig farms below that level. In the United States, the income of field crop farms is lower than the average of all farms but commensurate with their size. Dairy farms are above average size, receive much more support than the average of all farms, mainly in the form of MPS, but their farm income is close to average. Cattle farms are of average size but their farm income is half the average of all farms. However, cattle farmers supplement farm income with offfarm sources of income to a larger extent than do dairy farmers. Pig farms are almost double the size of average farms and their average income is twice as large although they receive little support, but poultry farms are much smaller in terms of size and average income. In EU member states, very large farms are found in the poultry sector, which accounts for a small percentage of all farms ( Figure 3.9, Annex Table C5). Relative to the average of all farms, the average support received by poultry farms is higher (four times higher in the EU27), but not as much as their average size. Pig farms are also above the average farm size, but to varying degrees (1.5 to 7 times larger depending on the country; 2.7 times higher in the EU27). In addition, their income was poor if not negative in 2007, reflecting low world prices, but in general, they did not receive compensatory support. For example, in Denmark and the Netherlands, pig farms had on average negative farm income and while off-farm income attenuated the loss, it did not compensate it. Farm income in pig farms was also negative in Estonia in 2007, and very low in other countries. This was not the case in previous year, where pig farms had an average income significantly higher than the average of all farms (up to three times higher in Estonia in 2006). In a number of EU member states included in the analysis as well as for the EU27, crop farms are on average smaller than the average of all farms, but they have a larger economic size in England, France and Ireland (Figure 3.9). They receive proportionally more first pillar payments, and except in England more total support (Annex Table C5). As a result, their income relative to the average of all farms is higher than their relative farm size. 14. It should be noted that payments can be received several months after the sales of commodity. They can even be recorded the following year in farm accounts. The average dairy farm in the EU27 is larger than the average of all farms, receives more support and more payments. The average cattle farm, however, is much smaller than the average of all farms and it receives more support and payment. Dairy and cattle farms are on average smaller than the average of all farms in Belgian Flanders, the Netherlands, France and Germany and receive relatively more support. In other EU member states covered, cattle farms are also smaller than the average but dairy farms are larger and have an income above the average of all farms. Dairy farms receive generally more total support than the average and their income is significantly higher in many cases (two to three times higher in Denmark and Ireland), while cattle farm have farm incomes significantly lower than the average of all farms, despite receiving significant levels of support. Compared to other farm types, cattle farmers receive the highest share of their gross receipts from support, except in Germany where sheep and goat farms are more dependent on support ( Figure 3.10 and Annex Table C6). This proportion was important but lower for dairy farms in 2007 due to relatively high prices on the world market, but it was higher in 2004, before the 2003 CAP reform was implemented. In many EU member states, a relatively large percentage of farms (a quarter in Estonia and Germany; 38% in England) is classified as -others\u2016. This aggregate, which includes mixed farms, is slightly better than the average of farm income in terms of size, support level and farm income. The share of -other\u2016 farms is much smaller in Canada (8%), the United States (5%) and the Netherlands (12%). In EU member states reporting off farm income, the differences between average farm income and farm household income are not large as in Canada or the United States as EU surveys focus on the main occupation farmers. The impact of support on differences in income by farm type is not clear. Support does not seem to affect much the diversity in farm receipts by farm type as compared to that of gross agricultural output in Canada. It reduces it slightly in England, Germany, the Netherland and the United States, and more significantly in Estonia and Ireland. Differences in net worth among farm types do not seem as large as differences in income. Figure 3.10 illustrate differences in the share of support in gross farm receipts by farm type, which mirrors differences by commodity (OECD, 2009b). The share of support in gross farm receipts also reflects its importance in income. In Canada and the United States, dairy farms derive a larger share of their receipts from MPS than other farms, while in the EU aggregate and in EU member states represented, cattle and sheep farms are the most dependent on support, both MPS and payments. For each farm type, the share of support in gross receipts is generally higher in EU member states than in North America. This is consistent with what is found at the national level: in 2007, %PSEs reached 19% in Canada, 10% in the United States and 25% in the EU.    Table C6."}, {"section_title": "Differences by region", "text": "Canada, England, Germany, Italy and the United States provided results by type of region defined according to national or OECD regional typology, which is based on regional population density and the presence of an urban centre (OECD, 2009a). As a result, around 80% of farms are classified as predominantly rural in Canada and England, 40% in the United States, 30% in Germany and 25% in Italy. In Canada, farms in predominantly rural areas concentrate about 75% of gross agricultural output, 73% of market price support and 80% of payments. Farms in predominantly urban areas account for 6% of all farms, less than 10% of gross agricultural output and concentrate about 6% of total support. In Canada, England and Italy, the average share of support, notably payments, in gross farm receipts is lower in farms located in predominantly urban regions than at national level (Figure 3.12). This is the opposite in Germany and the United States, probably because farms in predominantly urban regions are of a type that receives larger payments in Germany and MPS in the United States ( Figure 3.9, Annex Table C7). In Canada, Italy and the United States, the average gross agricultural output per farms in predominantly urban areas is larger than the average of all farms. Except in Germany, farms in predominantly rural areas are relatively smaller than farms in other types of regions (Figure 3.11). In the United States, farms in regions classified as predominantly urban are larger than farms in other regions; they receive higher average levels of total support but lower levels of payments than the average of all farms. They also have a higher share of gross receipts from MPS possibly because of the importance of dairy farms (Figure 3.9). Predominantly rural and intermediate farms are very similar in size and receipts, but predominantly rural farms receive more payments and less MPS. In England, average levels of total support and payments are higher than the average of all farms in predominantly rural (Figure 3.11). This probably reflects the number of cattle and sheep farms in these regions (Figure 3.9). In Italy, which is relatively urbanized, farms in intermediate regions receive on average more support than at national level, but support, in particular payments, accounts for a higher share of gross farm receipts than in other types of regions (Figure 3.12). This may reflect higher levels of payments from second pillar measures, in particular less favoured area payments. Overall, differences in average farm income are less than 10% between types of regions. In Canada, average farm income is highest in intermediate regions and lowest in predominantly urban regions. Although average gross agricultural output is the highest for farms in predominantly urban areas, compared to farms in predominantly rural areas, average farm income is lower because average farm expenses and depreciation are much higher in predominantly urban areas. In Germany average farm income is highest in predominantly rural regions, and in England in intermediate regions. The hierarchy between types of regions is maintained in Germany between gross agricultural output and farm income, although payments in predominantly rural areas reduce the difference in income in intermediate regions. In the United States, predominantly urban farms have on average significantly higher farm income than farms in other regions and the income difference is maintained when off-farm income is taken into account."}, {"section_title": "-DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPORT AND INCOME IN AGRICULTURE", "text": "OECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES WORKING PAPER NO. 46 \u00a9 OECD 2011    \nOECD FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES WORKING PAPER NO. 46 \u00a9 OECD 2011 equity, income support is expected to benefit those with low incomes, making the distribution of income more equal. But other policy measures, which do not have explicit or implicit income support or distribution objectives, do not necessarily need to be equally distributed: they are equitable to the extent that they are targeted and support is related to the value of goods and services provided. While being equitable, they can be unequally distributed if different farms provide those services in different amounts. As with any type of public money, however, there may be limits to the degree of inequality that society is ready to accept for the remuneration of services, and policy makers must take this into consideration. Moreover, whatever the objective, policy makers must make sure that market distortions are minimal, i.e. that payments are as decoupled as possible. This study shows that support contributes to raising farm income and improving slightly its distribution, but with the bulk of support going to larger farms, with above average farm incomes. To the extent that a significant portion of this support is often related to income objectives, this represents significant leakage to unintended beneficiaries, in particular farmers with above average incomes. The strong correlation between support and farm economic size indicates the lack of targeting of most support. For an income policy to be efficient and equitable, it would have to target an income indicator, preferably at individual level, so that only the intended beneficiaries receive support and that the support is adapted to their specific situation. Any other target will lead to significant leakages and inefficiencies, unless it is strongly correlated to the income problem. In order to develop more efficient and equitable policies, governments need better information on the individual income and wealth situation of farm households.

Unlike other measures, it does not require any ranking or grouping of farms in order to be computed and combines in a single indicator all sources of inequality (by farm size, type, region or any other farm characteristics). Figure 3.13 and Annex Table C9 shows that total support is as unequal as gross agricultural output in Germany. It is more unequal in Canada, EU aggregates, Belgium Flanders, the Netherlands (in 2004 and 2007) and the United States (compared to gross receipts), but it is more equally distributed than gross agricultural output in England and Estonia. This necessarily reflects differences in the support rate between commodities and thus between farm types. In EU member states, inequality is particularly high for second pillar payments, whose main purpose is to address agrienvironmental issues (Figure 3.14). Inequality in the distribution of first pillar payments decreases slightly with the implementation of the single payments scheme in most EU member states included in the analysis (Annex Table C9). It also decreases in the EU10 and is stable in the EU15. In the EU27, it decreases between 2004 and 2006 but then increases with Bulgaria and Romania's accession. In Germany, the decrease is gradual as the country chose to distribute an increasing part of the payment as a flat rate payment per hectare (dynamic hybrid model). Overall, support seems to have a slight redistributive effect as the Gini coefficient for gross receipts (gross agricultural output plus total payments) is marginally lower than that for gross agricultural output (by 0.01 in the EU27, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States, up to 0.04 in England) (Annex Table C9).

These findings are in line with conclusions from previous work. While previous OECD reports (OECD, 1999(OECD, , 2003 focussed on the distribution of support and income by farm size, the current analysis explores more systematically differences in the distribution of support and income by farm type and type of region.

Identifying unintended beneficiaries requires well-defined objectives with clear and measurable targets, as well as relevant information to assess the situation, identify targets and measure the impact of the policy. The distribution of support needs to be looked at in relation to the objectives of policies. Information on the distribution of support and income is useful to monitor the extent to which income support benefits those with income problems, as well as the extent to which differences in support affect farm competitiveness and farmers' welfare. However, information on the income situation of farmers is often partial and difficult to access.
