[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "and the IMAGEN consortium (www.imagen-europe.com) Impulsiveness is a pivotal personality trait representing a core domain in all major personality inventories. Recently, impulsiveness has been identified as an important modulator of cognitive processing, particularly in tasks that require the processing of large amounts of information. Although brain imaging studies have implicated the prefrontal cortex to be a common underlying representation of impulsiveness and related cognitive functioning, to date a fine-grain and detailed morphometric analysis has not been carried out. On the basis of ahigh-resolution magnetic resonance scans acquired in 1620 healthy adolescents (IMAGEN), the individual cortical thickness (CT) was estimated. Correlations between Cloninger's impulsiveness and CT were studied in an entire cortex analysis. The cluster identified was tested for associations with performance in perceptual reasoning tasks of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC IV). We observed a significant inverse correlation between trait impulsiveness and CT of the left superior frontal cortex (SFC; Monte Carlo Simulation Po0.01). CT within this cluster correlated with perceptual reasoning scores (Bonferroni corrected) of the WISC IV. On the basis of a large sample of adolescents, we identified an extended area in the SFC as a correlate of impulsiveness, which appears to be in line with the trait character of this prominent personality facet. The association of SFC thickness with perceptual reasoning argues for a common neurobiological basis of personality and specific cognitive domains comprising attention, spatial reasoning and response selection. The results may facilitate the understanding of the role of impulsiveness in several psychiatric disorders associated with prefrontal dysfunctions and cognitive deficits."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Trait impulsiveness plays a critical role in everyday life and has been associated with prominent behavioral styles such as binge drinking and alcohol consumption, 1,2 driving violations 3 and delinquency. 4 Furthermore, impulsiveness has been found to be a pivotal risk factor for mental health problems such as substance addiction 5 and eating disorders. 6 A number of psychiatric disorders like affective disorders, 7 borderline personality disorder 8 and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD 9, 10 ) are characterized by impulsive symptoms.\nImpulsiveness is a multidimensional construct understood to originate from an underlying common trait. 11, 12 Personalityrelated aspects of impulsiveness have been shown to predict individual behavior 13, 14 as well as psychopathological syndromes. 8, 9 Furthermore, some measures of impulsiveness provide empirical evidence for heritability, 15 such as the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, 16 and associations with genetic variants of certain neurotransmitter systems. 17 Cloninger's revised temperament and character inventory (TCI-R) provides an integrative approach to investigate the neurobiological substrates of different domains of personality. This psychobiological model has been derived from empirical findings in the field of genetics, personality and neurobiology. 18 Cloninger's scale, which has been specifically modified for the needs of brain imaging, has been validated by extensive data from genetics, neurobiology, longitudinal studies of development and clinical assessment.\nextensive body of multidisciplinary research. 20--24 Notably, associations with certain aspects of fluid intelligence 25 as well as perceptual--motor performance 26 have been described. In accordance with this, several animal studies have suggested that higher impulsiveness is associated with poorer performance in cognitive tasks that require waiting or processing of large amounts of information. 27, 28 In line with these findings, human data in 8--11 year olds indicate that reflective children scored significantly higher than impulsive ones on the attention--concentration subtests and the visual organization subtests of the Wechsler Scale of Intelligence for Children. 29 The findings outlined above suggest that impulsiveness has an impact particularly on perceptual reasoning. Structural brain imaging studies on impulsiveness in healthy samples are rare and their findings heterogeneous, most likely due to small sample sizes. However, oftentimes heterogeneous clinical samples might cause extra variance due to, for example, additional symptoms, medication and coping mechanisms specific to the respective disorder, which is likely to bias any findings. Those non-clinical studies reported impulsiveness to be associated with frontal, 30--37 and posterior cingulate structures, 31, 37 as well as regions of the claustrum and the cerebellum. 37 Furthermore, there is little consistency in the direction of the correlations found. While reported associations with impulsiveness reported had a negative slope in most cases, some studies also found positive ones, for example, with temporal structures (Schilling et al. 35, 36 , also see Gardini et al. 31 and Van Schuerbeek et al. 37 ). In addition, previous structural imaging studies on impulsiveness in non-clinical samples differ significantly in their methodological approaches, which limit comparability and generalization of the findings. These MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)-based studies are different in sample characteristics, operationalization of the construct of impulsiveness and statistical analyses. Moreover, half of the studies focused exclusively on either females 37 or males. 30, 32, 34 The sample size ranged from 14 32 to 115 participants. 35 Half of the scales of impulsiveness applied refer to behavioral measures 30, 34 or a broader domain of personality such as novelty seeking 31, 37 instead of more precisely defined trait impulsiveness. Except for one study investigating cortical thickness (CT; Schilling et al."}, {"section_title": "36", "text": "), all structural findings were based on volumetric data.\nThis report aimed to explore the structural substrates of trait impulsiveness in a large, representative sample of healthy adolescent females and males. Rather than comprehensive dimensions of personality such as novelty seeking, the more precisely defined personality facet impulsiveness (TCI-R) was chosen. Moreover, we opted to use surface-based morphology analyses provided within the FreeSurfer software (Charlestown, MA, USA). This fully automated tool has successfully been applied to a wide range of empirical research. 38--42 CT has been suggested to be a more sensitive parameter, with a higher signal-to-noise ratio compared with voxel-based morphometry. 43--46 Running entire cortex analyses on trait impulsiveness appeared to be most reasonable, as in healthy samples MRI findings are heterogeneous and findings on CT are very rare. In addition, we intended to investigate common structural correlates of both trait impulsiveness and associated perceptual reasoning. To control for confounding effects caused by verbal or numerical testing material, 47 the non-verbal core tasks only of the abbreviated Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC IV) were chosen. These tasks have been conceptualized to assess abstract reasoning and executive dysfunctions. 48 "}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants", "text": "The data with regard to 1620 adolescents (M, 14.43 years; s.d., 0.39 years; 866 females) volunteering in the IMAGEN project, a European multi-center genetic-neuroimaging study in adolescence, 49 were included in this study. The specific target age of 14 years of the IMAGEN participants had been chosen to allow for the initial assessment and a subsequent follow-up to occur in the mid-to-late adolescence, when the pattern of substance use is most dynamic. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants as well as from their legal guardians. The students were recruited through secondary schools at eight sites located in England (2 sites), France (1 site), Ireland (1 site) and Germany (4 sites). The assessment was approved by all local ethics committees. All interested students were screened for magnetic resonance contraindications. Furthermore, any participant with a medical condition such as a tumor, neurological disorders like epilepsy or mental health problems like affective disorders was excluded. All participating students were assessed by means of both a self-rating and two external ratings (parents; child and adolescent psychiatrists) as part of a scale tailored to adolescents and based on ICD-10 as well as DSM-IV (The Development and Well-Being Assessment Interview Performance measures. Perceptual reasoning was assessed by means of two subscale scores according to the non-verbal core tests included in the abbreviated WISC IV: 53 Block Design (BD) and Matrix Reasoning (MT). Both tasks require attention, spatial reasoning and response selection. BD involves putting together red-and-white blocks in a pattern so as to match to a displayed model. Speed is stressed, and some of the more difficult puzzles award bonuses for speed. MT asks participants to pick out of five images one fitting a shown array of pictures with one missing square.

Both correlations survived a Bonferroni correction at Po0.025."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this report, we explored the structural correlates of impulsiveness studying CT in healthy adolescents. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study on a large representative sample of adolescent females and males, without mental health problems, significant nicotine, alcohol or illegal substance use. A common morphological correlate of trait impulsiveness and perceptual reasoning was shown. The data suggest a prominent role of the SFC whose CT was associated negatively with trait impulsiveness and positively with cognitive functioning, within impulsivenessrelated neurobiological substrates.\nCompared to voxel-based morphometry, CT has been suggested to be a more sensitive parameter with a higher signal-tonoise ratio. 43, 45, 46 While voxel-based morphometry has been shown to be sensitive to a combination of changes in gray matter (GM) thickness, intensity, cortical surface area as well as cortical folding, 45, 59 surface-based morphology analysis allows the assessment of contributions of GM thinning independently of regional surface area. 55, 56 Voxel-based morphometry is especially susceptible to the degree of smoothing, differences in registration and choice of normalization template. 60, 61 Moreover, analyses on CT have been found to be particularly suitable for multicenter data. On the basis of evaluations of the reliability of CT across MRI scan sessions, scanners and field strength, Dickerson and co-workers 44 suggested that automated measures of CT are highly reliable across manufacturers. 44 In our study, the MRI data of nine different scanners by three different manufacturers (General Electric, Philips, Siemens) have been considered. The descriptive data with regard to CT of both the cluster identified in our whole cortex analysis and the respective standardized superior frontal regions (Table 1) showed comparable values across scanners. This is in line with the similar contrast to noise ratio within scanner systems and across manufacturers. The accurate segmentation of the brain into GM, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid FreeSurfer depends on a high contrast to Impulsiveness and perceptual reasoning in adolescents C Schilling et al noise ratio of the T1 image. In addition, our analyses were controlled for the variable scanner to reduce any potential nuisance effects. Previous structural findings on trait impulsiveness and SFC in healthy samples have neither been consistent nor comparable. Gardini and co-workers 31 described a positive correlation between novelty seeking and GM volume of the right SFC in healthy adults. Besides impulsiveness, novelty seeking comprises three more subscales (exploratory excitability, extravagance and disorderliness; Cloninger et al. 18 ). Thus, the association reported 31 could have been driven by any of the four subscales. Similar to this finding, we have previously found a negative correlation between the Barratt impulsiveness scale (total score, motor score, attention score) and CT of the left SFC (Po0.001 uncorrected) in healthy adults. 36 Clinical studies in samples characterized by impulsiveness emphasize the role of reduced CT in the SFC for impulsive behavior. In contrast to healthy participants, reduced CT in the bilateral SFC has been reported for children diagnosed with ADHD 62 and adolescents using marijuana. 63 Furthermore, CT of the right SFC has been found to be reduced compared with controls in children, adolescents and adults with ADHD, 64 as well as in amphetamine-dependent adults with a history of co-morbid heavy alcohol use. 65 The latter finding may reflect toxic effects of long-term substance use. In addition, Almeida and co-workers 64 have described a correlation between the severity of illness and CT within the right SFC. Thus, clinical findings on structural correlates of impulsiveness have to be interpreted with caution, as nuisance effects of disorder variables specific for the respective disorder cannot be ruled out.\nIt is important to emphasize that cross-sectional data describe correlative relations, but do not allow for any causal interpretations. Hence, structural findings could reflect a biological predetermination and/or experience-driven plasticity (for example, juggling; Draganski et al. 66 ). Interestingly, there is some evidence in functional MRI data suggesting a negative association between trait impulsiveness and the SFC. Horn and co-workers 67 have described an inverse correlation between trait impulsiveness (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale: total score) and activation in the SFC during motor inhibition (Go/No-Go task) in healthy adults. Our data suggest that individual correction of functional imaging results for local structural differences may be necessary (for example, ref 68 ). Previous literature presented several arguments that motor inhibition is closely associated with the right inferior frontal cortex. For instance, human lesion-mapping studies support the functional localization of motor inhibition to the right inferior frontal cortex. 69, 70 This idea is further supported by studies targeting this area with transcranial magnetic stimulation 71 showing an interference with motor inhibition. Consistently, fMRI studies have put forward the activation of the right inferior frontal cortex as a correlate of motor inhibition in different paradigms. 72--75 However, this analysis did not reveal an association between the right inferior frontal cortex and trait impulsiveness. Previous studies usually assessed motor inhibition by means of an experimental design involving external instructions, which prompt participants to suppress a particular motor response. Those experimental conditions differ from everyday life where individuals are not reminded externally to withstand their impulsiveness. Furthermore, the role of the IFG function in motor inhibition may be less associated to the IFG structure, which may explain the lacking correlation between impulsiveness and IFG CT in these data set. Even though, trait impulsiveness is thought to cover motor impulsiveness as one aspect of a more comprehensive, personality-related construct, 76 the functional and structural neural correlates of motor inhibition and trait impulsiveness might differ in general.\nIncreased impulsiveness has been found to be associated with decreased cognitive functioning, namely in attention, efficiency of information processing and reasoning. For instance, children with an impulsiveness-related disorder (ADHD) showed a poorer performance on BD compared with healthy children independent from high intelligence quotients in both groups. 77 Furthermore, highly impulsive individuals, compared with individuals with low impulsiveness, show slower reaction times, more errors 78, 79 and deficits in working memory. 80 Moreover, psychophysiological data have indicated that highly impulsive individuals have difficulties inhibiting irrelevant information in intelligence testing. 81 However, to date, little is known about overlapping brain structures correlated with both impulsiveness and specific cognitive abilities.\nThere are some structural imaging data in healthy adults supporting a positive association between prefrontal cortex and working memory. Yet, previous studies differ significantly from this study in the methods used. Findings based on GM volume have indicated correlations both with the right SFC 82 and with the left middle frontal cortex, as well as the right inferior frontal cortex. 35 The only study based on CT has found an association with the right SFC. 83 In addition, Hartberg and co-workers 84 have reported CT of the right SFC to be positively correlated with executive functioning in healthy adults. Moreover, based on structural data of healthy children and adolescents, Klingberg 85 has suggested a visuo-spatial working memory network, consisting of cortical areas as well as white matter tracts connecting them, located in the intraparietal cortex and SFC.\nFunctional imaging data support the idea of the SFC being central for solving tasks requiring working memory, in particular spatial reasoning and attention, just as both BD and MT do. 53, 86 Meta-analyses on positron emission tomography and fMRI studies attribute a significant role to the SFC when working memory must be continuously updated. 87 More recently, fMRI data in healthy children and adults 88--90 suggest the SFC to be particularly involved in spatial working memory. In addition, Fan and coworkers 88 have pointed out an association between left SFC and executive attention. Clinical fMRI findings in ADHD patients have further demonstrated associations between hypo-activation in SFC in a No-Go condition and higher scores in inattention as well as higher scores in impulsiveness. 91 In summary, the positive correlations between the SFC and the WISC subscales, discussed above, might suggest that frontal structures are associated both with trait impulsiveness and specific aspects of the participants' behavior related to impulsiveness. 48 Prospectively this might be clinically relevant, because personality traits and intelligence in children have been found to explain future drinking and smoking behavior. 92 Some methodological limitations of this study should be noted. Although there is a more recent junior TCI scale for children and adolescents, 93 the TCI-R 51 was used, because it has been modified in the context of neuroimaging research and repeatedly applied in this field. 19 Furthermore, participants were not screened with the standard instrument, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV non-patient version. Instead, based on both a self-rating and external ratings (parents; psychiatrists specialized in pediatrics), as part of a scale especially developed for children and adolescents (The Development and Well-Being Assessment Interview 50 ), adolescent volunteers with psychiatric disorders according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV were excluded. Concerning drug use, we used the well-established self-rating scale ESPAD (www.espad.org), as it provides information on lifetime alcohol use. The lack of more objective measures on short-term consumption such as urine drug screenings is a potential limitation of this study. However, effects of social desirability were controlled for by an anonymized computerized procedure of collecting this type of very sensitive data when the participant was at home. In addition, effects of substance use were examined in analyses in a subsample reporting some use. Those analyses suggest there might be only a small, but nonsignificant effect of substance use.\nIn summary, our findings indicate an inverse association between trait impulsiveness and CT of the SFC. For the first time, a set of automated tools for the reconstruction of brain cortical surface has been applied to identify morphological correlates of the personality facet impulsiveness in a large representative, healthy, adolescent sample. Impulsiveness-related domains of personality are a risk factor or future substance abuse. 94 Our findings help to identify underlying neurobiological substrates and emphasize the relevance of considering aspects of cognitive functioning associated with impulsiveness, which may be modulated by specific training interventions.
