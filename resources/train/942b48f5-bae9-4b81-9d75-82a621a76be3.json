[{"section_title": "", "text": "The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) is the third in a series of longitudinal studies sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistia. This report profiles the mathematics and science instruction received by eighth graders (11,414 surveyed in mathematics and 10,686 in science) in public and private schools in 1988 and proposes to trace the participants into the 10th and 12th grades. A preface lists highlighted findings, tables, and figures included in the document. The body of the report consists of five chapters. Chapter I discusses the purpose and format of the report and limitations of the study. Chapters II and III examine the relationship of various aspects of mathematics and science instruction to students' socioeconomic status and race-ethnicity and type of school attended. Among the aspects examined were the major topics taught, average class size, hours per week attended, allocation of class time, assigned homework, availability of instructional materials, student attitudes toward mathematics and science, and teacher characteristics and qualifications. Chapter IV examines mathematics and science achievement test scores in relation to the various components of instruction measured in the study. Chapter V provides a descriptive profile of the mathematics curriculum, the science curriculum, teacher characteristics and qualifications, classroom characteristics, school type differences, and students' opportunity to learn based on the findings. Appendices that describe the Stucktnts enrolled in remedial mathematics classes were twice as likely as students in algebra or advanced classes to be assigned less than 1 hour of homework a week (10 percent versus 4 percent). Studer:: Attitudes More than one-half of eighth grackrs looked fcawani to their classes in mathematics (57 percent) and science (62 percent). While nearly 90 percent of eighth graders thought that mathematics was important to their future, only 70 percent felt that way about science. However, some subgroup attitude differences wen seen. About 21 percent of eighth graders were afraid to ask questions in mathematics class, while 14 percent were afraid to do so in sciewe class. While low-SES students tended to look forward to mathematics more than high-SES students, they were more afraid to ask questions. Teacher Qualifications . While almost all (97 percent) of public school eighth graders' mathematics teachers felt well to very well prepared to teach mathematics, only 70 percent of them had majored or minored in mathematics (or math education) in college. Eighteen percent had majored in education only, and 12 percent had majored in another subject. Eighty-four percent of public school students had science teachers who felt well to very well prepared to teach science. Seventy-two percent of public school eighth graders had science teachers who had majored or minored in science in college. Fifteen percent had teachers who had majored in education only, and 13 percent had majored in arother subject. Nearly 70 percent of students had mathematics or science teachers with 10 or more years of teaching experience; less than 15 percent had mathematics or science teachers with 3 or fewer years of experience."}, {"section_title": "Public and Private School Differences", "text": "In this report, differences between public schools and three types of private schools (Catholic; private other religious; and private, nonreligious) were examined. A greater percentage of private, nonreligious school students (58 percent) reported attending algebra or advanced mathematics classes than public school students (29 percent). A greater percentage of Catholic school students reported attending remedial mathematics classes than students in all other school types. Private nonreligious and private other religious school students tended to participate in smaller mathematics and science classes (as reported by their teachers) than public and Catholic school students.   Accmding to recent repcms examining international achievement in mathematics and scieme, American students lag far behind their counterparts from cxher eountries.2 In a recent assessment of educational progress, 13-year-olds from the United States, Carlota, Iceland, Korea, the United Kingdom, and Spain were assessed in math and science proficiency. Students in the United States placed in the lowest scoring group in mathematics and in um second-to-lowest group in scklx:e.2 Researchers attribute low performance to various causes, including: 1) a low emphasis on mathematics relative to reading; 2) the grouping of students by ability (tracking) in U.S. schools; 3) a repetitive mathematics currkulum; 4) unequal opportunities for students to learn mathematics; and 5) teacher beliefs and attitudes about learning mathematics.3 Although individual factors such as stmlent aptitude and socioeconomic status are still believed to account for a large proportion of the variation in explaining achievement, it is possible that instructional variables are more immtant than previously recognized.4 Recently, the condition of middle and junior hip school education has become a topic of great interest to the gemral public. Because mrddle school students are preparing for high school and determining which educational programs will be most useful to their future, they are at a pivotal point in their lives. This is an especially critical time for eighth graders because they must choose what type of mathematics curriculum they will pursue in high school. If students are disinterested in school cx-are low WI:levers, they ate generally assigned to remedial or basic level classes. As a result, these students are unlikely to be prepared for advanced high school mathematics or science at an early age, and may be tracked as individuals who will be ill-prepared to enter a technology-caiented work force.5 A major problem facing educators in the scientific community today is that quality mathematics and science instniction is often less accessible to low-income and minority students. In addition, a disturbing nationwide pattern is emerging: teachers who are less experienced and less well prepared to teach in their field are instructing children from the lowest academic and socioeconomic backgrounds. In short, higher ability children and those from advantaged backgrounds are more likely than children of low ability and those from disadvantaged backgrounds to have well-trained, experienced teachers.6 1Lapointe, A..

In particular, both the quality of teaching and of the teachers themselves are ccesidered to be important process indicators of current classroom instruction. Stch process measures, whwh &scribe insnuctional practice and the degree to which quality education is available to all snxients, can help researchers investigate whether children fron disadvantaged families have the same cm:enmities to learn important mathematical and scientific skills (such as higher-order thinking and problem-solving skills) as more advantaged children. These process measures may also help educators understand discrepancies in student performance:7 Some researchers argue that past studies on classroom processes have primlilitlz focused on the \"intended curriculum,\" such as the kinds of textbooks that have been Consequently, they sugkrest that the \"implemented curriculum\"8which refers to how teachers present the cumculum, teachers' beliefs and interests, and the context in which instruction occurshas been ignored. Both teacher and classroom variables are increasingly being recognized as equally important determinants of student achievement as background factors such as socioeconomic status. For example, in a recent metaanalysis of variables related to learning, it was found that the quality and quantity of instmtion were roughly equal to student characteristics and out-of-school contextual variables in explaining student achievement levels.9 In particular, \"time-on-task\" (ccetent coverage or opportunity to learn) was found to be the most frequently cited variable in the instructional arena. Similarly, zsearchers argue that variables in the implemented curriculum are major factors in exPlaining the relatively poor educational achievement of students in the United States as compared with that of their counterparts in other countries.u) Thus, as the literature suggests, monitoring changes in student exposure to quality cunicula seems to be of critical importance from a policy perspective in determining whether or not our international achievement standing is likely to improve in the future. Experts do not always agree on defmitions of teaching quality, but some basic indicators can be useful. In a recent sourcebook on educational indicators, the authors maintain that teacher quality (the knowledge and skills of a teacher) is an important predictor of teaching quality (such as topic coverage or time allocation).11 Moreover, this review of the research showed that academic knowledge and preparation in a subject area are related to student learning, particularly in mathematics and science. Other research suggests that although various teackr preparation and qualification measures have been examined for their relatkaiship to stolent learning, Earl studigt have had equivocal results.12 There is some suppro for the idea that a teacher with better subject-matter knowledge is, in fact, a better teacher.13 In sklitkm, knowledge of teaching methods in a particular subject area is also cooidered to be an important measure of teacher quality. For example, in one study, the number of credits a teacher had earned in mathematics methods courses was found to be the most strongly related \"teacher reparation variable\" to student perky/mm.14 Also of interest is the match between teacher assignment and preparation and certification field, since it is considered undesirable to teach outside of one's specific instructional area. However, one problem with using certification as a teacher quality indicator is the fact that states vary in their requirements fcr cenificatioi. In addition, almost all public school teachers are fully certified, and little association has been demonstrated between certification status and student achievement. Using the NELS:88 survey data, a numba of impotant teacher and classroon-level characteristics can be used as indicators to examim tin instructional conditicsi of American eighth-grade mathematics and science edixation. For example, the curriculum-level measures included for mathematics instruction in this analysis are the class level (track) reported by students and the intensity of exposure to algelna and other madmatics topics reported by teachers.

Overall, about 91 percent of the eighth gratin had either their mathematics or science teacher surveyeti Approximately one-half of tiw students had their mathematics teacher surveyed (11,414), while the other half had their science teacher surveyed (10,868). The type of teachers (mathematics cr science) was selected on a random basis, so that students in each of these samples should be rewesentadve of the total sample. In addition, the NELS:88 data used Imre are fron the base year survey of an ongoing longitudinal study, and, thus, are only cmss-sectkmal. Cross-tabulations were used to look at differences, ami no causal inferences were drawn about the influence of instructional characteristics on achievement. The relationships presented are bivariate association umuljusted statistically for covariates. Thus, many of these associations may be relawd to a third variable.

Comparismis are made for those cmnponents of mathematics and scknce instruction that show the greatest overall variation, as well as for those that represem a broad spectrum of teacher and classroom experiences. By investigating how mathematics and science insmictimi differs for students of various backgrounds, one can determine whetlwr or not access to certain types of mathematics and scieme programs varies for studaits with different characteristics. In this chapter, the relatimiship of students' socioecimmnic status and me-ethnicity to various aspects of mathematics and science insmiction was examined. In addition, this chapter investigates community attributes that might be associated with mathematics and science instruction. Schools are characterized by geographic region (Northeast, North Central, South, and West), community type (urban, suburban, or rural), and socioeconomic status. School socioeconomic status (SES) is approximated by looking at the percentage of students in the schools who received free lunches. The greater the percentage of students receiving free lunches, the poorer the sclvol's population is presumed to be. Finally, by examining several questions that school administrators were asked in the NELS:88 Base Year survey regarding the school climate, scb3ol environment is identified. These questions were grouped into three areas, and composite scales were created that represented 1) student problems, 2) teacher engagement, and 3) academic \"press.\" The student problems scale represents the degree to which administrators thought issues such as student absenteeism, alcohol and drug use, student weapon use, physical ix verbal abuse of students toward teachers, and student theft were problems. The teacher engagement composite scale measures teacher morale and attitudes toward stionits. For example, administratcws were asked whether there were =filets between teachers and administrators in their schools, whether teachers had a negative anituck toward the studaits or had difficulty mmivating them, and whether teacher morale was high. Finally, academic press indicates-the intensity or competitiveness of the students toward their school work. This composite is a scale that included such questions as wixther students placed a high pricaity an learning, whether teachers encouraged students to do their best, whether students were expected to do homework, and whetha they faced competition for grades. is"}, {"section_title": "Mathematics and Science Curricula", "text": "This section profiles the types of mathematics and science classes eighth graders attended, dm major topics that were taught, the average size of these classes, the number of hours they met per week, how class time was allocated, the homework that was assigned, 181t should be remembered that these are school-level, not stucknt-level indkators. Thus, they are general awibutes of the entire school and not just of math and science instruction. See appendix A for a more detailed &scission.\nClass Types and Topic Coverage Students who attended private, nonreligious schools were more likely than public or Catholic school students to repert attending an algebra or advanced mathematics class (58 percent compared with 29 percent and 26 percent, respectively) (table 3.1). Catholic school students were more likely than students in other types of schools to report attending a remedial class, while public school students were more likely than private, nonreligious school sturknts to repart attending remedial classes. 28Throughout this chapter differences among the various schools may appear quite large. However, due 03 the small samples of private nonreligious and private other religious school students, these differences are often not statistically significant (see appendix B for standard weirs of the estimates presented). In relation to topic coverage, public school students appeared to have less exposure to algebra than Catholic school students (figure 3.1). About 60 percent of public school students had teachers who reported that algebra was covered as a major topic in mathematics class, compared with 78 percent of Catholic school stmlents. At dm same time, a greater pmpomon of public school students than Catholic school students were in classes when fractions and decimals were taught (68 percent of public school students, compared with 32 percent of Catholic school stucknts). It is interesting to note that public and private schools differed with respect to the three most prevalent mathematics subjects covered as major topics. The subjects most frequently covered as major opics in public schools were ratios/percents, problem solving, and fractions. In private schools, however, the three most prevalent sulljects covered as major topics were algebra, problem solving, and integers, which may indicate that private school students are exposed to more advanced mathematics subjects before entering high school than are public school students. Differences in science topics covered were less obvious than those topics covered in mathematics. As shown in figure 3.2, earth science seemed to be the most prevalent subject taught, regardless of type of school, followed by weather and astronomy topics.   Unlike science topic coverage, some diffmenca were found in the levels of exposure to science experiments among students in different types d schools (figum 3.3a). A.mong students in private, nonreligious schools, only about one percent had teachers who reported cow:hitting few science experiments (less than one per month), compared with 42 percent in private, other religious schools and about coze-fifth in either public or Catholic schools. Private, other religious school students were less likely than students in any other school type to conduct frequent science experiments (weekly or daily). Only 9 percent of private, miler religious school students had teachers who reported conducting weekly experiments compared with 66 percent, 55 percent, and 47 percent, respectively, of private nonreligious, Catholic, and public school students whose teachers reported the same. However, scarcity of scientific equipment did not explain how infrequently private, other religious school students conducted experiments, since only about one-third of these students were in classes where little to no equipment was available, and more than one-half were in classes where equipment was available for every one to two students (figure 3.3b).

The Natimal Survey of Practices and Trends conducted by the Johns Hopkins University Center fir Research on Elementary and Middle Schools found that about three-quarters of eighth graders were grouped by ability level in some or all of their subjects. Mathematics was cimd as being tracked most often (88 percent), while science was among the subjects least often grouped by ability (only 16 percent of all eighth graders).19 NELS:88 students reported participating in different levels of classes that were divided into four curricular areas: 1) participation in algebra or advanced classes (\"algebniladvanced\"); 2) participatice in general mathematics and algebra (\"enriched\"); 3) participation in only general mathematics (\"general\"); and 4) participation in remedial mathematics (\"remedial\").20 Table 2.1 illustrates how students were distributed in the four curricula by socioeconomic status, raceethnicity, and mathematics achievement test quartile. A substantial impaction (over 10 percent) of low-SES (bottom quartile), racial minority (Hispanics, blacks, and American Indians), and low-ability (bottom quartile cognitive test) eighth graders were participating in remedial programs. In particular, blacks and Hispanics were almost twice as likely as white students to be in a remedial course. Low-SES students were almost three times as likely as high-SES students to be in a remedial course. Science. It is widely reported that teachers spend most of their instructional time in science helping students learn and memorize facts rather than teaching them to think scientifically. For example, in the National Survey of Practices and Trends, in the middle grades most principals indicated that their typical science teachers taught basic facts every day, but only about one-third reported that discussions of scientific methods are a regular part of lessons.21 19.1. H. Braddock, \"Tracking the Middle Gmcks: National Patterns of Gmuping for Instruction,\" Phi Delta Kappan, Febniary 1990,445-449. 2ellese curricular areas were determined by students' responses to questions about their participation in specific types of math classes. The categories presented are mutually exclusive and they are modeled on those presented in the repcet by McKnight et al., The Underachieving Curricithan (1987). Students were asked two separate questions about their math class= one question asked whetha they were participating in an advanced or accelerated program and the oil= asked what type of class they attended weekly: (1) algebra/advanced, (2) regular, ca. (3) remedial. Those students who answered they were attending a weekly algebraladvimced class were Ina in the \"algebra/advanced\" category. Those who answered they attended a weekly regular class and were in an accelerated pmgram were put in the \"enriched\" category; those who attended a weekly regular class awl were not in an accelerated program were put in the \"genentl\" category, and those who indicated they attended any remedial class were put into the \"remedial\" category. There is evidence that Nokias overreport participation in algebra or ober advanced classes (see NCES report, Kaufman et al., The Quality of Responses in NELS:88 Survey, September 1991). In addition, classification into these four groups differs from the classification used in Prvfile of the American Eighth Grader, NCES, 1990 which does not include the \"eruiched\" category. 2111.1. Becker, \"Curriculum and Instruction in Middle Grade Schools,\" Phi Delta Kappan, Februaly 1990, 450-57. In the NELS:88 survey, almost all public school eighth graders (96 percent) repcned attending science class, and among them, about 22 parent reported being in science classes with a separate laboratory. One way of determining how much hands-on work science teachers were giving to their students was to determine how often science experiments were demonstrated ca. conducted in class and the amount and condition of laboratory equipment available to students. Table 2.2 illustrates the varying exposure of eighth graders to scientific experimentation and equipmeni Overall, a sizable pmportion of students had little or no exposure to science experiments. For example, about 40 percent of public school students had little exposure (no more than once a month) to scientific experimentation. Almost one-half of students participated in classes where the teacher indicated that science experiments were condixted about once a week (47 percent of public school stucknts). About 18 parent of the students had teachers who reported that little to no equipment was available, while 47 percent of the students were in classes where equipment was available only fir groups of three or more. The equipment that was available to students was reported to be in relatively good condition: 58 percent of students had access to equipment in good to excellent condition as reported by their teachers. About 31 percent of students attended classes where teachers reported the equipment to be in fair condition, and the remaining 11 percent attended classes in which teachers reported the equipment to be in poor condition. Group differences were apparent in levels of participation in science experiments (table 2.3). For example, 41 percent of low-SES students were in science classes where experiments were conducted once a week and 9 percent were in classes conducting daily experiments, compared with 54 percent and 19 percent of high-SES students who conducted science experiments at the same frequencies. Among racial-ethnic groups, Asian students were more likely than Hispanic students to be in science classes that conducted science experiments about once a day.22 Students in schools with large free lunch programs-more than 50 percent receiving free luncheswere more likely to be in science classes where experiments were conducted less than once a month (about 34 percent) than were students who were in schools where less than 20 percent received free lunches (14 percent or fewer conducted experiments less than once a month)."}, {"section_title": "Topic Coverage in Eighth-Grude Mathematics", "text": "In the Second International Mathematics Study, conducted in 1981-82, researchers determined that the United States had a more diffuse and \"arithmetic-driven\" mathematics curriculum than other countries, allocating relatively equal amounts of time to various mathematics topics.23 Japan, on the other hand, had a more intensive curriculum focused on algetaa in the niddle school years and cakulus in the secondary school years. Similar to these results, findings from the NELS:88 survey -4 that the mathematics curricuhnn in middle schools ccarsisted primarily of relatively survey-type courses, especially for lower-achieving stucknts. Students who showed an aptitude for mathematics were often given instruction in pre-algebra, algebra, or otlxir more mivanced subjects in the eighth grade, while those who had not performed as well were more likely to have attended classes where arithmetic and computations ekaninated instniction. In the NELS:88 survey, mathematics teachers were asked to identify which areas of mathematics were covered as major topics in their respective classes.24 These topics included ratios and percents, problem solving, integers, fractions (common and ekcimal), algebra, geometry, measurement, and probability and statistics (table 2.4). More than two-thirds of public school eighth graders were in classes where fractions, ratios and percents, problem solving, and integers were taught as major topics. These classes were followed by algebri (60 percent), geometry (51 percent), measurement (37 percent), and probability and statistics (20 percent). Figure 2.1 illustrates the difference in the intensity of the topics covered in the four curricular areas. Th6 figure suggests a substantial differentiation of opportunity to learn mathematics within the curriculum. According to teachers, algebra, problem solving, and topics related to integers dominated the advanced curriculum and exposure to other subjects was relatively low. In contrast, 23( .

Use of these two topics, representing extremes in the mathematics curriculum, clearly demonstrates how students of varied backgrounds and communities differed in their exposure to such topics. Mme than any other aspect of mathematics and science instruction, socioeconomic status was strongly associated with the types of mathematics topics covered in class. Only 49 percent of low-SES students were in mathematics classes where algebra was taught as a major topic, compared with 75 percent of high-SES stidents (table 2.5). Exactly the opposite pattern was seen for students in classes where the matior topic was fractions: 79 percent of low-SES students were in such classes, compared with 52 percent of high-SES students. Racialethnic group differences were also found in the NELS:88 survey. For example, Asian and white students were far =re likely to be in mathenvitics classes where algebra was a major topic than were black students (67 percent of Asian students and 62 percent of white students, compared with 49 percent of black students). Not surprisingly, Asian and white students were also far less likely than black or Hispanic students to be in classes where fractions were covered as a major topic (apiroximately 80 percent of black and Hispanic students, compared with 55 percent of Asian students and 64 percent of white students). Community and school attributes were also associated with the types of topics covered in mathematics classes (table 2.6). Nearly 70 percent of students in the Northeast were in matImmatics classes where algebra was a major topic, compared with a little Imre than one-half of the stucknts in the South awl in the West The , ,;te pattern was seen for the teaching of fractions: 59 percent of the students in Northeast were in mathematics classes with fractions taug,ht as a major topic, compared with more than 70 percent of the students in the South and m the West.

For example, 65 percent of suburban students were in mathematics classes where algebra was taught as a major topic, compared with 55 percent or urban stixlents and 56 percent of rural students. There was some indication that students in schools with large free latch programs (more than 50 percent receiving free lunches) studied algetwa as a major topic less than those in schools with 5 percent or fewer students receiving free lunches.

An initially surprising result found in this study was that low-SES students were more likely than high-SES students to be in the smallest mathematics classes (classes with 15 or fewer students): about 14 percent of low-SES students were in madwmatics classes of this size, compared with 9 percent of high-SES students (table 2.8a). While the difference was modest, it is statistically significant The overrepresentation of low-SES students in the smallest mathematics classes may reflect a tendency on the part of mathematics teachers to place lower-achieving students in small groups for remedial instruction.25 The same pattern held for the size of science classes (table 2.8b). 23See L Anckrson and L.

These included I) highest degree earned, 2) subject of their baccalaureate degree, 3) number of years' teaching, and 4) teachers' self-assessment of how well prepared they were to teach their imlividual classes. Virtually all of the eighth graders had mathematics and science teachers who had earned at least a baccalaureate defree. Less than one percent of public school eighth-grade students had mathematics or science teachers who had never completed a bachelm's degree, while approximately 46 percent had teachers who had earned a postgraduate degree (see figures 3.8a and 3.8b in the next chapter for breakdown by school type). To determine the extent of subject-matter preparation that mathematics and science teachers had received, the subject of their baccalaureate major (and minor) was examined rather than their area of certification. This ensured relative consistency ammig teachers. Requirements for certification do vary from state to state and, in some cases, may have changed within states as the demand fcr mathematics and science teachers has increased Thus, even teachers within the same state may have been exposed to differatt criteria for cerdficadat Teachen' subject-matter reparation was characterized as follows: 1) *timber or not they had =Owed in their teachul field; 2) if they had not majored in their teaching fkld, whether or nix they had mimed in it; 3) if they hal whim majcwed nor minceed in their teaching field, wlunbzr or not tIwy hal majcsed in edicatim or another subject Affoximately 49 percent ofeighth-grade taucktnts had science teachers who reporad majoring in science, while 43 percent of students had mathenuttics teachers who reported majoring in mathematics. About 70 potent of stuthmts had mathenuaks or science teachers who had either majored or minired tn their field (math, 70 percent; sciace, 72 percent). Eighth-grade students' backgrounds were related to the characteristics of their mathematics and science teachers (tables 2.13a and 2.13b). For example, students ci high socioeconomic status were mon likely than low-SES stalents to have mathematics teachers who had majored in mathematics (50 percent versus 39 percent). At the same time, low-SES students were mcce likely than high-SES stidents to have mathematics teachers (and w a ksser extent science teachers) who had =Owed in educatim.  Some differences among students' racial or ethnic backgrounds in relation to their mathematics teachers' subject-matter preparation were also found. For example, white students were more likely than Hispanic students to have mathematics teachers with a baccalaureate degree in mathematics. The same effect, however, was not seen for science teachers.\" There were also regional differences with respect to teacher education between students attending schools in the Northeast or North Central areas and those atttnding schools in the West. A greater proportion of students in Northeast and North Central schools had mathematics teachers with baccalaureate degrees in mathematics (53 percent and 50 percent, respectively), compared with students in the West (31 percent) (tables 2.14a and 2.14b). At the same time, students who attended schools in the West were more likely than students in northern schools to have mathematics teachers who had majored in \"other\" subjects (25 percent compared with 8 percent and 11 percent, respectively). Whether a school was located in the city, suburb, or rural area was not significantly associated with the baccalaureate majors of mathematics or science teachers. Finally, there were some differences noted for the ex.tent of the free luixh program in relation to subject-matter preparation for mathematics teachtrs. Thirty-two percent of the students who attended schools with large free lunch programs (more than 50 percent receiving a free lunch) had mathematics teachers who had majored in mathematics. 27Even though it appears that there are similar differences among students of different racial-ethnic backgrounds for science teachers' baccalaureate degrees, there was more variation among science teachers within each racial-ethnic category. Therefore, statistically significant differences were not obsezved. emptied with 50 percent d the students attending schools with smaller programs (6 percent to 20 percent receiving free lunches). Eighth-grade mathematics and science teachers in general were very experienced, with a majority of students having teachers who reported 10 or more years of experience. About 11 percent of students had relatively inexperienced mathematics tewhas (3 years cc fewer of teaching), and 12 percent had equally imxperienced science teachers. Some regional differetwes were observed for mathematics teachers. Those teachers in the South seemed to be somewhat less experienced than North Central teachers (table 2.15). Approximately 15 percent of southern students had mathematics teachers with 3 or fewer years of teaching experience compared with 5 percent of the students in the North Central region. No such statistically significant associations were found far science teachers. Almost all teachers felt that they were very well et well prepared to teach. Science teachers felt, in general, less prepared than mathematics teachers to teach tiwir respective fields. Only 84 percent of students had science teachers who felt well or very well prepared to teach their classes, compared with 97 percent of students with mathematics eackrs who shared similar attitudes (table 2.16). This chapter pesents an overview of findings as they differ for public att private school students. In the NELS:88 survey, in addition to public schools, three types of private schools were identified: Catholic schools; private, nonreligious (independent) schools; and private schools that do not classify themselves as either indepencknt or Catholic (primarily religious schools such as Lutheran, Fundamentalist Christian academies, Jewish schools, aixl so on). For ease of presentation, this report identifies the four types of schools as follows: public; Catholic; private, nonreligious; and other religious. The following sections discuss several areas of mathematics aixl science instnxtion in which differences were found among the four school types.28 The most prominent differences were found fix mathematics and science curricula characteristics such as mathematics class we (or track) and exposure to science experiments. Mathematics and science class sizes also varied according to school type. More modest differences were found for classroom experiences including class time allocation and grouping, and the amount of homework assigned by mathematics and science teachers. In addition, modest differences were found for teacher qualifications, especially the subject in which teachers had earned their bachelor's degree.\nVirtually all the eighth-grade students' mathematics and science teachers included in the NELS:88 survey had earned at least a baccalaureate degree. For instance, less than 1 percent of eighth-grade students in public schools or private, nonreligious schools had mathrmatics or science teachers who had never completed a bachelor's degree. Public school students were somewhat more likely to have mathematics teachers who had postgraduate degrees than were Catholic school students (figure 3.8a). The percentage of science teacivrs earning baccalaureate and postgraduate degrees was similar to that of mathematics teachers, although no statistically significant school type differences were discerned (figure 3.8b).   \nThe results of this study suggest that eighth graders' mathematics and science teachers ate well edtmated and experienced. A majwity ci the eighth graders' teadmrs who were surveyed had at least a baccalaureate degree and many had post-graduate degrees. However, differences were found among various groups of students in relation to their mathematics and science teacher's baccalaureate major and teaching experience. For example, low-SES aix1 mincrity students were more likely to have machers who did not major in the subject they taught. In addition, these studaits were also mme likely to have teachers who west less expenenced (1 to 3 years of teaching)."}, {"section_title": "Class Size and Time Allocation", "text": "Students in private, other religious and nonreligious schools tended to have smaller mathematics and scithee classes than did students in either Catholic or public schools (figures 3.4a and 3.4b). More than one-half of private, other religious school eighth grackrs attended mathematics classes (58 percent) and science classes (49 percent) with 15 or fewer pupils. About 40 percent of private, nonreligious school students were also in mathematics and science classes with 15 or fewer students, compared with less than 15 percent of public and Catholic school students.   It was difficult to discern significant differences among school types in relation to time allocation to small groups and individual instruction. Schools of the same type appeared to vary markedly. Part of the reason this may be true is that many schools of the same type differ in class size. This factor may strongly affect how time, especially in small groups, is allocated. That is, if a class is small to begin with, there may be very little need for small group instruction and, perhaps, more time fot individual instruction. Unfortunately, there were not enough private school students in the sample to control for class size. One way to examine patterns of time allocation is to determine how much time is spent teaching the class as a whole, rather than looking at small group and individual instruction time separately. Fix example, if a teacher spends less than 50 percent of class time teaching the entire class, the remainder is generally spent in small groups, individual instriction, or giving tests. Figures 3.6a and 3.6b illustrate the differences observed among types of schools for allocation of class time to the whole group in mathematics and science classes. FTOM these figures, it appears that a smaller propcction of Catholic school students than public school students attended mathematics or science classes that met less than 50 percent of the time as a whole group. For example, only 18 percent of Catholic school students were in mathematics classes that met less than 50 percent of the time as a whole gtoup, compared with 40 percent of public school students.

Specifically, stucknts identified as mentally handicapped, having physical or emotional problems that would seriously interfere with their ability to compkte the survey instruments, or having a language barrier interfering with their completicm of the survey instruments were excluded from the sample. About 5.4 percent of the potential sample was excluded for these reasons. Of those students who were excluded, a majority (57%) woe excluded for reason of mental disabilities, with most of the rest (35%) excluded for language reasons, and a small number excluded because of physical disabilities (8%). Again for policy analysis reasons, students of Hispanic or of Asian or Pacific Islander (A/PI) origin were oversampled. This oversampling was sponsored by the Office of Bilingual Education and Minority Language Affairs (OBEMLA). On average, 26 students were sampled per school. This two-stage process resulted in the incluskm of over 26,000 eighth graders in the sample. Teachers and school administrators also participated in NELS:88. Teachers were selected on a pre-assigned basis in two of four subject areasmathematics, science, Eng,lish, social studies (history/government). Each school was randomly assigned to one of the following combinations of curriculum areas: mathematics and English; mathematics and social studies; science and English; and science and social studies. At any school, each sampled student's current teacher(s) in each of the two designed subject areas was selected to receive a teacher questionnaire. This selectkm procedure was designed to ensure representation of mathematics or science cuniculum and English or social studies in all schools. Using this design, the number of teacher respondents was expected to vary depending on the size and structure of the eighth grack at a !Articular school. An average of five teachers per school participated. Over 5,000 teachem filled out student-specific evaluations kw a total of 23,188 sample students. While the teachers were not selected as a representative sample, their evaluations of sample students are linked to the specific student records, as are parent and school administrator reptrts. Finally, the school administrator (principal or headmaster) of each sample school was asked to complete a school administrator questionnaire. A total of 1,035 school administrators completed school questionnaires. "}, {"section_title": "Data Limitations", "text": "The target population for the base year survey consisted of all public and private schools containing eighth grP-' 4 in the 50 states and the Disnict of Columbia. Excluckd from the sampk were Bureau of Iriwan Affairs (BIA) schools, special educatioi schools for the handicapped, area vocatiimal schools that do not enroll students directly, and schools fo. dependents ci U.S. personnel overseas. In addition, students excluded frcqn the sampk included those with severe mental handicaps, students whose command of the English languar was not sufficient for understanding the survey materials, and students with physical or emotxmal problems that woild make it unduly difficult for drem to participate. Given time limitations, users of NELS:88 data should exercise caudal in interpreting findings kr certain groups. Ftw example, it is animated that approximately 10 percent of American Indian children attend schools that are affiliated with the BIA. Thus, the estimates for this subpopulatioi may not be representative. In this analysis, data from both the student and the teacher components of the survey were used. The teacher component of the NELS:88 survey, however, does not constitute a nationally representative sample of eighth grade teachers. NELS:88 teachers were not independently selected and their inclusion in the sample depended upon their linkage to a student who was selected for the survey. Therefor, in this study the student is the basic unit of analysis: the mathematics and science instrimion characteristics were analyzed in relation to go:lent-teacher pairs. Approximately half of tlre stuck= surveyed had a math teacher surveyed (11,414), while tlw other half had a science teacher surveyed (10,868). Overall, approximately 91 percent of the stuzlents surveyed had either a math or science teicher surveyed. The mathematics instruction component of this study is based upon only those students whose math reicher was surveyed, while the science instirction component was based upon only those whose science teachers were surveyed. Since the teackrs were randomly assigned at the school level, the students had an equal probability of having either a math or science teacher surveyed, and thus, each group should be equally representative."}, {"section_title": "Accuracy of Estimates", "text": "The statistics in this report are population estimates derived from the sample described in the preceding section. Two broad categories of error occur in such estimates: sampling and nonsampling error. Sampling error occurs because samples are not populations. However, the nature of the error depends upon the sample design, and the error properties of many types of sample designs (including two-stage designs such as the one used in this stixly) are known. Nonsampling error occurs not only in sample surveys but also in population censuses. Nonsampling error may arise from a number of sources, such as the inability to obtain cooperation from each sampled school (school nonresponse), cc the inability to obtain infornation from each sampled student in cooperating schools (student nonresponse). A third source of nonresponse contributing to nonsampling error is found at the item level. Cooperating students may not have answered every question in the survey. In addition, ambiguous definitions, differences in interpreting questions, inability or unwillingness to give correct infcemation, mistakes in recoding or coding data, and other errors of collecting and processing the data can result in nonsampling error. The precision with which one can use survey results to make inferences to a population depends upon the magnitude of both sampling and nonsampling errors. In large sample surveys, such as the NELS:88 study, sampling errors are generally minimal, except when estimates are made for relatively small subpopulations, such as for American Indians (N=315). The menampling arms are more difficult to estimate. The majo sources of nonsampling error considered were school, student, and item-level nonresponse. The NELS:88 base year student respone rate was above 93 percent and the item it:sponse rates within instnnnents, for the items used to develop the estimates in this repert, wete above 95.3 percent. Tin weights used to calculate the estimates were consumed in a fashion that compensawd fo instrument Weighting miceduzes axe explained in the NELS:88 Base Year Student User's Afamial. Tie small bias due to nomesponse is documented in the NEL C:88 Base Year Sample Design Repon.47 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Procedures", "text": "The statistical comparison in this report were based cm the t statistic. Generally, whether de statistical test is considered significant or not is determined by calculating a t value fct the diffaence between a pa:7 of means or Foportions and corn g this value to published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. The al level is a n a priori statement of the probability of inferring that a difference exists when in fact it does wt. In order to make proper inferences and interpretations from the statistics, a number of issues must be kept in mind. First, comparisons resulting in large t statistics may appear to merit special attention. This is somewhat misleading, since the size of the t statistic depends not only on de observed differences in means or percentage being compared but also on the number of respondents in tie categories used fox conparison, and on the degree of variability among respondents within categcries. A small difference =pared across a large number of respondents could result in a large t statistic. Second, when multiple statistical comparisons ate made cm the same data it becomes increasingly likely that an indication of a population difference will be erroneously given. Even when that is no difference in the population, at an alpha-kvel of .05 there is still a 5 percent chance of declaring that an observed t value representing one conparison in the sample is large enough tz be statistically significant. As the number of comparisons increases, the risk of making such an error in inference also increases. To guard against errors of inference based upon multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni procedure to correct significance tests for multiple contrast was used. This method corrects de significance (cr alpha) level fin-de total number of contrasts made with a particular classification variable. For each classification variable, there are (K*(K-1)/2) possible contrasts (or nonredundant pairwise comparisons), where K is the number of categories. For example, since SES has four categories, K=4 and there are (4'03)/2=6 possible comparisons between the categories. The Bonferroni procedure divides the alpha-level fix a single t test (for example, .05) by the number of possible pairwise comparisons to give a new alpha that is corrected for the fact that multiple =mists are being made. Standard errors for the estimates in each of the tables are presented in the appendix. The standard errors were calculated using the STRATTAB pnagram, which uses a Taylor series approximation to calculate standard ernrs based upon complex survey designs.48 A version of this program is available from NCFS upon request The standard errors repcced take into account the clustering in the sampling procedure; they are generally higher than standard errors calculated under the assumptions of simple random sampling. Interested readers can compute the t statistic between estimates from various subgroups presented in the tables using the following formula: Pl.P2 SQRT (set * sel + se2 * se2) where P1 and P2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se2 are their conespcmding standard arms. Effect size (used in Chapter 4) shows the mean difference in terms of standard deviation units. Effect sizes were calculated by subtracting the two mean estimates being compared and dividing by the total standard deviation. The use of effect size allows one to compare mean differegzes among group even when the tests are on different scales. In Kldition to allowing for scale-fire comparisons, the effect size yields an estimate of the size of the difference that is unaffected by the sample size. While many contrasts will be statistically significant given the large sample sizes, cally a few may reach practical significance. Effect sizes in the .10 to .20 of a standard deviation range are considered small. Effects sizes between .3 and .5 of a standard deviation are considered to be in the \"medium\" effect size range and to be practically significanto Effect sizes that approach a full standard deviation are considered quite large effects. Using the standanlized formula score in this report, we know that the mean is 50 and standard deviation is 10, thus we consider any difference in effect sizes of 3 points or more (.3 of a standard deviation) to be stanAically and practically significant"}, {"section_title": "Variables Used", "text": "Classification variables were selected to describe student characteristics such as sex, race ethnicity and socioeconomic status; school characteristics such as region, urbanicity, and school type; and mathematics or science class characteristics such as class type, ard test quartiles fir each student.
