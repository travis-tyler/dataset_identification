In 2010, 35.6 million people worldwide were estimated to have dementia, with care costing an estimated U.S. $604 billion [1] . Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, contributing to potentially 60%-70% of these cases. There are currently no approved treatments that slow the progression of AD, despite numerous clinical trials investigating potential disease-modifying therapies. A major obstacle for AD clinical trials is the high cost and time required to screen large numbers of candidate participants to meet specific trial inclusion criteria.\nBecause the accumulation of evidence suggesting the pathophysiological process of AD begins with b-amyloid (Ab) deposition, many clinical trials have begun to require Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

However, measuring Ab pathology with these technologies is expensive and invasive. This is especially an issue in trials using antiamyloid drugs directed against preclinical or prodromal AD, where evidence of Ab pathology is essential to avoid diluting the drug effect by inclusion of individuals with normal Ab levels (Ab2). Clinical trials attempting to recruit cognitively healthy Ab positive (Ab1) elderly may expect large numbers of screen failures, given that the prevalence of Ab positivity in cognitively healthy people aged 60-90 years is around 31%, as shown in a recent metaanalysis [3] . The overall goal of this study was therefore to provide tools to increase the proportion of Ab1 participants identified for screening for trials of preclinical AD. A global effort from organizations like the Brain Health Registry (www.brainhealthregistry.org), the Global Alzheimer's Platform (globalalzplatform.org), and the European Prevention of Alzheimer's Dementia Consortium (ep-ad.org) is underway to establish well-characterized trial-ready cohorts to expedite the screening process for AD clinical trials. Demographic, cognitive, and genetic information will be acquired both online and in clinics over time on large numbers of potential trial participants. Clinical trial recruiters will then be able to evaluate which participants may be likely to meet specific inclusion criteria before screening for specific trials. Recruiters may be able to exploit the associations between brain amyloid pathology and demographic [3] [4] [5] , genetic [6] [7] [8] , and cognitive [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] factors to improve the prediction of Ab positivity. However, the degree to which these associations can improve the positive predictive value (PPV) in the forecasting of Ab pathology in cognitively normal elderly is unknown. Therefore, the goal of this study was to quantify the effect of using demographic, cognitive, and genetic information in cognitively normal elderly to predict Ab pathology, to reduce the number of screen failures and costs of clinical trials."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data were obtained from the ADNI database (adni.loni. usc.edu).

The main outcome was PPV, that is, the proportion of individuals predicted to be Ab1 that were also observed to be Ab1, for predictors assessed both individually and collectively. Ab1 was defined as florbetapir PET SUVR .1.10 [10] or CSF Ab 42 , 192 ng/L [15] in participants without florbetapir PET (n 5 54). We classified subjects as Ab1 if they became positive at any point during followup. This approach is based on evidence that if a subject is approaching amyloid positivity in the near term, that is, has emerging amyloid pathology, they are likely to have increased atrophy rates [21] , lower FDG PET, and subtle cognitive dysfunction and should not be included in the reference group [22] . Based on this evidence, several recent publications have suggested that current amyloid-positivity thresholds are likely too conservative [23, 24] . Baseline characteristics of the Ab groups were assessed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables and Fisher exact test for categorical variables.\nIn the assessment of individual predictors, continuous variables were iteratively thresholded, moving across the spectrum of the predictor, with the proportion of Ab1 calculated at each threshold. The PPV estimates were then regressed on the range of thresholds using natural splines to produce PPV curves [25] . For the PPV curves of each predictor, 95% confidence intervals were estimated using the margins (2.5 and 97.5 percentiles) from 500 bootstrap samples.\nThe collective ability for the predictors to increase PPV was estimated using cross-validated random forests [26] . In each of 10 cross-validation folds, the probability of being Ab1 was estimated for each participant by averaging over the votes from all decision trees. The probability threshold used to classify participants as Ab1 was selected via cross-validation. For each candidate threshold, models were fit on the training sets (9 of the 10 folds) to get an estimate of mean PPV for 10 test sets. The threshold that maximized mean test set PPV was selected. For example, if the probability threshold P 5 .70 maximized the crossvalidated estimate of PPV, then only participants whose estimated probability of being Ab1 exceeded 0.70 were classified as Ab1. The resulting 10 estimates from all folds were used to get a mean and 95% confidence interval for PPV using the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.\nCognitive tests were administered at baseline, month 6 (except logical memory), month 12, and month 24. Cognitive measures over 24 months were regressed on time from the baseline visit to estimate subject-specific cognitive rates of change using mixed-effects regression with a random intercept and slope and an unstructured covariance matrix for the random effects. By month 24, all cognitive tests had been assessed at 3 or more follow-up visits, allowing participant-specific rates to be estimated. P values were all two sided and considered significant at the 0.05 level. All analyses were done in R v3.1.1 (www.r-project.org)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "There were 353 participants with complete data, including demographic, APOE, Ab information, and 24-month follow-up. One-hundred forty-four participants (40.8%) were Ab1 (119 measured by PET, 25 by CSF), and 209 (59.2%) were Ab2 (180 by PET, 29 by CSF). Ab1 participants were older, less educated, and had a higher proportion of females and APOE \u03b54 positivity, compared with Ab2 participants (Table 1) .

Sixty participants were predicted to be Ab1, of which 39 were actually positive. Participants predicted to be Ab1 had a mean age of 78.1 years (range, 65-90 years), an Table 3 ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The main finding of this study is that prediction of b-amyloid pathology can be improved in a cognitively normal population without expensive and invasive procedures. Enriching recruitment of cognitively normal Ab1 subjects is feasible through the use of demographic, cognitive, and genetic predictors, both individually ( Figs. 1 and 2) and collectively (Fig. 3) . A 0.65 proportion of Ab-positivity, nearly 60% above the reference proportion of 0.41, was found when all predictors, including longitudinal cognitive rates, were modeled. If used for pre-screening in a clinical trial aimed at recruiting 1000 Ab1 participants, this information could reduce the number of people undergoing biomarker screening from 2451 to 1539 participants. By The increase in the prevalence of Ab positivity with age is well established [3] [4] [5] . In a large meta-analysis of cognitively normal participants, the prevalence of Ab positivity increased from about 17% at age 60 years to 33% at age 80 years and up to 50% at age 95 years [3] . In our analysis, the proportion of Ab1's steadily increases with age until a plateau in the late 70s. However, the confidence intervals are wide at this end of the age range, and it is unlikely that the rate of Ab positivity does not continue to increase. Age continues to be one of the strongest predictors of Ab positivity.\nThe robust association between APOE \u03b54 genotype and b-amyloid pathology is also well established [6] [7] [8] . In this study, 58% of APOE \u03b54 carriers were Ab1 compared to 34% of noncarriers. This risk increase is similar to the increase of 51% versus 23% shown in the AIBL cohort [3] . Just under 42% of the model-predicted Ab1 participants in our study were APOE \u03b541, resulting in a lower rate of APOE \u03b54 positivity compared with the full Ab1 cohort. This low rate of APOE \u03b54 positivity among those predicted to be Ab1 highlights the importance of the combination of predictors and not just a dependence on APOE genotype to enrich Ab positivity. From a clinical trial standpoint, refraining from strict inclusion criteria such as APOE \u03b54 positivity will be important to avoid restrictive drug labeling.\nThe associations of gender and education with Ab pathology observed in this study are less clear. Although there is a higher rate of AD in females [28, 29] , the slight increased prevalence of Ab positivity in females observed in this study was not seen in other large cohort studies [3, 8] . However, once age, APOE, and cognitive measures were included in the model, gender did not predict Ab positivity. The ADNI cohort is also more educated than other cohorts, including population-based cohorts, which may contribute to the high overall rate of Ab positivity in this sample, following from the cognitive reserve hypothesis and similar associations observed in other studies [30, 31] . The additional slight increase of Ab-positivity in individuals with fewer years of education is likely due to the small sample size of less educated individuals in ADNI.\nSubtle cognitive dysfunction and increased rates of decline associated with Ab-positivity in cognitively normal elderly have been replicated in many independent cohorts [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . A meta-analysis comprising 34 independent studies of cognitively normal participants found overall significant associations between amyloid burden and poorer performance on measures of memory, executive function, and global cognition [13] . Given these associations, the increase in the proportion of Ab1's at the lower end of the spectrum of cognitive scores and rates observed in this analysis was expected. Increases in PPV are seen with a decrease in the cognitive scores and faster rates of decline in multiple domains (Fig. 2 ) not only delayed memory recall. It is possible that cognitive measures only marginally associated with Ab positivity across the entire spectrum of scores in small samples may still be useful for increasing PPV if the concentration of Ab1's increases toward the bottom 20%-30% of scores. This is especially true if the rate of Ab positivity accelerates at the low end of the spectrum, as it appears to do in several cognitive measures in Fig. 2 . In large cohorts of thousands of participants, the bottom quartile of scores may represent a large pool from which to recruit into clinical trials. Cognitive measures provide important complementary information to demographics and APOE and greatly improve the precision of the prediction of Ab pathology (Fig. 3) .\nA study of cognitively normal elderly from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging [32] found the strongest predictors of Ab pathology to be age, APOE status, family history of dementia, and/or AD, but not cross-sectional cognition and did not evaluate longitudinal cognitive change. Unfortunately, family history of AD was not assessed in our analysis because of the large proportion of missing data for family history, although it is possible or likely that family history information could further improve Ab enrichment. In summary, the relationships reported in previous studies of Ab, demographics, APOE, and cognitive data support the results of our model to predict Ab pathology.\nIn Fig. 3 , PPV estimates and confidence intervals are improved but not maximized when only subsets of the available predictors are modeled. It is not until all categories of predictors-demographic, genetic, and cognitive scores and rates-are included that PPV estimates reach 65% and confidence intervals narrow. This suggests that the prediction of Ab pathology in cognitively normal participants cannot be optimally done with simple independent thresholds for each predictor, but rather that risk must be evaluated with all predictors in concert. This can be seen by considering the range of characteristics of the predicted Ab1 group from the best model, where less than half of these participants are APOE \u03b541, many are aged ,75 years, and some have memory or global cognitive scores above the median (Supplementary Table) . Thus, whereas rates of Ab positivity increase with age, declining cognitive scores and APOE \u03b54-positivity, the ability and precision to predict Ab pathology increases substantially when these risk factors are assessed collectively. As such, clinical trials may benefit from using a set of interdependent inclusion criteria based on multiple factors. This study has several limitations. The cognitive tests described here were administered in clinic. Whether online cognitive testing will predict Ab positivity with the same PPV is unknown. The confidence intervals for the models shown in Fig. 3 overlap substantially. However, the best performing model has a lower confidence limit well above the reference PPV. A much larger cohort will be required to provide the power to test for model differences. The prevalence of Ab positivity in the ADNI cohort of cognitively normal controls is also on the high end of the spectrum of previously reported estimates, calling into question how the methods developed here would perform in other cohorts [33] . This cohort is not population based and is more educated on average, making the relationships among predictors and amyloid pathology observed here potentially less generalizable to other cohorts due to cognitive reserve. The enrichment of Ab pathology in this analysis relied on subtle cognitive dysfunction within the range considered to be cognitively normal. Identifying Ab pathology in participants with high cognitive scores remains a challenge and will likely require the identification of further biomarkers associated with Ab or downstream effects of Ab pathology. Additionally, the random forest model known for its flexibility in terms of modeling nonlinearity and the interactions among predictors comes at the cost of the ability to report simple estimates of the relationship between the predictors and the response [26] . The effects of predictors in random forest models vary over hundreds of bootstrap resamples, precluding the report of a simple closed form solution to predict amyloid pathology. For this reason, results are summarized by PPV estimates and confidence intervals of subsets of predictors and also the range of characteristics of the predicted Ab-pathology group. Nevertheless, even without specifying effects of individual predictors, a random forest model such as the one presented here is conceivable as a well-defined statistical working tool for pre-screening participants in clinical trials.\nFinally, considerable improvements to the recruitment of cognitively normal elderly with Ab pathology can be done without expensive or invasive procedures. By implementing a pre-screening procedure to participants enrolled in large online cohorts, the likelihood of Ab pathology can be assessed and the number of screen failures due to biomarker inclusion criteria and associated costs reduced. When effective treatments for AD become available, a similar approach could be used to identify individuals likely to harbor Ab pathology to inform decisions concerning treatment."}, {"section_title": "RESEARCH IN CONTEXT", "text": "1.
