The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at an early stage is a problematic task for researchers. For this, machine learning and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches are readily available to solve various problems related to brain image data analysis. In clinical research, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to diagnose AD. For accurate classification of dementia stages, we need highly discriminative features obtained from MRI images. Recently advanced deep CNN-based models successfully proved their accuracy. However, due to a smaller number of image samples available in the datasets, there exist problems of over-fitting hindering the performance of deep learning approaches. In this research, we developed a Siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN) model inspired by VGG-16 (also called Oxford Net) to classify dementia stages. In our approach, we extend the insufficient and imbalanced data by using augmentation approaches. Experiments are performed on a publicly available dataset open access series of imaging studies (OASIS), by using the proposed approach, an excellent test accuracy of 99.05% is achieved for the classification of dementia stages. We compared our model with the state-of-the-art models and discovered that the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art models in terms of performance, efficiency, and accuracy."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Alzheimer's disease (AD or Alzheimer's) causes the loss of tissues and death of nerve cells throughout the brain, resulting in memory loss of humans and imposing a bad impact on the performance of routine life tasks such as writing, speaking, and reading. Sometimes AD Patients may have problems in the identification of their family members. Mild cognitive stage patients behave very aggressively, but patients in the last stage of AD suffer from heart failure and respiratory system dysfunctionality leading to death [1] . Early and accurate diagnosis of AD is not possible due to the improper medication that has been specified [2] . However, the early-stage diagnosis of Alzheimer's and treatment can improve the patient's life [3] . All the indicators of AD usually grow slowly but affect severely with the passage of time, when the disorder of the human brain starts [4] . Every year a large number of people suffer from this disease. As per an estimation, one out of 85 persons would be suffering from AD in the world till 2050 [5] . The global deterioration scale (GDS) is commonly used for dementia scaling. This scale further divides AD into seven stages, which depend on the Brain Sci. 2020, 10, 84; doi:10.3390/brainsci10020084 www.mdpi.com/journal/brainsci Brain Sci. 2020, 10, 84 2 of 15 value of cognitive decline. In GDS, stage 4 is considered as early dementia; however, stage 5 and stage 6 are treated as middle dementia. On the other hand, the clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale is also used in dementia research because it is easy for communication between the families and medical professionals [6] . CDR scores assigned to test six different parameters such as problem-solving, orientation, hobbies, memory, and judgment [7] . In AD patients, the cerebral cortex and hippocampus sizes shrink in the brain, but the size of the ventricles increases in the brain. Spatial memory and episodic memory are part of the brain that is damaged when the hippocampus size is reduced [8] . It also provides connectivity between the brain and body. Hippocampus reduction causes cell loss and impairment of the synapses and neuron ends [9] . Due to the uncertainty between neurons, communication defects in the short-term memory, planning, and judgment have been observed [10] . Researchers have established many Computer-Aided Diagnosis Systems (CADS) for the accurate detection and classification of the extracted features related to AD [11] . To process the extracted features, more effort and time by human experts is required otherwise.\nRecently, the researchers are developing deep learning models/techniques to extract the features directly from medical images [12] . Deep learning models have achieved major conquest in medical images such as CT, MRI, X-ray, microscopy, and mammography [13] . These models or methods mainly focused on binary classification, which shows only that whether the patient is suffering from AD or not [14] . However, proper diagnosis of the patient requires the classification of different dementia stages. MCI stage is a highly defective stage as compared to AD because 10% to 16% of patients convert MCI sharply to AD per year [15] . MCI stage is highly variable for patients to stabilize or reverts into the healthy stage [16] . However, for prediction, the conversion from MCI to AD important biomarkers are Magnetic Resonance images (MRI) because they are less expensive as compared to positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). MRI based images contain multi-modal information regarding the function and structure of the brain, which is suitable for clinical purposes.\nA large number of datasets produced massive progress in object detection and image classification because most datasets are labeled. A common example is an ImageNet database, which has millions of better images for model learning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) gave a robust performance on large image datasets [17] . In deep learning, CNN is widely known for its ability to perform high accuracy in terms of medical image classification. There are different models that are utilizing CNN for AD scan categorization. However, the most important advantage of CNNs as compared to conventional machine learning techniques is that CNNs do not require manual feature extraction because CNNs are capable of extracting the effective features automatically and then categorizing the stages of AD [18] . However, existing machine learning and deep learning models are trained from scratch but have some limitations such as, (1) to train the deep learning model on huge number of images requires massive computational resources; (2) for the proper training of the model, we need magnificent amount of standard training datasets, which is the biggest problem for medical imaging where standard data can be expensive and ethically privacy issues arises; (3) during training the model on medical imaging requires more attentive and tedious tuning of a number of parameters, which cause overfitting problems and affect the overall performance of the model.\nOur current research towards the development of the Siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN) inspired by the VGG16 architecture [19] is implemented for the improved diagnosis and classification of multiple stages of Alzheimer's from no dementia to moderate AD. The model is completely identical but joins two modified VGG16 parallel layers, \"Siamese\". We insert a concatenation that joins every single layer. The key objective of the proposed technique is to reduce the dependency on large datasets. We acquired the 3-D views of the human brain dataset from the OASIS repository and achieved better performance as compared to the state-of-the-art performances on small MRI images. In this study, our key contributions are given below:"}, {"section_title": "\u2022", "text": "We formed an SCNN model for the multi-class classification of Alzheimer's disease.\nWe presented an efficient model to overcome the data shortcoming complications for an imbalanced dataset.\nWe developed a regularized model that learns from the small dataset and still demonstrates superior performance for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.\nRecently several researchers have developed techniques for AD diagnosis. The techniques are categorized based on machine learning and deep learning models. These techniques are briefly discussed in the following section."}, {"section_title": "Machine Learning-Based Technique", "text": "Several machine learning-based models have been proposed to extract the features and perform multiple operations on AD MRI images [20] .

[22] used a random forest classifier to develop a multimodal classification for AD classification on positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI data. Morra et al. [23] introduced different models' comparison to detect AD on MRI scans such as SVM and hierarchical AdaBoost models. Neff et al. [24] developed an algorithm for feature extraction and reduction by using downsized kernel principal component analysis (DKPCA) and support vector machine (SVM) for AD MRI images. They tested the model on the OASIS datasets and obtained 92.5% accuracy using a multi-support vector machine (MSVM) kernel. Wang et al. [25] used wavelet entropy and biography-based optimizers to extract the features in MRI data and classified them. They obtained 100% accuracy by applying a six-fold CV model on 64 brain images. Ding et al. [26] have improved the feature extraction and feature selection accuracy on AD and NC patient's datasets. They used gray level occurrence matrix and voxel based morphometric (VBM analysis for feature extraction and SVM for classification purposes. Performance checked on the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset showed an accuracy of 92.86%. Dashan et al. [27] proposed systems for feature extraction and reduction on T2-weighted MRI images produced by Harvard medical school. Two classifiers are being tested on the same dataset and obtained an accuracy between 97% to 98%. Hinrich et al. [28] obtained samples from the ADNI database and applied the proposed technique on the multi-classification of Alzheimer's. The overall accuracy obtained was 79.8% for all stages. Yue et al. [29] also developed a voxel-based hierarchical feature extraction technique that finds the correlation between subjects. In the second step, feature vectors were used for processing the feature and placed into the classifier to check the effectiveness. Ahmed et al. [30] designed a simpler CNN model using the patch-based classifier to diagnosis the AD multi-stages. The model reduced the computational cost and produced a great improvement in accuracy. They generated the patches on a three-view of MRI image and obtained an overall 90.05% accuracy. However, utilizing machine learning models with the hand-crafted features, most studies showed accuracy that depended on how well the feature was defined. For this purpose, the domain experts are required to achieve maximum performance. For such a limitation, one of the solutions is deep learning as it is familiar to capture arbitrary features automatically and then achieve relatively high accuracy [31] ."}, {"section_title": "Deep Learning-Based Technique", "text": "Several deep learning-based models have been proposed to extract the features directly on input data and perform multiple operations on MRI images [32] . These models based on multiple layers and hierarchical structure, which rapidly increased the ability of feature representation on different datasets. Liu et al.

[34] introduced a sparse auto-encoder based model for the classification of three AD stages. The respective accuracy obtained on the ADNI dataset for multi-classification is 95%. Dou et al. [35] presented the improved performance model on 3D CNN and 2D CNN approaches. They used 3D CNN model to detect cerebral micro-bleeds. They applied the extensive experiment to validate the purposed model and obtained the sensitivity result of 93.16%. Suk et al. [36] proposed another technique to classify AD and MCI converter stages by using an auto-encoder network. They obtained an accuracy rate of 95.9% over these MCI stages. Hong et al. [37] predicted Alzheimer's disease using long short-term memory (LSTM) because it was able to connect the patient's previous information to the current task. They process the time series data in three layers, such as pre-fully connected, cells, and post-fully connected layers. The accuracy is still limited because to get traditional features from temporal information due to the lack of data. They obtained the 82.05% overall performance for multi-classification of AD patients. The authors obtained at best 98.78% multiclass-classification accuracy on the OASIS data using ResNet50 and gradient boosted machine [38] . In [39] , the researchers proposed a deep learning model using inceptionV3 architecture for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to test on the ADNI dataset. They analyzed the accuracy rate on receiving operating characteristic (ROC) is 95% and sensitivity 100%. One such recent method developed [40] for Alzheimer's diagnosis and multi-classification from MRI images with the help of intelligent data selection. They used the popular CNN architecture VGG on the ADNI database. They also deployed the transfer learning and showed very high classification performance, such as for AD vs. NC 99.36%, MCI vs. NC 99.04%, and 99.20% overall accuracy for multi-classification. In [41] researcher proposed CNN based model and acquired 94.54% classification accuracy for early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) and late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI). The exiting studies using deep learning for medical images and text classification, the CNN provides improvement in results by automatically learning the features on the given task. However, if we compare RNN, CNN has a smaller number of parameters, so CNN is more suitable for a small number of datasets [42] ."}, {"section_title": "Materials and Methods", "text": "In the proposed approach, the algorithm depends on three steps. The first step is data preprocessing and augmentation, the second stage is feature extraction from input images, and the third step is the classification of dementia classes. We developed a CNN-based approach inspired by VGG16 for the classification of dementia stages. We modified the VGG16 and inserted one extra Conv layer in the model which was effective to grasp maximum features on a small dataset [43] . In the algorithm, two modified VGG16 layers were working parallel with 14 Conv layers, five max-pooling, three batch normalization, and three Gaussian noise. The reason for the model is the parallel work to extract the more important features. Consecutive parallel layers improved the classification accuracy [44] .

MRI images during the process of their forming endure deterioration, such as low variation due to bad brightness produced by the visual devices. To overcome this issue for the improvement of MRI scans, image enhancement approaches were applied for the upgrade of the distribution of pixels over an extensive range of intensities, linear contrast stretching was applied on the images. During the image acquisition process, some undesirable information was added to the image due to nonlinear light intensity conceded as noise. Specifically, non-linear light intensity affects the overall performance-accuracy of the image processing [46] . Due to the improper setting of the lens slit of the scanning devices, non-linear light was mostly introduced and the uneven distribution of light was normalized by image enhancement techniques. The dynamic range of light intensity was increased by using contrast stretching because the output images after this process were the ones having improved contrast and appropriate light distribution. Images in the OASIS repository to get better performance on the latter stages were enhanced using the linear contrast stretching. MRI images were obtained from the public OASIS repository and were segmented by extracting the differing intensities of the white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by using the K-mean clustering.

It is a common thing for a deep learning model to provide more effective results on more data.

The small imbalanced dataset creates overfitting problems during training of the model which affects the model efficiency. To overcome this issue, we need more data to enhance the effective accuracy in our proposed model. We used the augmentation technique to create 10 more images on each available MRI image [48] .

Each layer consists of distinct nodes with learnable bias and weights; in the convolutional layer's connection, weights are shared and called a convolution kernel. All the operation results are decided by a different number of activation functions. For the dimensionality reduction and moderation, the sample data used the pooling layer. In CNN, the output of the previous layer is convolved with a learnable kernel and weight-sharing plays a key role in training to reduce the number of weights. The general formula for a convolutional layer is given by:\nThe convolution layer W denotes the image height and width, K represents the filter size, P is the padding, and S refers to the strides. The pooling layer inserted between convolution layers to reduce the computational complexity by a down sampling operation, mostly the max-pooling layer is commonly used. The output of the feature map by convolutional layer further divide into small regions, and each region described the value of the region. CNN is commonly based on the number of pairs of convolutional and pooling layers, successfully connected and finally, softmax to produce the final output labels. In CNN's training, backpropagation [49] is used in order to reduce the cost function and each layer's weights are iteratively updated. In our model, we define a kernel initializer as \"random uniform\" and bias initializer \"zeros\".
