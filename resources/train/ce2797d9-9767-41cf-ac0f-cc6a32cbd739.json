In many countries strict social distancing protocols and guidelines have been put in place to limit the spread of the disease. Yet, there seems to be a world-wide tendency to negate many of these restrictions, at least within certain subpopulations. In a few countries, there are no formal restrictions on social interaction. The price of not imposing such restrictions, or of defying them, is not easy to quantify and remains ambiguous. Also, it is unknown whether temporary or partially loosening of restrictions, during a weekend or a holiday, has significant impact on the number of infected people or death.\nTo address these questions, we scanned Our World in Data database 1 (derived from European Center for Disease Control and prevention data) for (i) daily new cases and (ii) for daily new deaths. We observe rhythmicity in both indices. To test if the observed patterns are not accidental, and whether they follow a 7-day cyclic rhythm, we studied all 12 developed North American and European countries that reported more than 1,000 deaths by April 28 th . In order to validate the results, data from the US were also collected from an additional source (Worldometer 2 ), and were analyzed in parallel."}, {"section_title": "Statistics", "text": "Analyses were performed separately for each country and for daily numbers of deaths and daily numbers of new cases. In order to account for random variability, raw data was smoothed using a moving average with a window size of three days. Then, in order to account for global trends in each time series, the differences between every two consecutive time points (days in this case) were calculated and used for further analyses. Next, autocorrelations were calculated using an independence model method for calculating standard errors (implemented in SPSS, Version 25) using lags ranging between 1 and 16 days. An autocorrelation is the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of a given lag. The results represent the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. As such, a significant autocorrelation indicates the presence of recurring pattern such that values in the series can be predicted based on its preceding values. For example, if an autocorrelation with a lag of 7 days is positive and significant, it means that the values of the series tend to repeat themselves every seven days. We hypothesized that autocorrelations with a lag of 7 days will be significantly positive. We considered here significant autocorrelations coefficients that were outside the .

Finally, for the purpose of comparison of the detrended time series with a fixed 7-day periodic sinusoidal we fitted the following model ( ) = 1 * (sin (2 + \u2044 2 + 2 ) \u2044 ) + 3 where b1 represents the amplitude, b2 phase shift and b3 an offset and c was held constant to match the desired period of 7 days. The fit was computed with a simplex search method as part of the Matlab Optimization Toolbox (Matworks Inc)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "The original database had 2 missing data points for the number of deaths (one for Spain and one for Switzerland). Missing values were replaced by the average between the adjacent days.\nWe first analyzed the number of deaths cases reported daily and found a significant periodic cycle of seven days in seven out of the twelve countries in the dataset. These countries were: Belgium, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the USA and the UK. Fig. 1 presents a sample of the results obtained in a subset of countries (Germany, Sweden, Spain and the USA) selected to demonstrate the variability we observed in the current analysis. Qualitatively, a periodic pattern can be observed in the original time series for Germany, Sweden and Spain (left top panel); this pattern becomes more pronounced in the detrended data (black line, left bottom panels). The autocorrelation analysis (right panels) unequivocally demonstrated the presence of such periodicity in the time series from Germany and Sweden (the other countries with significant periodicity can be seen in Supp Fig. 1&2 ). As stated in the method section, autocorrelations falling beyond the 95% confidence interval are significant at the .05 level. For the US data, significant autocorrelations were obtained with lags of 6 and 8. Since the average of those cycles is 7, the US can be considered to have cyclic death period ranging between 6 and 8 days, with an average of 7 days. Furthermore, the analyses performed on the number of deaths on an additional database 2 for the US, showed a significant autocorrelations with the 7 days lag (see Supp. Fig. 5 ). Taken together, we can therefore consider the presence of seven-day period also for the US. Similar patterns emerge from the analysis of the records of new cases reported daily (Fig 2 [ where 7-day lag autocorrelations were significant for Germany, Sweden and Spain] and Supp Fig 3&4 [ 7-day lag autocorrelations significant for Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and UK]). Here, seven out of twelve countries showed significant autocorrelations with a 7-day lag. These countries were: Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and Switzerland. It should be noted that once such a component is present in the time series, one should expect to see also significant components at multiples of the same fundamental period (i.e 14 days, 21 etc) as can be observed also in analyses presented here albeit only for 14 days as our data is limited to one month.

Higher infection rate during weekend days may stem from lower social distancing, or higher frequency of interactions between young and old individuals during the weekend. Furthermore, as most new cases of COVID -19 occur in people older than 70, and the great majority of deaths are within this age group, we believe that this vulnerable population is infected by younger relatives or friends unaware of carrying the virus. If this postulation indeed accounts for the observed 7-day pattern, many lives may be saved by greater adherence to social distancing, especially during the weekend. In a few countries (e.g., Sweden), the levels of oscillation were more than 50% of the average levels, suggesting large potential for saving lives. In the US, the low range of daily deaths in the period assessed is about 1700, while the high range is about 2500. We believe that social distancing may lower such difference. This potential should be weighed against the expected mental and medical costs of loneliness and isolation.\nOne cannot ignore alternative explanations that may account for the evident seven-day cycle in the numbers of reported new cases and reported COVID-19 mortality. A leading plausible explanation could be delayed reporting of these events. That is, while new cases and deaths are distributed evenly along all weekdays, reports of these events are delayed during the weekend, erroneously reported and ascribed to 2-4 days later, while events occurring on weekdays are reported without delay. This scenario may be relevant to reports of new cases that need to be confirmed or that depend on the decision to check and/or hospitalize a person. However, it is less likely to account for a significant and welldefined event such as the death of a patient.\nAdditional explanations may include weekly rhythms in hospital care quality 8 . Our hypothesis should be re-tested and refined based on databases that accurately report events' times, when these will become available. We hope that our analysis will trigger local health authorities to ascertain or improve the accuracy of the reported dates, and, if proven to be accurate, act accordingly to prevent more actively the spread of COVID19 during weekends.\nThe copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 8, 2020. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089508 doi: medRxiv preprint Figure 1 .

First, the disease is commonly transmitted through respiratory droplets during un-protect social interactions 3 . Second, older people account for most recognized cases of the disease, and for the great majority of fatalities 4 and asymptomatic people carry and transfer the virus 5 . A trend towards increased social mixing during the weekends has been reported (including in countries present in our analyses 6 ). Third, epidemiological studies indicated that the median duration between contacting a sick/carrying individual and exhibiting clinical symptoms of COVID -19 infection is ~5 days 5 and that the median duration of hospitalization in people that do not survive the virus is ~14 days 7 .\nBecause the restrictions imposed in many countries or adopted voluntarily include limiting workplace hours for those in high-risk populations, susceptible/older people may become infected at higher rates during weekend-days compared to weekdays, as a result of increased social interactions with younger relatives or friends, as indeed indicated previously 6 . Under this assumption, and in accordance with the above known parameters, it follows that these vulnerable individuals will (i) exhibit clinical signs of COVID -19 infection at higher rates ~5 days after the weekend, on Thursday-Friday, and (ii) may have .
