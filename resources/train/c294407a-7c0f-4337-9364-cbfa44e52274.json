[{"section_title": "", "text": "uptake) for 4 brain regions (frontal cortex, posterior cingulate, lateral temporal cortex, parietal cortex). Details of a three-grade scoring system using RCTU scores for the amyloid plaque load are previously provided [9] . The mean retention value of the global cortical region of interest (ROI) was used to define the global cerebral A\u03b2 deposition as amyloid-positive if the mean standard value uptake ratios (SUVR) > 1. 4 in at least one of the ROIs including frontal, lateral parietal, lateral temporal or posterior cingulate-precuneus. All PiB image processing were performed using Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 (SPM8) installed in the MATLAB (R2014a, The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). The PiB-PET were coregistered to the T1 structural image of an individual and the transformation parameters were applied for the spatial normalization of the individual T1 structural image to a template of Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) were calculated. For each individual, the inverse transformation parameters were used to bring the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) 116 atlas to an individual space from the standard space (resampling voxel size = 1mm \u00d7 0.98 mm \u00d7 0.98 mm) using IBASPM software. By using the cerebral gray matter segment image, the nongray matter portion of the atlas were individually masked. The mean regional PiB uptake values from cerebral regions were obtained from coregistered T1-PiB-PET images using the individual AAL 116 atlas. Due to relatively low A\u03b2 deposition, the cerebellar PiB uptake was normalized quantitatively using cerebellar gray matter as the reference. A probabilistic cerebellar atlas (Cognitive Neuroscience laboratory, Royal Holloway, UK; Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL, UK) was brought into an individual space as described above to measure the PiB uptake in the cerebellar gray matter. To extract the mean cerebellar uptake values, the cerebellar lobular regions were included out of 28 anatomical structural regions in the cerebellar atlas. For Characterizing the PiB retention level in the frontal, precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), lateral parietal and lateral temporal regions, the AAL algorithm and a region combining method were applied to define regions of interest (ROIs). To obtain the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), mean value of all voxels within each ROI was divided by the mean cerebellar uptake value of the same individual image. Global cortical SUVR was calculated by dividing all the voxel mean values by the mean cerebellar uptake value from the same individual image. The mean PiB retention value of the global cortical ROI was used to define the global cerebral A\u03b2 deposition. PET were classified as amyloid-positive when the mean SUVR > 1.4 in at least one of the ROIs like frontal, lateral parietal, lateral temporal or posterior cingulateprecuneus [10] . Amyloid-PET data (F-18 and PiB) for ADNI participants were obtained from the ADNI database (http://adni.loni.usc.edu). Individuals were classified as A\u03b2 positive if the SUVR value from F-18 PET was > 1.1 or if the SUVR value was > 1.5 for the PiB PET as per ADNI guidelines [11, 12] .\nApoE expression in human brain and serum. The human postmortem brain tissues were obtained from the Victorian Brain Bank Network (VBBN) for cerebral cortex and the Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB) for cerebellum. Human sera were from the Biobank in the National Research Center for Dementia (NRCD) at Chosun University in Gwangju, Korea. The samples stratified by rs405509 (G/G, G/T, and T/T) were subjected to Western blotting. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described [13] , with minor modifications. Briefly, membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 hour and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: 1:1,000 rabbit anti-apoE (D719N; Cell Signaling); 1:2,000 mouse anti-GAPDH (sc-47724; Santa Cruz); 1:1,000 rabbit anti-apoB (ab20737; Abcam); 1:1,000 rabbit anti-apoC1 (ab198288, Abcam); 1:2,000 rabbit anti-transferrin (ab109503; Abcam). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:5,000. Immunoreactivity was detected with an EZ-Western Lumi Plus (DoGen). Western blotting bands were scanned, and quantified using Image J software. The apoE level was represented as the relative values using the G/G genotype as a reference. Data were indicated as the means \u00b1 SEM. A general linear model was applied to infer the point-wise cortical thickness differences using APOE genotype (\u03b53/\u03b54 vs. \u03b53/\u03b53) as a predictor adjusted for age, sex and field strength covariates. Cortical thinning in \u03b53/\u03b54 compared to \u03b53/\u03b53 individuals is shown for the entorhinal and parahippocampal regions (encompassed in dotted black circles) and precuneus region (encompassed in blue circles). The average cortical thickness in the medial temporal cortex (entorhinal and parahippocampal regions) (B) and precuneus (C) was compared between individuals with APOE genotypes \u03b53/\u03b54 and \u03b53/\u03b53 within each ethnic group as described in Figure 3 . (D) The bar graph shows the comparison of hippocampal volumes between APOE genotypes (\u03b53/\u03b54 and \u03b53/\u03b53) in EastAs and EuroAs. The significance was labeled above the bar plots (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001). (E) Cortical thinning was mapped for rs405509-\u03b53/\u03b54 genotypes in EuroAs. A general linear model was applied to infer the point-wise cortical thickness difference using rs405509 (TT, GT, GG)-\u03b53/\u03b54 and \u03b53/\u03b53 genotypes. The average cortical thickness was compared between \u03b53/\u03b53 and either of rs405509 (TT)-\u03b53/\u03b54 or rs405509 (GG)-\u03b53/\u03b54 in the medial temporal cortex (entorhinal and parahippocampal regions) (F) and precuneus (G). The bar graph shows the comparison of hippocampal volumes between \u03b53/\u03b53 and either of rs405509 (TT)-\u03b53/\u03b54 or rs405509 (GG)-\u03b53/\u03b54 in EuroA (H).
