[{"section_title": "Executive Summary", "text": "The Pell Grant program is the largest federal need-based grant program available to postsecondary education students. In 1998-99, the federal government spent $7.2 billion on Pell Grants for more than 3.8 million students (U.S. Department of Education 1999). Students can use a Pell Grant at almost all 2-and 4-year public and private notfor-profit institutions, as well as several thousand private for-profit institutions. Pell Grant program eligibility is based primarily on the student's and/or parents' income for the previous year, with awards made primarily to low-income students. Among undergraduates who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96, 87 percent of Pell Grant recipients were either dependent students whose parents' incomes were under $45,000 (59 percent) or independent students with incomes under $25,000 (28 percent). Other factors are also taken into account in awarding Pell Grants, such as student and parent assets and other family members who are concurrently enrolled in college. This report provides a description of Pell Grant recipients who were first-time beginning postsecondary students in 1995-96. Using data from the 1996 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study, \"First Follow-up\" (BPS:96/98), the report examines the academic and enrollment characteristics of beginning students who received a Pell Grant and their rates of persistence 3 years after first starting postsecondary education. These students are compared with beginning students who did not receive a Pell Grant. Because Pell Grant recipients are predominantly low-income students, high-income students were excluded from the analysis when comparing students' educational background and postsecondary outcomes. For these analyses Pell Grant recipients were only compared to low-and middle-income nonrecipients. However, all students were included when analyzing the distribution of different types of financial aid and the types of institutions that students attended with respect to whether or not they received a Pell Grant. In 1995-96, 29 percent of all beginning students and 32 percent of full-time beginning students received a Pell Grant. Beginning postsecondary students receiving Pell Grants differed from other first-time students in the types of institutions attended and receipt of other types of financial aid. When examining low-and middle-income students only, Pell Grant recipients differed from nonrecipients in their level of high school academic preparation and the number of factors that put them at risk for not achieving their educational objectives."}, {"section_title": "Institution Type, Pell Grant Award Amounts, and Other Financial Aid", "text": "Taking into account all students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96, Pell Grant recipients differed from nonrecipients in where they enrolled.

Pell Grant recipients enrolled at public 2-year institutions also were more likely than nonrecipients to enroll full time and less likely to work while enrolled.

The goal of the program is equal educational opportunity by providing a \"floor of portable financial aid, distributed entirely on the basis of need\" (Turner 1998). The Pell Grant program is the largest program of need-based grant aid available to postsecondary students. In 1998-99, the federal government spent $7.2 billion on Pell Grants for 3.8 million students (U.S. Department of Education 1999). Students can use the Pell Grant at a wide range of postsecondary institutions, including almost all 2-and 4-year public and private not-forprofit institutions, as well as several thousand private for-profit institutions. Twenty-nine percent of all students who began postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96 received a Pell Grant.' The Pell Grant is available for fees, tuition, and living expenses, and the average amount awarded to students in 1998-99 was $1,876. The maximum award for that year, based on the annual federal appropriation for the program, was $3,000.2 Pell Grant recipients consist primarily of students from low-income families. The Department of Education determines who is eligible for federally funded financial support, including Pell Grants, based on a formula called the \"Expected Family Contribution\" (EFC). This formula takes into account several factors affecting a student's ability to pay for a postsecondary education. The most important factors in the equation are the student's income and assets (for independent students), or parents' income and assets (for dependent students).3 Some students from middle-income families may receive a Pell Grant due to other circumstances affecting their financial need, such as having siblings who are also enrolled in college. Between 1976-77 and 1998-99, the number of Pell Grant recipients doubled, from 1.9 million to more than 3.8 million per year. Program expenditures increased by 75 percent in inflation-adjusted terms due to at least two factors: increases in higher education enrollments during this period (including the number of low-income students) and an expansion of eligibility re-Introduction quirements. However, augmentations in program funding have not translated into more purchasing power for the individual student. The maximum Pell Grant now covers a smaller proportion of the price of attending college than it did in the early years of the program, because Pell Grants have not increased at the same rate as college prices (King 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Persistence and Attainment of Pell Grant Recipients", "text": "While discussions about the Pell Grant program have centered on its goal of providing access to postsecondary education and its success in doing so, the public is also concerned about student outcomes. Many want to know how well Pell Grant recipients fare in postsecondary education once they overcome the immediate financial obstacles to enrollment. Do they persist and graduate at rates similar to nonrecipients? The problem with answering this question is that a Pell Grant can only directly influence one dimension of a student's lifealbeit an important oneonce that student is enrolled in college. Due to their low-income status, Pell Grant recipients often come from disadvantaged environments and have poor academic preparation, affecting their ability to succeed in postsecondary education regardless of whether any financial barriers have been removed. Various factors can affect a student's propensity toward completing or stopping their studies prematurely, many of which are related to a student's academic preparation and socioeconomic background as well as any financial and practical concerns (Horn and Premo 1995). However, much can be learned about the role of financial aid in helping students persist in postsecondary education. Previous studies on financial aid and persistence have shown that there appears to be a positive relationship between grants and persistence,' though few studies have focused specifically on Pell Grants and their relationship to persistence. As with most types of student financial aid, it is difficult to isolate the effects of Pell Grants from those of other financial support because aid recipientsespecially need-based aid recipientsfrequently receive multiple types of support. A student's financial aid package can consist of a mixture of grants, loans, work-study, and other awards. Lee found that Pell Grant recipients who began their postsecondary studies in 1989-90 had a persistence rate that was 8 percentage points lower than that of nonrecipients.5 When recipients' rates of persistence were analyzed by income, Lee found that among the lowest income students, recipients persisted at a higher rate than those who did not receive Pell Grants. These findings, Introduction however, did not control for institution type or academic preparation. This analysis discussed in the current study examines Pell Grant recipients' outcomes with respect to both institution type and academic preparation."}, {"section_title": "Organization of This Report", "text": "After a discussion of the data and methods, this report is divided into four sections. The first section provides an overview of all beginning Pell Grant recipients by institution type. The remaining sections control for income (by analyzing only low-and middle-income students). Section two provides a description of academic preparation, postsecondary attendance intensity (full-time versus part-time), employment status, and an analysis of persistence risk factors. The third section provides a description of 3-year persistence and attainment rates, within institution types, and levels of academic preparation. Finally, a multivariate analysis was conducted to control for the relationships of various individual demographic and academic variables to 3-year persistence and attainment. The following questions are addressed in this study: 1) What types of postsecondary institutions do beginning. Pell Grant recipients attend? How much do students receive from the Pell Grant program according to the type of institution they attend? What other types of financial aid do these students receive? 2) What are the academic background and postsecondary enrollment characteristics of beginning students with Pell Grants? What types of persistence risk factors do beginning Pell Grant recipients tend to have? How do Pell Grant recipients differ, in terms of these characteristics, compared with low-and middle-income students who do not receive these grants? How do they differ by type of institution attended? 3) What are the persistence and attainment rates of beginning Pell Grant students three years after starting postsecondary education by type of institution attended? How do these rates compare with those of low-and middle-income students who do not receive these grants? Many comparisons between Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients are reported in this study. When differences are reported, they were statistically tested (using t-tests or ANOVA) at the .05 alpha level.6 If the t-test or F test did not exceed the critical level, the report states that no difference could be detected (see appendix B for details of statistical methods). This report uses data from the 1996-98 Beginning Postsecondary Students longitudinal study (BPS:96/98). The survey includes the postsecondary education outcomes of students three years after their initial enrollment in 1995-96. Students were first interviewed as part of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:96) and then reinterviewed in spring 1998. BPS:96/98 is a nationally representative sample of more than 10,000 first-time beginners, including more than 3,000 Pell Grant recipients (see Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000; Kojaku and Nuriez 1998)."}, {"section_title": "Institution Type", "text": "Institution type is a key variable when analyzing persistence and attainment in postsecondary education for Pell Grant recipients. Because institutions have such varying rates of persistence, and Pell Grant recipients are more likely to attend certain types of institutions than others, it was necessary in this study to control for institution type when analyzing persistence and completion rates. Institution type is based on the institution in which the student first enrolled in 1995-96 and includes the following categories: To provide as much information as possible, most tables include all beginning students in the totals (or all low-and middle-income students where indicated), but due to small sample sizes, students in public less-than-2-year institutions, private not-for-profit less-than-4-year institutions, and private for-profit 4-year institutions are not shown as separate rows."}, {"section_title": "Attendance Status", "text": "While the Pell Grant program allows part-time students (including less-than-half-time students who are not eligible for federal student loan programs) to receive grants, many part-time students do not receive Pell Grant awards for various reasons.? Some part-time students work while they are enrolled, thereby earning income that lowers their eligibility for a Pell Grant. In addition, part-time students generally have lower expenses. In most cases, they are charged lower tuition and fees than are full-time students. This may decrease the likelihood that such students apply for financial aid. Among those who do apply, lower expenses reduce the amount of allowable costs covered by the program, affecting both eligibility and the amount of Pell Grant dollars received. Moreover, federal financial need analysis for the Pell Grant program does not include room and board in the student budget for less-than-half-time students, which further reduces their eligible educational expenses. In addition to differences in Pell Grant eligibility, educational outcomes differ between full-and part-time students. Specifically, attending part time is negatively associated with persistence and degree attainment (Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000). Therefore, in order to take into account differences in Pell Grant eligibility as well as outcomes, many of the tables are presented in two parts, showing all beginning students followed by those who attended exclusively full time. The multivariate analysis is based on full-time students only."}, {"section_title": "Income in 1994", "text": "Beginning postsecondary students in 1995-96 were aggregated into quartiles based on 1994 annual income. In BPS:96/98, the primary source of data on income was the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) completed by students applying for federal financial aid for the 1995-96 academic year. Applicants were required to provide information on the FAFSA for income earned during 1994.8 Incomes for independent students include both students' and spouses' incomes, while incomes for dependent students are based on parents' incomes. The income quartiles for independent and dependent students are as follows:"}, {"section_title": "Income quartiles", "text": "Independent students Dependent students The cutoff point at which dependent students were considered \"high income\" ($70,000 or more) is consistent with other NCES reports based on BPS:96/98 data. For example, one recent ?Among 1995-96 beginning postsecondary students, for example, about one-fifth of part-time students received a Pell Grant, compared to about one-third of full-time students (BPS:96/98 Data Analysis System). 8For those without 1995-96 FAFSA information, 1994 income data were collected directly from students and parents via telephone interviews or were imputed. Of' study on college affordability defined middle-income students as the population of dependent undergraduates with annual family incomes between $35,000 and $70,000 (Lee and Cleary 2001). In this analysis, it was important to control for income when analyzing differences between Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients. The Pell Grant program provides a basic level of financial support for needy students. At best, a Pell Grant award increases a low-income student's purchasing power to the level of a middle-income student's. Neither the current method of administration nor the original goals of the program have the intention or the effect of creating circumstances for low-income recipients that would be comparable to those of high-income students. High-income students may not be affected by financial barriers to attendance and completion to the same degree as low-and middle-income students. Previous studies have shown that high-income students have higher rates of completion than students in lower income categories (see, for example, Lee 1998). Therefore, when analyzing students' academic backgrounds, persistence risk characteristics, and postsecondary outcomes, high-income students ($70,000 or more for dependent students; $25,000 or more for independent students) were excluded from comparisons between Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients. Inclusion of high-income students would increase the persistence and completion rates of nonrecipients in comparison with Pell Grant recipients, most of whom come from low-income households. However, when analyzing the distribution of other types of financial aid and the types of institutions students attend, Pell Grant recipients are compared with all nonrecipients including high-income students."}, {"section_title": "Academic Background", "text": "In addition to demographic background information, the BPS:96/98 survey data have been supplemented with academic background data from ETS and ACT, which include test scores and self-reported courses taken for those who took the college entrance examinations.

Those in the lowest quartile scored between 400 and 700 points, those in the two middle quartiles scored between 710 and 1,020 points, and those in the highest quartile had scores in the 1,030 to 1,600 range.

Departures from the persistence track include downward transfers (such as transferring from a 4-year institution to a less-than-4-year institution) or leaving postsecondary education for more than 4 months and then returning (i.e., stopping out). If a student stops out for more than 4 months and then returns to the original institution or even to a higher level institution, that action still constitutes a departure from the persistence track because enrollment must be continuous if the student is to be considered to have remained on the persistence track. In this study, Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients were compared with regard to the rates at which they 1) remained on the persistence track (i.e., attained a certificate/degree or remained enrolled continuously at an institution of the same or higher level); 2) left the persistence track (i.e., stopped out or made an immediate downward transfer); or 3) left postsecondary education without a degree and without returning within the 3-year period. 10These categories were first used by Horn and Kojaku (2001) and are defined in detail in appendix A in the glossary under the entry for \"CTAKING.\" 11The concept of the \"persistence track\" was first defined by C.D.

In this case, the first year of enrollment was 1995-96 for the cohort of students participating in BPS:96/98. This section of the report includes all beginning postsecondary students who enrolled in postsecondary education for the first time in 1995-96. Taking into account all beginning students, 29 percent received a Pell Grant (table la). About one-third (32 percent) did not receive a Pell Grant but received some other type of financial support, and 39 percent did not receive any aid at all. 9 9 :- The proportion of students receiving Pell Grants varied by institution type. Private forprofit less-than-4-year institutions enrolled the highest percentage of beginning students with Pell Grants in 1995-96, 57 percent, more than the percentages found at all the other institution types included in this study (public 4-year institutions: 26 percent; private not-for-profit 4-year institutions: 25 percent; and public 2-year institutions: 25 percent). Private not-for-profit 4-year institutions enrolled the highest proportion of students who did not receive a Pell Grant but received some other type of financial support (56 percent), and public 2-year institutions enrolled the highest proportion of beginning students receiving no financial support (56 percent). Similarly, when only full-time students were taken into account, private for-profit lessthan-4-year institutions enrolled the highest percentage of Pell Grant recipients (57 percent). Also, private not-for-profit 4-year institutions had the largest proportion of nonrecipients who received other aid (58 percent), and public 2-year institutions had the highest percentage of students who received no financial support (45 percent). Table lb displays the proportions of Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients within institution types by level of selectivity. (See appendix B for more detail on the selectivity classification system.) Based on this system of categorization, selective 4-year colleges and universities were less likely to enroll Pell Grant recipients than were less selective 4-year institutions. This was the case among all beginning students as well as among beginning students who attended exclusively full time. Another way to compare these beginning students is to estimate how all Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients are distributed among the institution types (table 2). Among all beginning students, Pell Grant recipients were more likely than nonrecipients to enroll in private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions (21 percent versus 6 percent), and they were less likely to enroll in private not-for-profit 4-year institutions (13 percent versus 16 percent), public 4-year institutions (24 percent versus 27 percent), and public 2-year institutions (39 percent versus 48 percent). Among all full-time beginning students, Pell Grant recipients also were more likely than nonrecipients to enroll in private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions and were less likely to enroll in public 4-year institutions and private not-for-profit 4-year institutions.

In general, private not-for-profit 4year institutions have higher levels of tuition than public 4-year institutions. Public 2-year institutions usually are among the lowest price institutions. Since the Pell Grant is determined in part by the total amount of eligible student expenses, differences in Pell Grant award amounts might be expected among institution types. Table 3 shows that those enrolled at public 2-year institutions received a smaller Pell Grant, on average, than did those enrolled at public 4-year institutions. However, when only full-time students are compared, no differences in Pell Grant awards were detected between public 2-year students and those enrolled in any other institutions. Likewise, for beginning students enrolled at 4-year public and private not-for-profit institutions and private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions no differences were detected in the average amount of Pell Grant dollars they received in 1995-96.  Table 3 also shows that Pell Grant recipients enrolled at private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions received a grant for fewer years, on average, than those enrolled at other institutions. In addition, the average cumulative Pell Grant amount was lowest among this group of students. This is likely due to the shorter degree and certificate programs offered by these institutions, or a tendency on the part of these students to seek other sources of financing in subsequent years. Due in part to having lower incomes, beginning Pell Grant recipients were more likely than beginning nonrecipients to qualify for and receive other types of financial support (table 4a). Compared with nonrecipients, Pell Grant recipients were more likely to receive additional aid in the form of loans (49 percent versus 23 percent), work-study (12 percent versus 5 percent), and non-federal grants (47 percent versus 31 percent). As with all beginning Pell Grant recipients, full-time Pell Grant recipients also were more likely than their nonrecipient counterparts to receive loans, work-study assistance, and nonfederal grant aid. Pell Grant recipients enrolled at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions were more likely than recipients enrolled at other institutions to receive other types of aid including loans and work-study. In addition, private not-for-profit 4-year institutions will often award additional grant aid to lower income students. Indeed, Pell Grant recipients enrolled at such institutions were more likely than nonrecipients to receive other grant aid (among all beginning students: 78 percent versus 65 percent; among full-time students: 81 percent versus 68 percent)."}, {"section_title": "34", "text": "Average total aid received was estimated for beginning students receiving any type of financial aid, and average award amounts were estimated for those who received a loan, workstudy award, or other grant support (table 4b).

The same was not found for beginning students enrolled at private for-profit less-than -4year institutions. No difference was found between Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients in the total amount of aid received. However, Pell Grant recipients received, on average, less loan aid ($3,608 versus $4,192) and other grant aid ($1,661 versus $2,645) compared to nonrecipients. In other words, Pell Grant recipients in private less-than-4-year institutions borrowed less than nonrecipients and also received lower amounts of non-federal grant aid, but no differences in the total amount of aid between Pell recipients and nonrecipients could be detected. Pell Grant program eligibility is based primarily on the student's and/or parents' income for the previous year and Pell Grants are awarded primarily to low-income students. For example, among 1995-96 beginning students 87 percent of Pell Grants were awarded either to dependent students whose parents' incomes were under $45,000 (59 percent) or to independent students with incomes under $25,000 (28 percent).12 Other factors are also taken into account, such as student and parent assets and other family members who are concurrently enrolled in college.

Taking into account only low-and middle-income beginning students, Pell Grant recipients were not as well prepared academically as nonrecipients for postsecondary study. For example, as shown in table 6, among low-and middle-income beginning students enrolled at less-than -4year institutions, Pell Grant recipients were less likely than nonrecipients to have received a high school diploma (77 percent versus 90 percent) and more likely to have received a GED or high school equivalency certificate (17 percent versus 7 percent).

However, at the public institutions (2-year and 4-year public institutions), no differences were detected between full-time recipients who received loan aid and those who did not.14 13The lack of statistical evidence showing a difference in persistence rates between Pell Grant recipients and non-recipients enrolled at private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions may be due to the small sample sizes of these two groups. \"While it appears as though borrowers in public 2-year institutions were less likely than nonborrowers to leave postsecondary education (28 versus 38 percent) and more likely to stop out or transfer down (35 versus 23 percent), there was not enough statistical evidence to draw this conclusion."}, {"section_title": ".)", "text": "Three-Year Persistence and Attainment Table 14.Percentage distribution of 1995-96 low-and middle-income beginning postsecondary students enrolled at less-than-4-year institutions according to their enrollment status in 1998, by receipt of Pell Grant and first institution type 'Percentage of students who were continuously enrolled at the same institution or made immediate lateral or upward transfers to other institutions. 2 Percentage who made downward transfers (for example, transferring from a 4-year institution to a less-than-4-year institution) or left for more than 4 months and then returned (i.e., stopped out). 3 Includes public 2-year and private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions.

However, many of the characteristics analyzed, such as income level and the types of institutions attended, are interrelated. A multivariate analysis was conducted to determine the commonality of relationships among these variables with the rates of persistence among beginning students. See appendix B for a detailed description of the method used. The multivariate analysis was limited to full-time, low-and middle-income beginning postsecondary students. It analyzed how likely these students were to remain enrolled continuously at an institution of the same or higher level while controlling for the covariation of the following variables: receipt of Pell Grant, gender, race/ethnicity, age, income level (low versus middle), parents' highest level of education, institution type first attended, high school completion, delayed enrollment, employment status, dependency status, number of dependents other than spouse, and single parent status.16 The results of the multiple regression analysis are shown in table 17. The first column includes the unadjusted percentages, which are the percentages of full-time, low-and middleincome beginning students who remained enrolled at the same or higher level institution before adjusting for the covariation of all the other independent variables in the model.\" The column with the adjusted percentages includes the expected value for each subgroup after adjusting for covariance among the other variables. Comparisons are made between the subgroup and the reference group (in italics), and all significant differences are designated with an asterisk. The independent variables accounted for 8.5 percent of the variance of remaining enrolled for three years. The unadjusted percentages showed that among all full-time low-and middle-income students, Pell Grant recipients were less likely to remain enrolled continuously at the same or a higher level institution than nonrecipients (53 percent versus 61 percent). This difference was found in part because Pell Grant recipients are more likely than nonrecipients to be enrolled in 16Measures of academic preparation could not be included because they were available only for those enrolled in 4-year institutions. 17Bivariate correlations showed that the effect sizes of the independent variables on the likelihood of remaining enrolled for three years were small, with correlations ranging from .012 to .190.

Students in less-than-4-year institutions are less likely to persist than their counterparts in 4-year institutions (Berkner, Horn, and Clune 2000). However, after adjusting for the covariation among the independent variables in the regression model including institution type, the analysis detected no differences between Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients in their rates of remaining enrolled."}, {"section_title": "43", "text": "Other variables also were associated with persistence prior to the multivariate analysis but were not associated after controlling for covariation of the variables in the table. These include being age 30 or older versus age 18 or younger, enrollment in private for-profit, less-than-4-year institutions versus public 4-year institutions, financial independence versus dependence, having dependents other than one's spouse versus no dependents, and being a single parent versus not being a single parent. The multiple regression analysis revealed that some variables continued to be associated with lower persistence rates relative to the comparison group, both before and after controlling for background variation. These include being Black, non-Hispanic versus White, non-Hispanic; being 20-23 years old versus 18 or younger; having an income in the lowest quartile versus the middle quartiles; attending a public 2-year institution versus a public 4-year institution; not receiving a high school diploma versus having received one; delaying enrollment versus enrolling immediately after high school; and working full-time versus not working. All of these factors continued to be related to persistence after controlling for covariance of the other variables in the table. Two factors that were associated with higher persistence rates relative to the comparison group before controlling for background variation remained so even afterwards. These include having a parent or parents with an advanced degree versus a bachelor's degree and attending a private not-for-profit 4-year institution versus a public 4-year college or university. A few factors that were not originally associated with persistence were later found to be related after adjusting for the covariation of the independent variables in the model. For example, no difference was detected between unadjusted percentages for men and women. However, after controlling for background variation, females were more likely than males to remain enrolled at an institution at the same or higher level. Also, Asian and Pacific Islanders were found to have higher rates of persistence than that of Whites after controlling for related variables but not before. Although it appeared as if there was a difference between the unadjusted percentages, there was not enough statistical evidence to conclude that Asian/Pacific Islanders persisted at a higher rate than White, non-Hispanics before controlling for other variables (70 percent versus 59 percent). Finally, with respect to parents' highest level of education, no difference was detected in the unadjusted persistence rates between those with a parent who had achieved some postsecondary education and those who had a parent with a bachelor's degree (54 percent versus 61 percent). However, after controlling for the covariation of related variables, students who had a parent with a bachelor's degree persisted at a higher rate than those whose parents had completed only some postsecondary education. s,."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "This report described the postsecondary experiences of first-time postsecondary students who received Pell Grants and also addressed how beginning Pell Grant recipients differed from other beginning students in terms of academic and enrollment characteristics and three-year rates of persistence and attainment. First and foremost, because Pell Grant recipients qualify for needbased financial aid, they have demonstrated that they are financially needy. Financial need in itself places students at a disadvantage when compared with middle-and high-income students especially high-income students who are more likely to succeed in postsecondary education. Income, therefore, was controlled to some extent in this study by excluding high-income students when analyzing differences between Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients with respect to their academic preparation and postsecondary outcomes. Even so, low-and middle-income Pell Grant recipients were more disadvantaged than their nonrecipient counterparts in other ways related to persistence: they were more likely to have children, to be single parents, to be financially independent, not to have received a high school diploma, and to have delayed their postsecondary enrollment. Pell Grant recipients also were less likely to have SAT I/ACT composite scores that were in the highest quartile or to have taken a rigorous course curriculum while in high school. Although Pell Grant recipients who began their postsecondary studies in 1995-96 were at a comparative disadvantage in many ways and were less prepared academically than other beginning students, few differences in their rates of persistence were detected when compared to the persistence of nonrecipients. While some differences in the likelihood of remaining enrolled at the same or higher level institution were found between Pell Grant recipients and nonrecipients attending private not-for-profit 4-year institutions, no such differences were found among those enrolled at public 4-year institutions, public 2-year institutions, or private for-profit, less-than -4year institutions. Finally, it appears that Pell Grant recipients have a more difficult time remaining enrolled at private not-for-profit 4-year institutions and private for-profit less-than-4-year institutions if they do not also receive some loan assistance. Among beginning Pell Grant recipients enrolled at private institutions, those who did not also take on a student loan persisted at lower rates than those who did. 6 3 45"}]
