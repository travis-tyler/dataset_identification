The first complete genome sequence of the virus in Bangladesh has been reported (EPI_ISL_437912) by the Child Health Research Foundation (CHRF) on the 15th of May 2020. Since then, more than 250 sequences have been published by several various other institutes in Bangladesh. From the genomic analysis, it has been shown that the size of the SARS-CoV2 genome is approximately 29.8 kb to 29.9 kb (Rahaman et al., 2020; . This enveloped virus consists of polyprotein replicas (ORF1ab), and four structural proteins: spike protein (S), a membrane protein (M), an envelope protein (E), and nucleocapsid protein (N). There are also six accessory proteins encoded by ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and ORF10 predicted as hypothetical proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Wu et al., 2020; Rahaman et al., 2020) . With the availability of complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 strains, researchers are investigating the underlying mechanisms of severity, susceptibility hidden in the sequences (Khailany et al., 2020; Rahaman et al., 2020; Forster et al., 2020; Van Dorp et al., 2020) . In this perspective, Bangladeshi researchers already have done numerous studies on Bangladeshi originated SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences Hasan et al., 2020; Parvez et al., 2020; . Recently, an analysis conducted by Benvenuto et al. in 2020 has revealed that viruses outside China formed a monophyletic clade, suggesting the effectiveness of border measures.

This site contains at least two types of nucleotides (or amino acids), and at least two of them occur with a minimum frequency which is required for the fewest evolutionary changes in the genome. This informative positions are mainly helpful for giving information about evolutionary relationships among studied genomes. Moreover, in the evolutionary analysis this also important as it hypotheses relationships that require the smallest number of character changes is most likely to be correct (https://www.mun.ca/biology/scarr/2900_Parsimony_Analysis.htm).\nMoreover, studies on the SARS-CoV-2 genome have shown insightful information on phylogenetic relationships, mutational frequency, human-to-human transmission, and viral tropism (Lv et al., 2020; Ceraolo et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020) . This genome annotation along with parsimony-informative site analysis of SARS-CoV2 might lead to improved understanding of transmission patterns, changes of behavior, and implementation of effective containment measures.\nIn addition, the characterization of viral epidemiological nature, transmission root, and mutations can provide valuable information for deciphering the mechanisms linked to pathogenesis, immune evasion, and viral drug resistance. Therefore, Parsimony-informative sites, evaluation, and mutation studies can be crucial for the design of new vaccines, antiviral drugs and effective diagnostic tests. In this study, we aim to characterize the genetic variation and, parsimony-informative sites along with deletion and insertion site in circulating complete Acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences A total of 245 complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences of Bangladeshi origin, was submitted in the GISAID between 18 April and 30 July 2020 and were included in this study. Along with the complete genome sequences of 245 strains, with their date of collection and the patient's history, 35 reference genomes were selected based on the BLAST hit of the selected genomes (Supplementary Table 1 ). Partial genomes or genomes with unusually high variants including gaps or genome without a complete history of the patients/sampling place/collection date weren't considered in this study. Moreover, genome sequences containing with legionary characters (N, R, X, and Y) other than A, T, G, and C were also excluded from the analysis.

After considering all the exclusion criteria, 175 unique SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence from eight different divisions (Dhaka, Sylhet, Chattogram, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Khulna, Barisal, and Mymenshing) in Bangladesh was investigated in this study (Supplementary Table 1 ). An MP phylogenetic tree was constructed in order to choose and identify potential and representing (Figure 1 ). The tree also revealed that the Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 sequences differ from the reference sequence, NC_045512 (mark as red) of Wuhan, China followed by splitting into many sub-lineages, which are represented by different branches. Each branch of the tree ends with a cluster or a single sequence whereas closely related genome sequences were grouped in clusters (BAN 1 to BAN 5). For example, three Bangladeshi genome sequences were located in a BAN 2 group which originated in/ with genomes mainly from Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. Cluster BAN3 and BAN4 contain sequences were closely related to sequences from France, Germany, India, USA and, Brazil ( Figure 1 ). Moreover, five sequences of Cluster BAN5 revealed mixed matching with the sequences from other countries of Asia, Europe and, Latin America. Most interestingly, group 1 (BAN 1) contained only sequences from Bangladeshi origin. We also found that some genome sequences, although isolated during the different months (April/ May/ June/ July) and from different areas, were still closely related and therefore grouped in the same cluster ( Figure 2 ). From figure 2, we have found that in some cases a few circulating strains might cluster with the same strain circulating in this area which is indicated by the green circle in figure 2 where all isolates from Dhaka are clustering in the same clade. But intra distribution was also present (Sylhet and Rajshahi or Chattogram, Rajshahi, and Mymenshing isolate merged) which was indicated by the red line in figure 2. Our result also suggests that the circulating viral invading occurred independently or in clustery in every divisional region of Bangladesh (Figure 3 )."}, {"section_title": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f", "text": "We found 26 parsimony-informative sites in which nine of them were important (Figure 4 ) in conducting non-synonymous changes into the genome.

As a consequence of it, more than 103,770 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 has been screened around the world to reveal the hidden footprint in to the circulating genome and find the easiest possible solution to stop the ongoing deadly pandemic as soon as possible. Unfortanuntly till now there is no available vaccine against COVID-19 and the high error rate during RNA synthesis provides RNA genomes high mutation rates (Duffy, 2018) . As a result of a higher mutation rate, effective vaccine design against RNA virus needs a close genomic analysis of all circulating strains. In immuno-modulations (Li et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Furthermore, several deletion mutations in ORF7a and ORF8 have also been observed in the analysis which have greater impact on viral host adaptation followed by transmission and replication (Su et al., 2020 (Khailany et al., 2020) , due to their high sequence conservation. So diagnosis of the SARS-CoV-2 might be hampered by any kind of influential changes in targeted genes (Khailany et al., 2020) . In our study among all the studied genomic diagnostic assay, 5 sets of genomic diagnostic assay contain the mismatches in the targeted genomic portion which is partially supported by the study of Khan et al. in 2020 who reported mismatches in 7 sets of genomic diagnostic assay out of 27 studied assays (Supplementary Table 2 ) which could affect the diagnostic procedure in Bangladesh. Therefore, mutation profiles of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the country should be taken into account.\nAs SARS-CoV-2 genomes spread, they leave footprints behind (mutations) allowing us to trace them. From this footprint, we have found that mutational frequency in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 genome in Bangladesh is fluctuating over time which is supported by another recent study by It is feasible to complement the conventional approach with genome sequencing in an unbiased way. This fight against ongoing deadly COVID-19 pandemic will be a long one until we develop an effective treatments.
