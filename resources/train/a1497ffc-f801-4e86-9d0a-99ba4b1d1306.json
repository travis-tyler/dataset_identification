The SOFRA study was undertaken in response to specific questions about the sustainability of southern forest management. These different objectives are reflected in the aspects of the forest resource and markets given emphasis in the two studies and in the methods of modeling and projection. Nonetheless, many of the basic functions of the projection components are essentially identical in the two studies, though the details of their methods differ. This can be seen in a comparison of the flow charts ( Figure 1 ) used to summarize projection methods in the two studies. The Subregional Timber Supply (SRTS) model in SOFRA plays the same role as the North American Pulp and Paper Model-Timber Assessment Market Model (NAPAP-TAMM) modules in the RPA, establishing the equilibrium of demand and supply for timber and deterrnining the associated stumpage prices. Inventory is updated for harvest and growth in the SRTS Inventory Model in SO-FRA and by the Aggregate Timberland Assessment System (ATLAS) module in the RPA. Projections of timberland area and the area of pine plantations are handled by the Empirical Plantation Allocation Model and Timberland Allocation Model in SOFRA (Figure l) . The same role is played by the land use and land cover area projection (AREACHANGE) module in the RPA. Outputs of these latter modules feed back to the inventory projector in both cases.

SOFRA and RPA used similar basic approaches to address these issues, first projecting changes in major land uses to produce future timberland area estimates, then projecting changes in forest cover types (e.g., planted pine) on the timberland base. SOFRA employed a timberland allocation approach described by Wear (2002) to project land allocation among timber and other uses and an empirical plantation allocation model to project areas of timberland allocated to planted pine and other forest types (Prestemon and Abt 2002) . In the RPA, the AREACHANGE module projected area changes for both land uses and land cover types (AIig and Butler 2004, Alig et al. 2003) .\nThe RPA and SOFRA both rely on econometric models for projections of area change by major land use. In the SOFRA model, allocation of land between urban and rural uses is driven by population density and personal income. Allocation of rural land between agricultural and forest uses is influenced by returns to crops, returns to grazing, agriculture costs, land quality, and timber prices. The core land-use model in SOFRA is based on land-use patterns recorded in 1982, 1987, and 1992 In both the RPA and SOFRA models, timber price influences land-use decisions and is represented by the softwood sawtimber price (see Hardie et al. 2000, p. 665-666, and Ahn et al. 2002) . These prices rise in both studies. As shown in Table 1 and Figure 3 , the rate of composite softwood timber price growth-the volume weighted average of sawtimber and pulpwood-from 1995 to 2040 is slightly negative in the RPA projection. This results, however, from offsetting movements in the sawtimber and pulpwood components. In fact, growth in the sawtimber component alone is about f0.996. In SOERA, the weighted sawtimber-pulpwood average grows at about 1.2% and the sawtimber and pulpwood components are both increasing.\nThe impact of timber price changes on the land-use projections in both models depends on the responsiveness of land-use decisions to prices-the elasticity of land use and type changes to timber price. In the RPA model for the urbanlforest interface, no statistically significant response to timber prices was found, while the forest/agriculture interface had a price elasticity of 0.1 ( Ahn et al. 2002) . In SOFRA, in contrast, the elasticity of timberland area to timber price was about 0.3 (Prestemon and Abt 2002, Both studies develop estimates of timberland area by private ownership class for five forest management types (planted pine, natural pine, mixed oak-pine, upland hardwood, and bottomland hardwood) that are partially dependent on timber prices determined within the respective models. SOFRA's empirical plantation allocation model determines the number of acres of pine that would be planted given softwood prices and other factors.

Projec-' Both SOFRA and RPA project strongly rising population and income tions of the nonforest drivers of these land-use price varied by owner, with elasticities of 0.60 for forest industry and 1.80 for nonindustrial private forestland (NIPF) owners. These elasticities were intended to reflect landowners' reactions to broad investment stimuli in the tree-planting decision. RPA used a forest type change accounting matrix to reflect period-to-period transitions among the five forest management types under various forms of disturbance (such as harvest) or absence of disturbance. For NIPF owners, the eiasticity of area planted to pine with respect to timber prices was 0.87, and zero for industrial owners. Timber harvest was also an important determinant of area trends for planted pine in the RPA mode1 based on analysis by Kline et al. (2002) . As a result, timber harvesi projections from other RPA modules feed into the AREACHANGE process as shown in Figure "}, {"section_title": "Growth and Yield", "text": "The timber inventory projection models used in the two studies simulated the growth, management, harvest, and regeneration of timberland in private ownership. The models differ in requirements and form, but they recognize the same basic factors shaping future growth. Both studies stratified the starting inventory by five forest management types, both called 1995 the starting year, and in both studies the starting inventory and several of the growth parameters were derived from the field data collected by FIA. The timber models incorporated projections of area by forest type from the area change models, both used assumptions about the level of investment in future forest management to influence growth rates, and in both models the wood fiber requested through a demand model was converted to an allocation of harvest across the inventories."}, {"section_title": "SOFRA Approach", "text": "In the subregional timber supply (SRTS: Abt et al. 2000 , Sendak et al. 2003 ) inventory model, projections were based on a set of empirically derived yields representing the average growth for each forest management type and ownership. To reflect the faster growth associated with investments in timber management, the average yields were $djusted upward over time, increasing growth and subsequent volume. The multiple regimes and yields described in the SOFRA report (Siry 1998 (Siry ,2002 were originally derived for ATLAS as part of the RPA (though they were not implemented directly in SOFRA SRTS).\nThe SOFRA planted pine growth rate was assumed to increase as a result of investment in improved silvicultural practices and advances in tree growing technology. Two rates were assumed: a high rate (H) amounting to a 75% increase for FT owners and a 37.5% increase for the NIPF ownership, and a low rate (L) amounting to a 50% increase for FI and a 25% increase for NIPF owners (these were considered lower bound estimates of potential increases, see Prestemon and Abt 2002) . The increases were linear, starting in 1995 and reaching the maximum by 2040."}, {"section_title": "RPA Approach", "text": "The aggregate timberland assessment system (ATLAS; Mills and Kincaid 1992) projected inventory similar to SRTS, following the assumption that intensifying management would lead to increases in forest growth and that growth on industrial lands would increase faster than growth on NTPF lands. Unlike SRTS, ATLAS allowed for multiple yield options (or silvicultural regimes) for each forest type. Increasing the growth rate in ATLAS was accomplished by shifting regenerated area to higher yielding silvicultural regimes. These regimes originated in working sessions coordinated by the Southern Forest Resource Assessment Consortium and were incorporated into surveys of industrial forest managers and state foresters whose responses were used as a basis for the projections of management (Moffat et al. 1998, American Forest and Paper Association 1999) . It was assumed that most future investment would occur in the planted pine type, and industrial owners were given a broad portfolio consisting of 12 planted pine regimes, while NIPF planted pine was represented with seven regimes. The planted pine yields were developed for ATLAS with the TAUYIELD (Arnateis et al. 1995) projection model (Sky 1998 (Sky ,2002 . Yields for the other softwood and hardwood forest types were derived empirically, similar to those developed for SRTS; however, each had at least one option to invest in some form of improved management (see Haynes 2003) . So the key to changing growth rates in the RPA was the distribution of area among silvicultural regimes. The area enrolled in each regime in the early part of the projection was ba5ed on survey responses; therefore, the initial changes in growth rates under RPA-ATLAS were based on the outlook of managers."}, {"section_title": "Hardwoods", "text": "With 53% of private timberland area classified in either upland or lowland hardwood types, hardwoods are the dominant forest cover in the South. A sizeable amount of hardwood volume is also found in the oak-pine forest type. The studies differ with regard to the hardwood starting inventory volume, with ATLAS 3.4% below the SRTS starting inventory ( Figure 5 ). The ATLAS softwood inventory was higher by 0.5%, the net difference amounting to an additional 4 billion cubic feet (bcf) of fiber above the SRTS starting inventories. This difference was likely due to newer FIA data available to SOmCQ for the states of Georgia (completed in 1998) and Tennessee (completed in 1999) .\nBoth models projected hardwoods based on empirical yields. Unlike the softwood case, however, only a limited set of simple hardwood management regimes was developed for ATLAS. Gains in ATLAS harvest volume per acre under management averaged 11 % for FI and 6% for NIPF owners. Based on the results of the owner surveys, relatively few hardwood acres were actively managed."}, {"section_title": "Markets", "text": "To project timber harvest and prices, SOFRA employed the SRTS Stumpage Supply Model (Abt et al. , Sendak et al. 2003 , a supply-demand model of softwood and hardwood stumpage markets. In the SOFRA application of SRTS, timber demands are aggregated into two species groups (all softwoods, all hardwoods) and the demand curves have fixed elasticities. Demand at stable prices is assumed to expand at about 1.6% per year over the period to 2040, based on results of other studies and long-term 1 historical trends in southern removals. Supply equations explain the behavior of private timberland owners, their harvest responding to price and shifts in inventory with fixed elasticities. Price is established where demand and I supply are equal in a given year."}, {"section_title": "1", "text": "The RPA model considers the simultaneous interaction of regional product and stumpage markets and produces demand information similar in form to that used in SOFRA. The short-term timber demand and supply elasticities used in SRTS were drawn h m earlier RPA studies (see SOFRA 1 Table 13 .1) and are nearly identical to those used in Haynes 1 (2003) . Demand and supply interact in much the same way 1 to determine equilibrium prices and quantities. The primary differences lie in the link of regional timber demands to later stages of processing (markets for solid wood and fiber products). This linkage produces shifts in timber demand over time (like the demand shifts in SRTS noted above) and 1 variation in the demand elasticity for southern timber as well. In particular, the demand for southern timber becomes more elastic'(price changes have a bigger impact) when options for substitution in national product markets expand I as happens, for example, through growth in import supplies and use of substitute products. This possibility is also recognized in the SOFRA report (see Prestemon and Abt 2002, p. 302) , which examines both inelastic (I) and elastic (E) demand projections that might result from different degrees of substitution. result^.^ The projected net timberland area losses are within 0.5 million acres in the RPA and SOFRA M, but shifts of timberland to urban and developed uses differ by more than 5 million acres and gains from agriculture by 6 million acres. With timber price growth in excess of 1% (and nonzero elasticity of the timberland-use share with respect to timber price), SOFRA still projects a larger area of shift from timberland to urban uses than RPA. This result may reflect differing sensitivities in the underlying land-use models to income and population trends (in the RPA model the elasticities of urban share with respect to income and population may be lower and the urban share is not influenced by timber price movements). Differences in land-use shifts from agriculture to timberland, in contrast, may result predominantly from lower price elasticities at this margin (see Table 1 ) and somewhat less rapid sawtimber price growth in the RPA."}, {"section_title": "Projection Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Timberland and Planted Pine Area", "text": "Both RPA and S O W I H projections show sizable increases in the area of planted pine within the timberland base.

SOFRA plantation elasticities with respect to timber price are higher than RPA's for both industrial and NIPF owners, and SOFRA's composite timber price rises somewhat more rapidly than RPA's sawtimber price. These differences would be consistent with the direction of the plantation area differences between the RPA and SOFRA IH cases. But even with limited price growth, as in the EH case, SOFRA still shows a plantation area gain more than one-third o f that in the M case and more than half of the RPA increment."}, {"section_title": "Prices", "text": "Projections of prices from the SOFRA IH (base) and EH cases and the RPA base are shown in Figure 2 for softwoods and hardwoods. In the RPA, sawtimber and pulpwood markets are reported separately. SOFRA reports an aggregate of sawtimber and pulpwood prices (see Prestemon and Abt 2002, p. 319) . To compare price projections, we constructed volume-weighted average prices from the separate RPA pulpwood and sawtimber results. The aggregate W A and SOFRA softwood (El) base case prices diverge after 2010. SOFRA prices grow at about 1.2% per year, while the aggregated RPA prices decline slightly. A s noted above, however, the RPA aggregate comprises a sawtimber component that grows rapidly until 2015 and a pulpwood portion that falls until 2030 (see Figure 2 ). The source of the difference in behavior of the price aggregates between the studies lies in part in the higher effective elasticity of demand for southern timber emerging h m the RPA model compared to the fixed inelastic demand used in the SOFRA IH case. The R P A projects rising off-shore supplies of both softwood lumber and pulp and paper commodities that compete directly with US products. This substitution acts to increase the long-term elasticity of demand for southern softwood timber, pushing pulpwood prices down and slowing growth in sawtimber prices.\nWould we observe price projections similar to the RPA base with higher softwood demand elasticity in SOFRA? SOFRA developed projections under two elasticity values, with the elastic case 10 times larger than the inelastic base case. Figure 2 shows the aggregate softwood timber price resulting from the EH projection. The RPA base projection cycles around this line (the cycles come from other demandshifting developments in the RPA model), but clearly the general trends in prices are much closer with this higher demand elasticity.\nThe same observations regarding demand elasticities apply to hardwoods. Projected hardwood lumber demand conditions in the W A follow past trends a n d there is no expectation of emerging new domestic o r off-shore supplies. Low and stable demand elasticities would be consistent with this lumber market outlook. On the pulp and paper side, however, hardwood pulpwood demand faces the same competition effects from imports as softwood pulpwood and hence a higher elasticity. The net volume-weighted result for both sawtimber and pulpwood produces an RPA hardwood price trajectory that is roughly a blend of the SOFRA Figure 2) . RPA hardlonger term, when substitution is less marked but demand wood prices track the EH case in the first two decades when continues to grow, RPA prices shift upward more in line volume growth is low and substitution is most rapid.

For softwoods, SOFRA IH base removals are higher than the RPA base and grow faster over the projection (1.0% per year versus 0.8% from 2000 to 2040). The higher demand elasticity in the SOFRA EH case, however, produces a slower rate of growth (+0.7% per year), and, as with prices, the RPA projection cycles around the SOFRA EH trend. Removals in 2040 are 1.9 bcf higher than in 1995 in the SOFRA EH projection compared to a 2.2 bcf increase in the RPA base.\nHardwood removal levels in both studies rise, at 0.9% per year for the SOFRA IH and 0.5% for the RPA. The 1995 levels differ by nearly 1.0 bcf, however, and both studies differ from the 1996 Southwide removals totals reported in Smith et al. (2001) . Because the demand and supply relations in the two studies are each calibrated to their own data sets, the initial removals difference has little impact on price projections. Over time, however, the higher levels in the RPA lead to a more rapid onset of declining hardwood inventories. The cause of the differences in 1996 relates to the sources of data used in the two studies. SOFRA derives initial removals estimates directly from the FIA inventory database. Some of SOFRA's inventories are more recent than those used in Smith et al. (2001) and none were adjusted to Southwide totals in a common year using the same procedures as in Smith et al. (2001) . RPA historical removals, in contrast, were derived by working backward from product output to roundwood equivalents. This process leads to differences from the inventory-based harvest data and from Smith et al. (2001) due to different conversion factors for products and the inclusion of some classes of products not directly represented in the harvest data in the past (hardwood log and chip exports and domestic pulpwood consumption for OSB)."}, {"section_title": "Softwood Growth and Inventory", "text": "Despite differences in removals between the studies, both reports expect rising softwood growth and increasing inventories, due to more area devoted to pine plantations and to the maturation of large areas of timberland regenerated in the recent past (see Figure 4) . Based on its growth adjustments for management intensification, SRTS softwood growth under the IH scenario shows a steady increase of 4.0-4.5% per 5-year period. The ATLAS growth increase is uneven. Rapid investment in plantations and other forms of more intensive management raise growth at the start of the projection, but these effects subside a s prices stabilize after 2015. The rise in growth falls from a 6% increase per 5-year period in 2015 to 2% per period in 2025. In contrast, growth in SRTS increases steadily and beyond 2030 the IH growth projection exceeds ATLAS. In spite of their very different approaches, however, the total cumulative growth projected by SRTS was just 0.7% higher than that projected by ATLAS. Private softwood inventory projections are shown in Figure 5 . With comparable growth and lower removals, the RPA projection exceeds SOFRA after 2015."}, {"section_title": "Growth Model Differences-A Simulation Experiment", "text": "Future inventory projections are the net result of starting inventory estimates, projected removals, area change, removals adjustments for area change, and projected growth. We can account for differences in starting inventory, removals, and projected area between the t w o studies ( Figure  3 and Table I ), but the growth projections and adjustments in removals for area change are determined by mechanisms (and assumptions) within the SRTS and ATLAS growth models. Are the effects of these model differences sufficient to account for significant differences in projected growth and inventory? We examined this question i n an experiment in which we ran the ATLAS model with SOFRA M rebasic yield tables or yield projections, (ii) how the two movals and area projections.3 In this projection (called models account for any volume capture when timberland ATLAS IH2), the key differences remaining are: (i) the area is lost, and (iii) how (and how much) they expand growth due to assumed investment trends in private timber Imposing the IH removals and area change scenario on ATLAS produced a new softwood inventory projection that was significantly below the others ( Figure 5 ). With lower growth (see Figure 4) , ATLAS IH2 was not able to meet the higher IH removals in all periods (there was insufficient merchantable volume). This can be seen in Table 2 as the difference between the sum of softwood removals for ATLAS 1 ' 2 and SOFRA IH. This suggests that there are important differences between the two growth models. We think there are four main contributing factors.\nBecause both models use yield tables as the basic drivers of growth projection, and since the ATLAS IH2 growth and inventory projections for both softwoods and hardwoods are below SOFRA IH levels, there is some likelihood that SRTS yields are higher than those in ATLAS.\nThere are differences in the structure and stratification of the starting inventory. SOFRA made use of updated versions of the Georgia and Tennessee inventories that were not available for the RPA Assessment. The starting softwood inventories contain nearly identical volume, but their distributions by age are different, which would influence growth.\nThe modeling methods used to increase forest growth to reflect intensification of management are different. The growth increase in ATLAS was achieved by regenerating stands under higher yielding silvicultural regimes. As a result, the impacts of investments are lagged, requiring 10-20 years to affect the available wood supply. In SRTS, a factor was applied to growth that acted to increase yield on all existing stands, affecting all age classes. This increase was initially small, but the approach gives an immediate boost to timber volumes available for harvest. Over time, these two techniques create different age class structures because removals in the first periods of the projection would impact the inventory differently. Each growth increase in SRTS would, in effect, lower the area required to obtain a specified volume, leaving additional unharvested stands to grow before the next round of h e s t . The growth increase in ATLAS did not impact mature inventories for several periods. In the interim, cutting affects a larger area to achieve the same volume. This acted initially to shift the ATLAS age distribution toward younger classes.\nFinally, the softwood projections differ in part because the internal mechanisms used to handle area change differ between the models. Although the projected net change in southern timberland is less than 2% between 1995 and 2040, the \"gross\" movement of areas h and out of timberland and across forest types is much larger. The total area involved in gains and losses (the gross area turnover) amounts to over 15% of the timberland base. For area shifted out of timber production, ATLAS is configured to allow for some inventory to leave the base intact and not be used. This \"leakage\" can be seen by comparing the difference between the 1995 and 2040 inventories with the sum of growth minus the sum of harvest over the 1995-2040 period in Table 2 . The ATLAS-projected inventory change is smaller than the difference between the growth and harvest because some volume is lost when land shifts to urban and other uses, roughly 3 bcf? Doing the same calculation with SRTS growth and removals produces nearly the opposite result; there is about a 3 bcf gain in the inventory volume not explicitly accounted for in the reported growth or removals. Considering this, there is a difference in methods between the studies that helps to account for a total spread of about 6 bcf in softwood inventories between the two projections in 2040 (121.3 BBF for SOFRA IH versus 107.6 BBF for ATLAS IH from Table 2 ). Elimination of this difference alone would reduce the gap between the two estimates of inventory by half."}, {"section_title": "Hardwood Projections", "text": "Despite differences in absolute removals levels, both studies expect hardwood removals to rise and hardwood growth to decline. Hardwood inventory trends, however, are markedly different, with S O W rising and RPA falling ( Figure 5 ). Significant differences between the studies also exist for the initial period (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) inventory estimate, which persist in the projections. As in the case of softwoods, three key components influence the hardwood inventory projections: timberland area, removals, and growth.\nThe hardwood area projections for each study are relatively close; both showing reductions. The difference in removals is more pronounced, resulting from different methods for computing removals. Between 1995 and 2040, the cumulative RPA removals are 13% higher than those projected in SOFRA IH. This amounts to 22 bcf by 2040, a sizable difference, but by itself not enough to account for the gap in inventories. A further portion derives from growth. It can be seen that at the start of the projection, the SOFRA growth projection exceeds the RPA projection by about 9%. Over the full projection, cumulative hardwood growth in SOFRA is 12% higher than in the RPA. This amounts to about 12 bcf of additional inventory, which when combined with the difference in removals accounts for 89% of the 2040 inventory difference. The remainder can be attributed to the mechanisms for handling area change and slight differences in area. Management change did not play a significant role in the ATLAS hardwood projection (the growth rate in hardwood types increased by just 3%) and SRTS applied no increases to hardwood growth."}, {"section_title": "Hardwood Projections Under M 2", "text": "Projections with the RPA ATLAS model using SOFRA IH removals and area bring the inventory projections closer together ( Figure 5 and Table 2 ), but they do not converge.\nBy 2040, the ATLAS IH2 inventory projection is 14% below SOFRA IH. Growth and area change were again part of the difference. Under IH2, ATLAS growth fell consistently below the RPA base ( Figure 4 ) and overall totaled 6.7% less growth than SRTS (Table 2) . Volume losses associated with hardwood area change accounted for another 4 bcf of the differen~e.~ The final piece of the difference in the hardwood projections is the gap in starting inventories. The newer Tennessee inventory may have made the most difference, where ATLAS began with 3.3% less hardwood volume than SRTS. and urban uses, however, differ substantially. Because the lands involved in these inter-use shifts are located in different regions and have different forest production potentials, underlying differences in the details of land area change can have important impacts on projected future timber supply, despite the similarity of the net timberland area losses. Type Change and Pine Plantation Establishment: How Sensitive Are These Decisions to Timber Price?\nRPA and SOFRA employed additional models to explain the distribution of timberland area across forest types and the management decisions to invest in pine plantation establishment. Again the sensitivity of projections to the various determinants, particularly timber price, differs between the models. In particular, for industrial owners, the RPA type change and plantation decisions involved only projected timber harvest and past type conversion trends, while SOFRA's projections were sensitive as well to projected timber price. With roughly similar softwood sawtimber price trends in the RPA base and SOFRA IH cases, the plantation area projections differ by about 50%. Timber Demand and Substitution: Demand Elasticity Is Critical to Results.\nComparisons of the softwood and hardwood timber price projections across the studies amply illustrate the importance of assumptions about the effects of substitution on future price behavior. Extensive substitution of imported fiber products for domestic production in the RPA projection depresses demand growth for southern pulpwood and lowers the pulpwood price projection. This pulls the projected aggregate (volume-weighted average) price of southern softwood timber down as well, despite rising sawtimber prices through 2015. This same behavior is observed in comparing the SOFRA I H and EH projections with a 10-fold expansion in demand elasticity."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "Inventory and Removals Data: Basic Inputs Are Not Always Five major areas of contrast emerge from our review of the Same SOFRA and RPA methods and results: five differences Although both studies use USDA Forest Service HA between the studies that have important impacts on their smey data for inventories, the vintages of the surveys projections of future southern timber supply. varied, with SOFRA having the most recent results. In a Timberland Area: Gross As Well As Net Changes Matter.\nBoth studies use state-of-the-art, well-documented approaches to model future trends in the private timberland base and their response to population, income, and relative land rents in various uses. As a result of differing methods and data, some of these responses, such as the elasticities of area allocation to urban and forest uses with respect to timber prices, differ significantly. With comparable inputs on population and income growth and nearly comparable projections of the critical softwood sawtimber price, the land base models reach roughly similar conclusions on the net loss of private timberland over the period to 2040 (comparing RPA base and SOFRA M). The gross shifts of land between agriculture and forestry and between forestry This is the difference in Table 2 between the change in inventory (0.92 bcf) and the excess of growth over removals in the projection (4.97 bcf). It is harvestable volume not captured when hardwood timberland changes uses or is converted to softwoods. region of rapid growth and shorter rotations, this difference in starting points can have important impacts on projections. The studies also differed in the methods used to estimate historical removals. The effects of this difference are particularly marked in the case of hardwoods, with RPA removals consistently higher than SOFRA. This suggests the need for vigilance in future studies to insure that removals data are computed in comparable ways. Growth Projection: Treatment of the Components o j f Growth I s Important.\nMethods of growth projection differ between the studies. The ATLAS IH2 experiment indicates that these differences can lead to sizable effects, even when timberland area (and type) change and removals levels are the same in both models. The experiment suggests that basic SRTS yields may be higher than those in ATLAS. Results also highlight the importance of assumptions about the effects of changing management investment and how it would impact current and future growth. With large areas of land moving into nonforest uses in the South, the assumed disposition of volumes on these areas (how much is captured for product use) is also seen to be of significance in projecting inventory trends.\nIn offering these observations, it has been our intent to aid potential users of the SOFRA and RPA studies in interpreting and understanding differences and cornrnonalities in the projections. We believe that comparison of the two studies, in light of the information presented in this article, can yield a useN view of the potential variation in the South's timber supply outlook and some of the key sources of uncertainty in future harvests."}]
