Between the year 2000, when AMS conducted its fi rst comprehensive national survey of farmers markets, and the end of 2005, the number of farmers markets in the United States increased 43 percent, from 2,863 to 4,093, an average growth rate of 8.6 percent a year. As a result of the massive expansion in the number of farmers markets since 2000, nearly 30 percent of all seasonal markets are less than 5 years old and most still appear to be establishing themselves economically. Managers of these young markets reported monthly sales only half the national average of all markets. They also reported fewer vendors (22 compared with a national average of 31) and fewer customers per week (430 compared with a national average of 959). The large percentage of young markets explains in part why the growth in the number of farmers markets is not mirrored by a corresponding growth in sales. Total farmers market sales in 2005 are estimated to have slightly exceeded $1 billion, compared with $888 million in 2000, an average annual growth rate of 2.5 percent. To ensure the scope of the study included only markets engaged primarily in direct-to-consumer retail sales, it was restricted to farmers markets that relied on direct sales to consumers for 51 percent or more of their revenue, a restriction that may have resulted in a conservative overall sales estimate. Despite some slippage in the volume of sales per market site between 2000 and 2005, the number of farmers participating in farmers markets still appears to have increased signifi cantly. The average number of vendors per market, weighted for regional differences, increased from 27 in 2000 to 31 in 2005. Market managers reported in 2005 that 25.1 percent of vendors used their farmers market as the only outlet for their farm products. It is interesting to note that the percentage of minority vendors at farmers markets was higher than the percentage of minority farmers in the general farming population. More than 11 percent of vendors at farmers markets were reported to belong to minority groups, compared with 4.8 percent in the general farming population, as reported in the 2002 Census of Agriculture. 1 The disparity is particularly striking considering that the Far West region, which features more ethnic diversity in the farming population than the rest of the country (Figure 33), was somewhat underrepresented in our 2005 survey. Farmers markets appear to represent a particularly important marketing channel for minority growers, perhaps because of the low cost of market entry or the volume of product needed to participate, or because the specialized merchandise they grow lends itself well to direct sales outlets. The average number of customers at farmers markets per week declined slightly from 1,055 customers per week, reported in 2000, to 959 customers per week, reported by managers in 2005. Nevertheless, the decline in the average number of customers was somewhat offset by the 43 percent growth in the number of farmers markets between 2000 and 2005. Seasonal farmers markets remain the predominant market type in the United States. Approximately 88 percent of respondents reported they operated seasonal markets, open, on average, 4.5 months per year. As might be expected, seasonal markets that were open for 6 or fewer months per year attracted fewer vendors and generated less revenue than farmers markets open 7 months or more. Markets open 6 months or less reported an average of 25 vendors, with sales of $20,770 per month, and serving 565 customers weekly. Markets open 7 months or more reported an average of 51 vendors, with $57,290 in monthly market sales and serving 942 customers weekly. Year-round markets reported more than three times the sales of markets operating 6 months or less, had more than twice the number of vendors, and slightly more than six times the number of weekly customers. On the other hand, seasonal farmers markets that operated for 7 or more months performed similarly to markets that were open 12 months per year. Year-round markets reported an average of 58 vendors, had monthly market sales of $69,497, and served 3,578 customers weekly. Location appears to be a critical factor in market performance. Most market managers reporting high monthly sales were in densely populated urban areas. This observation is based on the rural-urban continuum code 2 for the locations of markets that responded to the survey. The most successful farmers markets in terms of sales were located on the coasts. The Far West and Mid-Atlantic regions reported average monthly sales of at least twice that of other regions-$56,742 and $41,452 respectively. The sales of the remaining regions clustered around $23,000 a month. The number of customers per week, as reported by region, somewhat mirrored monthly sales per market regionally. The Far West and Mid-Atlantic regions were again the top two regions, reporting 1,964 and 974 customers per week respectively. The North Central Region was a close third, reporting 856 customers weekly, and the remaining regions around 700 customers per week. Markets that sold organic products 3 reported larger numbers of weekly customers, larger number of vendors, and larger monthly market sales at their markets. Both seasonal and year-round markets that sold organic products performed better than markets that did not. Seasonal markets that sold organic products reported average monthly market sales of $34,715 and 854 customers per week. Seasonal markets that didn't sell organic products reported $11,812 in monthly market sales and served 394 customers per week. Similar results were reported by year-round markets-those that sold organic products reported monthly market sales of $92,349 and 4,344 customers weekly; those that did not reported $41,584 and 2,590 customers. Seventy-one percent of markets that sold organic products were located in urban areas, compared with only 55 percent of markets that did not. 4 These relationships held true for markets that sold organic products regionally, except for the Northeast region that reported markets without organic products were more often located in urban areas than markets that sold organic products. However, in spite of this one inconsistency, Northeast markets that sold organic products had more customers and vendors, and higher monthly market sales than markets in other regions across the Nation. Government programs had varying degrees of impact on vendor sales at farmers markets. The Women, Infants, and Children Farmers Market Nutrition Program (WIC FMNP) had the largest effect, showing average monthly sales of $1,744 nationwide and 61 percent participation. Senior Farmers Market Nutrition program (SFMNP) average sales were $1,004 per month and 45 percent of markets reported they accepted SFMNP vouchers. The average Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) 5 sales, which utilize electronic benefi ts transfer (EBT), were a distant third at $279 a month and only 7 percent of markets reported accepting EBT cards. Clearly the WIC FMNP had the greatest impact on vendor sales, both nationwide and regionally. 2. Rural-urban continuum codes are defi ned in Appendix 2: Rural-Urban Continuum Codes. 3. Organic foods at farmers markets means that the products were labeled organic. The survey did not ask whether the organic foods sold were USDA \"certifi ed organic\" products. 4. Urban areas are defi ned as counties with a rural-urban continuum code between 1 and 3. Counties outside of metro areas have rural-urban continuum codes between 4 and 9. 5. Formally titled the Food Stamp Program. To achieve the most accurate survey results possible, the Agricultural Marketing Service's Marketing Services Division (MSD) staff attempted to reach each farmers market manager listed in the USDA National Farmers Market Directory to verify contact information and update it as necessary prior to embarking on the 2006 National Farmers Market Survey. The Directory was used as the initial source of contact information for farmers market managers because it was the most comprehensive national listing of farmers markets available. In addition to calling market managers, each State's farmers market representative was contacted by e-mail and asked to provide an updated listing for the farmers markets in the State. The resulting updated database, containing contact information for 3,575 markets, was the primary distribution list for this survey. Through a cooperative agreement with Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, MSD staff developed a Webbased survey instrument to capture responses from farmers market managers effi ciently and effectively. Market managers were invited by e-mail to complete the survey questionnaire, either on-line or by mail. AMS provided market identifi cation numbers and passwords to prevent the possibility of double counting, and respondents were allowed access to the survey website only if they furnished a unique identifi cation number and password. The survey website also allowed market managers not contacted by letter to register their markets and obtain identifi cation numbers and passwords allowing them to participate in the survey. As a result, an additional 168 farmers markets not on the original master list were registered on the survey website. A total of 3,743 farmers market managers were invited to participate in the national survey, representing 85.4 percent of the 4,385 farmers markets in the U.S. during the 2005 season. The effort we made to update the farmers market contact list is illustrated by the highly successful survey response rate of 34.5 percent (1,292 usable responses out of a total of 3,743)."}, {"section_title": "Data Cleaning", "text": "Sales data reported by market managers were trimmed slightly to enable information reported by these markets to be combined with other markets without unduly skewing average sales fi gures.

Our efforts to account for the increased paperwork burden faced by managers of multiple markets by redirecting the survey to a secondary point of contact proved largely unsuccessful. Out of the 965 managers of multiple markets in the population listed on our contact sheet, only 99 responded to the survey-10.3 percent, compared with an average response rate of 34.5 percent.

To comply with this requirement, the survey questionnaire was reviewed by OMB representatives to ensure that the information being collected was important to the public, that the collection of information would not duplicate research that was already being carried out elsewhere, and that recognized and accepted survey research methods would be applied. As part of the review process, fi ve market managers were asked to fi ll out the draft survey and record the time needed to answer the questionnaire. The average completion time was 19 minutes.

By the time the information collection process ended, 3,743 farmers market managers had been contacted. Of this number, 1,292 managers returned usable surveys, a response rate of 34.5 percent. 7 With a response rate of this magnitude, we believe the fi ndings of this survey provide a reasonably comprehensive and accurate picture of recent developments at U.S. farmers markets."}, {"section_title": "Preventing Duplication", "text": "To avoid analyzing duplicate data from individual markets, whenever a market manager requested an identifi cation number and password, a researcher at MSU compared his or her market name and contact information with information already entered into the database. If a questionnaire already had been completed from that market, an identifi cation number and password were not issued and the person requesting the identifi cation number and password was notifi ed that a survey for that market had already been completed. Surveys received by surface mail were also screened to remove duplicates; when duplicates were identifi ed, the appropriate individuals were contacted to resolve the issue and information removed or merged into an existing entry as needed. 7. \"Usable\" refers to respondents that answered more than the preliminary contact information. Farmers markets continue to be a thriving segment of the U.S. agricultural economy. Between 2000 and 2005, the number of farmers markets in the United States increased by 43 percent, from 2,863 to 4,093-representing an annual increase of nearly 9 percent. 8 This indicates that the growth rate of farmers markets, while still brisk, is slowing. As the result of this brisk growth rate, sales at farmers markets increased from $888 million in 2000 to $1 billion for 2005. 9 Because of the massive expansion in the number of farmers markets created between 2000 and 2005, a sizable percentage of surveyed markets (nearly 30 percent of all seasonal markets) were less than 5 years old and may have still been establishing themselves economically. As younger markets tend to have fewer sales than older markets, this may help explain why overall farmers market revenues did not grow as rapidly as the number of markets. Our survey data shows that national average revenues per market in 2005 were $31,923 for each month of operation compared with $15,078 per month for markets less than 5 years old. Furthermore, the farmers markets sector remains heavily predominated by seasonal markets, which also curtails overall sales growth. Almost 88 percent of the managers responding to our survey reported their markets operate only part of the year, and 90.8 percent of seasonal markets operate 6 months or less. As one might expect, there is a sizable difference between sales volumes of markets that operate 6 months or less a year and those that operate more than 6 months a year. Markets open more than 6 months a year had average monthly sales of $57,290 in 2005, while markets that operate fewer than 6 months a year averaged only $20,770 a month. Proximity to densely populated urban centers and number of years in operation also are associated with higher sales volumes. This is described in more detail in \"Infl uence of Population Density on Market Performance\" on page 76. Sales also appear to be enhanced by growing consumer participation in government food assistance programs, the Women, Infants, and Children Farmers Market Nutrition Program (WIC FMNP) and the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP). Both programs are designed to increase the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables to households at risk for food insecurity, while boosting sales of fresh fruits and vegetables. Sixty-one percent of managers reported their markets accepted WIC FNMP vouchers in 2005. USDA's national study of farmers markets conducted in 2000 reported 58 percent of surveyed farmers markets participated in WIC FMNP. In 2005, farmers market managers reported an average monthly sales per market of $1,744, and the 45 percent who said their market accepted SFMNP vouchers, reported an average of $1,004. Given that average sales per market amounted to $31,923 in 2005, WIC FMNP and SFMNP vouchers clearly contribute to farmers market sales, especially in areas where recipients of Federal nutrition benefi ts constitute a sizable proportion of neighborhood residents. 8. The number of farmers markets in 2008 is estimated at 4,685 markets, an increase of 14.5 percent since 2005, at an annual increase of 4.8 percent a year. 9. Annual sales at farmers markets were weighted by the number of markets in each region."}, {"section_title": "Profi le of Survey Respondents", "text": "Markets were grouped into seven regions: the Far West, Rocky Mountain, Southwest, North Central, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast (defi nitions of these regions can be found in Appendix 1: Regional Defi nitions). The only major divergence between the regional distribution of survey respondents and the regional distribution of farmers markets in the United States (based on data found in the AMS National Directory of Farmers Markets) was a 9 percent overrepresentation of markets in the North Central region and a 7 percent underrepresentation in the Far West region. Consequently, we believe our survey sample represents a fairly accurate representation of the national farmers market industry as a whole. Survey response rates from the Far West region appear to have been hampered by the large number of managers in that region who oversee multiple markets. Market managers were asked to complete a separate survey for each market managed. Because of the additional time commitment required to prepare surveys, only 99 managers of multiple markets-slightly more than one in ten-completed this task, compared with the more typical response rate of one in three from managers of single markets. As most managers of multiple markets are in California, we surmise that this contributed in part to the relatively low rate of survey responses from market managers in the Far West region. "}, {"section_title": "Farmers Market Industry Overview", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Age of Markets", "text": "The farmers markets included in the survey had been in operation for an average of 15 years. However, the number is skewed by the 3.5 percent of markets in operation for 50 years or longer; indeed, 14 respondents reported they had been operating for 100 years or more, the oldest for 254 years. Because of these long-running historic markets, a more realistic median age of 10 years may be a closer approximation of actual industry trends. Year-round markets tended to be considerably older than seasonal markets; 43.3 percent of year-round markets were 20 years or older versus 23.7 percent of seasonal markets in the same age category ( Figure 2). In every region of the country, a signifi cant portion of surveyed farmers markets had been established within the previous 5 years, ranging from one-fourth to almost 40 percent of regional totals, suggesting that farmers market growth is a national phenomenon. Leading the pack is the Rocky Mountain region, where managers reported that 38 percent of their markets had been created less than 5 years ago (Figure 3). Because the Rocky Mountain region contains the second lowest number of farmers markets in the country, the recent aggressive growth in this region may refl ect that the region had been underserved by direct marketing outlets compared with other locations. "}, {"section_title": "Vendor Participation", "text": "The average number of vendors at individual farmers markets nationwide in 2005 was 31, ranging from a high of 51 in the Far West region to a low of 18 in the Northeast. The median number of vendors per market ranged from a low of 12 vendors in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions to a high of 35 in the Far West region (Figure 4), while the North Central, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeastern regions reported similar median and mean numbers. This shows a fairly narrow distribution of responses for other regions, such as the Far West, Rocky Mountain and Southwest regions, which had mean numbers of vendors much higher than the median. Consequently, the \"typical number\" in the Far West, Rocky Mountain, and Southwest regions may be more accurately described by the median than the mean.   Figure 5 illustrates that surveyed markets in the Far West and Rocky Mountain regions had a large percentage of markets with many vendors. Almost 43 percent of markets in the Far West region had 40 or more vendors and almost 36 percent of Far West markets reported markets with 20 to 39 vendors. The Rocky Mountain region also reported high concentrations of markets with large numbers of vendors. More than one-third of markets in the Rocky Mountain region had 40 or more vendors. In contrast, the Northeast region reported 6 percent of its markets had 40 or more vendors, and most in the Northeast region (42 percent) had 10 or fewer vendors per market."}, {"section_title": "Vendor Income", "text": "Regardless of location, managers reported that most of their farm vendors earned $5,000 or less each from sales at their markets in 2005. However, the survey data revealed isolated pockets of signifi cant income generation from farmers markets. In the Far West and Mid-Atlantic regions, managers reported that almost 12 percent and slightly more than 15 percent of the vendors at their markets earned gross incomes of between $25,000 and $100,000 in 2005. These two regions reported the largest pockets of vendors with this level of sales. In contrast, the lowest average annual vendor sales were reported by managers in the North Central and Rocky Mountain regions ( Figure 6), both regions reporting more than 80 percent of vendors at their markets had annual sales between $1,000 and $5,000.

On the whole, seasonal markets tended to be younger than year-round markets; 29.2 percent had been operating for 5 years or fewer, compared with only 17.3 percent of year-round markets.   Average annual sales at farmers markets across the United States were $242,581 in 2005, and median annual sales were $40,000. This disparity refl ects the extreme variability in sales per market across regions. Sales can be infl uenced by such variables as size, location, and duration of operation. The disparity refl ects the extreme variability in sales per market across regions. Figure 10 illustrates how annual sales varied across regions, with the highest annual sales per market of $476,733 in the Far West. In contrast, the lowest level of annual sales occurred in the Rocky Mountain region, averaging $90,169 per market.

Nationally, an average of 71.6 percent of vendors at markets sold only what they produced; the median percentage reported was 80.6 percent. Consequently, most vendors at farmers markets were able to capture the entire value of the consumers' food expenditures. The median number of vendors selling only their own products varied from a high of 78 percent in the Southwest region to a low of 60.3 percent in the Rocky Mountain region. Figure 11 illustrates how the percentage of producer only sales varied by region. For each region, the median percentage of vendors selling their own farm products exceeded the mean, implying the average was lowered by the small number of markets reporting an unusually low percentage of vendors selling their own products. Therefore, the median percentage may be a more accurate refl ection of the relative dominance of farmers selling their own agricultural goods at farmers market establishments. Vendors' use of farmers markets as their primary marketing channel appears to have declined slightly since the 2000 survey of the farmers market sector. In 2000, managers reported that 28.5 percent of their vendors used their markets as their sole marketing outlets. In 2005, managers reported that 25.2 percent of vendors used their market as their sole marketing outlets. Nevertheless, farmers markets clearly remain an important marketing channel for participating vendors.

Therefore, monthly sales per market were calculated to account for variation in the length of time a market was open per year. Monthly sales can be compared across markets in the same region and across regions without bias. Average monthly sales at farmers markets nationwide were $31,923 in 2005, and varied widely by region from a high of $56,742 in the Far West to a low of $21,018 in the Southeast (Figure 12). Markets were grouped into four sales categories so the regional concentration of farmers markets with similar sales volumes could be observed ( Figure 13). The Far West region contained the largest concentration of farmers markets with monthly sales of $23,000 or more (45.5 percent). It also featured the lowest concentration of farmers markets with fewer than $2,500 in monthly sales (12.5 percent).

Monthly sales fi gures were calculated again to remove the bias created by analyzing annual sales data for markets that were in operation over different periods of time. Though the gap between sales volumes at seasonal and year-round markets narrowed considerably if average monthly sales fi gures were compared, the volume of sales generated at year-round markets still exceeded sales at seasonal markets ($70,292 per month against $28,836). Managers of seasonal markets in the Far West region reported $55,257 per month, the highest average for any reason. The lowest average sales were reported by the Southwest region, with an average of $13,119 per month ( Figure 15). The Far West, Rocky Mountain, and Mid-Atlantic regions had the largest concentration of markets with sales of $23,000 or greater, and the Southwest, Southeast, and North Central had the largest concentration of markets with monthly sales at or below $2,500 ( Figure 16). Unlike most regions, where older markets have greater sales volumes, younger seasonal markets in the Rocky Mountain and Far West regions are doing unusually well fi nancially, compared with markets of similar age elsewhere in the country. Even though seasonal farmers markets in the Rocky Mountain and Far West regions represented only 10.4 and 13.9 percent of seasonal markets less than 5 years old in 2005, they accounted for 20.0 and 24.0 percent of seasonal markets that generated monthly sales of $23,000 or more (Table 1).

"}, {"section_title": "Product Characteristics", "text": "As one might expect, the most popular category of farm products sold at farmers markets in 2005 was \"fresh fruits and vegetables.\" Nearly 92 percent of managers reported selling fresh fruits and vegetables at their markets, and more than 75 percent reported that their markets sold \"herbs and fl owers\" and \"honey, nuts, and preserves\" (Figure 18). The dominance of fresh produce also could be seen in the mix of market vendors. Fresh produce, fruit, and vegetable vendors comprised 45 percent of farmers market vendors nationwide in 2005 ( Figure 19), followed by vendors selling \"herbs and fl owers\" (15.4 percent), \"honey, nuts, or preserves\" (8.8 percent), \"baked goods\" (8.6 percent), and \"crafts or woodworking\" (8.3 percent). Even though sizable numbers of market managers reported that their markets offered meat and dairy products for sale, the actual number of farmers specializing in these commodity categories at farmers markets appears to be quite limited-only about 3 percent of vendors were reported to sell meat and poultry, and only 1.5 percent were reported to sell milk and dairy products. Organically labeled products were sold at farmers markets across the country, but were considerably more prevalent in the Far West and Northeast regions. Market managers reported that 47.0 percent of markets nationwide sold at least some types of organically labeled products; their availability varied across regions from a high of 74.5 percent in the Far West region to a low of 30.4 percent in the Southwest region ( Figure 20). Product availability still appeared to be heavily concentrated in the Far West, Northeast, and Rocky Mountain regions; in the rest of the country, fewer than 40 percent of markets sold organically labeled items. Year-round markets sold organically labeled products more often than seasonal markets-57 percent compared with only 40 percent of seasonal markets. Most likely, the reason year-round markets more frequently sold organically labeled product is because they served more customers. "}, {"section_title": "Percent", "text": "Markets that sold organically labeled products reported more customers per week, more vendors, and larger monthly sales. However, their superior performance may have been infl uenced as much by their location in densely populated urban areas as by their product offerings. Seventy-one percent of farmers markets that sold organic products were located in urban areas 10 compared with 55.3 percent of markets that didn't offer organic products. Furthermore, a greater percentage of the markets were located in regions of the country, such as the Far West and Northeast, that experience higher than average farmers markets sales volumes (Table 3). Each market responding to the survey was assigned a rural-urban continuum code based on the county in which the market was located. (Rural-urban continuum codes were developed originally by the Offi ce of Management and Budget and were later expanded by USDA's Economic Research Service. Each county in the Nation is assigned a code to describe its degree of rurality 11 or urbanicity.) 10. Urban means that the market was located in a location that had a rural-to-urban continuum code of 1, 2 or 3. The top three product categories sold by farmers markets carrying organically labeled products, illustrated in Figure  19, are \"fresh fruit and vegetables\" (91.4 percent), \"herbs and fl owers\" (46.3 percent), and \"meat and poultry\" (30.1 percent). Participation rates of vendors selling organically labeled items followed similar patterns ( Figure 20); the three highest concentrations of organic vendors at farmers markets were vendors of organically labeled \"fresh fruits and vegetables\" (60.2 percent), \"herbs and fl owers\" (16.7 percent), and \"meat and poultry\" (9.3 percent). Unlike the prevailing trend at most farmers markets, those offering organically labeled products seem to include more meat, poultry, and dairy products as part of their overall merchandise mix, suggesting that farmers market consumers may prefer organically produced varieties of these items. The widespread use of organic labels and other labeling claims on meat and dairy products at farmers markets, such as \"hormone-free,\" \"antibiotic-free,\" \"pasture-raised,\" and \"free range,\" discussed in the next section, suggests farmers market consumers want to be informed about the methods used to produce their meat and dairy purchases. Table 3. Farmers markets that sold organic products compared with markets that did not sell organic products 12. Only markets that reported sales of organically labeled products were included. \n\nGiven the apparent importance of vendor fees to market fi nances, it's not surprising the vast majority of markets nationwide charge vendors fees for selling privileges. Eighty-six percent of surveyed market managers charged participating vendors some type of fee at their markets. The top three fee types imposed by farmers markets were a fl at fee (76.4 percent), a membership fee (26.4 percent), and a calculated fee based on a percentage of vendor sales (13 percent). The percentage use of types of fees can be seen in Figure 41. \nRedemptions of food stamp nutrition benefi ts via EBT terminals in 2005 lagged far behind the level of participation in the WIC FMNP and SFMNP. Only 6.8 percent of surveyed market managers reported their market accepted food stamps for fresh food purchases, and on a regional basis, the use of EBT terminals to accept food stamps at farmers markets ranges from a low of zero in the Southwest region to a high of 15.9 percent in the Far West region ( Figure  56). Consequently, average monthly market sales generated by food stamps averaged only $279 per market site nationwide (Figure 57). The limited food stamp benefi ts via EBT terminals at farmers markets may refl ect in part the rather steep investment cost required to acquire and install a wireless EBT terminal (in the range of $1,000-$1,500), the ongoing maintenance costs and transaction fees involved in operating the terminal, and the complex certifi cation and training required. (To help farmers markets enhance their ability to redeem food stamp benefi ts, Congress recently authorized AMS to set aside 10 percent of Farmers Market Promotion Program funds to help markets acquire wireless EBT terminals.) "}, {"section_title": "Other Label Claims", "text": "In addition to organic label claims, farmers market vendors frequently displayed a variety of such specialty label claims as \"locally grown\" to advertise their merchandise. Sixty-nine percent of surveyed managers reported that vendors at their markets used specialty labels, ranging from a low of 51.3 percent in the Southeast region to a high of 78.8 percent in the Rocky Mountain region (Figure 23). The most popular specialty label claim across the country was \"locally grown,\" with nearly 90 percent of all managers in every part of the country reporting their vendors used the phrase as a labeling claim (Figure 24). Other popular label claims included \"pesticide-free\" or \"chemical-free\" (at nearly half of surveyed farmers markets) and \"natural\" (also at nearly half of surveyed farmers markets). Label claims related to the absence of pesticides and chemicals were particularly popular in the Far West and Rocky Mountain regions, while labels claiming merchandise is \"natural\" were popular in the North Central region. "}, {"section_title": "Customer Characteristics Why Customers Shop at Farmers Markets", "text": "Market managers were asked to rank the top three reasons they believe their customers shopped at their farmers markets. Freshness, taste, and access to local food were the top three reported by managers, with price ranking a distant sixth. Figure 25 depicts the percentage of managers that reported each motivating factor as either important, very important, or extremely important. "}, {"section_title": "Weekly Number of Customers at Markets", "text": "The average number of customers reported at all farmers markets was 959 per week. Year-round markets reported an average of 3,622 customers per week, higher than seasonal markets, which caused the average customer counts at all markets to be skewed upward. In comparison, managers of seasonal farmers markets reported an average 601 customer visits per week. Because most markets across the Nation reported they were seasonal and there were only 87 year-round markets that responded to the survey, we limit regional breakdowns to seasonal markets. The region with the largest number of customers per week at seasonal markets was 1,379, reported by markets in the Far West region, a number much higher than any other region (Figure 26). This result was somewhat surprising, as only 59.5 percent of farmers markets in the Far West region were located in urban areas, as measured by rural-urban continuum codes, suggesting that location in densely populated areas may not be crucial for market success. Another example, Figure  28, shows that the Mid-Atlantic region has the largest percentage of markets in urban areas, but Figure 26 shows its weekly customer counts fall in the middle range. Population density may not be the sole determinant of farmers markets performance. To gain a better perspective of typical customer traffi c at markets on a region basis, weekly customer visits were grouped into four ranges: fewer than 100 customers, 100-199 customers, 200-599 customers, and 600 or more customers (Figure 27). The resulting analysis reveals that seasonal farmers markets in the Far West typically attract far more customers per week than markets in other regions of the country. More than half the seasonal farmers markets in the Far West averaged 600 or more customers per week; at the other end of the spectrum, more than half the markets in the Southeast and Southwest regions had fewer than 100 customer visits per week, while markets in other regions of the country most frequently served between 100 and 199 customers per week. Given the limited average levels of customer turnout in so many parts of the country, it is not surprising to learn that \"targeting customers\" remains a high priority for farmers market managers in terms of desired marketing assistance (see Figure 51 on page 65), as customer patronage of seasonal farmers markets remains highly concentrated in a few key geographic locations. "}, {"section_title": "Distance Traveled by Customers", "text": "As a general rule, customers were willing to travel only a limited distance to patronize farmers markets, underscoring the important link between market location and market performance. Surveyed managers reported that, on average, more than half their market's customers (58 percent) traveled 5 miles or less to reach the market, and that more than 80 percent of their market's customers traveled 10 miles or less ( Figure 29). A similar pattern of behavior can be seen in most regions of the country, with the majority of market customers traveling 5 miles or less. The only exception was in the Southeast region, where a slight majority of market customers traveled more than 5 miles to visit farmers markets. "}, {"section_title": "Advertising Methods", "text": "Signs/banners and newspaper advertising were the two promotional methods most frequently used by farmers market managers nationwide, with more than 80 percent of surveyed managers reporting they use these methods to attract customers ( Figure 30). On average, farmers markets nationwide spent $3,566 on advertising in 2005. It is important to note, however, that this average is probably infl ated by a handful of well-established markets that spent upwards of $100,000 on advertising. Perhaps a more typical and realistic estimate of annual advertising expenditures is the median fi gure of $500 per year, accounting for approximately one-third of reported annual median operating expenses at farmers markets. Managers were asked to rank the importance of each type of advertising method on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 representing \"not important\" to 5 representing \"extremely important.\" The two advertising methods rated most important by market managers were signs/banners and newspapers, with brochures/fl yers in third place (Figure 31). Nearly 25 percent of surveyed managers gave the highest possible ranking, \"extremely important,\" to signs/banners for advertising the market to the public. "}, {"section_title": "Outreach to Customers", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Use of Market Research on Customer Preferences", "text": "Managers were asked if they conducted periodic consumer surveys to learn the needs and preferences of their customers. Only 27.6 percent of surveyed managers conducted surveys, suggesting that market managers may need to devote greater effort to obtaining feedback from market patrons (though the nature of direct-to-consumer marketing fosters better communication between buyers and seller than other sales channels). 13. The graph summarizes the percentage of managers that ranked the advertising method as either effective, very effective, or extremely important. Nationally, the annual average sales volume per vendor was $7,035, ranging from a low of $2,349 in the Rocky Mountain region to a high of $17,017 in the Mid-Atlantic region. The large swing in the magnitude of annual sales per vendor between these regions is because a few markets had signifi cantly large value sales and few vendors. The median sales per vendor is a more representative view of annual sales per vendor across regions. Annual median sales per vendor nationally were $2,222. The median sales per vendor regionally ranged from a high of $5,552 in the Mid-Atlantic region to a low of $1,200 in the North Central region (Table 5). Monthly sales per vendor allow more equitable comparisons among markets within and across regions because the length of time a market operates during a year doesn't infl uence the magnitude of vendor sales. The average monthly sales of vendors in 2005 was $1,070 per month, ranging from a low of $607 in the Rocky Mountain region to a high of $2,187 in the Mid-Atlantic region 14 (Table 4). Even with monthly vendor sales factored in, there are still large variations among vendors at markets. Therefore, as discussed earlier, the median sales fi gure gives a more representative view of vendors' monthly sales. Nationally, the median monthly sales of vendors was $468, ranging from a high of $875 in the Mid-Atlantic region to a low of $245 in the Southwest region. Vendors at smaller markets earned higher revenue than vendors at larger markets, presumably because there was less competition for customers (Table 6). However, when the market size reached 40 or more vendors, the negative impact of competition appeared outweighed by increased sales volume from greater customer traffi c. 14. Vendor average monthly sales fi gures were calculated by dividing average monthly market sales by the average number of vendors reported by market managers. The number of vendors reported by market managers was the number of unique vendors that used their market. The number of times a particular vendor sold products at a given farmers market is unknown.   "}, {"section_title": "Vendor Characteristics", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Infl uence of Age of Market on Vendor Sales", "text": "Average monthly sales per vendor were lowest at the youngest tier of farmers markets, which can be expected of start-up businesses (Table 7). However, rather than climbing in a linear fashion over time, monthly sales volume per vendor seemed to sag at markets that were between 10 and 19 years old, possibly because of increased competition among vendors for customers. At farmers markets 20 years old or older, however, vendor income once again seemed to recover, suggesting farmers markets 20 years old and older may offer attributes attractive to customers, such as wider product selection and variety, or convenience and accessible locations.

On average across the country, farmers market managers reported that more than half of vendors at their markets traveled less than 6 miles to sell at their markets, and nearly a quarter had to travel between 6 and 10 miles ( Figure 32). The Northeast region reported the highest percentage of vendors traveling less than 6 miles-65.9 percent. Managers in the Northeast region reported that 21.6 percent of vendors traveled between 6 and 10 miles. Managers in the Mid-Atlantic and North Central regions reported similar distances: 60.8 percent and 59.7 percent of vendors traveled less than 6 miles and 22.6 and 22.0 percent traveled between 6-10 miles, respectively. The Far West, Southwest, and Rocky Mountain regions reported 57.4 percent, 55.7 percent, and 53.4 percent of vendors traveled less than 6 miles to market their products at farmers market and 20.0 percent, 22.0 percent and 18.9 percent of vendors traveled between 6-10 miles, respectively. Vendors in the Southeast reported the lowest percentage of vendors that traveled less than 6 miles (46.6 percent) and the highest percentage of vendors that traveled between 6-10 miles, (29.8 percent) than any other region. Although regionally, managers reported different travel patterns for vendors at their markets, managers in each region reported at least three-quarters of their vendors traveled less than 10 miles from their farming operations to market their products.

"}, {"section_title": "Operational Issues at Farmers Markets", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Restrictions at Farmers Markets", "text": "Farmers markets often impose restrictions on their vendors to maintain the integrity of the products sold at their markets. The most common restriction is a requirement that vendors may sell only agricultural products they produced. Sixty-three percent of surveyed managers reported their markets enforced such producer-only sales restrictions (Figure 37). In keeping with this policy, the overwhelming majority-nearly 72 percent-of vendors in 2005 were reported to be producers selling goods they had grown and/or produced themselves, ranging from a peak of 78 percent in the Southwest to a low of 60.3 percent in the Rocky Mountain region (Figure 38). Other common restrictions at farmers markets included controls on the types of product categories that could be sold at markets, restrictions on selling products produced outside the local area, and controls on the number of vendors allowed to sell a certain type of product. Markets selling organically labeled products tended to report controls more frequently on the number of vendors allowed to sell similar types of products at individual markets. Market Self-Suffi ciency The majority of farmers markets appear to be well on the road to fi nancial self-suffi ciency. Nearly half (46.5 percent) of surveyed market managers reported their markets were economically self-suffi cient and depended exclusively on vendor fees to pay the market's operating expenses ( Figure 40). As one might expect, farmers markets that have been in business longer tend to be more fi nancially secure than younger markets; only 32 percent of markets fewer than 5 years old consider themselves to be economically self-suffi cient, compared with 59 percent of markets in business 20 years or longer. The top three funding sources for farmers markets that were not self-suffi cient were vendor fees, city or county governments, and non-profi t organizations. Younger markets reported greater dependence on external sources of funding than older markets; non-self-suffi cient markets fewer than 5 years old derived only 40 percent of their budgets, on average, from vendor fees, while non-self-suffi cient markets in business for 20 years or more were able to fund 57 percent of their budgets, on average, with vendor fees (Figure 40).

Only 39 percent of surveyed market managers reported their markets hired paid managers, and only 22 percent reported hiring other paid employees to carry out market functions. The percentage of farmers markets with paid managers varied widely across regions, from a low of 27 percent in the Southwest region to a high of 65 percent in the Far West region (Figure 43). Salaries of paid market managers varied considerably depending on market location. The nationwide average annual salary reported for paid market managers was $14,323, ranging from a high of $21,913 in the Mid-Atlantic region to a low of $8,864 in the Rocky Mountain region (Figure 44).

Markets without paid managers reported average market sales of $11,059 and median sales of $4,000 per month ( Figure 46). Both average and median sales of all markets with paid managers were fi ve times that of markets without paid managers. However, just looking at average or median sales of markets that did and did not use paid managers can conceal the sales levels at which markets hire paid management. To examine the data in more detail, we grouped the markets into four categories: markets with monthly sales of less than $2,500 per month (24.9 percent of all markets), markets with monthly sales between $2,500 to $6,999 (21.5 percent), markets with monthly sales between $7,000 and $22,999 (24.9 percent), and markets with monthly sales of $23,000 or higher (28.7 percent).

The next lower sales group (markets with $7,000 to $22,999 in monthly sales), reported about the same monthly sales from markets with and without paid management. This sales group appears to be the tipping point; the percentage of paid managers is roughly the same as the percentage of markets that did not have paid managers. Twenty-six percent had paid managers and 23.5 percent did not have paid managers in this sales group. Seasonal markets with monthly sales in the bottom two tiers reported fewer paid managers. In the $2,500 to $6,999 monthly sales group, 16.8 percent reported having paid market managers and 27.1 percent reported they did not. In the less than $2,500 per month sales group, 8.4 percent of managers reported paid managers and 38.6 percent of markets reported no paid managers.

Market managers in the Far West and Mid-Atlantic regions list the same fourth and fi fth most important operational concerns: availability of customer parking and business planning assistance, respectively.

Market managers were also asked to rank their highest priorities for market assistance. As with responses to the question about needed operational improvements, managers across the country expressed similar concerns.

Two of these programs, the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition program (SFMNP) and the Women, Infants, and Children Farmers Market Nutrition Program (WIC FMNP), provide vouchers-redeemable exclusively at farmers markets-to help subsidize purchases of fresh fruits and vegetables by low-income seniors and recipients of WIC benefi ts. Eligible participants in the WIC FMNP are women, infants (more than 4 months old), and children certifi ed to receive WIC program benefi ts or who are on a waiting list for WIC certifi cation. They may use their WIC FMNP coupons to purchase fresh, unprepared fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Because the number of allowable items can be restricted by each State, the range of available items varies, and may affect regional redemption levels. To qualify for WIC, applicants' income must be at or below 185 percent of the U.S. Poverty Income Guidelines. 18 Participants in the SFMNP are low-income seniors, generally defi ned as individuals at least 60 years old with household incomes not to exceed 185 percent of the Federal poverty guidelines. (Some State agencies accept proof of participation or enrollment in another means-tested program, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp Program), for SFMNP eligibility. 19 ) In addition to these two programs that specifi cally promote purchases of fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets, an increasing number of farmers markets are acquiring EBT capabilities (some used in combination with a debit/credit card terminal) that enables SNAP participants to use their benefi ts at farmers markets. To be eligible for SNAP benefi ts, households may have no more than $2,000 in countable resources, such as a bank account ($3,000 if at least one person in the household is age 60 or older or is disabled), and the gross monthly income of most households must be 130 percent or less of Federal poverty guidelines. Net monthly income must be 100 percent or less of Federal poverty guidelines. SNAP participants can buy food, except for hot foods or foods that can be eaten in the store. 20 While all these nutrition programs have had some positive infl uence on farmers markets sales, the degree of impact varies considerably by program. Managers reported the WIC FMNP program contributed more to vendor sales than any other federally funded nutrition program, refl ecting that market participation rates in the WIC FMNP program exceed current participation rates in any other nutrition program. The participation rate of surveyed farmers markets in WIC FMNP reported in 2005 was 60.7 percent, ranging from a high of 87.9 percent in the Northeast region to a low of 35.8 percent in the Rocky Mountain region (Figure 52).

Almost 32 percent of younger markets reported average monthly sales of less than $2,500 a month, the dominant category for younger markets. In contrast, the most well established markets operating 20 years or more typically had monthly sales of $23,000 or more; 47.9 percent of established markets were in this sales category (Table  9). As markets age, mean and median monthly market sales seem to increase in a linear fashion ( Table 9). The number of vendors, average number of weekly customers and percentage of vendors with annual gross revenues of $10,000 or more also appear to increase linearly as markets age (Table 10). It is important to keep in mind that at every age level the percentage of vendors with sales of more than $10,000 is small. The percentage ranges from a low of 8.7 percent for markets that are less than 5 years old to a high of 23.3 percent for markets 20 years or older. Conversely, this means that while a few vendors are generating sales of more than $10,000 a year per market, 85 percent of vendors at markets of all ages generate revenues of less than $10,000 annually per market. Comparison of markets of different vendor size categories across age groupings gives a hint of how markets change as they age. It appears that markets tend to have more vendors as markets get older. Comparison of these four size groups can be seen in Figure 60. The largest size category of markets in the United States, regardless of market age, is the \"20-39 vendor\" category, but the number of vendors per market varies greatly in different age groups. Managers of markets in operation for less than 5 years reported that 36.4 percent of their markets had fewer than 10 vendors, while managers from markets in business between 5 and 9 years reported the most even distribution across all vendor size categories, ranging from \"40 or more vendors\" (19.4 percent) to \"20-39 vendors\" (28.6 percent). Markets in operation between 10 and 19 years generally fell into the \"10-19 vendors\" and the \"20-39 vendors\" categories, with 27.8 and 35.2 percent of markets corresponding to these categories, respectively. Markets in operation 20 years or more featured the largest percentage of markets with \"20-39 vendors\" or \"40 vendors or more,\" accounting for 29.0 and 34.9 percent of all markets in this age group, respectively.  "}, {"section_title": "Infl uence of Population Density on Market Performance", "text": "Comparison of markets with strong sales to markets with weak sales suggests the population density of a location is an important infl uence in market performance. Young markets in densely populated areas consistently had better sales than those in less densely populated areas. Seventy-fi ve percent of markets with sales between $7,000 and $22,999 and 92 percent of markets with sales of $23,000 and greater were located in densely populated metropolitan counties, compared with 55 percent of markets with monthly sales of less than $2,500 and 44 percent of markets with sales between $2,500 and $6,999 (Table 11). Densely populated market locations also appeared to infl uence whether vendors choose to extend their marketing season. Only 57.4 percent of markets open for less than 7 months were located in urban counties, yet 80 percent of markets open 7 months or more and 86.7 percent of year-round markets were in urban counties. 21 Location appears to have a signifi cant infl uence on the marketing decisions of vendors (Table 12).  Comparison of markets open less than 7 months versus year-round markets, by degree of urbanicity"}, {"section_title": "Monthly Sales", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Rural", "text": "Farmers markets continue to be an important and rapidly growing segment of the agricultural sector. Nevertheless, growth in farmers market numbers, although still increasing, is continuing at a slower pace. The reduction in the growth rate of farmers markets may indicate that farmers markets are approaching a saturation point. Newly established markets have not been able to generate the economic activity of older markets, raising questions about whether current levels of growth are sustainable. There appear to be regional differences in the revenue potential of farmers markets. Vendors in the Far West, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast regions had the largest percentage of vendors with sizable annual sales revenues, suggesting the most profi table farmers markets were located on the coasts. These regions reported 12.4 percent, 16.1 percent, and 6.7 percent of their vendors, respectively, had annual sales of $25,000 or more. In comparison, the Rocky Mountain and North Central regions reported 1.2 percent and 2.9 percent of vendors had annual sales of $25,000 or more. The national mean and median annual sales per vendor per market reported by market managers were $7,035 and $2,222, respectively. Market managers reported that 71.4 percent of vendors at their farmers markets had annual sales of $5,000 or less per market, indicating only a few vendors at a given market have sizable annual sales revenues. There may be ways organizers of new farmers markets can compensate for these trends. Market organizers may want to be more discriminating in their selection of locations for new markets. Organizers selecting a location for a new market should consider densely populated or heavily traffi cked areas that would provide a suffi cient number of customers for the new market without drawing customers from existing farmers markets. Our study found that markets with higher sales most frequently were located in densely populated, usually urban, areas. In addition, market managers reported that more than half of farmers market customers (58 percent) lived within 5 miles of the market, and 80 percent within 10 miles. Another recommendation to organizers of new markets would be to make an active effort to know their customers. Young markets (those that have been in business 5 years or less) that conducted consumer surveys reported higher sales than other markets in the same age category, suggesting these markets did a better job of learning the needs and preferences of their customers. Young markets with higher sales levels also had more diversifi ed product offerings and employed paid market managers more often. As new markets start to compete for customers, market managers may have to allocate resources to target and attract customers to their markets successfully. The presence of organic products at farmers markets seems to operate as a driver of consumer spending, especially in urban locations. Customers in urban areas expressed a preference for organic products that boosted market sales. Furthermore, markets that sold organic products reported more customers per week, more vendors, and larger monthly sales. Seventy-one percent of farmers markets that sold organic products were located in urban areas 22 compared with 55.3 percent of markets that didn't offer organic products. Market organizers may also consider extending their marketing season to the longest timespan they can support. Markets that operated 7 months or more reported almost twice the number of vendors, almost 3 times the amount of sales revenue per month, and almost twice the number of customers per week, compared with markets open for 6 months or less. The higher level of performance of these markets may be due to the availability of fresh products 22. Urban means that the market was located in a location that had a rural-to-urban continuum code of 1, 2 or 3. Rural-to-urban continuum code is defi ned in Appendix 2: Rural-Urban Continuum Codes."}, {"section_title": "Implications of Analysis for Market Managers", "text": "early and late in the growing season, which can command higher prices because fresh local products can't be found elsewhere, or by the availability of more value-added shelf-stable products. Markets open for longer portions of the year also seem to create stronger bonds with their customers, resulting in more customers incorporating market visits into their routine shopping patterns. It is interesting to note that as of December 2008, 747 of the 4,668 markets listed in the National Directory of Farmers Markets operated during winter months (October 1 through March 31). This represents 16 percent of all markets listed. Two hundred forty-one seasonal markets operated during winter months-about one-third of all markets operating in winter. When extending your market season, you may fi nd that incremental changes yield favorable results and cost less to operate than a year-round facility. Markets open 7 months or more reported an average of 51 vendors, $57,290 in monthly market sales, and served 942 customers weekly. In comparison, year-round markets reported an average of 58 vendors, had monthly market sales of $69,497, and served 3,578 customers weekly. Even though year-round markets reported 4 times the number of weekly customers than markets open 7 months or more, they reported only 13.7 percent more vendors and 21.3 percent greater sales revenue. Establishing a successful farmers market requires careful planning and coordination between farmers and vendors to ensure a dependable supply of a variety of products, knowledge of local customer preferences, coordination with town and/or city leaders, advice from local extension agents, and the involvement of local business leaders. Markets should be convenient to their potential customers so trips to the market are easily incorporated into routine shopping patterns. Market mangers should take advantage of direct contact with customers by actively seeking customer feedback and then refl ect those preferences in the length of the market season, the days of operation, and the products offered. In addition, managers of markets should remain responsive to the needs and demands of customers and the community and be fl exible, creative, and resourceful. 22.
