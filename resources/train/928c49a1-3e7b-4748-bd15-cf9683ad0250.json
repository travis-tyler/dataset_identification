It has mostly been used to assess white matter (Assaf and Pasternak, 2008) , but more recently, it has also been applied to study gray matter (GM) microstructural integrity (Weston et al., 2015) . Mean diffusivity (MD), a scalar DTI measure, quantifies the average degree of diffusion of water molecules in all directions (Le Bihan et al., 2001) . Evidence from animal models suggests that cell atrophy leads to a loss of microstructural barriers to diffusion such as cell membranes, thus increasing MD in the brain's gray matter at an early stage of atrophy (Zerbi et al., 2013) .\nIn cognitively healthy older people, increased MD of GM structures has been found to correlate with decreased cognitive function (Carlesimo et al., 2010; Kantarci et al., 2011; den Heijer et al., 2012; Salminen et al., 2016; Gyebn\u00e1r et al., 2018) . Specifically, Kantarci et al. (2011) found that medial temporal lobe MD was negatively related to memory performance in a sample of healthy older people and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. Similarly, left hippocampal MD correlated with memory performance in healthy people older than 50 years (Carlesimo et al., 2010) , whereas no association was found in younger people.\nThe concept of cognitive reserve (CR) was introduced to explain the discrepancy between the level of neuropathology and the level of ante-mortem functional impairment in brain autopsy studies (Katzman et al., 1988) . This discrepancy is assumed to depend on lifetime experiences, such as education, occupation, or hobbies. More cognitively challenging lifetime experiences thus protect individuals from functional impairment, either by compensating or by preventing neuropathological lesions. As an example, Bennett et al. (2003) found that the association of neuropathology and cognitive impairment was moderated by years of formal education. More precisely, stronger negative correlations of neuropathology and cognitive function were found in participants with fewer years of education. Thus, the concept of CR represents an active cognitive mechanism that protects from cognitive impairment.\nCognitive reserve needs to be distinguished from the closely related concepts of brain reserve and brain maintenance (Barulli and Stern, 2013) . According to the concept of brain reserve, brain measures such as total intracranial volume or head circumference explain the differential susceptibility to cognitive impairment at a given level of neuropathological lesion. In contrast, brain maintenance refers to healthy aging and the mechanisms that protect healthy older people against neuropathology or agerelated cognitive deterioration (Barulli and Stern, 2013) .\nThe quantification of CR is still a matter of debate (Nilsson and L\u00f6vd\u00e9n, 2018) . Most researchers use single proxies, such as years of education (Meng and D'Arcy, 2012) , occupational status or measures of premorbid IQ (Alexander et al., 1997) . Other measures include physical or social activities (Scarmeas and Stern, 2003) . However, using a single proxy (e.g., years of education) to measure a latent construct (CR) may lead to a biased measurement. Also, proxy variables such as education may affect the risk of dementia in ways that are unrelated to CR. As an example, more years of education are directly related to health status (Silles, 2009 ). These problems may be resolved by using specific CR questionnaires that were developed to provide a more comprehensive measure of CR (Valenzuela and Sachdev, 2007; Nucci et al., 2012) . Another way is the calculation of a measure of the discrepancy between cognitive performance and neuropathology (Reed et al., 2010; van Loenhoud et al., 2017) . As long as there is no consensus on the operationalization of CR, a composite score combining several proxies is preferable. A factor analytic approach has been previously used to determine a composite CR score (Scarmeas et al., 2004; Stern et al., 2005; Sol\u00e9-Padull\u00e9s et al., 2009 ). The resulting CR score summarizes shared variance between established proxy measures and contains less proxy-specific variance than a single proxy measure. As our sample (ADNI) is known to be highly educated, we expect to increase variance thereby avoiding a ceiling effect in our CR measure by using a composite score. At the same time, we think that a composite score can capture the concept of CR more precisely by reducing proxy specific variance.\nReviewing the evidence on the association of brain changes and CR, Arenaza-Urquijo et al. (2015) proposed two distinct mechanisms of CR. The compensatory mechanisms of CR are assumed to take effect once neuropathology is present in the brain. Reserve would then delay the onset of cognitive symptoms despite the neuropathology. Evidence for this mechanism has been found in studies on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using multiple indices of AD pathology, such as A\u03b242 CSF, hypometabolism and atrophy (Querbes et al., 2009; Sol\u00e9-Padull\u00e9s et al., 2009) . For example, Sol\u00e9-Padull\u00e9s et al. (2009) found a negative association of whole-brain volume and CR in participants with MCI and mild AD at a given level of cognitive performance. The neuroprotective mechanisms of CR have mainly been reported in healthy subjects (Landau et al., 2012a) , but also in animal and intervention studies (Valenzuela et al., 2003; Costa et al., 2007; Erickson et al., 2011) . When it comes to hippocampal integrity and CR, inconsistent results were found so far. On the one hand, in healthy older people with abnormal CSF amyloid, a negative association of CR proxies and hippocampal volume was found, suggesting a compensatory mechanism of CR on hippocampal integrity (Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2013b) . However, in another study with healthy older people with low amyloid burden, no association of hippocampal volume and years of education was found, suggesting differential effects according to amyloid status (Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2013a) . On the other hand, evidence for a protective mechanism of CR on the hippocampal atrophy rate was found in older healthy individuals (Valenzuela et al., 2008) . Additionally, Piras et al. (2011) found lower MD, i.e., better preserved hippocampal microstructural integrity, in better educated cognitively normal middle-aged individuals. This would also indicate a protective mechanism of CR on hippocampal microstructural integrity.\nThe present study aims at determining the role of hippocampal GM MD in the interaction of AD pathology and CR in older people without dementia.\nMore specifically, our first aim was to examine the association of CR and hippocampal GM MD in older people with normal cognition (NC) and with MCI after controlling for the level of memory performance. In accordance with the results by Piras et al. (2011) , we assumed a negative association of hippocampal CR and GM MD.\nSecond, following the model by Arenaza-Urquijo et al. (2015), we examined whether the presence of amyloid load moderated the association of CR and hippocampal GM microstructural integrity. We expected a significant interaction of CR and amyloid load in both, MCI and NC subjects. This interaction would be assumed to result from a negative association of a composite CR score and hippocampal MD in amyloid negative participants, indicating a neuroprotective mechanism. In amyloid positive participants, we expected a compensatory effect of CR, resulting in a positive association of a composite CR score and hippocampal MD.\nFor comparison, we also evaluated the association of CR and hippocampal volume as a measure of hippocampal macrostructural integrity."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "ADNI Database", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database 1 .

We found that hippocampal GM MD was not related to CR in older adults without dementia. Also, no interaction of amyloid status and CR was found. Piras et al. (2011) found a negative association of years of education and hippocampal MD in middle-aged healthy adults. We could not replicate this finding in older people without dementia. The present study differs from the study by Piras et al. (2011) in several ways. First, while Piras et al. (2011) chose middle-aged healthy adults, we studied older, non-demented participants because CR takes effect in this age group. One could argue that our sample may have been too old to detect an effect of CR, which is closely related to school education. However, the effect of education on the risk of dementia and on dementia pathology at a more advanced age has been shown in many studies (Mortimer et al., 2003; Valenzuela and Sachdev, 2006; Meng and D'Arcy, 2012) and, crucially, is the key finding supporting the CR hypothesis (Stern, 1994 (Stern, , 2009 ). Second, we corrected for PVE when estimating hippocampal GM MD. By not using any partial volume correction, Piras et al. (2011) potentially overestimated MD in the older participants of their sample (Henf et al., 2018) . However, this should not essentially change the patterns of results in middle-aged participants, because PVE are more pronounced in older than in younger people (Jeon et al., 2012) . Additionally, the choice of covariates in our study differs from Piras et al. (2011) , who used age as the sole nuisance variable. However, both gender and cognitive performance need to be included when analyzing the association of CR and measure of regional brain integrity (Arenaza-Urquijo et al., 2015) . Especially memory performance seems to be related to CR (Opdebeeck et al., 2016) . Therefore, when omitting memory performance as a covariate in these analyses, the resulting associations of CR and neuroimaging data may reflect differences in cognitive performance instead of differences in CR. Moreover, both subgroups of our sample had more years of education than the sample by Piras et al. (2011) . This results from the high education of the ADNI sample in general 4 . The high education limits the generalizability of our findings to the general population. What is more, the choice of CR proxy differed, as Piras et al. (2011) used years of education as the proxy variable and we used a composite CR score. However, our composite score resulted from a factor analysis that also included years of education. In fact, we observed a high correlation between years of education and the composite CR score (Supplementary Material and Supplementary Table S1 ). When repeating the regression analysis with years of education as the sole CR proxy, the results did not change substantially (Supplementary Material and Supplementary Table S2 ). In addition to that, the sample size of Piras et al. (2011) was considerably larger than our sample size, which might suggest a potential lack of power of our analyses. However, as can be seen in the section \"Results\" (Tables 2-4 ), all power values were within a range of 0.95 to >0.99. Therefore, we conclude that both samples were sufficiently large to detect a potential effect of CR.\nOur study also aimed at determining the differential effects of CR on hippocampal microstructural integrity according to cognitive and amyloid status. Previous studies on CR proposed that higher CR leads to decreased neuropathology (\"neuroprotective effect\") in healthy individuals (ArenazaUrquijo et al., 2015) . In individuals with existing neuropathology, those with a higher CR may tolerate a higher amount of pathology, leading to the inverse association of higher CR being associated with increased neuropathology (\"compensatory effect\"). Our results do not conform to this model suggested by Arenaza-Urquijo et al. (2015) . In the overall statistical models, none of the main effects or interaction terms reached significance. Possibly, hippocampal GM MD is not sufficiently sensitive to neurodegeneration. However, using hippocampal volume as a criterion in the regression analyses, the results did not essentially change. What is more, the CR score in the present study was composed of a factor representing three CR proxies and resulted from a factor analytic approach. Compared to previous studies using this approach, the percentage of variance explained by our score was relatively low (55%), indicating lower intercorrelations of the original variables (years of education, occupation and ANART). The ANART may be sensitive not only to premorbid, but also to current cognitive performance (Lowe and Rogers, 2011) . In our sample, we found a numerically higher number of errors in the ANART in the LMCI sample compared to the NC sample. Albeit not statistically significant, this difference may also result from reduced memory performance in the LMCI sample instead of premorbid IQ. Thus, the composite CR score in the LMCI sample may be confounded by cognitive impairment. This may have limited its correlation with the other two CR proxies used in this study (years of education and occupation).\nSeveral limitations need to be considered in the present study. First, the acquisition delay between the PET and the MRI scans was variable in the present sample (M = 73 days; SD = 136), even though binary amyloid positivity remained stable during the study period in those participants with the longest acquisition delays (>100 days). Unfortunately, information on CSF biomarkers and/or Tau PET was not available for our sample. These biomarkers would have helped to more accurately quantify neuropathology in the cognitively normal participants. Also, some of the participants did not receive a diffusion weighted scan at baseline but only in the course of the study. Thus, slight retest effects may have influenced the memory score (Crane et al., 2012) . However, exclusion of non-baseline data did not substantially change the results (data not shown). Another limitation is the post hoc quantification of the occupational status. A more differentiated assessment such as the lifetime of experiences questionnaire (Valenzuela and Sachdev, 2007) or a longer version of the National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (Chandola and Jenkinson, 2000) would have been desirable. However, the information available in ADNI was not detailed enough to determine more nuanced scales of occupational attainment. We took this limitation into account by calculating a composite CR score containing less method-specific variance than the single CR proxies available in the ADNI dataset (years of education/ occupation/ANART)."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In this study, we aimed at determining the role of hippocampal microstructural integrity in the neuronal mechanisms of CR. We did not find an association of CR and hippocampal GM MD in healthy participants and in LMCI patients. Also, we did not find amyloid load to modulate the association of hippocampal GM MD and CR. On a neuronal level, we therefore assume that there is no association of beginning neurodegeneration, as indicated by an increase of hippocampal MD, and CR in older people. Thus, CR does not seem to take effect by preventing or compensating early hippocampal damage in older healthy people. More research is needed to determine the exact role of hippocampal MD in the interplay of age, AD pathology and CR.
