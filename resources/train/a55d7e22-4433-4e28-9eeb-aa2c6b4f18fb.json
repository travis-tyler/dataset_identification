Briefly, we first derived a quantitative MRI measure that linearly combined neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular variables based on their association with episodic memory in WHICAP-1. We next applied the same score to the independent WHICAP-2 group to replicate its association. Because of the longitudinal nature of the study, we were able to combine the 2 cohorts to examine differences in the scores among subsequent diagnoses (i.e., controls, MCI, LOAD) and to determine whether the score predicted future conversion to MCI or LOAD among healthy controls. We repeated this analysis after limiting the analysis to the WHICAP-2 cohort only.\nWe examined the association of the MRI measure with neuropathologic features of LOAD and cerebrovascular disease among the 42 participants who came to autopsy. Finally, we computed the MRI score in an independent study (ADNI-1) to test its association with LOAD-specific biomarkers not available in WHICAP and with clinical progression.\nIn the WHICAP-1 cohort (n = 690), multiple linear regression analyses were used with 2 MRI variables reflecting cerebrovascular disease (WMH volume and infarcts) and 2 neurodegenerative variables (hippocampus volume and cortical thickness) as predictors of the memory score (dependent variable). Each participant's raw neuroimaging variables were multiplied by the respective unstandardized \u03b2 weights generated from the multiple regression analysis. The values were summed to yield a single value for each participant reflecting the linear combination of the cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration variables, weighted by their contributions to the memory score, with higher scores indicating more intact memory. The initial regression analysis was repeated with the neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease measures entered as separate variables to determine the extent to which inclusion of cerebrovascular disease improved model fit.\nThe newly derived quantitative MRI measure was then repeated in the WHICAP-2 independent cohort (n = 485) using the same \u03b2 values derived in WHICAP-1. Subsequently, we combined data from the 2 imaging groups and examined differences in the MRI measure among individuals classified as normal controls, MCI, and LOAD at a subsequent clinical follow-up using analysis of variance.\nWe conducted multiple Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association of the MRI measure with clinical conversion from control to MCI or LOAD. Here, we compared models that used the derived MRI measure with those that tested each of its component parts separately (i.e., WMH volume, presence of infarct, hippocampus volume, cortical thickness). To define which model performed better, we compared the latter in terms of \u22122 log-likelihood. We also employed the glmnet R package 20 to fit an elastic-net regularization path for a Cox model that included all predictors (i.e., WMH volume, presence of infarct, hippocampus volume, cortical thickness, and the quantitative MRI score). The function was run 100-fold for cross-validation and the best value of lambda (such that error is within 1 standard error of the minimum) was used to identify the best set of predictors."}, {"section_title": "Autopsy validation", "text": "Forty-two WHICAP participants with MRI data came to autopsy. We examined the relationship between the quantitative MRI measure and key pathologic findings: neuritic amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, large and small vessel infarcts, and atrophy. Because measurements were made in several brain regions, the 2 regions with the greatest average severity ratings across participants were selected for the primary autopsy outcome. Multiple regression analysis, correcting for the time interval between MRI and date of death, were conducted to examine the relationship between the quantitative MRI measure and each pathologic outcome separately. We subsequently recalculated the quantitative MRI measure by including only neurodegenerative factors (hippocampal volume and cortical thickness), repeated the regression analyses with this score, and compared the variance explained (R 2 ) between models. We also repeated the analyses with each individual MRI variable entered separately to determine whether the weighted, linear combination in the MRI measure was more strongly associated with pathology than any of its component parts. Neuritic plaques were rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (i.e., no plaques observed) to 4 (i.e., 20 or more plaques observed) regionally. Neurofibrillary tangles were similarly rated on a 5-point scale (0, 0 tangles noted; 4, \u226515 tangles noted). Regional atrophy was rated on a 4-point scale, ranging from absent to severe. The number of brain infarcts on gross examination was recorded.\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI has included data from over 50 sites across the United States and Canada. Study procedures and the follow-up duration for ADNI-1 have been described in the protocol (adni.loni. usc.edu) and in the e-Methods (doi.org/10.5061/dryad. m8s3r88). A standardized and validated MRI protocol for image acquisition was implemented across ADNI sites. 21 MRI data acquisition took place on 1.5T systems. T1-weighted volumetric sequences were acquired in the sagittal orientation. A proton density/T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence was acquired in the axial orientation. Sites included in the ADNI protocol passed rigorous scanner validation tests and scan acquisitions for each subject included a fluid-filled phantom (adni.loni.usc.edu). WMH quantification procedures have been described previously. 12 The T1-, T2-, and proton densityweighted MRI scans were coregistered and skull stripped. 22, 23 After bias field correction, 24 WMH were detected based on corresponding proton density, T1, and T2 intensities; the prior probability of WMH; and the conditional probability of WMH based on the presence of WMH at neighboring voxels. Total WMH volumes were derived by summing and multiplying the number of labeled voxels by voxel dimensions.

This PiB+ cutoff value was based on studies in a large group of cognitively normal controls studied at the University of Pittsburgh. 27 From the initial 871 ADNI-1 participants, data from 665 (76%) were available for analyses. Full demographics for the ADNI sample are reported in table e-1 (doi.org/10.5061/ dryad.m8s3r88). We selected the same 4 MRI variables and applied the \u03b2 values derived from the WHICAP analysis to derive an identical quantitative MRI measure. We then tested the association between the quantitative MRI measure and the clinical diagnosis, CSF biomarkers, and amyloid-PET imaging measures for LOAD. First, we fit an ordinal regression model with the 3 diagnostic categories at baseline (i.e., healthy control, MCI, LOAD). We then restricted the analyses to participants with MCI, the largest diagnostic group in ADNI. We used generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine the association between the quantitative MRI measure and rate of change in Clinical Dementia Rating 28 sum of boxes score.

When each MRI variable was entered separately, the inclusion of WMH and infarcts significantly improved the model fit (R 2 change = 0.015, F = 8.97, p < 0.001). The results of this analysis and the independent relationship between each neuroimaging variable and episodic memory are shown in table 3. The resulting quantitative MRI measure was normally distributed (data not shown). Although the relationship between presence of infarcts and episodic memory was not statistically significant, we elected to retain the variable in the derivation of the MRI measure because it represents a characteristic cerebrovascular measure. However, the relatively weak association with memory still results in the small contribution of infarction to the overall score across individuals.\nRelationship of the quantitative MRI measure to memory and diagnostic outcomes Higher quantitative MRI measure was observed in those with better episodic memory performances in both WHICAP groups with moderate effect sizes (table e-2, doi.org/10.5061/ dryad.m8s3r88).

Lower hippocampus volume, lower cortical thickness, and higher WMH predicted conversion to MCI or LOAD. Presence of infarcts did not predict conversion. Finally, the MRI score predicted conversion to MCI or LOAD and showed the lowest likelihood test score across all the models tested (see table 4 for full results). Because the MRI measure was originally derived in the WHICAP-1 cohort, we repeated the analyses restricting the sample to the WHICAP-2 cohort.

The quantitative MRI measure was derived in a community-based cohort and replicated. Validation of the quantitative MRI measure was completed using autopsy data and clinically proven biomarkers for LOAD. The MRI measure predicted conversion in controls to MCI or LOAD. These results confirm and augment the role of both neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular pathology in LOAD, and suggest the possibility of capturing both in a single valid and reliable MRI-based measure.\nThe MRI measure we developed combined quantitative measures of neurodegeneration, brain infarcts, and WMH, which can reflect cerebrovascular disease, each weighted by their contribution to episodic memory. Because the MRI measure comprised neurodegenerative changes such as cortical thinning and hippocampal atrophy, well-validated MRI biomarkers for LOAD, it is not surprising that it correlated with memory and measures of pathologic findings in LOAD.\nIt is important to point out that in all analyses, the addition of the WMH and brain infarcts also significantly increased the strength of association with episodic memory and with the clinical and pathologic outcomes. The goal here was not to develop a diagnostic biomarker for LOAD but rather a quantitative metric combing the weighted contributions of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease. Despite the fact that the MRI measures were weakly correlated, there was no indication of statistical interaction among them, indicating that each was additive to the overall score. The area under the curve (AUC) for the MRI score and it components was similar (data available in figure e- placing the overall MRI score in the \"good\" category for biomarkers. The mean sensitivity at 89% and specificity at 55% in this article is also comparable to CSF measures of A\u03b2, tau, and p-tau. 29 In fact, a review of table 5 in that article indicates that each CSF measure (A\u03b2, tau, and p-tau) yielded similar AUCs as each MRI measure in our study.\nOur study indicated that the MRI measure was also associated with both LOAD neuropathology and related PET and CSF biological markers, an important validation step. These findings augment the observations showing a link between the presence of cerebrovascular vascular risk factors in midlife and LOAD-specific biological markers in later life. 30 While others have considered the contribution of cerebrovascular factors to LOAD risk and clinical presentation to be additive, our study is unique for several reasons. First, the derivation of the MRI score weighted each cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative factor by its relevance to a meaningful cognitive phenotype: episodic memory. Second, the MRI measure combines both cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative factors into a single conceptual framework that closely reflects the mixed pathology of LOAD. 31 Third, we were able to replicate our findings in independent datasets and validate the resulting MRI measure using direct pathologic measurements and LOADspecific PET and CSF biomarkers.\nWhile there is now substantial evidence that cerebrovascular disease plays a role in LOAD, there is considerable debate Figure 3 Scatterplot representing the distribution of the quantitative MRI measure in relation to the PET-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) average uptake in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 cohort about the mechanistic link. Atherosclerosis involving both large and small arteries is associated with a twofold risk of dementia. 32, 33 Endothelial and pericyte damage, inflammatory changes in vessels, atherosclerotic plaques, and microglial activation within endothelial cells can affect brain function and structure. An alteration of the blood-brain barrier, resulting from macrovascular and microvascular damage, can result in oxidative stress, inflammation, and cerebral hypoperfusion, 34 which have been implicated in AD. 35 A neurovascular hypothesis for LOAD has been proposed that posits the presence of cerebrovascular disease leads to a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, altering the clearance of A\u03b2 and p-tau, which results in neuronal dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and dementia. 36 However, it is also possible that cerebrovascular pathology may be secondary to an alteration in A\u03b2 clearance with A\u03b2 accumulation and neurodegeneration. Thus, a breakdown in the blood-brain barrier or other vessel changes results in cerebrovascular pathology and hypoperfusion, 37 which has been observed with multiple imaging modalities of LOAD. Our study was unable to establish causality between cerebrovascular factors and LOAD, but it does suggest the strong possibility that cerebrovascular factors contribute to the clinical manifestations and neurodegeneration in LOAD.\nWhile the prevalence of LOAD and related dementia has increased due to increase life expectancy, recent studies [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] indicate an inconsistent, but declining trend in incidence rates possibly related to a reduction in cardio-cerebrovascular risk factors. However, adjusting for such a reduction did not completely explain the change in incidence rates. 41, 42 Nonetheless, vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular disease could represent a potential avenue for LOAD risk modification.\nThe current study has limitations. The field strength for the MRI in the first WHICAP imaging group differed from that in the second group (1.5T vs 3.0T), but we were able to subsequently apply the MRI measure from the former group to the latter with good reliability, suggesting minimal effect on the outcome. Differences in field strength may affect measurement precision for the radiologic variables of interest, but should not alter the relationship between the variables and key outcomes. The MRI variables used in the study such as cerebrovascular disease, quantified by volume of WMH and infarcts, and as neurodegeneration, quantified by hippocampus volume and loss of cortical thickness, may lack specificity. For example, WMH could be a reflection of neurodegeneration, 43 although the vast majority of previous work would suggest a vascular origin, and cortical thickness can certainly be affected by cerebrovascular disease. Indeed, increased burden of WMH was associated with risk for familial early-onset AD, and progression of symptoms, and is elevated among individuals with autosomal dominant, fully penetrant mutations prior to symptoms. 13, [44] [45] [46] Our autopsy analyses were on 42 individuals. This limitation is somewhat mitigated by the use of biomarker data from the ADNI cohort. We included frequently used measures of cerebrovascular disease, including WMH and radiologic infarcts. We were unable to include others such as microbleeds and microinfarcts because they were only available in a few participants and we did not have sufficient spatial resolution to identify cortical microinfarcts reliably. The association of infarcts with episodic memory was weak, resulting in a relatively small weighting applied to presence of infarction in the final derivation of the MRI measure. Neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease can affect each other, making the 2 processes difficult to separate. However, this possibility does not detract from our work and, in fact, highlights the possibility of synergism between the 2 processes.\nIt is likely that the mixed pathologies of WMH and brain infarcts, reflecting cerebrovascular pathology, and the neurodegeneration manifest by focal atrophy and cortical thinning in LOAD are part of a continuum in which the onset and clinical manifestations of LOAD are jointly determined. This research approach might help to advance our understanding of this complex disease process and will help develop potential targets for treatments or preventive measures that are more precise for the individual patient.
