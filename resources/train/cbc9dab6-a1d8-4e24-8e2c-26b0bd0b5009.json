[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The Bay of Bengal (BOB) experiences seasonally reversing wind and widely varying freshwater input (including runoff and rainfall). The freshwater flux can induce a strong halocline, thus forming a \"barrier layer (BL)\" over much of the bay. The BL hampers vertical exchange between the surface and deep waters (Lukas and Lindstrom, 1991), which consequently initialize oceanic processes for the formation of near-surface temperature inversions. Previous studies have suggested that the surface circulation and redistribution of low-salinity water have a dominant influence on the observed BL distribu-Corresponding author: LI Jian, lijian@scsio.ac.cn tion in the BOB (Thadathil, 2008). Thadathil et al. (2007) showed that a thick BL (approximately 50-m thick) appeared along the western bay in November when the current flowed equator-ward in December and that the BL thinned when the current reversed in January. Using buoy and satellite data, Sindu et al. (2010) concluded that the temperature variability in the bay appeared to be mainly due to lateral advection rather than local heat flux in winter and spring, and the variability of freshwater content in the mixed layer is generally independent of the local surface freshwater flux in all seasons. They also indicated that temperature variability in the bay is most likely not significantly affected by the vertical movement of the subsurface water, which is influenced by thermocline displacement. A sustained BL could be subjected to winter modification, causing surface-layer temperature inversion in the BOB (Panakala and Sastry, 1981;Rao et al., 1983;Prabhakara et al., 1987;Thadathil et al., 2002). A large freshwater flux appeared in the upper layer as a BL formed in summer (Zeng et al., 2009), and the surface cooled rapidly in winter, forming a pycnocline. Thadathil et al. (2002) found that the inversion remained until February in the northeastern bay and that the inversion became less organized in January and almost disappeared by February in the western bay. Using an array for real-time oceanographic observations, Thompson et al. (2006) showed that the temperature inversion in the BOB peaked in February at a magnitude of 1.57\u00b0C and was nearly absent in April. In addition to the heat and freshwater fluxes across the air-sea boundary, the wind-forced advection of cold water over warm water may also be a factor in the formation of a temperature inversion (Thadathil and Ghosh, 1992). The formation of a thermal inversion suggests the confluence of different water masses in the Lakshadweep Sea, and Gopalakrishna et al. (2005) reported large differences in the life cycle and depth of occurrence of these thermal inversions between the winter of 2002/2003and that of 2003/2004. Mignot et al. (2007 used in situ temperature and salinity profiles to show that the BL in the northwestern tropical Atlantic is associated with temperature inversions of up to 0.5\u00b0C during boreal winter. Such inversions related to the BL are also reported from the areas near the southeastern China coast and north and east of the Shandong Peninsula by Hao et al. (2010). Advection of surface freshwater by a wind-driven coastal current can result in an expansion of the inversion (Hao et al., 2010). Although the inversion layer associated with the BL in the BOB exists in spring, there are few publications on surface-layer temperature inversion before the summer monsoon onset. In this study, we focus on the temperature inversion in the BOB that forms before the summer monsoon onset using cruise data and remote sensing data (section 2). Section 3 explains possible causes for the formation of the temperature inversion. The conclusions are given in section 4."}, {"section_title": "Data and methods", "text": "Two cruises were performed on board Research Vessel SHIYAN #1 in the eastern Indian Ocean during 26-30 April 2010 and 1-4 May 2011. During these two cruises, we collected data from nine Conductivity-Temperature-Depth Recorder (CTD) stations (N01-N09) along the 10\u00b0N section in the BOB in 2010 and from 13 CTD stations (S01-S13) along the 6\u00b0N section. A Seabird SBE9/11 plus CTD (accuracies for temperature of 0.002\u00b0C, salinity of 0.003%, and pressure of 0.015%) was operated up to 100 m. The processed 1-m-bin-averaged temperature (T) and salinity (S) data were used to construct T-S profiles at each station and were examined for spikes. A total of 22 profiles were obtained in this region (Fig. 1). Real-time current data were collected by a high-resolution shipmounted Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP). The ship position was maintained using a Trimble Difference Global Positioning System (DGPS), and the vessel speed was computed by GPS positions and deducted from the measured current. After the quality control, we obtained 10-m-bin-averaged current data. Other datasets were used in this study to describe the oceanography in the BOB: an objectively analyzed (1\u00b0 grid) April climatological field of in situ salinity from the World Ocean Atlas 2009 (WOA09) and high-resolution CTD/XCTD (Expendable Conductivity-Temperature-Depth) profiling floats from the World Ocean Database 2009 (WOD09), which include 146 temperature profiles in April 2010 and 164 temperature profiles in April 2011 for the BOB. After quality control, we combined the sparse data of the cruise CTD and WOA09 CTD/XCTD profiling to construct the 45-75-meter mean density field in 2010 and the 25-45-meter mean density field in 2011. Because a possible mechanism for the origin of temperature inversion is the net heat loss at the sea surface (Thompson et al., 2006), daily heat fluxes from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) Reanalysis with 2\u00b0 horizontal resolution were used to obtain the net heat flux."}, {"section_title": "Results and discussions", "text": "In accordance with Durand et al. 2004, we consider a subsurface temperature exceeding the surface temperature by at least 0.2\u00b0C as a temperature inversion. Two (N02 and N05) out of nine stations showed temperature inversions along the 10\u00b0N section (between 82\u00b0E and 92\u00b0E) in April 2010, while seven (S01, S02, S07, S08, S09, S12, and S13) out of 13 stations exhibited temperature inversions along the 6\u00b0N section (between 82\u00b0E to 92\u00b0E) in May 2011 (Table 1). Figure 1 shows that the whole bay had a low salinity (<33.5 psu) during April. The BL is a salinity-stratified layer where the density gradient (\u2202\u03c1/\u2202z) is the greatest, known as a pycnocline, at the top of the thermocline layer, acting as a barrier to vertical exchange; thus, it also affects vertical heat distribution, which plays an important role in the upper ocean. Figure 2 shows that temperature inversion along the 10\u00b0N section occurred at a greater depth (60 m) than that along the 6\u00b0N section (20-50 m). Different from previous studies, our data show that such an inversion remains until the summer monsoon onset. These inversions were all located near the pycnocline (Fig. 3). The pycnocline can stabilize the ocean surface even if a temperature inversion is present. A thick BL impedes the cold thermocline water from entering the mixed layer (Du et al., 2005). The spring inversion was due to heat variation in the upper ocean of the BOB, which included local heat flux, lateral advection, and vertical mixing. In our study, we pay attention to the role of local heat flux and lateral advection. The surface layer gained buoyancy from the colder water that was advected into the region, and it lost buoyancy because of the freshwater on top of the colder water in 2010 ( Fig. 4a), while the buoyancy flux of heat was the deciding factor in generating the temperature inversion in the bay in 2011 (Fig. 5b)."}, {"section_title": "Heat flux", "text": "The whole bay gained heat from the atmosphere in the northwestern part during 26-30 April 2010 (Fig. 4a). Thus, few temperature inversions could occur in this case. During 1-4 May 2011, however, the ocean lost heat to the atmosphere (Fig. 4b) along the 6\u00b0N section, and the surface was colder than the subsurface ocean in the southern BOB. It is possible that the generation of the temperature inversion in 2011 was mainly due to net heat loss at the ocean surface, especially with an approximately 80-90 W   m -2 net heat loss at S07-S09. In fact, the temperature inversion was present at all stations (S01-S13) along the 6\u00b0N section (not shown). The different causes of net heat flux in these two years may be due to global atmospheric circulation anomalies. The year 2010 was a post-El Ni\u00f1o year, which can lead to a dry spring in the BOB, while 2011 was a post-La Ni\u00f1a year, which can bring a rainy spring to the BOB."}, {"section_title": "Lateral advection", "text": "In addition to heat flux variation, cold-water advection is a factor in the generation of temperature inversion in the bay. The strong cyclonic (anticyclonic) gyre that prevails in this region during winter (spring) (Somayajulu et al., 2003) can produce advection that forms a temperature inversion. The currents mainly flowed westward across the isopycnal layers at N02 and N05, but they flowed along isopycnals at other stations (Figs. 5a and 5b). Thus, the N02 inversion was mainly influenced by warm salinity water from the east sinking below the cold freshwater from the west, while the N05 inversion was affected by warm salinity water from the west sinking below the cold freshwater from the east (Figs. 2a and 5a). In fact, the inversion stations exceeded 0.2\u00b0C, while inversions at S03-S06 and S10-S11 also occurred but did not exceed 0.2\u00b0C.  "}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Temperature inversions can vary spatially and temporally. We used the data of two spring cruises to discuss various processes of the formation of temperature inversions in the BOB before the summer monsoon onset, such as the stratification, freshwater flux, heat flux variation, and lateral advection. Due to the large amount of freshwater input into the bay, the near-surface layer exhibits salinity-induced stratification, which is beneficial to the formation of spring temperature inversions. There may be different processes responsible for the inversions in different years. Our results show that the inversions in 2010 were mainly induced by advection, while those in 2011 were due to net heat loss by the ocean to the atmosphere. The stratification related to BL can hamper heat transport into deep waters to form temperature inversion at the top of the thermocline through thermodynamic activity. With the presence of temperature inversions, the surface ocean may be able to supply abundant heat to the atmosphere quickly by increasing the SST, thus completing the transition from the winter monsoon to the summer monsoon. global climate change (Grant No. 2010CB950300), the National Foundation of the Indian Ocean Opening Voyage Project (Grant Nos. 41149903 and 41049908), the Knowledge Innovation Programs of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. 2011CB403504), the Knowledge Innovation Project for Distinguished Young Scholar of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. KZCX2-EW-QN203), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos.
