[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a biomarker commonly used to screen for prostate cancer. Several studies have examined PSA growth rates prior to prostate cancer diagnosis. However, the resulting estimates are highly variable. In this article we propose a non-linear Bayesian hierarchical model to combine longitudinal data on PSA growth from three different studies. Our model enables novel investigations into patterns of PSA growth that were previously impossible due to sample size limitations. The goals of our analysis are twofold: first, to characterize growth rates of PSA accounting for differences when combining data from different studies; second, to investigate the impact of clinical covariates such as advanced disease and unfavorable histology on PSA growth rates."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a biomarker widely used for the early detection of prostate cancer. Since its introduction in the late 1980s, PSA has changed the way prostate cancer is diagnosed and answered by previous studies because of their limited sample sizes. Indeed, the distinguishing feature of the combined dataset is that it has the largest collection of longitudinal PSA measures taken prior to diagnosis on disease cases. We exploit this strength to address the following question: does PSA provide information about whether a newly diagnosed prostate cancer case has disease that is likely to progress to an advanced stage if left untreated? To do this, we use our models to answer the following questions: (1) are PSA growth rates after the change-point different for cases diagnosed with early stage disease relative to those diagnosed with late-stage disease? and (2) are PSA growth rates after the change-point different for cases diagnosed with high-grade disease than for those diagnosed with low-grade disease? We allow post-change point growth rates to differ by stage and grade at diagnosis by incorporating information on these variables at the second level of the hierarchy. The clinical importance of distinguishing aggressive localized prostate cancer from indolent disease cannot be overstated. Prior studies have estimated the overdiagnosis rate due to PSA testing to range between 30% and 50%, (Etzioni et al., 2002a; Draisma et al., 2003) . This implies that 30% or more of patients diagnosed by PSA screening do not require aggressive therapy for the condition, although the majority of them will still undergo these invasive procedures. Given that the aggressive therapies for localized prostate cancer (surgery or radiation) are commonly associated with complications such as urinary incontinence and sexual and bowel dysfunction, all of which have been shown to significantly diminish quality of life (Penson et al., 2003; Potosky et al., 2000 Potosky et al., , 2002 , overdiagnosis is therefore associated with considerable morbidity that might be avoided if a reliable method were available that could distinguish aggressive from indolent disease given information available at the time of diagnosis.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide a brief description of the studies in our meta-analysis. We describe Bayesian hierarchical change-point models in Section 3. We present model fit results in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5 we present some conclusions and directions for further work."}, {"section_title": "RETROSPECTIVE STUDIES", "text": "Our models combine data from three studies: namely, the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trials (NPCT), the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA).

Moreover, the eligibility criteria required that subjects had a five year life expectancy and no internal malignancies treated within the previous five years, and no histories of significant liver or kidney disease.\nSubjects were randomized from 1983 through 1992 to receive either placebo or a nutritional dosage of selenium daily. Participants were scheduled to return to the clinic every six months for dermatological examinations, a blood draw, and evaluation for signs of selenium toxicity. The primary outcome was incidence of basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. Secondary endpoints, established in 1990, were all-cause mortality, total cancer mortality, total cancer incidence, and incidences of lung, prostate and colorectal cancers. In particular, PSA levels were determined retrospectively from frozen plasma samples using the Abbott Diagnostics IMx PSA assay (Abbott Park, IL)."}, {"section_title": "The Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET)", "text": "This double-blind trial conducted from 1988-96 was aimed at evaluating the chemopreventive efficacy and safety of beta-carotene and retinol in a population at risk for lung cancer. Blood was obtained at randomization and yearly during a pilot period and every two years thereafter. Prostate cancer screening or management of prostate cancer was not part of CARET; thus all diagnoses of prostate cancer were made within the patients' regular health care system.\nFor the PSA substudy (Ellis et al., 2001) , cases were selected from the group of 336 CARET participants diagnosed with prostate carcinoma between January 1985 and May 1997. From this group 90 men were identified who were between 50 and 65 years old at randomization with more than one serum specimen obtained before cancer diagnosis. Controls were men 50 to 65 years old at randomization without a subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer or lung cancer. All controls had serum available from a pre-randomization visit and at least two subsequent blood specimens. Serum was stored at \u221270 \u2022 C until assay. Total and free serum PSA was determined by the Abbott Diagnostics AxSYM PSA assay (Abbott Park, IL).\nChart abstraction was performed by a single investigator. Chart data consisted of medical records forwarded to CARET investigators by treating physicians. These data included clinical reports indicating the initial events leading to diagnosis as well as surgical, pathological and radiological reports describing tumor staging. From these records tumor clinical and pathological stage, and Gleason grade were recorded. Staging was done according to 1997 American Joint Commission on Cancer TNM criteria.\nIn 70 cases at least three measurements were made before diagnosis and in 62 controls at least three measurements were made before the matched case diagnosis. Among the initial events leading to the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma was abnormal digital rectal examination in 60 men, abnormal PSA in 70, voiding symptoms in 17 and other events in four. In some patients multiple events led to the diagnosis of cancer. In 18 cases PSA and in 14 digital rectal examination was recorded as the only event leading to diagnosis. These values imply that screening for prostate cancer may have led to diagnosis in some cases."}, {"section_title": "The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA)", "text": "The BLSA began in 1958 to study normal human aging (Shock et al., 1984) . The BLSA is an ongoing multi-disciplinary study of community-dwelling volunteers with the continued recruitment of new participants to replace other participants who leave the study due to death or dropping out. Participants in the BLSA return to the study center every two years for three days of free biomedical and psychological examinations. To date, over 1500 men with an average of about eight visits to the study center and 13 years of follow-up and approximately 900 women (women were first studied in 1978) with an average of about four visits and seven years of follow-up have participated in the study. The study participants are mostly white (95%), well educated (at least 75% have a college degree), and financially comfortable (82%). Besides describing human physiological changes that occur with age, the study has also been beneficial in helping examine differences between normal aging and disease processes.\nThe serum PSA levels have been measured in male BLSA participants either at the time of routine subject visits (since 1991) or using a frozen serum bank for available retrospective samples (before 1991) donated at participant visits. This study uses PSA data on men prior to the development of prostate cancer. PSA levels were determined using Tandem-R (Hybritech) assays."}, {"section_title": "Data aspects", "text": "In all studies described above, retrospective longitudinal PSA measurements were available for all prostate cancer cases along with the clinical stage of the disease at diagnosis. Clinical stage is categorized into local or metastatic stage of the disease. Disease grade was available for a subset of prostate cancer patients. In our analysis, low grade reflects Gleason score lower than or equal to 6, while high grade means Gleason score higher than 6. All studies also included normal patients. Table 1 summarizes the information available from each study. Here we only consider the data for patients who had at least two longitudinal measurements of PSA. Figure 1 shows the longitudinal profiles of PSA (log-transformed) for prostate cancer patients as a function of age by study and stage of the disease. The data indicate that PSA levels increase, but that the growth rate may not be constant in prostate cancer patients. Though not shown here, longitudinal profiles of (log-transformed) PSA indicate a linear increase of PSA when considering normal patients.\nThough we were not dealing with screening studies, because of the time period in which they took place, some men may have had PSA screening. However, our dataset does not contain information that identifies who had PSA screening. Moreover, in our dataset the last measurement of PSA in each patient, though closest to diagnosis, may be different from PSA measured at detection.\nFinally, we note that these studies not only differ in their designs, but also in the way PSA levels were determined. Each study used a different reagent kit; the BLSA used the Tandem-R assay (produced by Hybritech), the NPCT used the IMx assay, and the CARET study used the AxSYM assay (both AxSYM and IMx are produced by Abbott laboratories). Several studies (Leewansangtong et al., 1998; Oesterling et al., 1995; Brawer et al., 1997) have confirmed that the different assays produce highly correlated, although not always equivalent, results.\nOur models, while borrowing the information across studies, account for the specific study differences through a hierarchical structure which we describe in the next section."}, {"section_title": "MODEL SPECIFICATION", "text": "Let S denote the total number of studies considered for meta-analysis. Any particular study is indexed by s(s = 1, . . . , S) and contains N s individuals. Therefore, the overall number of patients is N = S s=1 N s . Similarly, let i(i = 1, . . . , N s ) denote the subject index in study s. Subject i has n i measurements indexed by j ( j = 1, . . . , n i ).\nSerial measurements of PSA are available along with individuals' age at which the serum was sampled. Let y s i j = log(P S A s i j + 1) denote the (log-transformed) PSA level observed at age t s i j . In particular, for prostate cancer cases, let t s i0 denote the age closest to disease diagnosis for patient i in study s. To address questions formulated in Section 1 we consider Bayesian hierarchical models. From a Bayesian perspective, such models are fully specified with (1) a model for PSA growth described by p(y s i j |\u03b8\n2) a model for the inter-patient variation described by p(\u03b8 s i |\u03b8 s ), (3) a model for the intra-study variation p(\u03b8 s |\u03b8), and finally (4) a model for the inter-study variability p (\u03b8) .\nIn what follows we describe the non-linearity of PSA growth rates with patient-specific change-point models. We formally combine the individual non-linear regression models with a hierarchical model. There is an extensive literature on Bayesian hierarchical change-point models. Earlier developments with discrete change-points include, for example, Booth and Smith (1982) and Carlin et al. (1992) ; while for continuous change points, see Stephens (1994) ; Slate and Cronin (1997) and Slate and Turnbull (2000) .\nOur models extend earlier approaches to the analysis of PSA growth in several directions; first, by formally addressing the study-to-study variability in PSA growth, and second, by allowing for different post-change point growth rates depending on subject-specific disease prognosis. Finally, we note that we model PSA as a function of age as opposed to years prior to diagnosis (Morrell et al., 1995; Slate and Clark, 1999; Slate and Turnbull, 2000) . This time-scale is flexible in that it allows us to present results as a function of years prior to diagnosis, but it also allows prediction of transitions on a scale that is appropriate when building natural history models. At the individual level, we propose the following non-linear model to describe growth of log(P S A + 1) as a function of age:\nwhere x + = max(0, x) and the error terms \u03b5 i j are assumed independent and identically distributed with Normal(0, \u03c3 2 ): that is, a normal distribution with mean zero and variance \u03c3 2 . We assume that 1/\u03c3 2 \u223c Gamma(r \u03c3 , s \u03c3 ), where r \u03c3 and s \u03c3 are known hyperparameters. (Here, Gamma(a, b) denotes a Gamma distribution with mean ab \u22121 and variance ab \u22122 .) In words, equation (1) describes the growth of log(P S A+1). In normal patients the growth is constant over time, while in prostate cancer patients a piecewise model describes the growth, with \u03c4 i denoting a change-point in the growth rate for patient i. Under this model, the growth of log(P S A + 1) for patient i in study s is described by a linear model with intercept b s 0i and slope b s 1i . A prostate cancer patient has a transition at \u03c4 i and experiences a change in the slope by b s 2i after \u03c4 i . In summary, PSA growth for a normal individual i in study s is characterized by a patient-specific parameter vector \u03b8\nwhile for prostate cancer patients we have \u03b8\nImplicit in this formulation is the assumption that all prostate cancer patients experience a change-point in the growth rates and that normal patients do not experience a change-point at all. Moreover, the intercept is defined for 20 year-old men.\nThough patients' change-point times are never observed, each prostate cancer patient contributes interval-censored information that a change-point occurred before diagnosis of the disease at age t s i0 . This is formalized with a probability model that assigns probability mass one to the event {\u03c4 i < t s i0 }."}, {"section_title": "Hierarchical model", "text": "To combine subject-specific non-linear regression models p(y s i j |\u03b8 s i ) defined in Section 3.1 we specify a model p(\u03b8 s i |\u03b8 s ): that is, a model that explains the variation of the subject-specific parameters within studies. Let X i be the subject-specific indicator variable for advanced stage disease. (Later, we specify a similar model for high-versus low-grade disease.) At the second stage of the hierarchical model we assume that\nwhere i = 1, . . . , N s is the patient index, and s = 1, . . . , S is the study index. That is, we assume that within a study, all patients share the same mean intercept and mean pre-change point slope. However, patients with advanced disease (metastasis) at diagnosis may have a further increment in the mean postchange point slope. We note that the subject-specific parameters are allowed to vary from individual to individual in the same study. Here, the study-specific parameters are denoted by\nWe combine the study-specific parameters by specifying a model for p(\u03b8 s |\u03b8) where \u03b8 denotes the population parameters, that is \u03b8 = (\u03b2 0 , \u03b2 1 , \u03b2 2 , \u03b3 ) .

Priors set on parameters associated with means were centered at zero, while those associated with precisions were centered at one. Posterior distributions of the model parameters, while not available in closed analytical form, can be obtained with Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Full conditional distributions are available in closed form for all parameters, except for the subject-specific change-point parameters \u03c4 i . We implemented a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm; within a Gibbs sampling algorithm (Geman and Geman, 1984; Gelfand and Smith, 1990 ), the updating of \u03c4 i was performed using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Metropolis et al., 1953) . To obtain samples from the posterior distribution of all parameters, we ran our Markov chain for a burn-in period of 1000 000 iterations, followed by additional 250 000 iterations from which we stored sampled values at every 50th iteration.\nAs we will see in the next section, we also consider posterior predictive distributions. Those can be obtained using our posterior samples and the composition method (Tanner, 1996, p. 2) . For example, suppose one is interested in the posterior predictive distribution of \u03c4 for a patient who is not in our combined dataset. This is an out-of-sample prediction formalized by\nwhere D denotes our combined data and we have assumed that \u03c4 is conditionally independent of D given (\u00b5, \u03c3 2 \u03c4 ). Note that this calculation does not use information about PSA readings, nor age at diagnosis, for this new patient. Hence, this posterior predictive distribution applies to the population of all new patients, not any specific patient. Since, in particular, the age at diagnosis is unknown, we obtain samples from p(\u03c4 | D) by using posterior samples for (\u00b5, \u03c3 2 \u03c4 ) and drawing \u03c4 given (\u00b5, \u03c3 2 \u03c4 ) from the untruncated LogNormal(\u00b5, \u03c3 2 \u03c4 )."}, {"section_title": "MODEL ASSESSMENT", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Comparing alternative models", "text": "In this section we justify the model proposed in Section 3 which we denote by M 0 . This model allows for post change-point slopes to depend on disease prognosis as defined by the patient's clinical stage of the disease. We defined three alternative models to assess whether not only the post-changepoint slopes, but also the change-points varied with stage. In the first alternative model M 1 we assumed that both the changepoint and the post change-point slopes do not depend on disease prognosis. In symbols, model M 1 assumes that \u03b3 s \u2261 0. Our second alternative model M 2 allowed for stage-dependent change-points, but that post change-point slopes are not stage dependent, that is, only \u03b3 s \u2261 0, but\nwhere X i is the indicator of advanced disease for patient i. We complete the hierarchical formulation by assuming\n). Finally, our third alternative model M 3 allowed for stagedependent change-points and post change-point slopes, that is, it combines the model describing M 0 with the hierarchical structure for the change-point described above for M 2 .\nFrom a Bayesian viewpoint, one may use Bayes factors (Kass and Raftery, 1995) for model comparison. Let D denote the data. To compare models M 0 and M 1 , the Bayes factor is the ratio B F 0,1 = P(D|M 0 )/P(D|M 1 ). Using the output from our MCMC analysis, we can compute the Bayes factors using harmonic means to compute\nwhere M is the number of posterior samples (\u03b8 i , i = 1, . . . , M) under model k. We obtain 2 log B F 0,1 = 12.26. Kass and Raftery (1995) provide guidelines for the interpretation of Bayes factors. We found 2 log B F 0,1 > 10, suggesting a decisive preference for M 0 over M 1 . Similarly, we obtained 2 log B F 0,3 > 10, again suggesting a decisive preference for model M 0 over M 3 . When comparing M 0 and M 2 we obtain 2 log B F 0,2 = 7.30, still showing a strong evidence favoring model M 0 ."}, {"section_title": "Data analysis", "text": "We fit the hierarchical model from Section 3 to the data from the three studies. Figure 2 shows 95% credible intervals for some subject-specific parameters. The left panel displays change-points in years prior to prostate cancer diagnosis and indicates that patients with metastatic disease are likely to have transitions occurring later in time (i.e. closer to disease diagnosis) as opposed to patients with local disease. A larger variability is, however, usually associated with the change-point in patients with local disease. The right panel of Figure 2 shows that the growth rates of PSA post change-points are somewhat higher for patients with metastatic disease than those with local disease. This plot also highlights betweenstudy differences; the results suggest that post-change-point slopes for metastatic patients were highest for the CARET study, and considerably lower for the other two studies. This may be due to between-study differences in the definition of localized and metastatic disease. Figure 3 shows the posterior medians of the subject-specific change-points versus the posterior medians of the subject-specific post changepoints slopes, indicating that in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, transitions occur at times closer to diagnosis and that the transition is followed by a higher growth rate. Though this plot ignores the variability in the posterior distributions, it shows a relatively good separation of the two groups of patients. used in clinical practice as indicative of a possible prostate cancer disease. This figure shows that most patients experience a transition at levels of PSA lower than the clinical threshold. Posterior distributions of the study-level, post-change-point slopes for patients with local disease (that is, \u03b2 s 2 , s = 1, 2, 3) are very similar between studies. However, for patients with metastatic disease (that is, \u03b2 s 2 + \u03b3 s ) the posterior distributions show a much larger variability; moreover, between-study differences are clearly apparent. The posterior distributions of the population parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3 place a large probability mass on the positive range (probabilities equal to 0.99 and 0.93, respectively). Table 2 summarizes the posterior distributions of the study-specific and population parameters. We chose to fit our models to log(P S A + 1); this has been the scale used by others in analysis of PSA data, presumably to reduce skewness while avoiding indeterminate values (Morrell et al., 1995; Slate and Clark, 1999; Slate and Turnbull, 2000) . For interpretation purposes, log(P S A) may be preferable, because its inverse transformation provides estimated relative growth rates in the original measurement scale (i.e. as the annual percentage change in PSA). To estimate these relative growth rates, we fit our model to the response y = log(P S A), with zero values (n = 10) being replaced by the minimum value of PSA in the dataset. We found that PSA increases by an estimated 2.24% per year prior to the change-point; this is similar to the estimate of 3.2% from Oesterling et al. (1993) which was derived from a population without a prostate cancer diagnosis. After the change-point, PSA increases by 15.31% per year for patients with local disease, and by 63.09% per year for patients with advanced metastatic disease.\nThe posterior predictive distribution of age at transition is shown in the left panel of Figure 5 . The posterior predictive mode of the distribution is at age 57.25 (the lower and upper boundaries of the 95% credibility intervals are 42.90 and 91.06 years, respectively). The right panel of Figure 5 shows the predictive PSA trajectory for a new patient by disease prognosis. Figure 6 shows the posterior predictive PSA trajectories for a new patient within each of the studies. The full lines show the posterior predictive median trajectory, while the dotted lines show the boundaries of the 95% credibility intervals. Figure 7 shows the 95% posterior predictive PSA trajectories for some randomly selected patients. Left side panels correspond to trajectories for some of the local patients, while right side panels correspond to trajectories for some of the metastatic patients in our combined dataset."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "In this analysis we used a non-linear Bayesian hierarchical model to combine longitudinal data on PSA growth from three different studies. Our model accounts for the study-to-study variability as well as the variability between and within patients. In the first level of the hierarchy-the individual level-we considered a change-point model to accommodate the non-linearity of PSA growth in cancer patients. We then incorporated information on disease stage at the second level of the hierarchical model. Our analysis allowed us to combine information across studies to obtain estimates of PSA growth that are more reliable than those based on a single study, while also identifying between-study differences. The combination of data across studies also provided us with some key insights that are highly relevant from a clinical perspective. First, we found that for most patients, the change-point occurs at PSA levels below 4.0 ng ml \u22121 , which is the standard threshold for a positive test. Assuming that the change-point does indeed represent a biological transition from a healthy to a neoplastic state, this finding is in concurrence with recent studies that have observed a non-trivial frequency of prostate cancer cases with PSA levels below this standard threshold (e.g. Punglia et al., 2003) . Second, our comparison of PSA growth patterns between cases with localized and metastatic disease at diagnosis suggested that the PSA growth rates after a transition point differ for localized and metastatic cases. In particular, the post-change-point growth rates appear to be considerably higher on average for cases destined to be diagnosed with metastatic disease. This finding has clear implications for determining prognosis among newly diagnosed cases, suggesting that patients with high PSA are more likely to be candidates for aggressive therapy than those with slowly increasing levels of PSA. Moreover, it also has important implications for early detection, because it suggests that metastatic disease may be biologically different to localized disease. The basic premise underlying early detection is that metastatic disease diagnosed while still localized is as treatable as localized disease. However, if metastatic disease is biologically different to localized disease from the time of disease onset, this premise may not always hold. It is possible that our higher growth rates among metastatic cases could reflect the presence of a second change-point with accelerated growth after that time. We considered a two-change-point model, but found our estimates under this model to be highly variable due to the limited number of metastatic cases in the dataset.\nOur analysis compared cases staged clinically as localized or metastatic. It is known, however, that many cancers are clinically under-staged. Partin et al. (1997) report that of approximately 60% of men believed to have organ-confined disease and who have surgery, fewer than 50% of them are confirmed to have local disease on final pathological analysis. Using pathological stage instead of clinical stage could improve the estimation of PSA growth. However, information on pathological stage is only available for patients who undergo surgery and this information is not available for most of our patients. Our models could be expanded to deal with missing information on pathological stage or, alternatively, mis-classification of clinical stage. However, the results shown in Figure 3 do not indicate clear misclassification patterns. As an alternative to stage, one could consider other prognostic variables for studying PSA growth such as the Gleason score. It is known that prostate cancer patients with low Gleason score (less than or equal to 6) have a considerably better disease prognosis than those with high Gleason score. Using our hierarchical Bayesian change-point model to investigate PSA growth by Gleason score we found that patients with a high Gleason score tended to exhibit higher post-change-point slopes than those with low Gleason score, but the difference in post-change-point slopes between cases with low-and high-grade disease was not as extreme as the difference observed between cases with early-and late-stage disease (see Figures 8 and 9 ).\nWhile our analysis yields important new insights into the natural history of prostate cancer and PSA, it is subject to some limitations. The Bayesian hierarchical framework is based on a parametric model and imposes constraints on the correlation structure among observations from the same individual or study. However, such models also allow detailed estimates of within-and between-individual variation-which are needed for simulation modeling of prostate cancer. Moreover, the ability of hierarchical modeling to provide population-level parameter estimates with any degree of precision is limited by the number of studies (regardless of the estimation technique used). In the present analysis, data were available from three studies, which resulted in population estimates that were considerably less precise that the studyspecific estimates. Consequently, we have presented many of our results by study which has also enabled us to understand study-to-study variability. We hope in the future to add at least one more study to the meta-analysis.\nIn conclusion, the Bayesian hierarchical framework has enabled us to combine data on PSA from multiple studies, yielding novel insights about the disease process in prostate cancer, as reflected by PSA growth. Findings from the current study provide insight into the evolving natural history of a patient's prostate cancer and may allow clinicians to more accurately determine which patients are more likely to have indolent disease and which have more biologically aggressive tumors. This, in turn, may result in more selective application of aggressive therapy, restricting the risk of adverse outcomes to men who are most likely to benefit from these treatments, and, therefore, improving quality of life for all men with prostate cancer.
