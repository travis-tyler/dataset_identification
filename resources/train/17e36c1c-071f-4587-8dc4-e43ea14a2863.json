Since 21 st Century, the education system of Indonesia has been strategically reformed to be more competitive. However, the rank of Indonesia was 48 out of 56 countries in reading, 52 in science, and 51 in mathematics in 2006. The rank of Indonesia was 36 out of 49 countries in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and ranked 35 in science in 2007. This data indicated that Indonesian students still rank low on international standardized tests. The fact demonstrates that Indonesia must concentrate on ensuring high quality of education to improve access and performance. Generally, public sector organizations tend to be more cautious and more concerned with rules and regulations [5] . The business school has been using computer to support learning significantly, which IT professionals are trained and prepared to meet industry [13] . A business must manage the use of information correctly, as the data was collected either personally or through mail to meet the demands of the changing world.\nEducational and school councils were eager to make education become more productive. Bandur [2] mentioned that Indonesia school council has been empowered to design strategic planning for school development, determine learning standards in the school, and decide on the provision of incentives to the principal, teachers, and administrative staff, etc., with the guidelines of the Ministry of National Demir [8] mentioned that SMIS computerized the basic subject of today's school management and SMIS aims to provide support for the managing and educational activities of the school managers by processing information. Also it is needed to describe the process of http://dx.doi.org/10.5392/IJoC.2014.10.2.067 school business. ARIS is the business process modeling tool that provides a \"complete\" description of a business process [1] by using EPC (Event-driven Process Chain) model. But ARIS is not, strictly speaking, a tool, but a concept [7] . EPC model consists of sequence of events triggering business function [17] , which provides comprehensive means for modeling the relevant aspects of business process [15] , and becomes the central model for all business modeling in ARIS.\nIn addition, Davis [7] remarked that ARIS has supported for modeling software system using UML. UML is a standard language for writing software blueprint, and a common standard for object-oriented modeling, which can help to represent a complex system as a set of simple diagram, charts, and narratives [3] , [11] , [17] .\nTo manage the school organization, this paper aims to develop a SMIS based on the Indonesian National Education Standards by using ARIS and use the school information efficiently. Finally, a design of the new system will be built by using UML, and this new system conforms to the education rules of government."}, {"section_title": "EDUCATION SYSTEM OF INDONESIA", "text": "Related to Kelegai and Middleton [13] on education, they stated that policy makers must have confidence that educational institutions are able to produce people to meet the demands of the changing world and the people are trained and prepared to meet industry needs and especially school industry. The quality of the education must be supported by existing organizations and adjusted according to the rules of the country for example, the rules of Indonesian Education System. They mentioned that common elements of information policy, includes: identifying the information needs of the nation, devising ways of achieving these needs, and promoting effective use of the resulting service. Most of the elements are presented in the National Education Standards, which education sector of Indonesia is used to manage the education industry of the country.\nAccording to Republic of Indonesia laws Number 20 of 2003 about National Education Systems, Indonesia has the porridge of education as follows: basic education, secondary education, and higher education."}, {"section_title": "Basic Education", "text": "Basic education [16] "}, {"section_title": "Secondary Education", "text": "Secondary education [16] "}, {"section_title": "Fig. 1.

Thereafter, user can directly work with another menu, which is part of the selection. After user finished that work, the system will update the data, and the if-else condition is appeared.

The other work that the administrator can do is input data, such as the school provision, which there are six parts of the provision, etc. The administrator also should select the provision that is entered by the educator.

The third object is Database:Management, that each process in Management Standards will be connected to this object. As shown in Fig. 9 , the administrator has 5 use cases, and the administrator can work for input the information that user needed in the SMIS. When the administrator met the message in administrator menu, the actor chooses one selection, and then the data will be verified in planning program and work plan side. Thereafter, each data are updated in the Database:Management of SMIS. After the user finished using the system of planning program and work plan, then the user can exit the program, and the SMIS program will be closed."}, {"section_title": "CONCLUSION", "text": "In the future research, there are several topics that can be developed. The first, SMK/MAK or Vocational Senior Secondary School is not considered in this paper. The SMK current development in Indonesia has begun to increase. Therefore, applying the SMIS to the SMK/MAK can be done with real data collection and more detailed analysis. The second, there are two standards of NES had been developed. The other six standards of NES are important to meet the greatest SMIS for Indonesian school. These six new systems Standard of NES can be more specific by using the UML diagram. The third, this analysis of process need to be proved by using questionnaire for each school environment, and directly interview to the headmaster, so that the accuracy of the data to be analysis can be improved. Thereafter, the analysis by ARIS can be more detailed by added another function, such as organization, and EPC tools (database, documents, etc.) that provided by ARIS software. The fourth, the design of new system in this paper is using two diagrams: use case diagram and sequence diagram. To make the design more complete and flexible, the other diagram such as class diagram, activity diagram, and another diagram that the system needed can be added. The fifth, the new system in this paper is a prototype of the scenario of the developing system that presented in UML diagram. The programming solution can be added to make the new system can be applied in the real life, by using programming language, with object oriented approach. The last, maximizing the usefulness of information must be collected, considering the development of SMIS at present day can be change at any time. Web-based and network system can be proved in the Indonesian SMIS, by centered on the nation's capital, which is information derived from the subsections in each region of Indonesia. The SMIS would support a better result, especially in determination of decision, collection of information at the running time, and reduce cost of transportation (because the information that user needed, can be access at any time and any place)."}]
