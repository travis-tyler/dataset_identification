[{"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "Adoption of technology is an extensively studied topic in agricultural economics. A large volume of empirical literature has identified a wide range of factors that influence technology adoption decisions by farmers. Among such factors, education may be one of the most frequently used variables in empirical models perhaps because it also is one of the most theoretically uncontroversial factors to positively influence technology adoption. In general, farmers with higher education have better access to information and knowledge that are beneficial to farming operation. They also tend to possess higher analytic capability of the information and knowledge necessary to successfully implement new technology and realize expected results. Hence, higher education allows farmers to make efficient adoption decision Rahm and Huffman, 1984 and be the early adopters who can take advantage of new technology and profit most from it Gardner and Rausser, 2001 . Highly educated farmers also tend to adopt technology with greater intensity Saha, et al., 1994 . The objective of this study, however, is to challenge this conventional brief. We believe that it is theoretically possible that education could potentially have a negative effect on technology adoption in agriculture. Education increases farmers' human capital and gives them more lucrative employment opportunities off the farm, which in turn decreases the managerial time on farm to implement new technologies and realize the expected results. This is particularly true for management intensive technologies. This study empirically examines this theory. Considering the facts that the number of farmers with college education has been steadily increasing over the last 50 years Mishra, et al., 2009 and increasing share of farm household income is from off-farm sources Fernandez-Cornejo, 2007 , it is crucial to accurately assess the net effect of education on technology adoption in the context of labor allocation between on and off the farm by farm households. In so doing, we estimate a simultaneous equations model that coalesce labor allocation and technology adoption models using 2006 Agricultural Resource Management Survey ARMS data. Technologies considered in this study are precision farming as a representative of management intensive technology and genetically modified GM crops as a representative of management saving technology. We estimate this model following the procedure suggested by Nelson and Olson 1978 to obtain asymptotically consistent estimates of parameters of our interest. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews existing literature on the relationship between education, technology adoption and off-farm labor supply in agriculture. Section III provides analytical framework, followed by empirical results in Section IV. The final section offer concluding remarks."}, {"section_title": "II. Literature Review", "text": "In order to lay a comprehensive theoretical foundation about the net effect of education on technology adoption, we attempt to unite findings from three different topics in agricultural economics literature. We first review empirical findings about the effect of education on technology adoption, followed by the effect of education on off-farm labor supply. Finally, we shed light on recent studies that account for these two effects in a single model to explain simultaneous decision making process through which farmers allocate their time between off-farm and on-farm labor, including technology adoption."}, {"section_title": "Education and Adoption", "text": "A number of empirical studies have shown the positive effect of education on adoption of various types of technology in agriculture. For example, education is found to have a positive impact on adoption of forward pricing methods Goodwin and Schroeder, 1994, computer technology Huffman and Mercier, 1991, Putler and Zilberman, 1988 of the internet Mishra and Park, 2005, Mishra, et al., 2009, precision farming Roberts, et al., 2004, genetically engineered corn Fernandez-Cornejo, et al., 2001 , soil nitrogen testing Fuglie andBosch, 1995 , conservation practices Traore, et al., 1998 and the level of participation in government-supported conservation programs Lambert, et al., 2007 , to name a few. At the same time, there are also some empirical studies that found insignificant or even negative effect of education on technology adoption. Farmers' education has insignificant effect on adoption of variable rate technology Khanna, 2001 and GPS guidance system for cotton farmers Banerjee, et al., 2008 . Nyaupane andGillespie 2009 identified factors affecting adoption of best management practices BMP for Louisiana crawfish producers, but education was found to be insignificant for adoption of all but one BMP, with which education found to be negatively correlated."}, {"section_title": "Gould et al. 1989 studied factors affecting adoption of conservation tillage for", "text": "Wisconsin farmers. They unexpectedly found that education is negatively correlated with adoption, holding constant of other factors such as the proportion of off-farm work time to on-farm work time, among others. This implies that highly educated farmers are less likely to adopt conservation tillage, given the same proportion of off and on farm work time. Because highly educated farmers are more likely to earn higher wages from off-farm work, they are expected to have a higher proportion of off-farm income to on-farm income given the same proportion of on and off farm work time. Therefore, it seems sensible if highly educated farmers, who are more reliant on off-farm income, have fewer incentives to spend time and effort for farming, including adoption of technology such as conservation tillage. As these examples show, the effect of education on technology adoption in empirical literature has yet to reach consensus consistent with the economic theory. Nonetheless, little attention has been paid to explore the reasons for such incoherent findings, perhaps because the underlying theory seems intuitively too appealing to refute."}, {"section_title": "Education and Off Farm Labor Supply", "text": "One possible explanation for the inconsistent empirical results about the effect of education on technology adoption may be attributed to the relationship between education and off-farm labor. Highly educated farmers are expected to work more off the farm, ceteris paribus, as human capital accumulated through longer years of formal education becomes an advantage to find more lucrative off-farm employment opportunities, which makes farming relatively less attractive. Theoretically, however, the effect of education on off-farm labor supply is ambiguous; while higher education increases more attractive employment opportunities off the farm, farms with highly educated operator may realize higher productivity in farming operation and thus reservation wage to work off-farm for such operators may be high Hallberg, et al., 1991, Huffman andLange, 1989 . The existing literature has mostly found that education is positively correlated with both off-farm labor participation and the intensity of off-farm work Huffman, 1980, Huffman andLange, 1989 , indicating that the marginal effect of education on off-farm wage is higher than the marginal effect of education on the reservation wage. For instance, Goodwin and Mishra 2004 found a strong and positive effect of education on off-farm labor participation; an additional year of education leads an increase in annual off-farm labor supply by fifteen hours. Huffman 1980 estimated the effect of education on the odds ratio of off-farm work participation and the number of days worked off-farm by farm operators. The study found a positive and significant effect of education on both the odds ratio and the number of days working off-farm by operator. From theoretical standpoint, there are two seemingly contradicting effects of education on technology adoption. On one hand, higher education leads to more technology adoption, but on the other hand, higher education increases off-farm labor supply, which inevitably affects on-farm labor supply available for technology adoption. Mixed findings about the effect of education on technology adoption in empirical literature can perhaps be attributed to the fact that conventional technology adoption models do not fully account for the role of off-farm labor supply. has a significant effect on adoption of yield monitor as it was not their primary interest. In this study, we extend models developed by Fernandez-Cornejo 2007 andFernandez-Cornejo et. al. 2005 to estimate the net effect of education on adoption of two different technology: herbicide tolerant HT crops and precision farming. We do so by including in our model the interaction between farm size and education. The correlation between adoption, education and farm size is of particular interest because small farms are more likely to work off-farm Fernandez-Cornejo, 2007 and less likely to adopt management intensive technology Fernandez-Cornejo, et al., 2001, Saha, et al., 1994 Therefore, one can capture the net effect of education that varies across farm sizes."}, {"section_title": "III. Analytical Framework 1 General Representation of Simultaneous Equations Model", "text": "Following Judge et al., 1984 , a system of simultaneous equations that consists of equations representing endogenous variables each with observations can be generally expressed as follows: , where is a matrix of observations on endogenous variables, \u0393 is a matrix of unknown parameters for endogenous variables, is a matrix of observations on exogenous variables, \u0392 is a matrix of unknown parameters for exogenous variables, is a matrix of error terms, and 0 is a matrix all of whose elements are zero. For the purpose of exposition, we partition , and where , and represents th and th column of corresponding matrix. We also express elements of \u0393 and \u0392 in corresponding lower case letters. Then, 1 can be rewritten as follows: Multiplying and summing up matrices on LHS of 2 yields a matrix. We can rewrite 2 as 0.

We first estimate the reduced form equation of (8) in which endogenous variables, and , are absent. We employ Tobit model as the dependent variable, annual off-farm working hours by operators, is a censored variable bounded from below at zero. Then, we obtain linear prediction of the latent variable, y , which is used as an instrument in the second stage estimation of adoption of GM crops and precision farming by bivariate probit model."}, {"section_title": "Interaction between Education and Farm Size", "text": "The primary interest of this study lies in estimating the effect on technology adoption of the interaction between education and farm sizes. A common approach to incorporate an interaction of two variables into a regression model is to assume that the 12 shows that is now dependent on as well as a new regressor that is a product of the two variables of interest, and . However, following this method and creating a product of education and farm size would not allow us to fully capture the potential interaction between education and farm size. This is because we expect that the coefficient of the interaction term, equivalent to in 12 in the above example, will not be a constant. Therefore, instead of simply creating a product of the two variables, we employed the following steps to estimate the interaction between the two variables. First, as a measurement of farm size, we select gross cash farm income gcfi . Next, we create dummy variables for each quartile of gcfi. Then we multiply each of the four dummy variables with education to create four interaction variables each of which represents different levels of farm size in terms of farm income. We include three dummy variables, each representing second, third and fourth quartile of farm size, into the regression model and assume coefficient of each dummy variable is associated with education as in 11 2 . For the lowest quartile interaction variable, for example, we expect the sign of coefficient to be smaller than those for higher quartile interactions. This is because, for smaller farms, more educated operators are likely to work more off-farm and thus adopt fewer technologies. For the highest quartile, on the other hand, we expect the sign of coefficient to be more elusive 3 . The point we wish to clarify here is that we expect the effects of interaction between farm size and education to be different for small farms with higher education and large farms with lower education. If this is the case, simply multiplying education and farm size does not capture such conflicting effects. number of similar farms, the particular number being the survey expansion factor or the inverse of the probability of the surveyed farm being selected for surveying , and is referred to henceforth as survey weight, or w i i 1, \u2026, n, where n denotes sample size . To demonstrate, the size of the samples considered in the analysis was 6,457 which when properly expanded using survey weights yielded populations of farm operator households totaling 387,651. The ARMS collects data to measure the financial condition farm income, expenses, assets, and debt and operating characteristics of farm businesses, the cost of producing agricultural commodities, and the well-being of farm operator households. The 2006 ARMS also collected information on farm households; in addition to farm economic data, the survey contains detailed information on off-farm hours worked by spouses and which large farm operators commit to farming may be even stronger for those operators with lower education as they will not have as many attractive off-farm employment opportunities as highly educated counterparts do. farm operators, the amount of income received from off-farm work, net cash income from operating another farm/ranch, net cash income from operating another business, and net income from share renting. The target population of the survey is operators associated with farm businesses representing agricultural production in the 48 contiguous states. A farm is defined as an establishment that sold or normally would have sold at least $1,000 of agricultural products during the year. Farms can be organized as sole proprietorships, partnerships, family corporations, non-family corporations, or cooperatives. Data are collected from one operator per farm, the senior farm operator. A senior farm operator is the operator who makes the majority of the day-to-day management decisions. For the purpose of this study, operator households organized as nonfamily corporations or cooperatives and farms run by hired managers were excluded. Table 1 provides the complete list of variables used in this study, their definitions and descriptive statistics. Finally, following Goodwin and Mishra 2004 we adopt a bootstrapping approach that consistently accounts for the stratification inherent in the survey design 4 . The ARMS database contains a population-weighting factor that indicates the number of farms in the population i.e., all U.S. farms represented by each individual observation. We utilize the weighting population-weighting factor factor in a probability weighted bootstrapping procedure. Specifically, the data selecting N observations from the sample data are sampled with replacement. The models are estimated using the pseudo sample of data. This process is repeated a large number of times and estimates of the parameters and their variances are given by sample means and variance of the replicated estimates. We utilize 2,000 replications in the application that follows."}, {"section_title": "IV. Results and Discussion", "text": "Maximum likelihood estimate of the first stage Tobit model of off-farm working hours is provided in Coefficients of education and interaction between education and farm size are partially inconsistent with our expectation but they nonetheless provide interesting results. First, for adoption of precision farming, coefficient of education educ is found to be insignificant in explaining adoption of precision farming table 3 . Note that this coefficient represents the effect of education on adoption of precision farming for farms whose gross cash farm income belongs to the first quartile benchmark group . This means that, for small farms whose income is lower than the 25 th percentile, education has no significant effect on adoption of precision farming. Coefficients of three interaction terms educ_q2, educ_q3, educ_q4 are all positive and significant and the coefficients increase with farm size gross cash income . In other words, holding constant of off-farm working hours by farm operator, education has no effect on adoption of precision farming for small farms, but, for larger farms, the effect becomes positive and large. Marginal effects estimates in Table   4 shows that, for farms in the second, third and fourth quartile income, an additional year of education has 0.5%, 0.9% and 1.2% higher probability of adopting precision farming in comparison to the farmers in the first income quartile. The effect of education on adoption of GM crops is similar but different in one important aspect. For farm operators in the first income quartile, the effect of education is unexpectedly negative and significant. The marginal effect in Table 4 shows that an additional year of education leads to a 1% decrease in probability of GM crop adoption. For farms whose gross cash income falls in the second, third and fourth quartile, an additional year of operator's education increase probability of adopting GM crops increases by 0.5%, 0.95% and 1%, respectively, compared to the farmers in the first income quartile. This indicates that, after controlling for off-farm labor supply, education has almost no effect on probability of adopting GM crops for farms whose income is above 75 th percentile and the probability becomes negative for smaller farms. In order to examine the robustness of our specification of farm size proxy via gross cash farm income , we estimated the same two stage models using interaction between education and total operated acres instead of gross cash farm income, following Mishra and Park 2005 . Parameter estimates and marginal effects of education for two models are summarized in Table 5. The results are similar when we replace farm income by total operated acres except that the effect of education on precision farming adoption becomes positive and significant for the first quartile income farms. The fact that all but one interaction terms have significant coefficients and marginal effects in two different specifications of farm size validates inclusion of the interaction between education and farm size in our model. It also confirms our expectation that the effect of education on technology adoption varies across farm sizes, holding off-farm labor supply by farm operators constant. As we expected, the effect of education is smaller for small farms for adoption of both precision farming and GM crops and, contrary to our expectation, it becomes negative for adoption of GM crops. For both precision farming and GM crops, age has positive and age squared has negative coefficients, as expected. For precision farming, the effect of age continues to be positive until 50 years old and it becomes negative afterward. The turning point for GM crops occurs approximately 10 years earlier at 39 years. Total operated acres in operation has no significant impact on adoption of precision farming but has a negative and significant impact on adoption of GM crops. The degree of risk aversion 6 risk , measured by ratio of crop insurance expenses to total variable costs, as proposed by Goodwin and Rejesus 2008 , has positive and significant effect for both precision farming and GM crops. The positive coefficient of risk indicates that as risk aversion increases operators are more likely to adopt these technologies. This effect is more prominent for GM crops, which suggests that GM crops can be seen as a risk reducing tool. This gives us another insight into the unexpected negative effect of off-farm labor supply on adoption of GM crops. Because off-farm labor is often seen as a means to diversify income risk, farmers may perceive risk reducing technologies such as GM crops as a substitute of off-farm labor to manage risks, and thus having more of one leads to less of the other as it may have been the case in our estimation. It is not surprising that farm specializing in dairy operations is less likely to adopt precision farming and GM crops. Farmers with dairy operation are 4.7% less likely to adopt precision farming and 6.7% less likely to adopt GM crops. On one hand, this is consistent with a priori expectation that dairy farming is so labor intensive that dairy farmers are less likely to adopt management intensive technology such as precision farming, but on the other hand, the negative effect of dairy operation is unexpectedly larger for GM crops which we assumed as management saving. Estimates for powner and tenants represents effects of respective variables relative to the effect of the excluded base group of full-owners who own all of the land they operate. Descriptive statistics in Table 1 shows that part owners and tenants explain 45% and 11% of the sample respectively and the rest of the 44% is represented by full-owners. Coefficients and marginal effects of powner and tenants are all positive and significant for both precision farming and GM crops. Although one might expect the degree of land ownership to be positively correlated with technology adoption, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Our results is consistent with the fact that it is part owners who operate the largest farms and account for the largest share of farm sales, followed by tenants in the U.S. agriculture USDA, 1998 ; part owners and tenants may face higher profit opportunities and/or longer time horizon when considering adoption of precision farming and GM crops than full-owners. Government payment is also found to be positively correlated with adoption of both technologies. A possible explanation of this finding is that farm program payments may provide farmers with additional source of income that can be used to purchase newer technologies and adopt newer practices Caswell, et al., 2001, Lambert, et al., 2006, Lambert, et al., 2007 Results indicate that farmers who receive any type of government payments are 4% more likely to adopt precision farming and 25% more likely to adopt GM crops. The higher marginal effect of government payments on GM crops can be attributed to the fact that farm program payments are tied to production of corn, soybean, cotton and other cash grain crops. Literature indicates that technology adoption is affected by regional location of the farm Mishra, et al., 2009 . Parameter estimated in table 3 and marginal effects in table 4 show that most of the coefficients of regional dummy variables were statistically significant. Note that the Mississippi Portal region serves as a base group and thus it is excluded from the model. For precision farming, farmers in all of the eight production regions have higher probability of adoption relative to farmers in the Mississippi Portal region except that the effect is not significant for the Northern Great Plains region. For GM crops, farmers in all but the Heartland region have a lower probability of adoption relative to the base group and coefficient estimates are all significant at 1%. Higher probability of GM crop adoption in the Heartland region where crop production is active is also expected as found by (Fernandez-Cornejo, et al., 2005)."}, {"section_title": "V. Conclusions", "text": "While the economic theory suggests that education has a positive influence on technology adoption for farmers, existing studies on technology adoption have yielded mixed results. We hypothesize that this is because conventional technology adoption models do not account for the potentially negative effect of education on technology adoption through labor allocation between on and off the farm. The purpose of this study is to fill the gap between the economic theory and empirical findings in agricultural economics. We built a simultaneous equations model that coalesce labor allocation and technology adoption decisions following Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 2005 andFernandez-Cornejo 2007 and included interactions between education and farm size to estimate the net effect of education. The results confirm our expectation that the net effect of education on technology adoption varies across farm sizes and it can be negative for small farms. Given the increasing federal spending on agri-environmental programs that encourages farmers to adopt environmentally benign practices over the last two decades, a precise assessment of the net effect of education on technology adoption is of great importance for policy makers. Our findings suggest that simply targeting highly educated farmer to adopt new farming practices on the basis of the conventional theory is not sufficient to achieve an efficient outcome. Finally, some limitations this study has encountered have to be noted. First, our model did not yield expected results on adoption of GM crops. Although this was not our primary objective, it would be necessary to expand our model to incorporate labor supply of family members and address the risk reducing aspect of GM crops to obtain more accurate estimates of the relationship between GM crops and off-farm labor supply. Second, the definition of precision farming in our data is more broadly defined than previous studies such as Banerjee, et al. 2008 andRoberts, et al. 2004 . This may have obscured the relationship between off-farm labor supply and adoption of precision farming. Third, we have employed Nelson and Olson's procedure to estimate a simultaneous equations model with endogenous limited dependent variables. The simplicity of this procedure is a tremendous advantage for practitioners. Although this procedure allows us to obtain consistent estimates of unknown parameters, there exists an asymptotically efficient, but relatively more complicated, estimator suggested by Amemiya 1979 . Future researches will address these limitations to build on our first attempt to estimate the net effect of education on technology adoption. interaction between educ and first quartile of farm income 3.32 5.84 educ_q2 interaction between educ and first second of farm income 3.31 5.82 educ_q3 interaction between educ and first third of farm income 3.37 5.91 educ_q4 interaction between educ and first fourth of farm income 3.44 6.03 educ_a_q1 interaction between educ and first quartile of total acres 3.33 5.86 educ_a_q2 interaction between educ and first second of total acres 3.30 5.79 educ_a_q3 interaction between educ and first third of total acres 3.35 5.87 educ_a_q4 interaction between educ and first fourth of total acres 3.47 6.07 Observations = 6457 Source: Agricultural Resource Management Survey, 2006"}]
