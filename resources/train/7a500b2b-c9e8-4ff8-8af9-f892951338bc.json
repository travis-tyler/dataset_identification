Insecure attachment is associated with unhealthy physiologic and behavioral responses to stress, which could lead to development of obesity.\nDesign: Cohort study. Main Exposure: Attachment security at 24 months was assessed by trained interviewers during observation in the child's home. Insecure attachment was defined as lowest quartile of attachment security, based on the security score from the Toddler Attachment Sort-45 Item.\nOutcome Measure: Obesity at 4 1 \u20442 years of age (sexspecific body mass index \u054695th percentile for age).\nResults: The prevalence of obesity was 23.1% in children with insecure attachment and 16.6% in those with secure attachment. For children with insecure attachment, the odds of obesity were 1.30 (95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.62) times higher than for children with secure attachment after controlling for the quality of mother-child interaction during play, parenting practices related to obesity, maternal body mass index, and sociodemographic characteristics.\nConclusions: Insecure attachment in early childhood may be a risk factor for obesity. Interventions to increase children's attachment security should examine the effects on children's weight.\nArch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2011;165(3):235-242 "}, {"section_title": "T", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "HE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENT-", "text": "ing childhood obesity is underscored by the persistence of obesity between childhood and adulthood, 1, 2 the health consequences of obesity throughout life, 3, 4 and the difficulties associated with obesity treatment. 5 The obesity epidemic in the United States has affected even preschool-aged children, 6, 7 leading medical and public health experts 8, 9 to suggest that obesity prevention efforts should begin early in life. The approaches typically used to prevent childhood obesity aim to directly alter the balance between energy intake and expenditure by changing dietary, physical activity, and sedentary behaviors. 10 However, because interventions using these approaches have not proved to be very effective, [11] [12] [13] alternative strategies need to be considered.\nA novel approach to preventing obesity is to help children develop healthy emotion regulation, controlling their physiologic and behavioral responses to emotions that arise from psychological stress. 14 There is increasing evidence [15] [16] [17] linking the stress response to obesity and the metabolic syndrome. High stress levels or an exaggerated response to stress can disrupt the functioning and development of the interrelated physiologic systems that affect energy balance, body weight, and fat distribution. 18 These include the systems regulating sleep, 19 mood, 20 motor activity, 21 and food intake. 22 For example, it has been suggested 23, 24 that difficulties in regulating negative emotions, such as fear, sadness, anxiety, and anger, might cause eating in the absence of hunger.\nA child's stress responses and emotion regulation begin forming at the earliest stages of brain development. 25 A secure attachment pattern is the best behavioral marker of whether a child has developed healthy emotion regulation and stress responses. [26] [27] [28] [29] Relying on the parent as a \"safe haven,\" securely attached children explore their environments freely, adapt eas-ily to new people and situations, and are able to be comforted under stressful circumstances. 30 Compared with children who have an insecure attachment pattern, those with a secure pattern perform better on tasks requiring emotion regulation 31, 32 and have healthier physiologic responses to stress. 27, 33 Interventions with parents have been shown [34] [35] [36] to increase children's attachment security. Despite what is known about the role of the physiologic and behavioral responses to stress in the development of obesity and how secure attachment reflects healthy emotion regulation and stress responses in children, we know of no studies that have examined children's early attachment security and obesity. Using data from a recent US cohort study, 37 we examined the association between attachment security at 24 months of age and obesity at 4 1 \u20442 years of age."}, {"section_title": "METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "STUDY POPULATION", "text": "We analyzed data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort, 37 which was conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics and approved by its ethics review board.

Children were excluded if they were born to mothers younger than 15 years or died or were adopted before 9 months of age. The final study cohort of 10 700 was formed when the children were approximately 9 months; 9850 were assessed at 24 months, and 8750 of these children were assessed at approximately 4 1 \u20442 years.

[38] [39] [40] In-home data collection allowed the data collector to observe the mother and child for approximately 2 hours. After the home visit, the data collector sorted 45 \"cards\" based on how well the behavior described on each card applied to the child. The descriptions on the cards included phrases such as \"seeks and enjoys being hugged by mother\"; \"when crying or upset, is easily comforted by contact with the mother\"; and \"if asked, lets friendly adult strangers (ie, the data collector) hold or share toys.\" Data collectors received more than 5 hours of training and were required to demonstrate their ability to administer the attachment sort in a reliable and valid manner. 40 From the attachment sort, a continuous measure of attachment security (security score) was derived, which could range from \u22121 to 1, with higher values indicating a more secure child. [38] [39] [40] Such a child would be described as affectionate, cooperative, and sociable, as well as not clingy, demanding, or aloof. In our sample, attachment scores ranged from \u22120.86 to 1 and were skewed toward positive values, with a mean of 0.49; this distribution is consistent with studies that have used the Attachment Q-sort. 39 For our analyses, we classified children in the lowest quartile of the security score as insecurely attached and those in the upper 3 quartiles as securely attached. We chose the lowest quartile (rather than some other cutpoint) with the rationale that it would be preferable to misclassify children with insecure attachment as having secure attachment rather than vice versa; doing so would be likely to make our estimate of any association between insecure attachment and later obesity a conservative one. Based on the attachment sort, it is also possible to derive a 4-level classification of attachment type (secure, ambivalent, avoidant, or disorganized); we report a secondary analysis using this alternative classification."}, {"section_title": "OUTCOME MEASURE", "text": "We defined children's obesity status at 4 1 \u20442 years of age relative to the 2000 US growth reference. 41 Children's height and weight were measured using a standardized protocol. 42 We determined body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) and categorized children as obese if they had a sex-specific BMI at or above the 95th percentile for age. 8, 9, 43 "}, {"section_title": "COVARIATES", "text": "Potential confounding variables were grouped into 5 domains: (1) mother's interaction with child, (2) child's interaction with mother, (3) parenting practices associated with obesity, (4) maternal health, and (5) sociodemographic characteristics.

Obesity was associated with many of the same covariates as insecure attachment (Table 1) .\nFor children with insecure attachment (4th or lowest quartile of security score), the prevalence of obesity at 4 1 \u20442 years was 23.1% (95% CI, 19.9%-26.3%) compared with 16.6% (15.3%-17.8%) for children with secure attachment (top 3 quartiles of security score).

This association persisted after accounting for factors that could provide alternative explanations, including mother-child interaction during play, parenting practices related to obesity, maternal BMI, and sociodemographic characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the role of children's attachment security in the development of obesity.\nThese findings have biopsychosocial plausibility. 55 There is evidence 16, 17, 56 that obesity and the metabolic syn- drome can result from physiologic and behavioral responses to psychological stress. The physiologic mechanisms appear to be related to neuroendocrine pathways, such as those involving cortisol, insulin, leptin, and neuropeptide Y. 18 The behavioral mechanisms may include impaired sleep 19 or eating to cope with negative emotions. 23, 24 Empirical observations support the possibility that children with a secure pattern of attachment are more easily comforted in stressful situations and are better able to regulate negative emotions 26 ; these behaviors are re- Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared); CI, confidence interval. a Sample sizes are unweighted, and each cell has been rounded to the nearest 50 to conform with reporting guidelines.

It is likely that children's relationships with adults other than the mother, such as with fathers, grandparents, teachers, or childcare providers, also influence children's attachment security. However, these other relationships were not assessed in this study.\nOur research has limitations. We chose to restrict our analyses to children who had videotaped mother-child interaction at 24 months; this criterion excluded 1550 children. To the extent that the association between attachment security and obesity is different in children with and without missing data, there is a possibility of bias in our estimates. We controlled for a large number of potentially confounding variables, but we cannot exclude the potential for bias due to uncontrolled confounding or measurement error. We may also have \"overcontrolled\" for potential confounding by including too many variables, such as television/video/DVD viewing and the frequency of eating family dinners, which could be part of the causal pathway between attachment security and obesity. We used logistic regression models to estimate ORs; when an outcome is not rare, the OR will be farther from 1 than the equivalent risk ratio. 57 Height and weight of children were directly measured, but a limitation of all analyses that rely on ratios (eg, BMI) of weight to height to assess obesity is that these measures reflect body build and musculature in addition to adiposity. More direct adiposity measures are difficult to obtain in large cohorts, and BMI is typically used despite the potential for some misclassification. 58, 59 Our measure of attachment security was derived from observations of the mother and child in their home. It is possible that behavior exhibited on the day of the assessment was not representative of children's typical behavior. 60 Obesity is a complex condition, and the high prevalence in children in the United States is the result of multiple causes. Solutions to the public health problem of obesity must take many forms, 61 and successful approaches to the prevention of obesity in early childhood are lacking. [11] [12] [13] We provide evidence that insecure attachment in 24-month-old children is a potential risk factor for early childhood obesity. To our knowledge, data about this risk factor have not been reported.\nIf these findings are confirmed in other studies, it may be possible to develop obesity prevention strategies that include working with parents to increase children's attachment security. Parents play a key role in the development of the stress response in how they protect children from extreme levels of stress, respond supportively and consistently to normal levels of stress, and model behavioral responses to stress. 55 The role of secure attachment in contributing to positive social and emotional outcomes for young children has been established, 32, 62 and evidence from randomized trials suggests that it is possible to increase children's attachment security. [34] [35] [36] Making obesity prevention another potential outcome of interventions to promote attachment security could revitalize strategies to improve parenting skills, aligning efforts in the fields of pediatrics, nutrition, public health, and child development.
