[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The purpose of this study was to explore differences in determinants of loyalty, including years of loyalty and use of word-of-Mouth (WOM), across rural and urban apparel shoppers. The secondary data used for this study was collected by BIG research in their Consumer Intentions and Actions Study. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted, and the results showed that four store attributes (fashionability, promotion, shopping environment, and retail basics) were positively related to store loyalty. Findings of the study also revealed that the effect of fashionability and retail basics on store loyalty differed significantly across rural and urban consumers while promotion and shopping environment were not different predictors of store loyalty between rural and urban apparel shoppers. Specifically, store attributes of fashionability were stronger antecedents of loyalty for women's clothing shoppers in urban areas than rural shoppers. The retail basics had a greater influence on store loyalty among women's apparel customers in rural areas than customers in urban areas."}, {"section_title": "", "text": ". Introduction \u2160 Rural communities are important to the expansion plans of several national chain retailers in the U.S., such as Dollar General, Family Dollar, and grocery chains such as Kroger (Horton, 2010) . Wal-Mart began their national chain store in rural areas and has successfully expanded throughout rural and suburban America as the store selling not only grocery but also low-end apparel products (Stone, 1997) . However, despite the importance of rural areas to the retail industry, research involving such communities is scarce even in the face of rapid infiltration of national chain players into rural communities and increased broadband penetration in rural areas in the past decade.\nSeveral early studies discuss the differences between rural and urban consumers in terms of their behaviors, attitudes, and lifestyles (Glenn & Hill, 1977; Smith & Krannich, 2000) . Rural people are more likely to be traditional, prejudiced, and ethnocentric, while people in urban areas are prone to favor change (Lowe & Peek, 1974) . Due to these differences in behaviors and attitudes between rural and urban consumers, it is expected that the two groups will also vary in their use of criteria in building loyalty toward a specific retailer in which to make purchases. Furthermore, the unique nature of rural communities such as their dense and closed networks suggests that shopping behaviors of rural consumers may differ from those of urban shoppers (Kim, loyalty, both in rural and urban communities.\nPast research shows that there are several store attributes that affect store loyalty (Lumpkin et al., 1985) , such as service quality (Harrison-Walker, 2001; Odekerken-schroder et al., 2001 ) and product assortment (Matos et al., 2008) . In addition, early studies provide ample evidence that customers who are satisfied with store attributes are likely to intend to repurchase (Baker et al., 2002; Pan & Zinkhan, 2006) and participate in positive WOM (Bitner, 1990; Anderson, 1998 . Review of Literature \u2161 1. Store attributes as determinants of store loyalty Loyalty refers to repeated purchase behavior over a period of time based on favorable feelings toward the subject in terms of both attitudinal and behavioral aspects (Keller, 1993 (Dick & Basu, 1994; Bowen & Chen, 2001 ).\nMany previous studies have investigated the antecedents of loyalty (e.g., Baker et al., 2002; Pan & Zinkhan, 2006) and have found that store attributes are significant factors that lead to customers' loyalty towards a certain store. Previous studies have supported the widely accepted notion that customers who are satisfied with store attributes are likely to intend to repurchase (Baker et al., 2002; Pan & Zinkhan, 2006) and participate in positive WOM (Bitner, 1990; Anderson, 1998 (Baker et al., 2002; Pan & Zinkhan, 2006) .\nIn addition to the common store attributes that lead to customers' store loyalty, Sullivan, Savitt, Zheng, and Cui (2002) studied the specific context of selecting an apparel retailer and found convenience, price, merchandise assortment, value for money, fashionability of current styles, merchandising, and sales service were key determinants of store choice.\nIn contrast, store promotion did not have a significant effect on customers' loyalty towards the retailer. According to Gedenk and Neslin's (1999) study, promotion had no significant influence on future brand loyalty. Specifically, price promotions were negatively related to future brand loyalty, while non-price promotion had no effect on the future brand loyalty.\nAmong the various determinants of retail store loyalty suggested by previous literature, this study will focus on a variety of attributes that we expect to represent fashionability; promotion; shopping environment including service quality; and retail basics including convenience, price and merchandise assort- "}, {"section_title": "Urban versus rural community", "text": "Early research defined a rural community as comprising farm residents and residents of towns with a population under 2,500 (Lowe & Peek, 1974) , while an urban community includes residents of cities of 50,000 population or above, together with residents of their suburbs. Kean et al. (1998) Several studies have investigated the differences between rural and urban communities in terms of their residents' behaviors, attitudes, and lifestyles (Glenn & Hill, 1977; Smith & Krannich, 2000) .\nRural people are more likely to be traditional, work-oriented, puritanical, prejudiced, ethnocentric, and isolationist, whereas people in metropolitan areas tend to favor change, be less lenient towards the treatment of criminals, and be more lenient toward divorce than people in rural areas (Lowe & Peek, 1974) . Previous researchers found that these different attitudes and behaviors were attributable to different characteristics of rural and urban societies including occupation, age, religion-ethnicity, the degree of population concentration, the size of community (Glenn & Hill, 1977) , education of the citizens (Smith & Krannich, 2000) , and the lifestyles of the people living within the community (Lowe & Peek, 1974) .\nIn addition to attitudinal and demographic differences, there are differences in interpersonal relationships of rural and urban customers due to the differing sizes of the two types of communities (House et al., 1988; Beggs et al., 1996) . House, Umberson, and Landis (1988) found that the level of social integration is higher in small communities (i.e., rural towns) than in large urban areas. Beggs, Haines, and Hurlbert (1996) and Miller and Kean (1997) also found that, relative to urban dwellers, rural residents have a larger proportion of long-term and strong relationships including kin, neighbors, and kin-neighbors and a smaller proportion of shortterm relationships."}, {"section_title": "Moderating effect of rural versus urban customers", "text": "Although several studies have compared general characteristics, lifestyles, or interpersonal relationships between rural and urban residents (Glenn & Hill, 1977; House et al., 1988; Beggs et al., 1996; Smith & Krannich, 2000) , very few studies have taken into account comparisons between urban and rural customers' shopping behavior (Sun & Wu, 2004 ).\nIn particular, no studies could be identified that study differences in urban and rural apparel shopping behavior in the United States.\nSun and Wu (2004) .

Using the Rural-Urban Continuum Codes, the codes were collapsed into two categories: metro counties and non-metro (rural) counties; codes from 1 through 3 are metro counties and from 4 through 9 are non-metro counties, which considers population size as well as distance from a metro area."}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "text": "A preliminary exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted to identify the store attribute factors.\nEFA was selected since it is better suited for identifying factor structure while principal component analysis is primarily used for data reduction (Norris & Lecavalier, 2009 "}, {"section_title": ". Results \u2163", "text": "In preliminary analysis, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) followed by an oblique CF-Quartimax rotation was used to identify determinants of customers' choice of retailer. The factor loadings of all items were at least 0.5 in size. Based on the factor analysis, four store choice factors were identified with each comprising multiple items: \"fashionability\"\n(newest styles, newest fabrics, and fashion ideas);\n\"promotion\" (coupons and special sales, store loyalty card, and store credit card); \"shopping environment\" (store appearance, knowledgeable sales people, store layout, service, location, and and in-store experience); and \"retail basics\" (price, product selection) (see Table 1 ). The average of the scale items for each factor was used for further analysis.\nTo test the hypotheses of this study, hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used. Table 2 illustrates the results of the hierarchical multiple regression for loyalty. The store attribute factors, rural versus urban customers, and the interaction term were used as predictors, and loyalty was the dependent variable.\nIn step1, the four dimensions of store attributes were entered in the model. All four dimensions of store attributes were found to be significant. toward their preferred retailer. In other words, all criteria for selecting retailers had a positive influence on loyalty. Among these four criteria, the retail basics factor had the strongest impact on loyalty.\nTherefore, hypothesis 1, 3 and 4 were supported while hypothesis 2 was not supported.\nIn step 2, the rural versus urban factor was added to the model. The increase in R 2 was significant (p=.001). Finally, in step 3, the moderation effects of rural versus urban on the relationship between the store attributes and loyalty were examined. The increase in R 2 from model 2 to and retail basics on loyalty, the results correspond to many previous studies that have investigated the antecedents of store loyalty (e.g., Baker et al., 2002; Pan & Zinkhan, 2006) . In contrast, the results showed a positive relationship between promotion and loyalty, which is different from the previous study of Gedenk and Neslin (1999) . This might be because the current study included in the promotion factor price promotions as well as loyalty cards while Gedenk and Neslin (1999) (Lowe & Peek, 1974; Glenn & Hill, 1977; Smith & Krannich, 2000) , and these different characteristics would lead urban customers to place emphasis on current fashion style as a key determinant of loyalty to a women's clothing retailer.\nFinally, the retail basics factor, which includes price, location, and product selection, was the most Since WOM has been found to be one of the most powerful and influential sources of information affecting purchasing behavior (Brown & Reingen, 1987; Wangenheim & Bayon, 2004) , strong retail basic store attributes will not only result in a long-term relationships with existing customers but also in attracting new customers to the store through WOM.\nSecond, this study suggests that women's clothing retailers need to use different strategies to attract metropolitan versus non-metropolitan customers.\nThe women's clothing retailers in metropolitan areas might need to provide the newest styles and trendy clothing to meet urban customers' needs and retain their loyalty. On the other hand, apparel retailers targeting rural customers might need to focus on reasonable price, convenient location, and diverse product selection to build customers' loyalty. This strategy might allow local retailers to strengthen their business in rural areas where business can be tough to come by (Bhat & Fox, 1996 "}]
