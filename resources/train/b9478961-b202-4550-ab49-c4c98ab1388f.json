The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Sleep (NPIsleep) Questionnaire was used to assess the sleep and night-time behavior changes. Regional tau-positron emission tomography (PET) (entorhinal, brainstem) and A\u03b2-PET (posterior cingulate, precuneus, medial orbitofrontal) uptake values were calculated. A series of linear regression analyses were used to determine the combination of sleep symptoms that built the best models to predict each pathology. Results: Informant-based reports of abnormal night-time behavior (NPI questions k3, k5, and k8) were significantly associated with increased entorhinal tau and A\u03b2 (all regions) accumulation. Interestingly, informant-based reports of sleep deficiencies without abnormal nigh-time activity (NPI questions k1, k2, and k6) were negatively associated with entorhinal tau burden. Conclusion: Detection of abnormal night-time behaviors (wandering, pacing, other inappropriate activities) by family members indicates early signs of both AD pathologies and may encourage the affected individuals to seek help by health care providers for detailed cognitive/neurobehavioral assessments."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances are frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and may appear before the onset of the clinical symptoms. Abnormal sleep patterns can be detected and quantitatively characterized by traditional polysomnography and motion-based actigraphy devices. An increasing number of actigraphy studies have reported associations between increased brain amyloid beta (A\u03b2) burden and several abnormal sleep-wake patterns, including shorter sleep latency 6 and increased night-time sleep fragmentation 7 as early as in clinically normal elderly adults. Self-reported and informant-based questionnaires can also help evaluate the overall sleep quality. While these subjective assessments do not provide accurate measures of sleep-wake patterns, they can be administered without the necessity of recording sleep data for a period of time. Spira et al found associations of self-reported measures of excessive daytime sleepiness/napping with elevated A\u03b2 burden in cognitively normal community-dwelling elderly adults. 8 Another study on non-demented late-middle-aged adults found that participants with self-reported sleep problems and inadequate sleep had greater amyloid burden in several AD-sensitive regions, including medial orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, and precuneus. 9 In comparison to A\u03b2, there is little known about the relationship between sleep and tau. The influence of tau pathology could be relevant to the sleep-wake alterations in AD, possibly due to the presence of abnormal tau accumulation in sleep-regulating regions such as brainstem. 10, 11 The objective of this study was to understand the associations of both A\u03b2 and tau with early signs of changes in sleep and night-time behavior in clinically normal elderly adults.

A positive answer (presence of resent sleep problems) is followed by eight questions (k1-k8) to determine the specific nature of the abnormal sleep behavior. These include difficulties in falling asleep (k1), getting up during the night (k2), pacing and wandering at night (k3), awakening the caregiver during night (k4), awaken at night or too early in the morning and thinking that it is time to start the day (k5), waking up too early in the morning (k6), excessive daytime napping (k7), and other abnormal nighttime behaviors (k8).

All ADNI [ 18 F]Flortaucipir images were uploaded to University of Southern California Laboratory of Neuroimaging (LONI) where they were preprocessed and the regional tracer uptakes were calculated in LONI by using Freesurfer-defined cortical regions on the subjects' T1-weighted volumetric MP-RAGE. The Freesurfer processing of MRI volumes included skullstripping, segmentation, and delineation of cortical and subcortical regions. Subjects' PET frames were coregistered, averaged, and smoothed to obtain a resolution of 8 mm full width at half maximum. The regional gray matter masks were applied to PET images to extract the mean uptake values, which were divided by the cerebellar gray matter uptake to determine the standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs). The size of these regions and their mean PET uptake values are available for download in ADNI archive. The mean regional tau PET uptake values from three regions (left and right entorhinal and brainstem) were downloaded.

We downloaded the mean regional A\u03b2 PET uptake values from six regions (left and right posterior cingulate, left and right precuneus, left and right medial orbitofrontal) and normalized them by the whole cerebellum. These regions were selected because they are known to be affected early by the A\u03b2 accumulation. [16] [17] [18] In addition to regional A\u03b2 uptake values, the mean A\u03b2 tracer uptake from a cortical summary region of interest (ROI) was downloaded to determine whether a subject is A\u03b2-positive or A\u03b2-negative. The summary ROI consisted of four cortical regions (frontal, anterior/posterior cingulate, lateral parietal, lateral temporal).

To determine associations between each regional A\u03b2/tau accumulation and informant-based sleep reports, we conducted three steps of regression analysis starting with a backward-elimination regression 19 for each pathology (regional tau and A\u03b2 SUVR values) as outcome. The sleep symptoms k1-k8 were included as categorical variables. The backwardelimination process tests the removal of each predictor using a chosen model fit criterion (Akaike information), and step-wise removing predictors with the most statistically insignificant deterioration of the fit to determine which combination of variables (from k1-k8) builds the strongest model to fit a given pathological measure. The sleep variables of the strongest model were subsequently included in a second linear regression model as predictors along with age, sex, and Apolipoprotein \u01904 (APOE-\u01904) status as covariates to determine the sign of the coefficients associated with each sleep variable for predicting each regional A\u03b2/tau accumulation (outcomes). A positive coefficient sign indicates that as the predictor increases, the outcome variable also increases. A negative sign indicates that as the predictor increases, the outcome variable decreases. For each regional A\u03b2/tau, the scores of all sleep variables with the same direction (positive or negative) of coefficient sign were added together and included as noncategorical variable (total score) in a third linear regression model to determine how these total scores predicted the corresponding regional A\u03b2/tau burden. Figure 1 illustrates the described statistical analyses pipeline for a single regional SUVR (example: A\u03b2 SUVR in the posterior cingulate cortex)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Data from 35 CN subjects were used for this study (Table 2) . Approximately, half of the subjects were APOE-\u03b54 carriers and had A\u03b2-positive scans. Sixty-six percent of the subjects were women. Table 3 shows the NPI-sleep questionnaires that were selected by the backward-elimination regression process as the combination of predictors building the strongest model for predicting each regional A\u03b2 burden (rows). The non-empty cells indicate the presence of the NPI symptom (with either positive or negative correlation) in the strongest backward elimination model. For most A\u03b2 regions, the NPI-sleep scores k3 (abnormal wandering and pacing at night), k6 (awaken earlier than was his/her habit), and k8 (other abnormal nigh-time behavior) were present in the strongest models for predicting A\u03b2 burden. The coefficient signs were positive for k3 and k8 but negative for k6. Excessive sleep during day (k7) was not present in any of the strongest models. Table 4 shows the NPI-sleep questionnaires that were selected by the backward-elimination regression process as the combination of predictors (both positive and negative) building the strongest model for predicting each regional tau burden (rows). In the entorhinal cortex, k1, k2, and k6 were associated with negative coefficients whereas k3, ,k4 k5, and k8 were associated with positive coefficients. The best model for brainstem did not include any of the eight symptoms. Excessive sleep during day (k7) was not present in any of the strongest models. Table 5 presents the regression analyses with the total scores (regional SUVR~Age+Sex+APOE+total_score_pos +total_score_neg). For regional A\u03b2 SUVR values, k3 and k8 appeared in the strongest models and had positive coefficients. Therefore, the total score of symptoms with positive coefficients (total_score_pos) was calculated as the sum of their scores (k38). The questionnaire k6 was the only symptom that appeared in the strongest model and was associated with a negative coefficient. For the left entorhinal SUVR value, the sleep symptoms k3, k5, and k8 appeared in the strongest models and had positive coefficients. Therefore, the total score of symptoms with positive coefficients for this region was calculated as the sum of scores from k3, k5, and k8 questions (k358). For the right entorhinal SUVR value, the sleep symptoms k3, k4, and k8 appeared in the strongest models and had positive coefficients. Therefore, the total score of symptoms with positive coefficients for this region was calculated as the sum of scores from k3, k4, and k8 (k348). The symptoms k1, k2, and k6 were associated with negative coefficients for both left and right entorhinal SUVR values. Therefore, the total score of symptoms with negative coefficients (total_scor-e_neg) for these two regions was calculated as the sum of scores from k1, k2, and k6 questions (k126). Brainstem was left out because none of the symptoms appeared in the strongest model for this region. Age, sex, and APOE were added as other covariates. The Bonferroni-corrected P-value of 0.006 was used to adjust for multiple Figure 2 . AStudent's t-test was conducted to determine the group differences. The associated P-values were 0.03 for group differences in global A\u03b2-PET SUVR when subjects were stratified based on the positive composite score k38 (k38=0 in group 1 and k38>0 in group 2) and 0.56 when they were grouped based on the negative score k6. For entorhinal tau, the P-values were 0.047 for group differences when subjects were stratified based on the positive composite score k358 and 0.066 when they were divided based on the negative composite score k126.

The primary goal of this study was to understand the associations between AD pathologies (A\u03b2 and tau) and simple sleep questionnaires that can be readily administered and interpreted by family members. Given that sleep disturbances are among the major causes of patient institutionalization in AD, 12 detecting earliest abnormal signs of altered sleep patterns may motivate the caregivers and affected individuals to seek help by health care providers who can provide more detailed cognitive/neurobehavioral assessments. The findings of this study indicate the presence of two distinct sleep-related patterns reported by Table 3 NPI-sleep symptoms (columns) in the strongest models for predicting regional A\u03b2 burden (rows). Non-empty cells indicate the presence of the symptom (positive or negative correlation) in the strongest model determined by the backward-elimination process DovePress informants and their differential associations with AD pathologies. We found that informant-reported symptoms related to abnormal night-time behavior (k3, k4, k5, k8)\nwere positively associated with both pathologies meaning that the presence of abnormal night-time activities and increased number of night-time behavioral symptoms (k38 for A\u03b2, k358 for left entorhinal tau, and k348 for right entorhinal tau) were associated with elevated levels of both A\u03b2 and tau. Interestingly, we found that informantreported symptoms related to sleep deficiency, difficulties falling asleep (k1), fragmented sleep (k2), awaken too early (k6), without the involvement of abnormal behavioral activities (wandering, pacing, get ready to go to work), were significantly associated with lower entorhinal tau burden (but no significant associations with A\u03b2). Given the previously observed relationships between self-reported sleep deficiencies and elevated A\u03b2 levels, the lack of such associations with informant-based reports on sleep deficiency may indicate that self-reports are potentially better in detecting sleep deficiencies than informant-based reports. However, the negative associations of sleep deficiencies and entorhinal tau were somehow surprising. While a large number of previous research have established a consistent link between sleep deficiencies and elevated amyloid across human subjects 7, 20, 21 and animal models, 22 little is known about how sleep deficiencies are linked to the progression of tauopathy. Specifically, previous sleep-tau studies on animals were conducted by evoking acute sleep deprivation on animals with seeded tau in their brains. 23 It remains to be explored how findings of these experimental studies on nocturnal animals (different circadian rhythm than human) can be translated into human subjects where tau deposits are also found in normal aging. Using actigraphy on a population of older cognitively normal adults, Kam et al 24 reported no correlations between cerebrospinal fluid measures of total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated (p-tau) and measures of sleep quality or habitual sleep duration. Another study by Sprecher et al 25 found that worse self-reported subjective sleep quality, more sleep problems, and daytime somnolence were associated with greater AD pathology, indicated by higher t-tau/A\u03b242, p-tau/A\u03b242. These different findings may be explained by differences in the use of subjective versus objective measures and self-report versus informant-report of sleep used across these studies. One of the limitations of this study is the small sample size. We included only subjects who had both A\u03b2 and tau scans. Also, due to the nature of the statistical analysis, we could only include subjects who had at least one sleep symptom (one of eight questions). The progression of A\u03b2 plaques starts decades before the onset of dementia. Non-demented individuals with abnormal A\u03b2 levels show impaired cognitive performance, particularly in episodic memory, 26 which is detectable but stable during a long preclinical period 27 prior to the manifestation of clinical AD, thus reflecting a relatively slow progression of pathological (eg, A\u03b2) processes that affect the episodic memory. It is not fully understood whether sleep disorders precede episodic memory decline. Based on a group of community-dwelling participants, Spira et al 8 found that sleep disorders in clinically normal subjects increased the odds (by 2.5 times) of developing A\u03b2 accumulation 15.7\u00b13.4 years later. Increasing evidence suggests that the glymphatic system, a recently discovered macroscopic waste clearance system, is responsible for removing metabolites and neurotoxic waste products including A\u03b2. 28 The glymphatic system is mainly active during sleep suggesting that sleep disorders can contribute to A\u03b2 accumulation by impairing the glymphatic function. It is possible that sleep disorders may precede episodic memory alterations that occur due to A\u03b2 progression.\nOne of the limitations of this study is the small sample size. We searched for all clinically normal ADNI subjects who had both A\u03b2 and tau PET scans and that these scans were acquired at time points close to each other and the sleep assessments. The rigid timing specifications reduced the number of available subjects. Therefore, this study should be investigated in larger research populations using informantbased or subject-based sleep reports to determine how they predict different AD biomarkers. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Sleep Questionnaire (NPI-sleep) could be both a strength and a weakness in this study. NPI-sleep questions are simple and can be readily administered and understood by non-clinicians. Only a positive answer to the initial NPI-sleep question (presence of resent sleep problems) is followed by the eight remaining questions to characterize the nature of the sleep problem. However, without the specific and detailed questions (k1-k8), some informants may be unaware of the presence of a sleep problem. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 29 is a more effective sleep assessment, which consists of 19 individual items and may deem better for characterizing sleep disorders and detecting associations with AD pathologies. The NPI-sleep questionnaire pertains to recent changes in sleep behavior. However, previous studies 8 suggest that specific alterations in sleep patterns (eg, excessive daytime napping) occur decades before developing A\u03b2 accumulation. Therefore, NPI-sleep may not be a suitable test for subjects with a long history of sleep problems."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Detection of abnormal night-time behaviors (wandering, pacing, other inappropriate activities) by family members indicates early signs of both A\u03b2 and tau pathologies and may encourage the affected individuals to seek help by "}, {"section_title": "Disclosure", "text": "The author reports no conflicts of interest in this work. dat1n$k1 = as.factor(dat1n$k1) dat1n$k2 = as.factor(dat1n$k2) dat1n$k3 = as.factor(dat1n$k3) dat1n$k4 = as.factor(dat1n$k4) dat1n$k5 = as.factor(dat1n$k5) dat1n$k6 = as.factor(dat1n$k6) dat1n$k7 = as.factor(dat1n$k7) dat1n$k8 = as.factor(dat1n$k8) dat1n$sex = as.factor(dat1n$sex) dat1n$APOE = as.factor(dat1n$APOE) ###################################### backward elimination ###################################### # fit1 = lm(ent_L~k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 + k5 + k6 + k7 + k8, data = dat1n) selection = step(fit1, direction = \"backward\") result_out = selection$coefficients ouput_temp = summary(eval(selection$call)) adj_rsq = round(ouput_temp$adj.r.squared, 5) ####################### second step: linear regression (determine positive and negative coeff) ############# #### fit2 = lm(ent_L~Age + sex + APOE + k1 + k2 + k3 + k5 + k6 + k8, data = dat1n) summary(fit2) ######################## third step: linear regression for composite scores ############################## fit3 = lm(ent_L~Age + sex + APOE + k358 +k126, data = dat1n) summary(fit3) (Continued).
