We then compared florbetapir2 vs florbetapir1 patients with respect to several AD-specific biomarkers, baseline and longitudinal cognitive measurements, and demographic and clinician report data.\nResults: Florbetapir and CSF-Ab 1-42 1/2 status agreed for 98% of ADs (89% of MCIs), indicating that most florbetapir2 scans were a reliable representation of amyloid status. Florbetapir2 AD (n 5 27/177; 15%) and MCI (n 5 74/217, 34%) were more likely to be APOE4-negative (MCI 83%, AD 96%) than their florbetapir1 counterparts (MCI 30%, AD 24%). Florbetapir2 patients also had less AD-specific hypometabolism, lower CSF p-tau and t-tau, and better longitudinal cognitive performance, and were more likely to be taking medication for depression. In MCI only, florbetapir2 participants had less hippocampal atrophy and hypometabolism and lower functional activity questionnaire scores compared to florbetapir1 participants.\nOverall, image analysis problems do not appear to be a primary explanation of amyloid negativity. Florbetapir2 ADNI patients have a variety of clinical and biomarker features that differ from their florbetapir1 counterparts, suggesting that one or more non-AD etiologies (which may include vascular disease and depression) account for their AD-like phenotype.\nNeurology \u00ae 2016;86:1377-1385 GLOSSARY Ab 5 b-amyloid; AD 5 Alzheimer disease; ADAS-cog 5 Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale; ADNI 5 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; AGD 5 argyrophilic grain disease; MCI 5 mild cognitive impairment; metaROI 5 previously validated region of interest; MMSE 5 Mini-Mental State Examination; MPRAGE 5 magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo; RAVLT 5 Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; SUVR 5 standardized uptake value ratio; TBM-SyN 5 tensorbased morphometry-symmetric diffeomorphic image normalization method; VBM 5 voxel-based morphometry; WM 5 white matter.\nThe rate of b-amyloid (Ab) negativity in clinically diagnosed Alzheimer disease (AD) varies across a variety of study populations and as a function of APOE genotype status. 1-6 Previous studies of patients with clinically diagnosed AD have shown that 12% were negative on amyloid PET in a recent meta-analysis, 7 and 10%-25% of APOE4-negative patients with AD did not meet the neuropathologic criteria for AD at autopsy. 8, 9 Older adults with an amnestic profile that is suggestive of AD comprise a diverse group with heterogeneous pathology.

ADNI was designed as a model for AD clinical trials, so the diagnostic accuracy and Ab status of these patients should be reasonably representative of those expected to enroll in clinical trials.\nWe first examined the extent to which image analysis problems may account for some florbetapir2 cases using CSF Ab measurements and reliability of image analysis. Next, we compared Ab2 and Ab1 patients with AD and patients with MCI on baseline and longitudinal measurements that are sensitive to AD, including clinical evaluations, APOE4 status, FDG-PET and structural MRI, and cognitive performance.\nMETHODS Participants. ADNI is a multisite longitudinal biomarker study that has enrolled over 1,500 cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late amnestic MCI, and people with early AD (www.adni-info.org).\nAs of June 2015, there were 177 patients with AD and 217 patients with (late) MCI with at least a baseline florbetapir scan and APOE4 genotyping. MCI and AD diagnoses were made using standard criteria that have been reported previously. 11 The amount of data available at the time of this study (August 2015) varies across measurements (table) . Concurrent clinical, cognitive, and FDG-PET data were available for $90% of participants, while concurrent CSF and hippocampal volume data were available for $70% of participants. More than one postbaseline follow-up clinical visit was available for at least 90% of participants. A 2-year follow-up florbetapir scan was available in 50% of participants.\nStandard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. All participants gave written informed consent that was approved by the Institutional Review Board of each participating institution.\nFlorbetapir PET image processing. Florbetapir synthesis and image acquisition details are described in detail elsewhere. 12 Briefly, florbetapir images consisted of 4 3 5 minute frames acquired at 50-70 minutes postinjection, which were realigned, averaged, resliced to a common voxel size (1.5 mm 3 ), and smoothed to a common resolution of 8 mm 3 full width at half maximum. Magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) images that were acquired concurrently with the baseline florbetapir images were used as a structural template to define cortical and reference regions in native space for each participant using Freesurfer (v4.5.0) as described previously. [12] [13] [14] Florbetapir scans for each participant were coregistered to baseline structural MRI scans, which were subsequently used to extract weighted cortical retention means (standardized uptake value ratios [SUVRs]) from frontal, cingulate, parietal, and temporal regions that were averaged and divided by a whole cerebellum reference region to create a SUVR with a positivity threshold of 1.11 as described in greater detail elsewhere 12, 13 and online. 15 We also investigated several alternative reference regions and applied positivity thresholds that were derived using a linear transformation of the whole-cerebellum normalized SUVRs as described previously 16 (cerebellar gray matter, 1.26; brainstem, 0.79; subcortical white matter [WM] eroded away from cortex, 17 0.62; and a composite region made up of brainstem, whole cerebellum, and eroded WM, 0.79).\nFDG-PET image processing. FDG image data were acquired 30-60 minutes postinjection, and fully preprocessed images were downloaded from the ADNI Web site (adni.loni.usc.edu). We then spatially normalized each FDG image to the standard 15O-H 2 O PET template using SPM5 and extracted mean FDG uptake for each participant from a set of study-independent and previously validated regions of interest (metaROIs) located in right and left inferior temporal and lateral parietal regions, and a bilateral posterior cingulate cortex region relative to the mean of a pons and cerebellar vermis reference region. 18 CSF analysis. CSF Ab 1-42 , t-tau, and p-tau measurements were acquired concurrently with florbetapir scans at baseline and analyzed by the ADNI Biomarker core laboratory. We applied autopsy-validated CSF Ab 1-42 , t-tau, and p-tau autopsyvalidated positivity cutoffs of 192 pg/mL, 93, and 23 to determine positivity as described previously. 19 Structural MRI analyses. Cross-sectional structural differences were assessed using hippocampal volumes defined on MPRAGE images by Freesurfer v5.1 (v4.3 for ADNI1 continuing participants) and divided by total intracranial volume to adjust for head size. We observed no differences in data analyzed with Freesurfer versions. Structural change over time was measured using a summary score developed by the Mayo Clinic that represents change between pairs of scans in 31 AD-specific regions of interest, known as the tensor-based morphometry-symmetric diffeomorphic image normalization method (TBM-SyN). 20 The average available follow-up time for longitudinal structural MRI scans was 1.3 6 0.5 years. White matter hyperintensity volumes at baseline as percent of intracranial volume were calculated using coregistered fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and MPRAGE images as described previously. 21 Clinical and cognitive measurements. We examined several clinical and cognitive performance measurements including baseline and longitudinal performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), 22 the Functional Assessment Questionnaire, 23 the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), 24 and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). 25 We also examined baseline scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale 26 although this test was used as a screening tool for ADNI enrollment; participants with a score higher than 5 at baseline were excluded. The average available follow-up time for longitudinal cognitive measurements was 1.4 6 0.8 years.\nWe also examined the following dichotomous variables in order to identify the extent to which the clinical profile was consistent with AD: whether conversion from MCI to AD occurred during the 1.4 6 0.8 years clinical follow-up (patients with MCI only), whether there was a family history of dementia or AD, whether a history of hypertension was present, whether the patient was taking medication for depression or for symptoms of AD (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) at baseline, and whether the clinician evaluating the patient reported that symptoms were possibly, as opposed to probably, due to AD (patients with AD only). Statistical methods. For each longitudinal cognitive and TBM-SyN measurement, a slope was calculated for each participant. Because of the discrepancy in florbetapir1/2 group sizes and the nonparametric distributions of some variables of interest, we carried out the Mann-Whitney U test at a 5 0.05 to evaluate differences in continuous variables between the florbetapir1/2 MCI and AD groups. Group differences in dichotomous variables were evaluated using the x 2 test. We carried out voxelwise FDG-PET and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses for participants with available whole-brain data (.95% of participants). Voxelwise spatially normalized and FDG-PET data were intensity normalized using the pons/vermis reference region. An independent-samples t test contrasting florbetapir1 vs florbetapir2 patients was carried out at p , 0.001 uncorrected for the AD and MCI groups in SPM8, with age, sex, and education as nuisance covariates. To examine whole-brain structural differences, we performed the same contrast using VBM with the DARTEL toolbox in SPM8. 27 RESULTS PET technical factors. Comparing amyloid status between whole cerebellum reference and 4 alternative reference regions (cerebellar GM, white matter, brainstem, composite), we found that status changed in 0%-15% of patients with florbetapir2 AD and in 1%-12% of patients with florbetapir2 MCI.\nFor participants with an available 2-year follow-up florbetapir scan (approximately 50% of the sample), we also examined change in amyloid status using the whole cerebellum reference region. The testretest reliability of the SUVRs was approximately 1.2% 6 0.8% (absolute mean change and SD in stable amyloid-negative controls), as reported previously. 17 Ninety-eight percent of patients with MCI and 100% of patients with AD who were florbetapir1 at baseline remained positive. Four of 54 (7%) patients with MCI and (1/9) 11% of patients with AD who were florbetapir2 at baseline were positive at follow-up.\nThe relationship between florbetapir and CSF Ab 1-42 measurements by APOE4 status is shown for ADs and MCIs in figure 1 (upper left quadrant, both abnormal; lower right, both normal). A total of 5/137 (4%) patients with AD and 18/170 (11%) patients with MCI had discordant CSF Ab 1-42 and florbetapir measurements (upper right and lower left quadrants), and the majority of these (100% of discordant AD and 72% of discordant MCI) were CSF Ab 1-42 1/florbetapir2. Of florbetapir2 cases only, about 3/4 of participants from each diagnostic group were also negative on CSF Ab 1-42 (14/19 or 74% of AD and 36/49 or 74% of MCI). CSF Ab2 participants were also disproportionately APOE42. Of the 14 patients with AD and 36 patients with MCI who were negative on both CSF Ab 1-42 and florbetapir, 13/14 (93%) and 32/36 (89%) were APOE42.\nComparison of florbetapir1/2 groups. Demographic and clinical variables. Demographic, clinical, cognitive, and biomarker characteristics of the florbetapir1/2 MCI and AD groups are summarized in table. In AD only, florbetapir2 patients were older than florbetapir1 patients and marginally more likely to be male. On clinical evaluation variables, MCI florbetapir2 patients had lower Functional Assessment Questionnaire scores (less functional impairment) and were less likely to convert to AD and to be taking medication for AD (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors). Florbetapir2 patients in both groups were more likely to be taking medication for depression, and in AD, florbetapir2 patients had marginally higher depression scores and were marginally more likely to have a history of hypertension. Clinicians were more likely to rate the symptoms of florbetapir2 AD patients as possibly (rather than probably) due to an AD diagnosis."}, {"section_title": "Figure 1", "text": "Agreement between CSF Ab 1-42 and florbetapir2 PET\nThe relationship between concurrent cortical summary florbetapir standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) and available CSF Ab 1-42 measurements is shown for the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) groups (APOE41 participants 5 green, APOE42 participants 5 blue). Dotted lines represent positivity thresholds for each measure (see Methods).\nBiomarkers. As shown in figure 2 , the majority of florbetapir2 patients were APOE42 (MCI: 84% APOE42; AD: 96% APOE42) whereas florbetapir1 patients showed the opposite pattern (MCI: 30% APOE42; AD: 24% APOE42) (figure 2). The florbetapir2 groups had less hypometabolism in characteristic AD (metaROI) regions, had lower CSF t-tau and p-tau, and had less longitudinal atrophy in ADspecific (TBM-SyN) regions (table) . MCI florbetapir2 patients (but not AD) had less hippocampal atrophy (table) . Groups did not differ on white matter hyperintensity volume.\nCognitive performance. Patients with florbetapir2 MCI had better baseline performance than florbetapir1 patients on MMSE, ADAS-cog, and RAVLT, while patients with florbetapir2 AD were marginally less impaired on ADAS-cog but did not differ on RAVLT or MMSE. Longitudinally, patients with florbetapir2 MCI and AD declined more slowly than florbetapir1 patients on the ADAS-cog ( figure  3 ) and the MMSE, and patients with florbetapir2 MCI also declined more slowly on the RAVLT. Voxelwise comparisons. Because we observed FDG-PET and structural MRI effects in AD-specific regions (see table) , we carried out voxelwise FDG-PET and structural MRI analyses to determine if the florbetapir1/2 groups differed across a broader set of regions. As shown in figure 4A , patients with florbetapir2 MCI and AD had less hypometabolism than florbetapir1 patients in bilateral temporoparietal regions and in the hippocampus (MCI only). These temporoparietal regions had nearly complete overlap with the independently derived AD-specific metaROI regions. In a similar contrast of structural MRIs (figure 4B), patients with florbetapir2 MCI had less atrophy than patients with florbetapir1 MCI in medial temporal regions including the hippocampus and amygdala, while patients with florbetapir2 AD had less inferior lateral temporal atrophy than patients with florbetapir1 AD. DISCUSSION A total of 15% of patients with clinically diagnosed AD and 34% of patients with amnestic MCI enrolled in ADNI were quantitatively negative on florbetapir2 PET. In order to determine the likelihood that false negatives were included in this group, we first examined potential methodologic problems. CSF Ab 1-42 measurements agreed with florbetapir in 89%-96% of cases (and about 75% of florbetapir2 cases only). Potential reference region inconsistencies accounted for 0%-15% of cases. While these findings raise questions about florbetapir status of a minority of participants, we concluded that the majority of florbetapir2 scans appear to accurately reflect the absence of significant fibrillar Ab in cortex. Our data are consistent with recent work examining discrepancies in amyloid status between measurement modalities (amyloid PET, CSF Ab, autopsy). 28, 29 These discrepancies may reflect differences in Ab binding site affinities or differing concentrations of forms of Ab, but the majority of cases agree when more than one modality is examined. [30] [31] [32] [33] Patients with Ab2 MCI and AD were less \"ADlike\" than their Ab1 counterparts across a number of biomarker, cognitive, and clinical variables. Patients with Ab2 AD were older. In both groups, Ab2 patients were predominantly APOE42, which has been consistently observed in clinical trials 3, 4 and autopsy studies. 8, 9 They also declined more slowly on the ADAS-cog and MMSE, they had higher temporoparietal glucose metabolism and higher medial temporal volume, and they had lower CSF t-tau and p-tau. In other words, across an extensive set of characteristic AD biomarkers, Ab2 patients have a profile that is atypical of AD.\nClinical evaluations revealed further differences between Ab2 and Ab1 groups. Ab2 patients were more likely to be taking medication for depression and patients with Ab2 AD had marginally higher depression scores. The latter finding is surprising because participants were screened for depression at enrollment, so our ability to detect a difference was limited by low variability in these scores. In addition, patients with Ab2 MCI were less likely to be taking medication for AD, and were less likely to convert to AD. Patients with Ab2 AD were more likely to have a history of hypertension, and clinicians was more likely to rate their symptoms as possibly (rather than probably) due to AD. These clinical data point to the broad set of possible explanations for Ab2 patients' cognitive symptoms, as well as 2 possible specific contributors: subclinical depression and vascular abnormalities. Both depression and vascular disease have complex relationships with AD and MCI. [34] [35] [36] They are both frequently observed in the presence of AD but causal or mechanistic associations are unclear. However, our analyses yielded conflicting information, perhaps due to the nonuniformity of the Ab2 phenotype; for example, white matter hyperintensities, a marker of vascular disease, did not differ between groups. Furthermore, since the ADNI enrollment criteria excluded individuals with a history of conditions such as major depression or vascular dementia as a primary diagnosis, it is likely that the contribution of non-AD etiologies would be even greater in a community sample. Recent autopsy studies have provided a more detailed view of the spectrum of neuropathologies observed in patients with clinically diagnosed AD. TDP-43, argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), hippocampal sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular disease have been reported as primary neuropathologic diagnoses in patients with an antemortem clinical diagnosis of AD. 9 Some of these (TDP-43, AGD) are not possible to diagnose in vivo, and others are syndromes with symptoms that can overlap with AD. It is also likely that some individuals with a non-AD dementia syndrome may present as \"AD-like\" because of preexisting deficits or vulnerabilities. Furthermore, several comorbidities may be present simultaneously, making it difficult to pinpoint a cause of the cognitive symptoms. Of ADNI AD cases that have come to autopsy, there have been few non-AD primary diagnoses, but comorbidities have been observed in a majority of individuals. 10, 37 Although the pattern of results in MCI was broadly consistent with AD, there were several important differences. First, patients with Ab2 MCI had less cognitive and functional impairment at baseline than patients with Ab1 MCI, whereas patients with AD did not differ. This is consistent with the frequent observation that MCI is a heterogeneous condition 38 and suggests that those with more severe or functional impairment were more likely to be Ab1. In AD, functional impairment is a diagnostic criterion, which may have resulted in less functional variability, or smaller sample sizes may have resulted in lower ability to detect differences at baseline. Second, compared to patients with Ab1 MCI, patients with Ab2 MCI had larger hippocampi and higher glucose metabolism in the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal regions, while patients with AD did not differ on these measurements. While we cannot rule out a developmental explanation for the differing hippocampal volumes and hypometabolism, our findings suggest that non-AD etiologies involving less medial temporal pathology account for the cognitive symptoms of patients with Ab2 MCI. The fact that patients with AD had low hippocampal volume that did not differ on the basis of amyloid status suggests that even those without amyloid had sufficient non-AD-related hippocampal pathology to account for their clinical diagnosis (e.g., hippocampal sclerosis). These findings should be viewed in light of several limitations. First, although we divided participants into groups on the basis of amyloid status, patients with Ab2 AD phenotype make up a diverse set of individuals with a broad range of pathologies. Therefore a \"relative absence of AD-like characteristics\" may best summarize these patients rather than specific non-AD etiologies. Second, our ability to thoroughly evaluate Ab2 cases was limited by the data available in ADNI, which meant that there were extensive biomarker measurements available but clinical observations were relatively limited. Third, although we examined potential methodologic problems that could account for false-negative scans, there are additional culprits we could not investigate specifically, such as contamination of the cerebellum by cerebral amyloid angiopathy 39 or the presence of soluble forms of Ab, both of which could account for some CSF1/florbetapir2 cases (which were the majority of discordant CSF-florbetapir cases). Finally, because we focused on florbetapir2 scans, our method was not designed to detect false-positive scans, so the full set of Ab2 patients may not have been fully captured.\nA more extensive understanding of patients who present with AD symptoms but lack evidence of Ab Voxelwise FDG-PET and voxel-based morphometry contrasts of florbetapir1 vs florbetapir2 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer disease (AD) participants\nResults of whole-brain contrasts show regions with increased glucose metabolism for florbetapir2 compared to florbetapir1 MCI and AD (A; blue, p , 0.001 uncorrected) and regions with increased gray matter volume for florbetapir2 compared to florbetapir1 MCI and AD (B; blue, p , 0.001 uncorrected), controlling for age, sex, and education. Independently derived AD-specific FDG-PET previously validated regions of interest (red) used in our region of interest analysis are overlaid on the voxelwise FDG-PET results for visual comparison.\npathology is important for several reasons. A discrepancy between the clinical and neuropathologic diagnoses may mislead patients and families about the anticipated course of illness. Furthermore, although there are currently no existing disease-modifying drugs available for treating AD, an incorrect diagnosis may also result in inappropriate drug treatment. Finally, inclusion of Ab2 individuals in a clinical trial of an Ab2 modifying drug therapy could result in exposure to a treatment without potential benefit and reduce the statistical power of the trial, making the observation of successful Ab2 modifying treatment less likely. Our findings indicate that screening for Ab positivity as part of enrollment criteria in clinical trials would eliminate approximately 1 out of 7 patients with AD and 1 out of 3 patients with MCI, thereby preventing administration of Ab2 modifying treatment to patients without Ab pathology."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "S.M.
