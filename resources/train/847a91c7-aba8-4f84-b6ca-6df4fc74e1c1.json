A sample of these students were selected to be interviewed during or just after their first year in 2004 and interviewed again in 2006 as part of the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/06). This report describes the background and characteristics of these beginning postsecondary students, some of their experiences while enrolled, and their persistence and completion of any programs of study in the 3 years after they had first enrolled."}, {"section_title": "Data and Methods", "text": "The 2004/06 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/06) collected information from a sample of about 19,000 undergraduates who enrolled in about 1,300 postsecondary institutions for the first time between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2004. These students were interviewed in 2004 as part of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04) and were then interviewed again in 2006. The BPS:04/06 study includes first-year data about the students that were collected in NPSAS:04, as well as data collected in 2006 about their experiences after the first year of enrollment. The BPS:04/06 sample represents those first-time undergraduates enrolled in postsecondary institutions in the United States and Puerto Rico that participate in the federal Title IV student aid programs. Additional information about the sample design is available in appendix B of this report. The estimates presented in this report were produced using the BPS:04/06 Data Analysis System (DAS). The analysis uses standard t tests to determine the statistical significance of differences between estimates. All differences noted are statistically significant at the p < .05 level. For more information on statistical methods, see appendix B. The findings presented here are descriptive. Although associations are noted and discussed, no causal inferences should be made.\nThe data in this report are from the 2004/06 Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (BPS:04/06), the latest in a series of BPS studies covering the years 1990-94 (BPS:90/94) and 1996-2001 (BPS:96/01). The students in the BPS:04/06 study will be contacted again and interviewed in 2009. The descriptive reports and public access datasets for all of these studies are available from the NCES website (http://nces.ed.gov/das). The BPS:04/06 study includes the results of the 2004 survey, administered during the students' first year of enrollment, as well as the results of the first follow-up survey of 2006. The 2004 survey was administered as part of the 2003-04 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04). NPSAS:04 is a nationally representative sample of about 90,000 undergraduate, graduate, and first-professional students in about 1,600 postsecondary institutions in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico 1 that are eligible to participate in the federal Title IV student aid programs. Approximately 19,000 respondents were identified as first-time beginners in the NPSAS:04 survey and became the sample for the BPS:04/06 longitudinal study. The NPSAS:04 study sample represents the approximately 19 million undergraduates enrolled in 2003-04, while the BPS:04/06 study sample represents about 4 million of these undergraduates who were first-time beginners that academic year. The estimates presented in this report were produced using the BPS:04/06 Data Analysis System (DAS). A glossary describing the variables in the DAS that were used to produce the tables is provided in appendix A. All comparisons made in the Selected Findings were tested using Student's t statistic, and all differences cited were statistically significant at the .05 level. Standard errors for estimates in this report are available at http://nces.ed.gov/das/library/reports.asp. The findings presented here are entirely descriptive in nature. Although associations are noted and discussed, these associations do not support causal inferences. The information about the BPS students in their first year comes from the NPSAS:04 study, which is based on a wide variety of sources such as institutional records, federal financial aid applications, federal student loan and Pell grant records, and a student interview. The information about the BPS students in 2006 is primarily based on the follow-up student interview, supplemented with data from the same federal databases, college admissions test agencies, and the National Student Clearinghouse enrollment records. The student interviews in both years were a web-based questionnaire that was either self-administered or conducted via telephone with a trained interviewer. In 2006 about 15,000 students completed the interview, resulting in a weighted response rate of 77 percent. The technical notes in appendix B supply additional information about response rates, the methodology of the data collection, file preparation, and analysis. Pascarella and Terenzini (2005) also review the research on the relationship of parental education and family income to student persistence. Student persistence in college is positively associated with higher levels of parental education; students whose parents attended college are more likely to go to college and to complete a degree. Persistence is also positively associated with family income, but financial aid enhances the persistence and degree completion of lowincome students. The recent literature by economists examining the complex relationship of persistence to financial aid, family income, parental education, and academic preparation has been reviewed by Long (2007). The first study in the Beginning Postsecondary Students series followed a cohort of students beginning postsecondary education in 1989-90 through their fifth year in 1994 (Berkner, Cuccaro-Alamin, and McCormick 1996). The second BPS study was based on a cohort of students beginning in 1995-96. The characteristics of these students in their first year were described by Kojaku and Nunes (1998) and their 3-year persistence and attainment was described by Berkner, Horn, and Clune (2000). These two reports provide information about the 1995-96 beginning students that is comparable to the information presented in this report about the 2003-04 beginning students. The persistence and degree completion rates of the 1995-96 cohort after 6 years is described in Berkner, He and Cataldi (2002). The persistence and attainment rates of the 1989-90 and the 1995-96 cohorts of beginning students are compared in Horn and Berger (2004). Adelman (2006) analyses the BPS data in relation to the college enrollment experience and completion rates of a cohort of students who were in the eighth grade in 1988. Choy (2002) provides a summary of the results of the NCES studies on students that is written for a general audience. academic preparation, and their enrollment patterns during the 3 years after they first enrolled. The focus of the narrative is to show the differences in the backgrounds and enrollment persistence of students who started at either 4-year, 2-year, or less-than-2-year institutions in 2003-04. The student enrollment and attainment patterns are described both in terms of retention at the first institution attended and as persistence anywhere in postsecondary education. The second part of the report is a table compendium that provides more detail about the topics discussed in the narrative. The compendium also includes tables and summaries of findings on a variety of other topics of interest that are covered in the BPS:04/06 survey. These topics include faculty contact, distance education and remedial courses, academic performance and experiences, reasons for leaving a college, participation in community service, job characteristics and salaries of those no longer enrolled, and financial aid received during the first year of enrollment. Each section of the compendium includes highlights of some of the important findings shown in the tables. The variables selected for the rows in the tables describe institutional and student characteristics associated with persistence, such as the type of first institution attended, degree plans, enrollment intensity, age, gender, race/ethnicity, dependency status, family income, parental level of education, recent high school graduation, high school mathematics courses, and admissions test scores."}, {"section_title": "Types of Institutions Attended", "text": "About one-half (48 percent) of the first-time students in 2003-04 began at a 2-year institution, 44 percent began at a 4-year institution, and 8 percent began at a less-than-2-year institution (figure A).

Among the students under age 24 who began at 4-year institutions, about one-half (47 percent) reported a high school grade point average (GPA) of 3.5 or higher, compared with 17 percent of the beginners at 2-year institutions (table E). One measure of the rigor of the courses taken in high school is the highest level of mathematics taken. Among students under age 24 who started at 4year institutions, about one-fourth (27 percent) reported taking calculus in high school; 6 percent reported taking only courses below algebra II. Among beginners under age 24 starting at 2-year institutions, 5 percent reported taking calculus and one-fourth (25 percent) reported taking only courses below algebra II (table F).  viii About 90 percent of beginners had regular high school diplomas, but the percentage who did not varied by institution type (compendium table 2.1). Four percent of students who began at 4-year institutions, 13 percent who began at 2-year institutions, and 25 percent who began at lessthan-2-year institutions did so without a regular high school diploma. Among beginning students under age 24, about one-fifth reported that they had earned Advanced Placement Test college credits which were accepted by their institution (19 percent) or that they had earned college credits for courses taken at a college while in high school (21 percent) (table 10).\nNot all beginning students enter postsecondary education with the same level of academic preparation or performance, and this information is useful for understanding rates of persistence and attainment. For all beginning students, information is available on the type of high school credential they earned (if any) and the type of high school from which they graduated. For students under age 24 when they began their postsecondary education, information was usually available on their high school grade point average, the highest level of high school mathematics courses taken, any college credits they earned during high school, and their scores on college admission tests (ACT or SAT). This type of information is less relevant for older students who have been out of high school for a long time and were age 24 or older when they first started  postsecondary education. With the exception of the admissions test scores, all data in this report related to academic preparation and performance in high school are student reported. About 90 percent of the beginning students had received a diploma at a public (79 percent), private (8 percent), or foreign high school (3 percent) (compendium table 2.1). The remaining 10 percent did not have a regular high school diploma-that is, they had a high school equivalency certificate based on their General Educational Development (GED) Test scores or other certificate of completion, or had been home schooled, or had not finished high school. The percentage of beginners without a high school diploma was 4 percent at 4-year institutions, 13 percent at 2-year institutions, and 25 percent at less-than-2-year institutions. About 80 percent of the beginners under age 24 had taken the ACT or SAT college admissions tests: 95 percent of those at 4-year institutions, 67 percent at 2-year institutions, and 37 percent at less-than-2-year institutions took these tests (table 7). Among those under age 24 who took one of the tests, about one-third (35 percent) of those starting at 4-year institutions were among those with the highest scores and 13 percent were in the lowest category of scores. At 2-year institutions, 41 percent of those under age 24 who took the tests were in the lowest score category. Admissions test scores are usually neither required nor considered in admission to 2-year or less-than-2-year institutions. About one-half (47 percent) of beginners at 4-year institutions reported a high school grade point average (GPA) of 3.5 or higher (table 8). About one-half (46 percent) of the beginners at 2year institutions and over one-half (57 percent) at less-than-2-year institutions reported a high school GPA below 3.0. One measure of the rigor of the courses taken in high school is the highest level of mathematics courses taken. Among students under age 24 who started at 4-year colleges, about one-fourth (27 percent) reported taking calculus in high school and 6 percent reported taking only courses below algebra II. Among beginners under age 24 starting at 2-year institutions, some 6 percent reported taking calculus and one-fourth (25 percent) reported taking less than algebra II (table 9).  About one-fifth of the beginning students under age 24 reported that they had earned Advanced Placement Test college credits, which were accepted by their institution (19 percent), or that they had earned college credits for courses taken at a college while in high school (21 percent); 30 percent reported earning college credits one or both ways (table 10). Among those under age 24 beginning at 4-year institutions, 41 percent reported having earned college credits while still in high school, and 21 percent of those under age 24 starting at 2-year colleges also reported doing so.

Some beginning students may \"stop out\" by leaving an institution for a semester or more, and then return to that or a different institution later. Students who have \"stopped out\" can only be identified as such after they have returned, which may be after the 3-year period of this study. When the term \"left\" is used in this report, it only refers to the enrollment status of the student at the end of the 3-year period, and includes some \"stop-outs\" who cannot be identified until later. Institutions usually measure student retention as the percentage of beginners still enrolled in the fall term of each year after they first started. The figures below for 3-year retention at the first institution show the percentage of the 2003-04 beginners who were not enrolled at any time in 2005-06 and also those who were enrolled only in the fall of 2005. Less-than-2-year institutions offer certificates in vocational fields that can be completed in less than 2 years of full-time enrollment. About onehalf (52 percent) of the students beginning at a less-than-2-year institution in 2003-04 had attained a certificate by 2006 at the same institution where they had started (figure C). Five percent of the beginners at less-than-2-year institutions were still enrolled at the same institution without completing a certificate in June 2006; 3 percent were last enrolled there in the fall of 2005; and 35 percent left the institution without completing a certificate and were not enrolled Two-year institutions offer associate's degree programs, which can normally be completed in 2 years of full-time enrollment, and may also offer certificates in vocational programs. Sixteen percent of the 2003-04 beginning students at 2-year institutions had attained a certificate (6 percent) or associate's degree (10 percent) within 3 years at the institution where they had first enrolled (table 5.1).

Eighteen percent had left the institution without a degree and transferred elsewhere during the 3-year period. Four-year institutions offer bachelor's degrees, which can usually be completed in 4 years of full-time enrollment, but may also offer associate's degree and certificate programs. Two percent of the beginners at 4-year institutions completed a bachelor's degree in 3 years and 4 percent completed an associate's degree or a certificate at the institution where they had started (table 5.1).

One is from the perspective of the first institution attended. The first institution attended designates students as first-time beginners (or freshmen) and reports whether those students continue to be enrolled or complete a program at that institution. This perspective will be referred to as retention and attainment at the first institution attended. The other is from the perspective of the student. It looks at the beginning student's enrollment history and degree attainment at any postsecondary institution over the 3year period under consideration. This will be referred to as student persistence and attainment anywhere. The difference between these two perspectives reflects the fact that many students transfer out of the first institution attended. When beginning students leave the institution where they first enrolled and then enroll at a different institution, they continue to persist in postsecondary education, but from the perspective of the institution where they started, they have no longer been retained. Similarly, graduation rates reported by institutions do not include outcomes for students who have transferred elsewhere; this additional information requires a survey like the BPS study. The normal length of time it takes for a full-time student to complete a program and attain a certificate or degree depends on the type of program. Vocational certificate programs normally take less than 2 years to complete, associate's degree programs can be completed in 2 or 3 years, and bachelor's degree programs can be completed in 4 or 5 years. The 3-year period covered in this report (from July 2003 to June 2006) is long enough for students beginning in 2003-04 to complete certificates and associate's degrees, but too short for most students to complete bachelor's degrees at 4-year colleges and universities. The 3-year period covered in this report is also too short to determine whether students who had not attained a certificate or degree and were no longer enrolled anywhere in June 2006 had permanently left postsecondary education. Some beginning students may \"stop out\" by leaving an institution for a semester or more, and then returning to that or a different institution later. Students who have \"stopped out\" can only be identified as such after they have returned, which may be after the 3-year period of this study. When the term \"left\" is used in this report, it only refers to the enrollment status of the student at the end of the 3-year period, and includes some \"stop-outs\" who cannot be identified until later. Institutions usually measure student retention as the percentage of beginners still enrolled in the fall term of each year after they first started. The figures below for 3-year retention at the first institution show the percentage of the 2003-04 beginners who were not enrolled at any time in 2005-06 and also those who were enrolled only in the fall of 2005. Less-than-2-year institutions offer certificates in vocational fields that can be completed in less than 2 years of full-time enrollment. About one-half (52 percent) of the students beginning at a less-than-2-year institution in 2003-04 had attained a certificate by 2006 at the same institution where they had started (figure 3). Five percent of the beginners at less-than-2-year institutions    Two-year institutions offer associate's degree programs, which can normally be completed in 2 years of full-time enrollment, and may also offer certificates in vocational programs. Sixteen percent of the 2003-04 beginning students at 2-year institutions had attained a certificate (6 percent) or associate's degree (10 percent) within 3 years at the institution where they had first enrolled. Twenty-four percent of the beginners were still enrolled at the same institution without completing a degree or certificate in June 2006; 7 percent were last enrolled there in the fall of 2005; and 35 percent had left the institution before completing a degree or certificate and were not enrolled anywhere during the 2005-06 academic year. Eighteen percent had left the institution without a credential and transferred elsewhere during the 3-year period. Four-year institutions offer bachelor's degrees, which can usually be completed in 4 or 5 years of full-time enrollment, but may also offer associate's degree and certificate programs. Two percent of the beginners at 4-year institutions completed a bachelor's degree in 3 years and 4 percent completed an associate's degree or a certificate at the institution where they had started. Sixty percent were still enrolled at the same institution without a degree in June 2006; 4 percent were last enrolled in the fall of 2005; and 13 percent had left the institution and were not enrolled anywhere during the 2005-06 academic year. Eighteen percent had left the 4-year institution where they had started and transferred to a different institution before completing any program."}, {"section_title": "Student Persistence and Attainment Anywhere", "text": "The students who left the institution where they had started without completing a certificate or degree either did not enroll anywhere else or they transferred (with or without credits) to another institution. Figures 4, 5, and 6 illustrate the relationship between the enrollment outcomes after 3 years at the first institution attended and the students' enrollment experiences anywhere in postsecondary education. The difference between the two is what happens to the transfers: they may still be enrolled without a degree, may have attained a degree at the transfer institution, or they may also have left the transfer institution without a degree. Since this study is limited to a 3-year period, some of those without a degree and not enrolled anywhere in June 2006 may actually be \"stop-outs\" who will enroll again later. The figures below compare the 3year retention at the first institution, which includes students last enrolled in the fall of 2005, to the 3-year persistence of the same students anywhere in the spring of 2006. The students enrolled only in the fall term at the first institution are included among those not enrolled anywhere in June 2006. Among students beginning at a 4-year institution, 13 percent left the institution without completing a program and were not enrolled anywhere in 2005-06; 4 percent were last enrolled in the fall of 2005; and 18 percent had transferred elsewhere without a degree (figure 4). By June 2006, 19 percent of the students who started at a 4-year institution had not attained any degree and were not enrolled anywhere; this includes the students who transferred and then left the second institution without a degree as well as those last enrolled in the fall of 2005. Seven percent had attained a degree or certificate and 74 percent were still enrolled without a degree, either at the first institution or at the transfer institution.  Among students beginning at a 2-year institution, 35 percent left the institution without completing a program before the 2005-06 academic year and did not enroll anywhere else; 7 percent were last enrolled in the fall of 2005; and 18 percent transferred elsewhere without a degree (figure 5). By June 2006, 45 percent of the students who started at a 2-year institution had not attained any degree and were not enrolled anywhere; this includes the students who transferred and then left the second institution as well as those last enrolled in the fall of 2005. Eighteen percent had attained a degree or certificate and 37 percent were still enrolled without a degree, either at the first institution or at the transfer institution.

By June 2006, 40 percent of all those who started at a less-than-2 year institution had left postsecondary education without completing a program anywhere. Table 11 shows some of the relationships between persistence, attainment, and certain student characteristics found in the more detailed compendium tables of this report. Among students in programs that can be completed in 3 years or less, those in shorter programs have higher rates of completion than those in programs that take longer to complete. Students working on certificates, which can usually be completed in less than 2 years, attain certificates at a higher rate (44 percent) than the students who are working on associate's degrees attain associate's  degrees (15 percent). Students who are always enrolled full time have higher completion rates (18 percent) than those who are always enrolled part time (7 percent), and part-time students leave postsecondary education without completion at higher rates (69 percent) than full-time students (28 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Persistence, Attainment, and Student Profiles", "text": "Independent students both leave postsecondary education without completion at higher rates (53 percent) than dependent students (26 percent) and have higher overall completion rates (21 percent) than dependent students (14 percent).

About one-fourth (27 percent) of the independent students are working on certificates, compared with 8 percent of the dependent students (compendium table 1.3), and 15 percent of all independent students attained a certificate, compared with 5 percent of all dependent students (table 11). About 90 percent of independent students are age 20 or older (compendium table 1.7). During the first 3 years, older students leave postsecondary education without completion at higher rates than younger students (table 11). Students who began at age 18 or 19 had 3-year rates of departure from postsecondary education without completion of 22 and 27 percent, respectively, while those in the 20 or higher age groups left postsecondary education without completion at a rate of about 50 percent. Among students who worked full time while enrolled in 2003-04, one-half left postsecondary education without completing a degree within 3 years, representing a higher rate of departure than those who did not work (28 percent) and those who worked part time (29 percent) (table 11). Students who worked full time remained enrolled after 3 years at lower rates than their peers who did not work or worked part time (35 percent vs. 55-56 percent).

Multiple data sources were used to provide information regarding a student's FTB status during the NPSAS year, including the NPSAS:04 student interview, records from the student's base-year institution via CADE, and federal financial aid sources. The data elements that were examined to estimate a student's likelihood of being an FTB and to construct the frame for the BPS:04/06 sample included the following: \u2022 FTB status from the institution enrollment lists used for NPSAS:04 student sampling; \u2022 FTB status from the CPS; 4 \u2022 FTB status from student-level data obtained from institutional records via CADE; \u2022 student reports (obtained during the NPSAS:04 interview) indicating that they were FTBs during the 2003-04 academic year; \u2022 year of high school graduation; \u2022 receipt of Stafford loan (date loan was first received and number of years loan was received); \u2022 receipt of Pell grant (date grant was first received and number of years grant was received); and \u2022 undergraduate class level. Using the above indicators, an index was created to estimate the likelihood of being an FTB. A positive index value was assigned to cases with more positive indicators than negative indicators. For example, students for whom all of the indicators listed above suggested that the student was an FTB were assigned an index value of 8. This index was then used to create a set of decision rules to identify which cases would be included or excluded from the follow-up sample, and which among those included would require additional eligibility screening. The determination of \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high\" likelihood of being an FTB differed for base-year study respondents and base-year study nonrespondents because more data elements were available for the base-year study respondents. Base-year study respondents were considered to have a \"low\" likelihood of being an FTB if (1) they were not identified as a potential FTB based on CADE or CPS data, (2) they had a negative index value, or (3) they had any Stafford loans or Pell grants that began prior to 2003 (indicating enrollment prior to the NPSAS year). Students with a \"low\" likelihood of being an FTB were excluded from the BPS sample. If the B-9 index was between 0 and 2, the student was classified as having a \"medium\" likelihood of being an FTB. If the index was 2 or more, then the student was classified as having a \"high\" likelihood of being an FTB. Base-year study nonrespondents had very little extant data. Students were considered to have a \"low\" likelihood of being an FTB if they were not identified as a potential FTB by either CADE or CPS. These students were excluded from the BPS sample. Students who were identified as a potential FTB from CADE (but not CPS) were classified as having a \"medium\" likelihood of being an FTB. Students who had an indicator from CPS that they were an FTB were classified as having a \"high\" likelihood of being an FTB. The NPSAS:04 sample yielded the numbers of students below who either indicated that they were FTBs during the interview and had other institutional records or federal financial aid sources that supported this, or were identified as potential FTBs based on institutional records or federal financial aid sources. 1. Approximately 24,990 students responding to the student interview indicated that they were FTBs during the 2003-04 academic year. Based on a review of the FTB status indicators above, approximately 21,170 of these were identified for inclusion in the follow-up sample. Of the approximately 21,170 included in the follow-up sample, approximately 19,800 had other data that strongly supported their FTB status, and approximately 1,370 of these students had some indications that they were not FTBs; these potential false positives were rescreened during the BPS:04/06 interview to confirm their status. The remaining approximately 3,820 of the original 24,990 were identified for exclusion from the follow-up when multiple data sources confirmed that they could not have been FTBs during the NPSAS year. 2. Approximately 1,420 students were not originally classified as FTBs, but were potential FTBs based on CPS data or because they had a high school graduation date in 2003 or 2004. These potential false negatives were also screened during the BPS:04/06 interview to verify their status. 3. Approximately 8,860 students did not respond to the NPSAS:04 student interview but were classified as NPSAS:04 study respondents and were potential FTBs based on CADE or CPS data, having more positive than negative indicators among the other variables, and having any Stafford loans or Pell grants that began after 2003. 4. Approximately 720 NPSAS:04 sample members were potential FTBs based on information from CADE or CPS, but did not respond to the student interview and did not have sufficient data to be classified as study respondents.

After data collection ended, logistic regression models for predicting eligibility among BPS nonrespondents were developed using data from BPS:04/06 respondents and the variables available for the BPS frame construction (date of birth; dates the student began receiving Stafford loans or Pell grants; FTB status according to the institution, CPS, or CADE; and institutional sector). All BPS:04/06 nonrespondents who had responded to the NPSAS:04 interview and were classified as FTBs were initially classified as eligible for BPS. Separate logistic regression models were fitted for each of the remaining sampling groups (NPSAS:04 respondents who were not initially classified as FTB and NPSAS:04 nonrespondents). At the conclusion of the modeling, 99 percent (4,480) of the nonrespondents were predicted to have a high probability of being eligible for BPS. Added together with the eligible respondents to the BPS interview, a total of 22,180 sample members were initially classified as eligible for BPS. One additional source of data on the BPS:04/06 sample, the NSC Tracker (http://www.studentclearinghouse.org), was obtained following completion of full-scale data collection and the modeling described above to facilitate imputation of key variables. However, as an additional check on the eligibility of the BPS:04 sample, the Tracker data were also used in combination with interview and other extant data to verify the eligibility status of all sample members retained for inclusion in the cohort. An analysis of enrollment and financial aid data within and across data sources identified a subset of the sample who, based on the results, were determined to be ineligible for membership in the BPS:04 cohort. Table B-5 presents the distribution of these cases by type of student and BPS:04/06 interview response status. The large majority of cases come from the group of NPSAS:04 respondents who were determined during that base-year interview to be FTBs based on a series of questions in the eligibility section. The distribution of final eligible FTBs is shown in the top half of table B-5. to Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) (Kass 1980), which was used for the imputation procedures in NPSAS:04. CART, however, is a nonparametric approach to forming imputation classes. This step produced a number of imputation classes that contain sets of donors used to impute recipients belonging to that class. Most of the variables derived from the BPS:04/06 interview had more than 5 percent missing because interview nonrespondents were included in the imputation. Next, the imputation classes were used as input to a SAS macro that implemented the weighted sequential hot-deck procedure. Additionally, data were sorted within each imputation class to increase the chance of obtaining a close match between donor and recipient. The hotdeck process was sequential in that the search for donors occurred sequentially, starting with the recipient and progressing up and down the sorted file to find the set of eligible donors from which a random selection of one was made. The process was weighted because it incorporated the sample weight of each record in the search and selection routine. 7 In some cases, further intervention was needed to ensure accuracy and consistency of imputation, as determined by preexisting edit rules. For example, to impute the level of parents' education when it was known that the parents had some college but the specific education level was unknown, the potential pool of donors was limited to those with at least some college education to prevent imputing parents' education level as less-than-college."}, {"section_title": "Weighting", "text": "All estimates in this report are weighted to represent the target population described in the sample design section. The weights compensate for the unequal probability of selection of institutions and students in the NPSAS:04 sample. The weights also adjust for multiplicity at the institution and student levels 8 and unknown student eligibility for NPSAS. Because the students in the BPS:04/06 sample are a subset of the NPSAS:04 sample, the BPS weights were derived from the NPSAS weights. The BPS:04/06 base weight is the product of the first eight NPSAS weight components given in table B-6. The weight for the subsample of NPSAS CATI nonrespondents who were included in the BPS:04/06 data collection was adjusted by the inverse of the subsampling fraction.

In these instances, the institution weights were adjusted for the joint probability of selection. Likewise, students who attended more than one institution during the NPSAS year also had multiple chances of selection.

Nonresponse bias could come from a variety of sources, including failure of the institution to provide lists for NPSAS:04, student nonresponse to BPS:04/06, and item nonresponse to the BPS:04/06 interview."}, {"section_title": "Institution-Level Bias Analysis", "text": "An institution respondent is defined as any sample institution for which \u2022 a student list was received that was sufficient for selecting a sample; or \u2022 a sample of students was selected from an NSLDS file of Stafford loan and Pell grant recipients in cases where such a student file was believed to include at least 85 percent of the student population. Of the 1,630 eligible NPSAS:04 sample institutions, 1,360 were respondents (84 unweighted percent and 80 weighted percent). The institution weighted response rate is also below 85 percent for six of the nine types of institutions. The weighted response rates by type of institution range from 70 percent for public 4-year non-doctorate-granting institutions to 93 percent for private not-for-profit less-than-4-year institutions. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for all institutions and for the six types of institutions with a weighted response rate below 85 percent. The nonresponse bias was estimated for variables known (i.e., non-missing) for most respondents and nonrespondents. Extensive data from IPEDS are available for all institutions. The following variables were used: 9 \u2022 type of institution; 10 \u2022 Carnegie classification; \u2022 degree of urbanization; \u2022 Bureau of Economic Analysis Code (OBE) region; \u2022 historically Black college or university indicator; \u2022 percentage of students receiving federal grant aid; \u2022 percentage of students receiving state/local grant aid; \u2022 percentage of students receiving institutional grant aid; \u2022 percentage of students receiving student loan aid; \u2022 percentage of students enrolled: Hispanic; \u2022 percentage of students enrolled: Asian or Pacific Islander; \u2022 percentage of students enrolled: Black, non-Hispanic; \u2022 total undergraduate enrollment; \u2022 male undergraduate enrollment; \u2022 female undergraduate enrollment; \u2022 total graduate/first-professional enrollment; \u2022 male graduate/first-professional enrollment; and \u2022 female graduate/first-professional enrollment. First, for the institution-level variables listed above, the nonresponse bias was estimated and tested to determine if the bias was significant at the 5 percent level. Second, nonresponse adjustments were computed, and the variables listed above were included in the nonresponse models. The nonresponse adjustments (see the weighting section of this appendix) were designed to significantly reduce or eliminate nonresponse bias for variables included in the models. Third, after the weights were computed, any remaining bias was estimated for the variables listed above, and statistical tests were performed to check the remaining significant nonresponse bias. As shown in table B-7, the institution weighting adjustments eliminated some, but not all, bias. For all types of institutions combined, about 6 percent of the variables showed statistically 9 For the continuous variables, categories were formed based on quartiles or logical breaks. 10 Type of institution was used only in the nonresponse bias analysis for all institutions. Appendix B-Technical Notes and Methodology B-19 significant bias due to institution nonresponse prior to the nonresponse adjustment; the variables with significant bias were type of institution, degree of urbanization, OBE region, and graduate/first-professional enrollment. After the nonresponse weight adjustment, none of these variables had statistically significant bias. The results varied by type of institution. Before weighting for public less-than-2-year institutions, and public 2-year institutions, 6 percent and 7 percent, respectively, of the variable categories were significantly biased. Variables 11 with statistically significant bias before weight adjustment for these types of institutions were percentage of students enrolled who are Black non-Hispanic, OBE region, and percentage receiving institutional grant aid. After the weighting adjustment, no significant bias remained for the variables analyzed for these types of institutions. None of the variables showed statistically significant bias either before or after the nonresponse adjustment for the private not-for-profit 4-year non-doctorate-granting institutions. For the other types of institutions, the percentage of variable categories with significant bias decreased after weight adjustments, but was not completely eliminated. For public 4-year non-doctorate-granting institutions, variables with statistically significant bias prior to the nonresponse adjustment were whether the institution is a historically Black college or institution, total undergraduate enrollment, total graduate/first-professional enrollment, male graduate/firstprofessional enrollment, and female graduate/first-professional enrollment; after the nonresponse adjustment, the bias was reduced for all of the variables but was still statistically significant for total graduate/first-professional enrollment and female graduate/first-professional enrollment. For private not-for-profit 4-year non-doctorate-granting institutions, OBE region had statistically significant bias prior to nonresponse adjustment, but this bias was reduced and was no longer statistically significant after nonresponse adjustment; one level of variable for this type of institution, the percentage receiving student loan aid, had statistically significant bias after the nonresponse adjustment, but was not statistically significant before the adjustment. For private for-profit less-than-2-year institutions, the percentage receiving student loan and total undergraduate enrollment showed statistically significant biases prior to the nonresponse weight adjustment; after the adjustment, bias for the total undergraduate enrollment was reduced and no longer significant, but the bias for the percentage receiving student loans was still statistically significant. In summary, significant bias was reduced for the variables known for most respondents and nonrespondents, which are considered to be some of the more analytically important variables and are correlated with many of the other variables. Further details of the institution-level bias analysis can be found in the 2004 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:04) Full-Scale Methodology Report (Cominole et al. 2006)."}, {"section_title": "Student-Level Bias Analysis", "text": "As mentioned in the sample design section above, a student respondent was defined as any sample member who was determined to be eligible for the study and had valid data for a selected set of key analytical variables. The BPS:04/06 analysis file contains all eligible sample members. Nonrespondents to the BPS:04/06 interview appear on the analysis file with imputed data. Of the 18,640 eligible sample students, 14,900 responded, resulting in an unweighted response rate of 80 percent and a weighted response rate of 77 percent. Since these rates are less than 85 percent, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted. The nonresponse bias was estimated for variables known for most respondents and nonrespondents. Some of these variables were known for all sample members, and the remaining were only known for federally aided students. These variables are included on the DAS and are listed below. The nonresponse bias was estimated for the above variables, and tested (adjusting for multiple comparisons) to determine if the bias was significant at the 5 percent level. This bias analysis was conducted for the entire sample and for each of the institutional strata. As shown in table B-8 for the entire sample, the bias was significant for many of these variables; almost half of the categories had significant bias. However, the relative bias was generally very small; for 7 of the 18 significant variables the relative bias was less than 5 percent, and for another 5 the relative bias was less than 10 percent. This analysis looks at the difference between respondents and nonrespondents. However, a separate weight adjustment for unit nonresponse was not made, because the data file contains both respondents and nonrespondents (with imputed data). As a result, the bias after nonresponse adjustment was not compared or evaluated. Because all of the nonrespondents were included in the data file, there was no nonresponse bias for the variables listed in table B-8. As noted earlier, the variables used in this analysis were known for almost all of the sample members (respondents as well as nonrespondents). Only the Pell amount and Stafford amount variables had any missing values. Of the 18,640 eligible students in BPS:04/06, the Pell amount variable was missing for 27 students and was imputed during NPSAS:04 for 40 students. The Stafford amount variable was missing for 27 students and was imputed during NPSAS:04 for 87 students.   Table B-9 summarizes the bias analysis for each institution type. For the total BPS:04 cohort, approximately 45 percent of the variables examined in table B-9 had statistically significant bias, but the mean and median relative bias was low: less than 3 percent. The percentage of variables with statistically significant bias varied from 0 to 22 percent, by type of institution. The public less-than-2-year institutions and public 4-year doctorate-granting institutions had the largest percentage of variables with significant bias due to student nonresponse; however, the mean relative bias was less than 5 percent for these categories. As noted earlier, all respondents and nonrespondents are included on the BPS:04/06 data file, which eliminates bias due to student nonresponse.

Item response rates (RRI) are calculated as the ratio of the number of respondents for whom an in-scope response was obtained (I x for item x) to the number of respondents who are asked to answer that item. The number asked to answer an item is the number of unit-level respondents (I) minus the number of respondents with a valid skip item for item x (V x ). When an abbreviated questionnaire is used to convert refusals, the eliminated questions are treated as item nonresponse (U.S. Department of Education 2003)."}, {"section_title": "RRI x = I x / (I -V x )", "text": "Second, for NPSAS:2000, the survey was restricted for the first time to institutions participating in Title IV student aid programs. According to the DAS for NPSAS:96, only about 1 percent of the sampled undergraduates were attending an institution not eligible to participate in Title IV aid programs. When students attending non-Title IV-eligible institutions were excluded from the NPSAS:96 sample, the percentage of undergraduates who received financial aid increased by less than 1 percent. This small change primarily affects comparisons of students enrolled in less-than-2-year and private for-profit institutions. When using the DAS from prior BPS studies for comparison to the BPS:04 cohort, analysts may want to filter cases in the prior studies (BPS:90 cohort, BPS:96 cohort) based on the variable that identifies whether the student was sampled from an institution that was eligible to participate in Title IV aid programs (T4ELIG). Finally, a design change in the NPSAS was made, beginning with NPSAS:90, to improve full-year estimates. NPSAS:90 sampled students were enrolled at four discrete points in time: summer (August), fall (October), winter (February), and spring (June). Since implementation of NPSAS in 1993, institutions have been asked to provide one list that represents students enrolled at any time during the respective financial aid award year. In NPSAS:90, those students who were initially sampled in the fall could have been enrolled for the full academic year. The BPS:04/06 also differs from prior rounds of BPS in that the BPS:04/06 dataset contains data items and a positive analysis weight for all sample members who were determined to be eligible; this includes nonrespondents as well as respondents to the BPS:04/06 data collection. Nonrespondents to the interview appear on the data file with imputed data for all variables. In previous rounds of BPS, the nonrespondents appeared on the file but did not have data items and had a value of zero for the analysis weight."}, {"section_title": "Additional Notes on the Accuracy of Estimates", "text": "RTI conducted a bias analysis to determine if any variables were significantly biased due to institutional-and student-level nonresponse.

Differences between estimates are tested against the probability of a Type I error, 13 or significance level. The significance levels were determined by calculating the student's t values for the differences between each pair of means or proportions and comparing these with published tables of significance levels for two-tailed hypothesis testing (p < .05). Students' t values may be computed to test the difference between estimates with the following formula: where E 1 and E 2 are the estimates to be compared and se 1 and se 2 are their corresponding standard errors. This formula is valid only for independent estimates. When estimates are not independent, a covariance term must be added to the formula: where r is the correlation between the two variables. 14 The denominator in this formula will be at its maximum when the two estimates are perfectly negatively correlated, that is, when r = -1. This means that a conservative dependent test may be conducted by using -1 for the correlation in this formula as follows: The estimates and standard errors are obtained from the DAS. If the comparison is between the mean of a subgroup and the mean of the total group, the following formula is used: "}]
