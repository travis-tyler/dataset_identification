[{"section_title": "", "text": "that effective prevention programmes can be developed for the elderly. To address different age-related health issues, several longitudinal Chinese ageing studies have previously been conducted in Taiwan or other Asian countries, such as the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS), 7 the China Health & Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), 8 the Beijing Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), 9 the Taiwan Longitudinal Study of Aging (TLSA) 10 and the Singapore Chinese Longitudinal Aging Study. 11 However, most of these established senescent cohorts, which were mainly followed up by collecting selfreported information, had not acquired comprehensive biomedical profiles for their participants. To further understand determinants of healthy longevity and geriatric issues, additional functional status measurements and biochemical data collections have been appended to some sub-studies 7, 8, 12 but their sample sizes were far smaller compared with their original cohorts. For example, lack of statistical power (n \u00bc 639) is one of major limitations of the Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS), 12 a sub-study of the TLSA, in spite of its enrichment with biochemical, genetic and functional measurements. To overcome the common barriers in geriatric cohort research, the Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study in Taiwan (HALST) was therefore established and funded by the National Health Research Institutes in Taiwan to address issues related to healthy ageing (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02677831).\nThe main study objectives of the HALST are to investigate: (i) factors that may influence trajectories of physical functioning; (ii) impacts of healthy lifestyles on incidence of chronic diseases, quality of life and mortality; (iii) individual, social and environmental determinants of cardiovascular diseases; (iv) association of neuropsychiatric risk factors and well-being; and (v) interaction between genetic traits and environmental risk factors in frailty versus successful ageing processes in older adults. The project also involves a variety of ancillary sub-studies focusing on important health-related issues that are unique to local people (such as betel quid chewing, dietary pattern, hepatitis due to viral infection and chronic renal disease). These issues are frequently overlooked but are crucial for the development of health-promotion programmes in older populations."}, {"section_title": "Who is in the cohort?", "text": "The HALST is designed as a longitudinal study recruiting community-dwellers aged 55 and above in seven selected areas in Taiwan: two in the north (Shilin District and Yangmei Township), two in the central region (Miaoli City and Changhua City), two in the south (Puzi Township and Lingya District) and one in the east (Hualien). These seven locations ( Figure 1 ) cover both urban and rural areas, as well as different ethnic groups speaking different dialects, representing the diverse socio-demographic characteristics of the Taiwanese population. In each catchment area, a regional hospital was selected to be the medical facility for clinical examinations, and all eligible residents living within about a 2-km radius of this local hospital were ascertained from the household registry archives. By using a systemic sampling method, beginning with around 3000-3500 residents aged 55 and above in each catchment area, we created a recruitment roster within the target population. To ensure that our study sample covered a sufficient number of the elderly with different sociodemographic backgrounds, the older adults ( 65 years of age) were over-sampled (70% for those 65 years and 30% for those in 55-64 years); on the other hand, the sampling distributions of gender and educational level (none, primary school, high school and above) are based on the demographic distribution within a li (village), a basic house registration unit defined by the Taiwan government. Individuals with any of the following conditions at the recruiting interview were excluded: highly contagious infectious diseases (including scabies and open tuberculosis), severe illnesses (including cancer under treatment), physician-diagnosed dementia, bedridden and/or too frail to stand and walk, severe mental disorder or cognitive impairment with a Mini-Mental Status Score < 16, 13 mental retardation or severe hearing loss. Individuals who were then hospitalized or institutionalized were also excluded. Figure 2 presents a flow chart with details of the subject selection process and the number of participants who completed the first annual follow-up telephone interview. Compared with the recruited subjects, the non-participants were more likely to be women, older and illiterate. In the first-wave survey (2009-13), we enrolled 5664 community-dwellers aged 55 or above.\nHow often have they been followed up?\nThe longitudinal assessments conducted in the HALST consist of home interviews and hospital-based clinical examinations every 5 years. The first-wave survey (recruitment and baseline survey) was carried out in 2009-13. The field study team took about 6-8 months to finish the work in one catchment area, starting in Miaoli City and then moving to the next (Shilin District was the last) for the processes of recruitment, interview and examination. The second-wave follow-up (2014-19) of home interviews and examinations is currently under way. After enrolment, those who have completed both home interviews and hospital-based examinations (n \u00bc 5349) are to be followed up by telephone contact every year for updates on vital status and health-related conditions.\nWhat has been measured?\nIn the sampling area of each site, community residents who met the inclusion criteria were invited to participate in the HALST study. A home interview was arranged for those who completed the consent form. Within 2 weeks after the home visit, study participants received a physical examination and provided morning spot urine and up to 30 ml of fasting blood specimens in one of the local hospitals. The home interview took about 90 to 120 min to complete; and the clinical examination required about 120 min. All interviewing and examination processes are based on the standardized manual of operation; the field sites are periodically inspected by the responsible investigators every season; and a routine call-back interview for quality and reliability control is performed for around 8% of the enrolled subjects by random selection. As seen in Table 1 ALT, alanine aminotransferase; GGT, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; BUN, blood urea nitrogen; HbA1c, glycated haemoglobin; RBC, red blood cells; WBC, white blood cells; HCT, haematocrit; MCV, mean cell volume; MCH, mean corpuscular haemoglobin; MCHC, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration; CRP, C-reactive protein; PTH, parathyroid hormone; HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antigen; Anti-HCVAb, anti-hepatitis C virus antibody; IL-6, interleukin-6; TNF-R1, tumour necrosis factor-R1; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms; sIL-6r, soluble interleukin-6 receptor; BSRS-5, Brief Symptom Rating Scale-5.\ninvestigation conducted every 5 years; 'follow-up telephone survey' is the annual survey of vital status and new health events occurring between formal home visit and clinical examination. The main measures are aimed at collecting information on physical function and geriatric conditions (e.g. lifestyle profiles, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive and mental health and longevity-related genetic factors) necessary for our research interests. In addition, the design of measures and instruments is mainly based on three practical considerations: (i) our results could be compared with those from well-recognized ageing-related studies, such as the Chicago Healthy Aging Study and Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging; (ii) the instruments have been used in similar population-based studies in ethnic Chinese communities; and (iii) the Chinese-language version questionnaires were chosen from those validated and widely recognized for use in community-based studies such as assessments of leisure time physical activity, 14 the For the laboratory analysis, routine fasting blood and morning urine tests are analysed at a certified clinical laboratory. In addition to the routine standardization and calibration tests performed by the laboratory, duplicate samples for about 5% of the specimens blinded to the laboratory are submitted together with other control samples to test reliability. We created three different levels (high, medium and low) of serum pools from control samples to assess accuracy of the assays operated by the central laboratory. All the remaining blood is centrifuged, aliquoted and stored in a -80 C freezer at the National Health\nResearch Institutes, where other blood tests-including inflammatory markers, blood clotting markers, hepatitis B and hepatitis C markers and genetic assays-are undertaken in the principal investigators' laboratories. The results of annual validity and reliability tests regarding between-run and within-run quality control of some major laboratory items are acceptable. In addition to the measures set in the routine investigations, a number of measures in relation to our main research interests are also conducted through ancillary sub-studies by collaborative researchers. For example, to better understand the relationship between bone/muscle mass and older adults' health, examinations of bone mineral density and whole body scan using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were carried out at the Puzi, Changhua and Hualien sites.\nIn addition to the home interviews and hospital-based examinations which are conducted every 5 years, we also perform annual telephone contact to update participants' health conditions such as changes in body weight, lifestyle behaviours, newly diagnosed diseases and conditions and new events of fall and fall-induced fractures and hospitalizations. To ascertain mortality and cause of death, we link the identification number of the HALST participants to the National Death Registry Database on a yearly basis. Similarly, medical records are requested for the ascertainment of any hospitalized events. In addition, we also assess health outcomes, healthcare utilization and medical costs from the National Health Insurance database (NHID) for those who have signed an informed consent (n \u00bc 5152, 91%) for the data linkage. Table 2 shows some selected baseline socio-demographic characteristics by different age groups. Women outnumbered men for those younger than 75. The prevalence of widowhood increased with older ages. The percentages of self-identified 'mainlanders' (immigrants from China) and no education were the highest (20.0% and 24.6%, respectively) in the oldest group. As regards lifestyle characteristics, about 13% of the study participants were current smokers and 3% were betel-quid chewers. The prevalence of these risky behaviours declined as the participants became older. The percentage in each age group that engaged in leisure-time physical activity was about the same (around 71%). With regard to the self-reported major cardiovascular diseases (such as heart disease and stroke) and some age-related conditions (such as cataract, arthritis and prostatic disorders in males), the prevalence generally increased with age. Table 3 reveals baseline biomarker profiles of the HALST participants. Systolic blood pressure increased but diastolic blood pressure decreased along with age. In addition, the levels of haemoglobin, albumin, glomerular filtration rate, cholesterol and triglyceride, and gait speed also all decreased with age, whereas the prevalence of under-weight [body mass index (BMI) < 20 kg/m 2 ] increased with age. For those older than 75 years, > 11% and > 6% had BMI < 20 kg/m 2 and serum albumin < 4 g/dl, respectively, indicating a risk of malnutrition that medical personnel should be on the alert for. Some common chronic diseases-such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and anaemia-also increased with age. In general, the intake of food and nutrients decreases in older participants, except for beans and dairy intake in males (data not shown). Regarding the physical function performance, the mean gait speed of those older than 75 (0.7 m/s) was slower than the cutoff point suggested in the European consensus, indicating the need for refining the definition of sarcopenia for the Asian population. 22 Similar situations can also be found with gender-specific handgrip strength (about 5 kg lower than that of Caucasian counterparts) 22 and distance in 6-min walking test (> 15% of those older than 75 years could walk no farther than 250 m). Among those who had completed the first annual telephone interview (n \u00bc 4930), 123 (2.49%) had a new diagnosis of hypertension, 99 (2.01%) developed diabetes, 34 (0.69%) had stroke and 38 (0.77%) had cancer diagnosed in the previous year of the first telephone survey. We also found, in the previous year, 752 (15.26%) had falls, 589 (11.95%) had been admitted to Data are n (%) unless indicated otherwise. BMI, body mass index; SBP, systolic blood pressure; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; HDL-C, high density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C, low density lipoprotein cholesterol; TG, triglyceride; ACR, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. In addition to the unique characteristics described above, several interesting results have been found in the HALST study. For example, we found a strong relationship between dietary fibre intake and physical performance in the elderly, providing potential practical preventive strategies for frail older adults. 23 Those who had higher education, higher BMI and lower fish and milk intake were found to be more likely to have vitamin D insufficiency. 24 The results of gait speed and handgrip strength performed by the HALST participants were adopted to refine cutoffs and prevalence of sarcopenia in Taiwan. 25 We also illustrated a synergistic impact of sarcopenia and obesity on elders' physical performance. 26 The HALST study is a member of the TaiChi consortium, joining international efforts to identify genetic determinants of atherosclerosis and metabolic-related traits in multi-ethnic populations. For the past 3 years, collaboration within the TaiChi consortium has been fruitful. For example, four new genetic loci have been found related to obesity; 27 some novel genetic variants associated with HbA1c, plasma triglycerides and risk of coronary artery disease were identified; 28,29 a novel independent type 2 diabetes locus was found in the Chinese population; 30 and some other important findings were also published in renowned journals. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] By linking with the NHID, we have recently conducted a prospective study and found that the older adults performing a healthy lifestyle (higher diet score, physical activity and psychosocial score) would be less likely to develop diabetes (manuscript under revision). More findings based on the follow-up data will be realized when we finish the second wave which started in 2014. The HALST, because of its prospective nature and extended data linkage, is a good epidemiological research platform to better understand multidimensional health risks in the elderly."}, {"section_title": "What has been found? Key findings and publications", "text": "What are the main strengths and weaknesses?"}, {"section_title": "Strengths", "text": "The HALST study has several strengths. First, composed of comprehensive geriatric assessment and extended biochemical and genetic measurements, the HALST is more feasible, compared with other Chinese longitudinal ageing studies, to investigate factors related to healthy ageing. We have established some international collaboration to conduct genetic and biomarker studies for ageing-related genetic traits.\nResults from the HALST study will provide information unique to Asian societies and allow a direct comparison with those from Western countries which differ in lifestyle and in genetic and environmental characteristics. Second, the study design includes data linkage with National Health Insurance databases, the mortality registry, the cancer registry, and medical records, which allows a tracking of participant incidence of health-related events and use of healthcare. Third, the HALST has a close link with the Chicago Healthy Aging Study. 38 Most methods of procedures (MOP) between these two studies are similar. This provides opportunities to make ethnicity and cross-country comparisons in various geriatric research issues. For example, researchers on both sides have recently been working on developing and cross-validating a sensitive but important questionnaire about filial piety which is unique to Chinese culture. Finally, all measurements in the HALST have been conducted by a well-trained team containing 15 fieldworkers who are trained to strictly follow the study protocols. Data collection, management, validation and processing are also being carried out to an exceptionally high standard."}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses", "text": "First, the HALST cohort is not a completely random sample from the elderly population in Taiwan; instead, the study is targeted at recruiting enough people with different socio-demographic backgrounds. This incomplete representation of Taiwan's general population limits the data applicability for estimation of disease prevalence. However, our study focuses on searching for the risk factors of ageing-related diseases and conditions, so the sampling effects would be minimal. Second, as with other longitudinal studies for ageing, response rate, sample attrition and missing data are always great concerns in the interpretation of the results. Third, although our study has a relatively large sample size, several years of longitudinal observations are necessary before it can obtain statistical power for new outcomes.\nCan I get hold of the data? Where can I find out more?"}, {"section_title": "HALST in a nutshell", "text": "\u2022 HALST is a prospective cohort study aiming at investigating multidimensional determinants of healthy aging-including lifestyle behaviours and genetic, metabolic and inflammatory factors-in an older Asian population.\n\u2022 A total of 5664 community-dwellers aged 55 and over, recruited from seven selected cities/counties to represent the socio-demographic diversity of the Taiwanese population, participated in home interviews and hospital-based clinical examinations in the first-wave survey (2009-13).\n\u2022 Participants have annual telephone contact to update health-related conditions and hospitalized events.\nThe HALST dataset has been linked to Taiwan's National Health Insurance database, the national mortality registry, the national cancer registry and medical records.\n\u2022 The HALST dataset comprises a broad scope of measurements, including socio-demographic information, lifestyle pattern, dietary habit, metabolic profile, inflammatory biomarkers, cognitive function, depression assessment, physical function, medication and genetic components.\n\u2022 "}]
