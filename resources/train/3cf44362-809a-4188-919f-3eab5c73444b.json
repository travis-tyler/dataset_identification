[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "New Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection was first reported in Wuhan China in late December 2019 but has rapidly spread across the world bringing in its wake a disease, COVID-19, that has challenged the best health systems [1] [2] . While the world of science and medicine have responded with rapid research into this newest microbial challenge and has indeed garnered some insight into SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, large uncertainties remain. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infection remains largely asymptomatic (80%) in most persons and causes mild, moderate(15%), or severe illness(5%) in others with no clear explanation for the spectrum of illness [3] . Furthermore, the predicted decimation by COVID-19 of populations with highly underdeveloped and unprepared health systems appears widely off-track [4] [5] [6] . The highest cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, most severe COVID-19 and highest crude case fatality rates/ mortalities are in Europe and North America [7] [8] .\nOverall, COVID-19 mortality varies regionally between 0.8% to 14% [9] . Africa appears to have been largely spared of its worst-case scenarios [10] , a situation currently described as mysterious [11] in search of a better explanation. It has been suggested that the relatively high rates of morbidities like diabetes and hypertension (both known to worsen in Europe and the Americas on the one hand, and the high rate of crossprotecting vaccinations (like BCG) and cross-protecting immunity from rampant endemic infections in Africa on the other hand, may have contributed to the differing outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 in these geographical regions [12] . Emerging serological studies suggest that indeed, high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection are ongoing in Africa with some studies suggesting a background rate of 9.3% of some African population seropositive [13] . Contrary to prediction that incidence intensity should predict COVID-19 mortality, as suggested from studies [14] , the fatality was 8 times less than predicted among a group of seropositive health care workers in Africa [15] . Together, these findings suggest that, although SARS-CoV-2 is indeed spreading in Africa as predicted, certain post-infection events mitigate COVID-19 while at the same time allowing continuing transmission. One possible explanation is post-infection cellular attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 by natural intracellular antiviral mechanisms. One such cellular antiviral mechanism, whose activity signature may be traceable, is Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP) [16] .\nAfter entering cells, viruses must overcome the intracellular antiviral machinery to establish a productive infection. In response to pathogen detection, host cells produce type 1 Interferons (IFNs) which signals downstream through JAK/STAT to induce numerous IFNs-Stimulated genes (ISGs) that inhibit various steps in the life cycle of the virus [17] . ZAP is one such ISG that is particularly effective against Beta coronaviruses [16] . ZAP, also called PARP13 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 13), is alternatively spliced and produced as the long form (ZAPL) and short form (ZAPS) [17] .\nZAPS is upregulated more than ZAPL by RNA virus infections and has been shown to restrict SARS-CoV-2 in human cell-lines known to be targets of the virus [16] . ZAP crucially inhibits translation of incoming viral RNA (an important action against positive sense RNA viruses) and synergizes with other ISGs to upregulates RIG-1 IFNs-Beta production [17] . Precisely, ZAP uses CpG dinucleotide (5'-Cytosine-phosphate-Guanosine-3') on viral sequences as targets for recognition, binding, and then recruits the exosome complex to degrade viral genome [18] [19] . Viruses with high CpG content are therefore more susceptible to ZAP restriction, while viruses with low CpG content are less susceptible [19] . It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 may have been able to cross to human host by acquiring CpG deficiency [20] and thereby mimic the CpG deficiency of human genome [21] . The null expectation of CpG index (I_CpG) is 1 [20] [22] , and less than or more than 1 are considered deficiency and overrepresentation [22] respectively; though it has also been suggested that I_CpG of 0.78 should be taken as significant deficiencies and I_CpG 1.22 should be taken as significant overrepresentation [23] . In this schema, <0.5 is considered extremely low and >1.5 extremely high [23] . It has been stated that \"SARS-CoV-2 has the most extreme CpG deficiency of all known Beta coronavirus genomes\" [20] . The I_CpG of the reference Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 is 0.4077 and is 'extremely deficient' according to the criteria previously stated [23] . It has been shown that ZAP knockdown in cells increases SARS-CoV-2 production by 3 folds and that this increase can be as high as 7.7 folds in the presence of Interferons [24] . Given that ZAP exhibits tissue-specific expressions [20] , the resulting difference in intracellular antiviral activity can be predicted to leave CpG signatures on SARS-CoV-2 and that I_CpG variations will reflect the spectrum of tissues infected [20] . Such CpG signatures may therefore be used to identify viral tissue-switching events [20] .\nIt may be predicted that given that SARS-CoV-2 infection has occurred, several ZAP induced CpG restriction scenarios may occur. In host communities with globally highly effective ZAP, COVID-19 will be milder, and this will also reveal as less variable SARS-CoV-2 I_CpG evolution within the community. On the contrary, in host communities with less effective ZAP suppression, COVID-19 will be more severe, and this will reveal as more variable SARS-CoV-2 I_CpG spectrum. Furthermore, within a host, a highly variable ZAP expression spectrum may result in more widespread tissue affectation with only host tissues with the higher order ZAP expression being spared. APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B (APOB) mRNA-editing, catalytic polypeptide), is another natural antiviral factor that targets CpG to restrict RNA viruses [25] . APOBEC3G deaminates C to U and may contribute to CpG deficiency [26] . Such C to U conversion is deleterious to the viral fitness if the deaminated site is in a functional region but may reduce viral susceptibility to CpG guided antiviral activity of ZAP [20] . Though unlike ZAP, APOBEC3G is not highly specific for cytosine [20] , high activity of APOBEC3G on SARS-CoV-2 may drive UpG overexpression (i.e. I_UpG>1) [27] .\nIn totality, if intracellular antiviral activity related to CpG or UpG restrictions or overexpression respectively are significant events in COVID-19, then such signatures will be expected in SARS-CoV-2 sequences in sample populations. This study was therefore conducted to determine the I_CpG and I_UpG signature patterns in available SARS-COV-2 sequences and identify any relationship with disease severity. All rights reserved.

The regions were taken as allocated on GenBank-namely, Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, North America (NAM), and South America (SAM). Complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences that contained patient metadata was downloaded from GISAID [30] . Such data was not available on GenBank.\nOn both platforms, SARS-CoV-2 sequences were downloaded as FASTA format, but on the GISAID platform, patient metadata was downloaded in a separate tab separated values(tsv) file.

Therefore, only regions with above 73 deposited SARS-CoV-2 sequences were included in the analysis(this excluded SAM, that had only 18 deposited complete sequences from human host as of 1 st August 2020). All complete sequences were used in the analysis but for sensitivity, the analysis was repeated with sequences with less than NNNs. We included only patients' status labeled 'Asymptomatic'(Asy), 'Intensive Care Unit' (ICU) or 'Deceased'(D) in the analysis because these terms were considered non-ambiguous. ICU and Deceased were merged as one group (ICU/Deceased) for analysis because these two were considered as one extreme of COVID-19 severity and that the difference is likely linked to therapy rather than viral factor. Also, ICU and Deceased status have been merged in previous categorical scaling of COVID-19 [37] . Patients' status like 'Alive', 'Hospitalized' and 'Discharged' were available on the metadata file, but such patient and corresponding sequenced were excluded from analysis because these terms were not classifiable as regards COVID-19 severity. Only extreme SARS-CoV-2 infection status (Asy vs ICU/Deceased) was compared because these were more clearly defined and were more likely to reveal differences in dinucleotide status if these exist. Another parameter of interest was viral Clade.\nI_CpG was calculated as I-CpG=\n. I_UpG was similarly calculated. The I_CpG and genomic GC proportion(GC%) was initially suggested to be a mathematical artifact [38] but this has been refuted [39] . Furthermore, it has been shown that differential CpG altering events alter the correlation between I_CPG and GC content in a genome [39] . We expected that both intracellular antiviral activities and random mutations may alter I_CpG. We hypothesized that highly variable intracellular ZAP antiviral activity in a host population will lead SARS-CoV-2 'quasi-species' with altered I-CpG vs GC% correlation. Absolute GC% was therefore calculated, as well as the correlation between I_CpG and GC% as another sign of ZAP activity. The population (total sample) rate of change of I_CpG with GC% was determined by linear regression and taken as the background rate.\nAll rights reserved.

All continuous variables failed normality tests and were therefore analyzed using non-parametric statistics. However, because population (and not sample) distribution is the superior consideration for choice of statistic and this is unknown for SARS-CoV-2, sensitivity analysis was performed by running parametric statistics for comparison. Where the outcomes of the analysis were contradictory, the result of the non-parametric analysis was used for decision. Spearman correlation was used to quantify the relationship between I_CpG and GC Content. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare dinucleotide Indexes between geographical regions and Mann-Whitney test was used to compare dinucleotide Indexes between Asy and ICU/Deceased. Spearman correlation was used to quantify the relationship between crude case fatality rate and dinucleotide indexes; for this comparison summary nucleotide indexes per geographical region were used.\nConsidering that by nature, both the crude case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and dinucleotide indexes should evolve with time, we consider such a time point comparison plausible. Mann-Whitney was used to test for a significant difference between the age of 'Asy' and 'ICU/Deceased' while Chi-Square was used to test for a significant difference in SARS-COV-2 dinucleotide distribution between genders. These two (gender and age) were considered possible confounders because they are known to influence SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 morbidity and disease severity respectively [12] , though ZAP expression may not vary with age or gender [40] . The slope of change of I_CpG with GC% was determined using linear regression. Contingency tables were developed to compare viral Clade over-representation in any patients' status and type III Chi-Square was used to assess significant differences. All clades were necessarily those used by GISAID (S, L, V, G, GH, GR) [41] . Clade O was also included in the patients' metadata though this clade is generic and less clearly defined [42] .\nIt has been shown that adults greater than 65 years account for 80% of COVID-19 hospitalizations and have a 23-fold risk of death compared to those less than 65 years old [43] .\nAlthough various age classification methods exist, for this study we used the consensus definitions of both Segen's Medical Dictionary [44] and McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern medicine [45] to define middle age as 45-65 years.

Where the data distribution was not amenable to linear regressions, the rate of change of I_CpG per GC content was considered inestimable.\nLinear regressions were considered suitable for comparison of slope differences when the R 2 of each slope was higher than 0.3 and the difference between R 2 did not transcend R 2 quality classification [46] , [47] . As sensitivity analysis to account for the variation of I_CpG with GC content, the I_CpG-GC ratio was determined and compared between groups. As regards UpG, only the group's median I_UpG and within-group variability were used for comparisons.

The usual factors that dictate adequate host response include viral transmission load, viral infectivity, tissue tropism, host immune response, and viral susceptibility to therapeutics, among others. Though a large volume of knowledge has been accumulated on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, there is still no clear explanation for skewed variations in morbidity and mortality as well as apparent discrepancies between ex-vivo viral susceptibility to candidate therapeutic and outcomes of clinical trials. Although a 382 nucleotide deletion has been associated with milder COVID-19, the prevalent D614G mutation, though increases transmission [9] , does not appear related to disease morbidity [50] . However, mutation studies focus on protein-coding regions.\nIn this study, focused on whole genomic analysis, signatures of the differential activities of intracellular zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) appear to point to this intracellular protein as a key factor in the differential effect of SARS-CoV-2 on human hosts. It is possible to do this because ZAP activity leaves a signature in terms of SARS-CoV-2 genomic CpG index(I_CpG) such that in a highly restrictive environment (high ZAP activity) the I_CpG of SARS_CoV2 remains low and vice versa [16] . In this regard, this study has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 I_CpG has rapidly varied widely from the reference Wuhan virus and varied differentially between geographical regions consistent with widely different ZAP activities in humans.

Interestingly African SARS-CoV-2 genome appears to have the lowest change in I_CpG to GC% correlation compared to the background SARS-CoV-2 population correlation (rs 0.357 vs rs 0.359, P>0.05) suggesting a highly restrictive ZAP environment. In support of this, I_CpG has the lowest absolute intersequence variation in Africa. Overall, the trend appears to be that areas with the highest ZAP activity have higher mortality except in Europe where regional SARS-CoV-2 intersequence I_CpG appears exceptionally low but has the highest crude case fatality. However, given that the I_CpG versus GC% correlation in Europe has widely varied from the SARS_CoV2 population correlation( rs=0.107 vs 0.359, P<0.05), one explanation is that though ZAP activity is low within the Europe population, the intra-host tissue variation in ZAP activity is low leading to low SARS-CoV-2 genomic I_CpG variability in Europe but overall, drift from reference( background) SARS-CoV-2 population I_CpG to GC% correlation.\nTo further test and give some validation to ZAP activity as a major factor in the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we evaluated the signature of ZAP activity in known risk factors whose data were available. In this regard, impressive I_CpG signatures of high ZAP activity and low ZAP activity were detected for Asymptomatic patients versus ICU/Deceased patients, respectively. Furthermore, Clade G(unsegregated), GR, and GH were overrepresented in ICU/Deceased patients and these clades also have I_CpG signature evidence of low ZAP activity. On the contrary, generic Clade O was overrepresented in asymptomatic patients and have I_CpG signature evidence of high ZAP activity. Interestingly, similar segregation is seen with age groups. Age group >65years, known to have a high risk of morbidity and mortality also have compelling I_CpG signature evidence of low ZAP activity. However, no significant differences in I_CpG signature of ZAP activity were seen between genders but the trend is towards higher variability in men, which is interesting because male gender appears to have up to 2.4 times higher risk of severe COVID-19 in some case series [51] though this was not supported by other studies [12] .\nUpG dinucleotide is also significantly differentially overexpressed in SARS-CoV-2 from different regions of the world.

In the first instance, ZAP activity levels are expected to be distributed within a given population in a Gaussian manner. Thus, in populations with overall high mean ZAP activity level, only 2.5% will be expected to be highly vulnerable while the remaining 97.5% would be susceptible to infection but with highly favourable outcomes mainly represented by mild illness, which may be missed as COVID-19, but leaves a high level of positive serology in the community. Nevertheless, flashes of severe illnesses may be seen in the 2.5% subset of such a population with lower levels of ZAP activity. Even, within countries, such flashes may be noted whenever in the country SARS-CoV-2 has recently been introduced. These appear to resemble the current SARS-CoV-2 scenario in Africa. However, in populations with an overall low mean ZAP activity level, more severe illness may be more common.\nBetween these extremes, various scenarios may ensue all of which may be modified by other health system factors. Furthermore, it suggests that asymptomatic person probably paradoxically harbour potentially more virulent low CpG viruses which the asymptomatic is fitted to contain but the next person may not be.\nThe therapeutic implication is that candidate SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapies may have a better chance of in-vivo success if they enhance ZAP activity and may have invitro versus invitro dissociation of efficacy if ZAP modulation is not one of its mechanism.\nThis may at least in part explain the increasing number of drugs showing impressive invitro activity against SARS-COV-2 but failing in trials even when started early (within 5 days of exposure) or even as pre-exposure prophylaxis. In this regard, it is interesting that strong interaction between Interferon and ZAP for its efficacy on COVID-19 has already been observed [16] . Although ZAP is an ISG product, ZAP also enhances the production of type 1 interferon [17] . Compromised ZAP competencies may, therefore, explain the low type 1 interferon response in severe COVID-19 [52] , the elderly [53] , obesity [54] , and type 2 diabetes [55] .

Overall, these suggest that drugs (including interferon) that enhance ZAP activity, may favourably modulate the known poor outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in these groups of patients.\nZinc sulphate has been found to have consistent invitro [58] and in vivo effect against SARS-COV-2 [59] and amongst many possible pathways for the effect of elemental zinc, it is interesting that it also enhances the production of interferon [59] . Dexamethasone is strongly anti-inflammatory and inhibits interferon [60] , thus reducing ZAP activity.\nDexamethasone may, therefore, may be predicted to be harmful in mild COVID -19, when viral replication appears to drive morbidity and beneficial in severe COVID-19 when hyper-inflammation and cytokine storm appears to drive morbidity. This probably explains the finding of the effect of dexamethasone in the 'Recovery trial' [37] . The funding further suggests that going forwards, arms of clinical trials may include a combination of interferon or its inducers, anti-viral, and zinc for mild to moderate cases and the addition of anti-inflammatory agents for severe cases.\nGiven the findings in this study, it is tempting to propose that communities with higher COVID-19 mortalities and those with lower mortalities have been pointed in the respective direction by the innate ZAP activity status while health system effectiveness may change or worsen the directions. It may also be suggested that in patients with lower ZAP competencies, SARS-CoV-2 infection in sanctuary sites, like CNS, may represent a slow smouldering disease, that may be better described as subclinical instead of asymptomatic, with ominous possible long term consequences. Given such scenarios, prevention, vaccine, prophylaxis, and therapeutics may need to be prioritized in that order.\nOverall, our study suggests that innate intracellular antiviral activities may be a major determinant of the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This consideration appears to explain many puzzling observations regarding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. In this regard, it may be important to examine how ZAP levels, forms, distribution, and activities are influenced by factors such as genetic polymorphism, race, co-morbidities, and aging to inform net ZAP activity as a contributing determinant of severity of Covid-19 phenotype.\nAll rights reserved.
