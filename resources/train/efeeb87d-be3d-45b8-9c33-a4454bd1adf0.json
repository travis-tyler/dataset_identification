[{"section_title": "BEST COPY AVAILABLE", "text": "Where College Students Live after They Graduate June 11, 2001 Kristin Keough Perry The extent to which states retain residents as college students, lose residents to institutions in other states or attract students from other states are issues that may affect state funding for higher education, state tuition policy, quality of education in the state, and residents' support for postsecondary education. Further, data regarding whether or not students stay in their state of residence or stay in the state of their institution after graduation provide information about state retention of college graduates as participants in the state labor force. The report uses data from the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/97) to describe the residence and migration patterns of students who .earned their baccalaureate degree in the 1992-93 academic year. These students were interviewed in 1993 and reinterviewed in 1994 and 1997. With information gathered over four years; these data are used to answer the following sets of questions: 1) To what extent did students attend college in their state of legal residence? 2) Where did students live after they graduated? Did students who attended in-state live there after graduation? Did students who went out-of-state stay where they went to college or did they return to their original state of residence after graduation? 3) What regions retained residents as students and what regions lost students to other areas? What regions retained residents who graduated from an in-state college? What regions gained graduates from other states? Although B&B data provide nationally representative estimates, the sample does not allow reliable state-by-state estimates to be made. Therefore, student residence and migration estimates are presented by region in this report. However, data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) provide numbers of first-time, first-year students, by state of residence, who attend each postsecondary institution, thus providing percentages of students, by state, who are residents of the state where they attended college. These data are used to provide the regional data for B&B by categorizing 50 states and the District of Columbia into two groups based on the level of retention of residents as students and on the level of attraction of students from out-of-state."}, {"section_title": "Where students went to college", "text": "About 78 percent of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients graduated from an institution located in their state of legal residence (table 1). Often, however, by the time students graduated, their states of residence were determined by the state in which of their postsecondary institution was located. Therefore, the percentage of students graduating from college in their parents' state (72 percent) is an alternative measure of whether students graduated in the state where they were residents before entering college, or following high school graduation. For this reason, \"graduated from an institution in parents' state of residence\" is included in Table 1. Unless specified, students' state of legal residence will be used. The likelihood of graduating from an in-state institution varied by the control of the institution. While 84 percent of students who graduated from a public 4-year institution were residents of the state where they graduated, 66 percent of students who graduated from a private not-for-profit 4-year institution graduated in-state. Similarly, 79 percent of students who graduated from a public 4-year institution and 57 percent of students who graduated from a private not-for-profit 4-year institution graduated from an institution in their parents' state of residence. Over 90 percent of those who graduated from a public 4-year institution graduated from a college in their home region, and nearly 80 percent of those who graduated from a private not-for-profit 4-year institution remained in their home region. The percentage of students who graduated from an institution in their state (or their parents' state) of residence varied according to whether or not they received state aid. Students who received state aid were more likely to have graduated from an institution in their state of residence than students who did not receive state aid: 94 percent of students who received state aid graduated in-state while 75 percent of students who did not receive aid graduated in-state. There was no significant difference between the percentages of men and women who graduated from an in-state institution. Eighty-five percent of Hispanic bachelor's degree recipients graduated from an in-state college while 77 percent of white bachelor's degree recipients graduated from an instate college."}, {"section_title": "Where bachelor's degree recipients lived after graduation", "text": "In the first and second follow-up surveys, 1992-93 graduates were asked where they lived in 1994and 1997. In 1994, 72 percent and in 1997 percent of graduates lived in the state where they graduated (table 2). In 1994, 83 percent of graduates lived in the state where they were legal residents in 1993, while 75 percent of graduates did so in 1997. Eighteen percent of the students who did not graduate from a college in their own state lived in the state of the institution where they graduated one year later (1994) and 17 percent lived in their institution state four years later (1997). Eighty-eight percent of students who graduated from an instate institution lived there in 1994 and 81 percent lived in that state four years later. Significantly more students who graduated from an in-state institution lived in their 1993 state of residence four years later than students who graduated from an out-of-state institution in 1993 (81 percent versus 52 percent). Sixty-four percent of students who graduated from an out-of-state college had moved back to their original state of residence one year after graduation. Four years after graduation, 52 percent of students who graduated from an out-of-state college lived in their 1993 state of residence. Students who attended public colleges were more likely to live in their 1993 state of residence four years later (77 percent) than students who attended a private not-for-profit college (70 percent). Students who received state aid were more likely to live in their original state of residence four years later (79 percent) than students who did not receive state aid (74 percent)."}, {"section_title": "States that retained residents and attracted students", "text": "Overall, 63 percent of all students graduated from an in-state college and lived in the same state four years after graduation (table 3). The percentage of students who graduated from an in-state college ranged from 88 percent in the Southwest to 60 percent in New England (table 3, figure 1). States in four regions retained significantly more students by 1997 (who graduated in-state and were residents in that state in 1997) than New England. For example, states in the Southwest retained 73 percent of students as residents, those in the Far West retained 70 percent, Great Lakes states retained 68 percent and the Southeast states retained 62 percent while states in New England retained 48 percent of graduates four years later. Sixty-eight percent of all college graduates who were residents of states in New England lived in the region four years laterthis includes students who graduated in-state and students who went to college and graduated out-of-state but returned to live in New England after graduation. States in New England retained a significantly lower proportion of students as residents four years after graduation than those in two other regions: the Southwest retained 80 percent of students as residents in 1997 and the Far West retained 78 percent. In addition to measuring student migration from one state to another state within regions, student migration can also be measured from regions. The percentage of students who remained in their region on residence four years later ranged from 87 percent in the Southeast to 75 percent in New England. Students whose region of residence in 1993 was New England were more likely to have migrated to live in another region by 1997 than students in the Southeast, Southwest, Far West and Great Lakes Regions. While 75 percent of students from New England lived in New England in 1997, 87 percent of students from the Southeast, 84 percent of students from the Southwest, 84 percent of students from the Great Lakes and 87 percent of students from the Southeast lived in the original region of residence in 1997. Although students may have moved to a different state by 1997, higher percentages of students remained in the same region four years later. For example in New England, 68 percent of students lived in the same state in four years after graduation while 75 percent lived in the same region four years later. This difference is also significant for the Mid East (72 percent versus 82 percent), the Great Lakes Region (77 percent versus 84 percent, the Plains Region (71 percent versus 79 percent), the Southeast (73 percent versus 87 percent), and the Far West (78 percent versus 83 percent). As noted above, it is not possible to report state level estimates based on B&B data. State level data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), however, provide percentages of students who were residents of the state where they first attended college. Because the median time for degree completion was 56 months,' fall 1988 IPEDS data were used to determine the characteristics of the states where students first enrolled. These data were used to categorize 50 states and the District of Columbia into two groups based on the enrollment of in-state students and on the attraction of students from out-of-state. Table 4 identifies states by level of retention of residents as students. Highretainer states are those which kept 85 percent or more of their high school graduates who entered college within 12 months of graduation as first-time students in 1988; low-retainer states kept less than 85 percent of their recent high school graduates who first attended college in 1988. The cutpoint was established somewhat higher than the national average of 78 percent and at a point where the difference became significant. States that retained a higher percentage of high school graduates as college students U.S Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, 1993 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:93/97), Data Analysis System. than other states were significantly more successful in retaining college graduates as residents after graduation. In 1997, 84 percent of students who attended in-state in high-retainer states (table 5) lived in their original states of residence four years after graduation. More students from high-retainer states lived in those states in 1997 than those from low-retainer states (79.3 percent). Table 6 identifies states by level of attraction. High-attractor states are those that drew 40 percent or more of their students from out-of-state; lowattractor states attracted less than 40 percent of their students from out-ofstate. States that attracted a higher percentage of students from other states kept more of those students as residents after graduation than other states (table 7). Seventeen percent of students who graduated from an outof-state college in high-attractor states lived in the state of their institution four years later and significantly more students remained living in highattractor states in 1997 than in low-attractor states (8.8 percent)."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Over three-quarters of 1992-93 bachelor's degree recipients graduated from a college or university in their own state of residence and nearly 90 percent graduated from an institution in their own geographic region. Students who received state aid or graduated from public institutions were more likely to have graduated from a college in-state. States in New England enrolled a lower percentage of residents as students than states in the Southwest, the Far West, Great Lakes and the Southeast. States in New England also retained a lower percentage of graduates as residents four years after graduation than states in the Southwest and Far West regions. Further, students whose region of residence in 1993 was New England were more likely to have migrated to live in another region by 1997 than students in the Southeast, Southwest, Far West and Great Lakes Regions. And, although students may have moved to a different state by 1997, higher percentages of students remained in the same region four years after graduation. High retention states that retained residents as students kept 63 percent of graduates as residents four years after graduation. About 84 percent of students who graduated from an in-state college in high-retainer states lived there four years later. High-attractor states kept 17 percent of these out-of-state graduates as residents four years after graduation. Sixty-four percent of students who went to college out-of-state returned to their original state of residence one year after graduation.         e.:?; ,:. ;..,. .1:V:  Vvia4fv,p; Corporate Source: tfAAAA:A Publication Date: 9--oo)"}, {"section_title": "H.
