[{"section_title": "SUMMARY Introduction", "text": "Comparative Indicators of Education in the United  2015 is a comparison of the education system in the United States with those in the other Group of 20 (G-20) countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. (We do not show data for the European Union, although it is included in the G-20, since it is a political entity that represents a number of countries, not a single education system.) The G-20 countries, which are among the most economically developed, represent 85 percent of the world's economy and two-thirds of its population. These countries are some of the United States' largest economic partners. The report draws on the most current information about eduation from the International Indicators of Education Systems (INES) project at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), as reported in the Education at a Glance series, as well as international assessments that range from grade 4 through adulthood. These international assessments include the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), which assesses fourth-graders in reading; the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), which assesses fourth-and eighth-graders in mathematics and science; the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which assesses 15-year-old students (regardless of grade) in mathematics, reading, science, and, occasionally, other subjects; and the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), which assesses adults, ages 16 to 65, in literacy, numeracy, and problem solving in technology-rich environments. The Comparative Indicators of Education report series has been published on a biennial basis since it began in 2002, although this year's is the first to expand its focus to the G-20 countries, having previously been focused on the G-8 countries. Please note that many of the report's indicators do not contain data for the complete set of G-20 countries. Data are not reported when a country does not participate in a study or when its data do not meet reporting standards for a study. The main fi dings of this report are summarized below. These highlights are organized around the five major sections of the report-population and school enrollment; academic performance; contexts for learning; expenditure for education; and education returns: educational attainment and income."}, {"section_title": "Population and School Enrollment", "text": "The four indicators in this section primarily draw on data from the OECD's Education at a Glance 2013: OECD Indicators."}, {"section_title": "School-Age Population", "text": "In the United States in 2012, there were 106.2 million 5-to 29-year-olds, representing 34 percent of the total population. Although students outside this age range enroll in school this is called the school-age population for purposes of comparison. In the other G-20 countries, the school-age population ranged from 25 percent of the total population in Italy and Japan to 50 percent in Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Eleven countries experienced growth in the population of 5-to 29-year-olds from 2002 to 2012, including the United States, with a gain of 5 percentage points. However, as a percentage of the total population, 5-to 29-year-olds declined in the United States and all other reporting G-20 countries (indicator 1)."}, {"section_title": "Enrollment in Formal Education", "text": "In France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, the percentage of 3-to 4-year-olds enrolled in preprimary or primary education programs in 2011 was above 90 percent, whereas in the United States, the rate was 64 percent. In the United States, it was not until age 6 that at least 90 percent of the population was enrolled in formal education. G-20 countries with enrollment rates below 20 percent among 3-to 4-year-olds included Indonesia and Turkey. In all G-20 countries except France and Italy, a higher percentage of 3-to 4-year-olds were enrolled in 2011 than in 2001. Among 5-to 14-year-olds, all reporting G-20 countries had universal or near universal (more than 90 percent) school participation in 2011. At ages 15-19, participation rates again varied-from 34 percent in China to 92 percent in Germany, with U.S. participation at 80 percent-which may reflect different policies regarding the age at which compulsory education ends. In the United States and four other countries, compulsory education ends at age 17. In 11 countries, compulsory education ends when students are between ages 11 and 16. In Germany, attendance is required until 18 (the highest of the G-20 countries). There were few changes in enrollment rates between 2001 and 2011 among 5-to 14-year-olds or 15-to 19-year-olds in the G-20 countries (indicators 2 and 3). International students 1 made up a smaller percentage of enrollment in higher education 2 in the United States (3 percent) in 2011 than in every other G-20 country with data, including Australia (20 percent), the United Kingdom (17 percent), Canada (7 percent), and Japan (4 percent). (At the same time, the absolute number of international students in the United States was larger than in any other G-20 country reporting data [OECD 2013, web table C4.7]). Within higher education, international students made up a smaller percentage of enrollment in academic higher education below the doctoral level than at the doctoral level in every reporting G-20 country except Germany. Foreign students 3 made up less than 5 percent of total enrollment in higher education in 8 out of the 10 countries reporting this measure, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Foreign students also made up a smaller percentage of enrollment in academic higher education below the doctoral level than at the doctoral level in 6 of 7 countries with data for both levels (indicator 4)."}, {"section_title": "Academic Performance", "text": "The 10 indicators in this section draw on student and adult results from the four international assessments described in the introduction (i.e., PIRLS, TIMSS, PISA, and PIAAC), each of which has a different number of participating G-20 countries (see Exhibit 1 in the main body of the report). Most of the indicators are from the most recent administrations of each assessment, though the three indicators on changes also draw on earlier administrations.\nTogether, the indicators in the academic performance section provide an overview of academic performance in 2011 or 2012 (indicators 5-8) in key content areas, a more detailed look at academic performance in particular aspects of those content areas (indicators 9-11), and an examination of changes over time in mean student performance (indicators 12-14). \u2022 Indicators 5-7 describe the distribution of students across performance levels corresponding to international benchmarks in reading, mathematics, and science at the fourth and eighth grades and at 15 years of age. \u2022 Indicator 8 describes the distribution of adults across levels of proficiency in literacy, numeracy, and problem solving in technology-rich environments. This is the first indicator in the G-8/G-20 series to use data from the new OECD assessment of adults. \u2022 Indicators 9-11 examine the mean performance of students on reading, mathematics, and science subscales at the fourth and eighth grades and at 15 years of age. These indicators show relative strengths and weaknesses in subcontent areas within countries and differences in those strengths and weaknesses across countries. \u2022 Indicators 12-14 present changes in countries' mean scores in reading, mathematics, and science over time and across grades and ages.  Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland) Indicator 5 draws on data from PIRLS 2011 and TIMSS 2011 to describe fourth-grade students' performance in reading, mathematics, and science in terms of four international achievement benchmarks (Low, Intermediate, High, and Advanced), which were established to describe the knowledge and skills that students display at different points on a performance scale (described in \"Definitions and Methodology\" below). For each subject, the indicator first describes the percentage of students reaching at least the Intermediate level of performance. Next, the indicator describes the percentage of students reaching the highest international benchmark (Advanced), followed by the percentage reaching only the Low benchmark. In reading in 2011, at least three-quarters of fourth-grade students in 9 out of 11 G-20 countries scored at least at the Intermediate international benchmark (that is, at Intermediate, High, or Advanced), including 86 percent of U.S. students (figure 5-1). At the high-performing end of the scale, 19 percent of fourth-grade students in the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and the Russian Federation, 18 percent in the United Kingdom (England), and 17 percent in the United States reached the Advanced international benchmark. Seven countries had smaller percentages of students reaching the advanced level than the United States, ranging from less than 1 percent in Indonesia to 13 percent in Canada. At the opposite end of the scale, the United States had among the smallest percentages of students reaching only the Low international benchmark (11 percent), with only the Russian Federation having a smaller percentage (7 percent) and the percentages in the remaining countries ranging from 10 to 38 percent. In Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, over one-third of the students did not reach the Low international benchmark. In mathematics in 2011, at least three-quarters of fourth-grade students in 7 out of 11 G-20 countries reached the Intermediate international benchmark or higher, including 81 percent of U.S. students (figure 5-1). At the Advanced benchmark, the Republic of Korea and Japan stand out, with 39 and 30 percent of students, respectively, at this level. In addition to these two countries, the United Kingdom ( "}, {"section_title": "Recent Performance", "text": "At the fourth-grade level in reading in 2011, 86 percent of U.S. students performed at least at the Intermediate level on a set of international benchmarks set by PIRLS to describe the knowledge and skills of students at various points on a performance scale. The percentage of students in the United States and the Russian Federation reaching the Advanced benchmark was larger than the percentage in most other participating G-20 countries and the percentage reaching only the Low benchmark was smaller. In mathematics and science, U.S. and Russian fourth-graders again performed similarly, but generally behind students from Japan and the Republic of Korea. For example, 13 and 15 percent of U.S. fourth-graders reached the Advanced benchmark in mathematics and science, respectively, compared with 39 and 29 percent of Korean fourth-graders (indicator 5). At the eighth-grade level, 7 percent of U.S. students reached the Advanced benchmark in mathematics, as did 10 percent in science; in both subjects, the U.S. percentages were lower than those of students in four of the 10 participating G-20 countries: Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom (England) (indicator 6). At age 15 in reading in 2012, 8 percent of U.S. students reached the high end of the performance scale (defined in PISA as profi ciency levels 5 and 6), while 17 percent reached only the lower end (level 1 or below). The United States had larger percentages of high performers and smaller percentages of low performers than 9 of the 14 participating G-20 countries, but Australia, Canada, France, Japan, and the Republic of Korea each had larger percentages of high performers and smaller percentages of low performers than the United States. Nine percent of U.S. 15-year-old students reached the high end of the performance scale in mathematics and 7 percent did so in science, which was lower than in 7 and 6 countries, respectively (indicator 7). In 2012, the percentage of adults ages 16 to 65 who reached the high end of the performance scale in literacy (defined in PIAAC as level 4 or 5) ranged from 3 percent in Italy to 23 percent in Japan. In the United States, 12 percent of adults reached level 4 or 5. The percentage of adults at the low end of the scale (i.e., at level 1 or below) ranged from 5 percent in Japan to 28 percent in Italy. In numeracy, the percentage of adults at the high end of the performance scale ranged from 4 percent in Italy to 19 percent in Japan. The percentage of adults at the low end of the performance scale ranged from 8 percent in Japan to 32 percent in Italy (indicator 8)."}, {"section_title": "Performance on Content Subscales", "text": "The overall performance scales in reading, mathematics, and science described in indicators 5 through 7 are composed of subscales that allow a more detailed look at student performance within each content area. In fourth-grade reading, the subscales are related to the purposes for reading. The United States had a mean score of 563 on the reading for literary experience subscale, which was higher than the scores in 8 of 10 other G-20 countries. On the reading to acquire and use information subscale, the U.S. mean score was 553, which was higher than the scores in seven other G-20 countries (indicator 9). In mathematics and science, subscales at both the fourth and eighth grades are related to content subdomains (such as algebra in mathematics or chemistry in science). In mathematics, the United States was relatively weaker in geometric shapes and measures in the fourth grade and geometry in the eighth grade, with more countries outperforming the United States on these subscales than on the other mathematics subscales, including number (both grades), data display (grade 4), data and chance (grade 8), and algebra (grade 8). In science, U.S. differences on the subscales were not as apparent (indicators 9 and 10). Mathematics subscales on the assessment of 15-year-olds also are related to content subdomains. U.S. 15-year-olds were relatively stronger on change and relationships and uncertainty and data, outperforming students in more countries on these subscales than on the quantity and space and shape subscales (indicator 11)."}, {"section_title": "Contexts for Learning", "text": "The eight indicators in this section draw on student and teacher questionnaire data from the most recent administrations of the international student assessments (i.e., PIRLS, TIMSS, and PISA).\nThe indicators in this section address a range of policy-relevant issues pertaining to the contexts for learning across the G-20 countries. This section presents data on differences between males' and females' attitudes toward learning across the grades, as well on teachers' reports of their instructional strategies, opportunities for collaboration and professional development, and job satisfaction and morale. \u2022 Indicators 15-17 describe students' attitudes toward learning, including fourth-graders' attitudes toward reading (indicator 15), fourth-and eighth-graders' and 15-year-olds' interest in mathematics (indicator 16), and fourth-and eighth-graders' interest in science (indicator 17). These indicators focus on the differences in attitudes between girls and boys. \u2022 Indicators 18-21 are based on teachers' reports and focus on teachers' behaviors and opportunities. Indicator 18 presents data on the strategies that fourth-grade teachers use to assist students having difficulty reading. Indicator 19 examines the extent to which fourth-and eighth-grade teachers collaborate in mathematics instruction. Indicators 20 and 21 present data on teachers' self-reports of participation in professional development in mathematics and science, respectively. \u2022 Indicator 22 reports on teachers' perceptions related to work, namely, on fourth-grade teachers' career satisfaction and changes in satisfaction over time. The indicators in this section draw on data from the student and teacher background questionnaires from PIRLS, TIMSS, and PISA."}, {"section_title": "Students' Attitudes", "text": "In PIRLS 2011, fourth-grade students were asked various questions about how much they liked reading, their motivation to read, and their confidence in reading. Their responses were used to create three indices: like to read, motivated to read, and confident in reading. In the United States, the highest percentages of both female and male students were motivated to read and the lowest percentages liked to read, a pattern generally mirrored in the other G-20 countries. Whereas the percentages of females and males who were motivated to read ranged from 67 to 92 percent and 57 to 90 percent, respectively, across countries, the percentages of females and males who liked to read ranged from 30 to 43 percent and 13 to 28 percent, respectively. In at least 8 of 11 G-20 countries (including the United States), higher percentages of female students than male students had a positive attitude on each of the three indices. For example, 33, 74, and 43 percent of U.S. females liked to read, were motivated to read, and were confident in reading, respectively. For U.S. males, the respective percentages were 20, 67, and 37 percent (indicator 15). Fourth-and eighth-grade students were asked similar questions in TIMSS 2011 to develop indices about their attitudes toward mathematics and science. In mathematics, there were no differences in the United States and three other countries (the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom [England], and the United Kingdom [Northern Ireland]) between the percentages of male and female fourth-graders who liked learning mathematics. (In the United States, 45 percent of males and 44 percent of females liked learning mathematics.) In the seven countries in which there were gender differences, males' attitudes were more positive than females' in five countries and females' attitudes were more positive than males' in two countries (Saudi Arabia and Turkey). Differences were similar at the eighth-grade level, with six countries (including the United States, with a difference of 2 percent) having a higher percentage of males than females who liked learning mathematics, but one country having a higher percentage of females than males (Turkey) (indicator 16). In PISA 2012, 15-year-old students were asked about the extent to which they agreed with a statement about interest in mathematics. In 12 of 15 participating G-20 countries, higher percentages of male than female students were interested in what they learned in mathematics (defined as those who agreed or strongly agreed), with differences ranging from 2 percentage points in Mexico to 17 percentage points in Germany. The difference between the percentages of U.S. males and females who were interested in what they learned in mathematics was 7 percentage points (indicator 16). In science, there were no differences in five countries, including the United States, between the percentages of male and female fourth-graders who liked learning science (TIMSS 2011). (In the United States, 57 percent of males and 55 percent of females liked learning science.) In the six countries in which there were gender differences, males' attitudes were more positive than females' in three countries and females' attitudes were more positive than males' in three countries. In contrast to fourth grade, SUMMARY v gender differences were more widespread at the eighth-grade level: higher percentages of males than females liked learning science in all countries except Turkey (in which more females liked learning science) and Saudi Arabia (in where there were no gender differences). In the United States, 33 percent of males liked learning science, compared to 25 percent of females (indicator 17). Teachers' Instructional Practices, Participation in Professional Development, and Career Satisfaction Strategies to help students with reading. In 2011, teachers participating in PIRLS were asked which strategies they usually used to assist fourth-graders having difficulty reading, including: asking parents to help their child with reading, working with students individually, and waiting to see if performance improved with maturation. The first two strategies were used more frequently than the third among teachers in the 11 G-20 countries participating in PIRLS. For example, the percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported asking parents to help their child with reading ranged from 88 percent in France to 100 percent in Germany and the Russian Federation, and the percentage whose teachers reported working with students individually ranged from 77 percent in Germany and Indonesia to 97 percent in the Russian Federation. (The U.S. percentages for these strategies were 95 percent and 94 percent, respectively.) In contrast, the percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported waiting to see if performance improved with maturation ranged more widely, from 22 percent in the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) to 79 percent in Saudi Arabia; this strategy was reported by 37 percent of fourth-graders' teachers in the United States. In terms of access to reading professionals, the United States had the highest percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers indicated that such professionals were always available (45 percent), as well as the lowest percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers indicated that they were never available (12 percent) (indicator 18). Collaboration in mathematics instruction. In 2011, teachers' reports also indicated varying levels of collaboration in mathematics instruction (categorized as sometimes collaborative, collaborative, or very collaborative), based on how often they engaged in certain interactions with other teachers. At the fourth-grade level, the United States was the only country in which a larger percentage of students had teachers who were very collaborative (49 percent) than who had teachers who were only collaborative (40 percent) or sometimes collaborative (11 percent). At the eighth-grade level, there were no countries in which higher percentages of students had teachers who were very collaborative than had other teachers in other categories; instead, in all countries except the United States and Indonesia, higher percentages of students had teachers who were collaborative. In the United States and Indonesia, there were no measurable differences between the percentage of students who had teachers in the very collaborative and collaborative categories (39 and 40 percent, respectively, in the United States; 45 and 50 percent, respectively, in Indonesia) (indicator 19)."}, {"section_title": "Participation in professional development.", "text": "A lower percentage of fourth-grade students than eighth-grade students had teachers who reported participating in professional development in various areas of both mathematics and science in the 2 years prior to the TIMSS assessment in 2011. In the United States, the percentage of fourth-grade students whose teachers participated in professional development in mathematics ranged from 49 percent in the area of integrating information technology to 68 percent in the area of mathematics content, the latter of which represented the highest rate of participation across the participating G-20 countries in that area. The percentage of eighth-grade students in the United States whose teachers participated in professional development in mathematics ranged from 61 percent in the area of assessment to 73 percent in the areas of mathematics content and pedagogy (indicator 20). In science, in the United States and nearly all other reporting G-20 countries, less than half of fourth-grade students' teachers reported participating in professional development in any of the four areas of professional development identified. The percentage of eighth-grade students in the United States whose teachers participated in professional development in science ranged from 57 percent in the area of assessment to 75 percent in the area of science content (indicator 21). Career satisfaction of reading teachers. In terms of teachers' satisfaction with their careers as reading teachers, across all participating G-20 countries except France, less than 10 percent of fourth-graders had teachers with low career satisfaction in 2011, with percentages ranging from 2 percent in Saudi Arabia to 6 percent in Australia, the United Kingdom (England), and the United States. In France 17 percent of fourth-graders had teachers with low career satisfaction. Higher levels of career satisfaction were more common: in 8 of the 11 participating G-20 countries, at least half of the fourth-graders had teachers with high career satisfaction, with a high of 89 percent in Indonesia. In the United States, 47 percent of fourth-graders had teachers with high career satisfaction, and an equal percentage had teachers with medium career satisfaction (indicator 22)."}, {"section_title": "Expenditure for Education", "text": "The two indicators in this section draw on data from the OECD's Education at a Glance 2013: OECD Indicators.

In the United States, 41 percent of first university degrees were awarded in the field of social sciences, business, and law, whereas 16 percent were awarded in the field of science, mathematics, and engineering (among the lowest percentages in any of the G-20 countries).

It also examines the ratio of these average starting salaries to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for each of the reporting countries. \u2022 Indicator 24 reports public and private education expenditures per student, both the total spent as well as that spent on core services, which pertain to instructional services, including faculty/staff salaries, professional development, and books and other school materials. It also presents annual public and private education expenditures as a percentage of GDP, allowing a comparison of countries' education expenditures relative to their overall economic output.

However, while in every reporting G-20 country, employment rates rose with each successively higher education level, the specific advantage of higher levels of education varied by system. For example, the difference in employment rates between adults with upper secondary education and those with lower secondary education ranged from 3 percentage points in Brazil to 22 percentage points in the United Kingdom; the U.S. difference was 16 points. Examining differences in employment rates by sex shows that, in all reporting G-20 countries, men at all education levels had higher employment rates than women with comparable education. In the United States, for example, the employment rate was 86 percent for men with academic higher education (vs. 76 percent for women); 72 percent for men with upper secondary education (vs. 62 percent for women); and 61 percent for men with lower secondary education or below (vs. 40 percent for women) (indicator 28)."}, {"section_title": "Distribution of Population by Education and Income", "text": "In all reporting G-20 countries, higher levels of education were associated with higher income (as well as lower levels of low income).

These projects include the International Indicators of Education Systems (INES) project at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS); the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS); the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA); and, more recently, the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). This report draws on the most current information available to present a set of education indicators that compare the education system in the United States with those in other economically developed countries. Updated information from these various projects will be incorporated in subsequent reports. Although the international education projects cited above involve many countries worldwide, the comparisons in this report focus on the Group of 20 (G-20) countries: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 1 These are among the most industrialized countries in the world. The G-20 countries were selected as a comparison group because of the similarities in their economic development and because the group includes many of the United States' major economic partners. The leaders of these countries meet regularly to discuss economic and other policy issues."}, {"section_title": "What's New in 2015?", "text": "This is the sixth report in the Comparative Indicators of Education series published by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Whereas all of the prior reports focused on the G-8 countries, this report expands its focus to include the G-20 countries. About two-thirds of the indicators use 2011 data from PIRLS or TIMSS or 2012 data from PISA or PIAAC. Using these recent data available from all the international assessments in which the United States participates, the report is able to compare the performance of students across the span of primary and secondary education, as well as of adults, in a variety of key subjects and competency areas, such as reading and mathematics. The section on academic performance, for example, includes indicators providing (a) snapshots of performance (or the percentages of the population reaching different proficiency levels or international benchmarks in a variety of content domains) from fourth grade through adulthood; (b) a closer look at student achievement in content subdomains in reading, mathematics, and science; and (c) an examination of changes in student performance over time in reading, mathematics, and science. The student and teacher questionnaires that accompany the international student assessments are also used to provide data for some updated and some new indicators describing the contexts of learning in the G-20 countries. Notably, all of the assessment data and nearly all the related tests for statistical significance were obtained using the NCES International Data Explorer (IDE), which is an online tool (found at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/ international/ide/) allowing users to create statistical tables and charts using data from international assessments. Most of the remaining one-third of the indicators draw on the international education data compiled by the OECD in the 2013 edition of Education at a Glance or provided in its online database. These data were largely used to update several indicators that have been presented previously."}, {"section_title": "Education Levels Used for the Indicators", "text": "Many of the indicators in this report refer to at least one of the following education levels: preprimary education, primary education, secondary education, and higher education. A brief overview of the education levels is presented here to provide the reader with a frame of reference (see appendix A for more detailed descriptions of countries' education systems). To ensure comparability in the indicators, each country aligned its national education data to correspond with the definitions of education levels that were developed for the 1997 revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97) (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 1997). The following descriptions highlight the key features of (1) education programs from preprimary through secondary education and (2) higher education programs. Preprimary education includes programs of education for children at least 3 years of age that involve organized, center-based instructional activities; in most countries, preprimary education is not compulsory. Primary education includes programs that are designed to give students a sound basic education in reading, writing, and mathematics, along with an elementary understanding of other subjects, such as history, geography, science, art, and music. In the international classification, primary education usually begins at the start of compulsory education (around age 6) and lasts for 6 years. In the United States, this is generally synonymous with elementary education. Secondary education encompasses two stages: lower secondary education and upper secondary education. Lower secondary education includes programs that are designed to complete basic education; the standard duration in the international classification is 3 years. Upper secondary education is designed to provide students with more in-depth knowledge of academic or vocational subjects and to prepare them for higher level academic or vocational studies or entry into the labor market. The standard duration of upper secondary education in the international classification is 3 years. In the United States, lower secondary education and upper secondary education generally correspond to junior high school and high school, respectively. Higher education includes tertiary programs 2 that fall into three main categories: \u2022 Academic higher education below the doctoral level. These largely theory-based programs are intended to provide sufficien qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. To be classified as such, a degree program must last at least 3 years and is typically preceded by at least 13 years of formal schooling. In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified at this level. \u2022 Vocational higher education. These programs provide a higher level of career and technical education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. In the United States, associate's degree programs are classified at this level \u2022 Doctoral level of academic higher education. These programs usually require the completion of a research thesis or dissertation. In the United States, master's degree programs and doctoral degree programs are classified at this level The international classification also includes an education level that straddles the boundary between upper secondary and higher education: postsecondary nontertiary education. These programs of study-which are primarily vocational in nature-are generally taken after the completion of upper secondary education. They are often not significantly more advanced than upper secondary programs, but they serve to broaden the knowledge of participants who have already completed upper secondary education. In the United States, these programs are often in the form of occupationally specific vocational certifica e programs, such as 1-year certific tion programs offered at technical institutes or community colleges. 3 Mapping G-20 Countries' Education Systems to the ISCED97 Matching the education levels of individual education systems to the ISCED97 classification can be challenging, because the particulars of individual countries seldom fit the ISCED97 perfectly. Using ISCED97 classifications as a starting point, NCES worked with education professionals in other G-20 countries to create a general overview of each country's education system. As an aid to the reader, schematics of how the ISCED97 applies to each of the G-20 education systems are provided in appendix A, accompanied by text describing each system in greater detail."}, {"section_title": "Organization of the Report", "text": "Following this introductory section, the report presents 29 indicators, each of which compares a different aspect of the U.S. education system and the education systems of the other G-20 countries. The indicators are organized into the following sections: \u2022 population and school enrollment; \u2022 academic performance; \u2022 contexts for learning; \u2022 expenditure for education; and \u2022 education returns: educational attainment and income. The first section, population and school enrollment, presents indicators that suggest the potential demand for education in countries as measured by the size and growth of their school-age population and current and past levels of enrollment in formal education. The section concludes with an indicator that examines the extent to which international or foreign students are enrolled in higher education across the G-20 countries. The next section, academic performance, has indicators spanning school levels and adulthood, as well as subject areas including reading literacy, mathematics, science, and problem solving in technology-rich environments. The indicators present findings on student performance in the G-20 countries, including the distribution of achievement across proficiency levels, average performance on content subscales, and changes in average performance on overall scales in reading, mathematics, and science. The third section highlights a range of key policy-relevant issues pertaining to contexts for learning across the G-20 countries. This section presents data on differences between males' and females' attitudes toward learning across the grades, as well as on teachers' reports of their instructional strategies, opportunities for collaboration and professional development, and job satisfaction and morale. The fourth section provides a comparative look at expenditure for education, including one indicator on public school teachers' salaries in primary and secondary education and one on annual changes in education expenditures. The final section, education returns: educational attainment and income, focuses on graduation rates, educational attainment and degrees, employment rates, and earnings (including disaggregation by sex and field of study) Each indicator is presented in a two-part format. The first part presents key findings and highlights how the United States compares with its G-20 peers (for which data are available) on the issue examined in the indicator. A section that defines the terms used in the indicator and describes key features of the methodology used to produce it follows the key findings. The second part presents graphical depictions of the data that support the key findings These tables and figures also include the specific data source for the indicator and more detailed notes on interpreting the data."}, {"section_title": "Data Sources", "text": "There are five main sources of data for this report: \u2022 INES. INES data come primarily from tables in Education at a Glance 2013: OECD Indicators or from the OECD's online Education Database. These data are derived from annual data collections carried out by the OECD, with member countries' data coming from a variety of national data sources, including administrative data collections, school surveys, household surveys, and national financial reports. Most of the INES indicator data for the United States come from the U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, the NCES Common Core of Data, the NCES Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, and the NCES Schools and Staffing Surve . \u2022 PIRLS. PIRLS is an assessment of fourth-grade students' reading literacy that is conducted on a 5-year cycle under the auspices of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA). Indicators in this report draw on data primarily from 2011, but also from the 2006 and 2001 cycles. \u2022 TIMSS. TIMSS is an assessment of fourth-and eighth-grade mathematics and science achievement that is conducted on a 4-year cycle under the auspices of the IEA. Indicators in this report draw on data primarily from 2011, but also from the 2007 and 1995 cycles. \u2022 PISA. PISA is an assessment of 15-year-old students that is conducted on a 3-year cycle under the auspices of the OECD. In 2012, it had a major focus on mathematics literacy. Indicators in this report draw on data primarily from 2012, but also from 2009 PIAAC is a new OECD assessment focused on adult competencies, including literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving in technology-rich environments and first administered in 2012. Data for indicator 1, on the school-age population, are from the International Data Base (IDB) of the U.S. Census Bureau. Many of the indicators in this report present student data. Some of the indicators show \u2022 students' mean scores (e.g., indicators 9-14); \u2022 the percentage of students or adults meeting certain performance levels, such as the percentage of students reaching established achievement benchmarks or proficiency levels (e.g., indicators 5-8); or \u2022 the percentage of students categorized into particular groups based on their self-reported views, such as the percentage of students who are \"confident in reading\" (e.g., indicators 15-17). Other indicators use the student as the unit of analysis, but the data are reported from the perspective of teachers, such as the percentage of students whose teachers reported participating in professional development (e.g., indicators 18-22). In several other indicators, the unit of analysis is not the student. For example, the unit of analysis may be \u2022 the teacher, as in public school teachers' starting salaries (indicator 23); or \u2022 postsecondary degrees, as in first university degrees by field of study (indicator 27). When interpreting the data presented in this report, it is important for readers to be aware of limitations based on the source of information and problems that may exist in verifying comparability in reporting. Except for indicator 23, which explicitly states that the data pertain only to public school teachers, the indicators in this report include data from both public and private schools."}, {"section_title": "Availability of Country Data", "text": "It should be noted that many of the indicators in this report do not contain data for the complete set of G-20 countries. That is, specific countries are sometimes not included or are only partially included in an indicator. This is the result of source data not being reported, specific countries or jurisdictions within a country not participating in a particular survey, or a country's data not meeting reporting standards. Therefore, these countries do not appear in indicators using these data. However, every G-20 country is featured in at least one indicator. Countries that are only partially included are noted in the respective tables and figures. One country warrants special mention: the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom-which includes England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales-participated in the various cycles of PISA as a unified education system; thus, results are reported for the United Kingdom as a whole in indicators drawing on PISA data. However, in TIMSS and PIRLS, England, Northern Ireland, and Scotland participated as individual jurisdictions. Results are reported for these jurisdictions separately-the United Kingdom (England) or the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), for example-in indicators drawing on TIMSS and PIRLS data. In PIAAC, only England and Northern Ireland participated and their results are shown in a combined fashion. Except for starting salary data all other results not mentioned are reported for the United Kingdom as a whole. 4 Additionally, because some of the indicators of academic performance focus on the most recent administration (e.g., 2011 for TIMSS and PIRLS and 2012 for PISA) and some focus on changes across years, the countries included in the indicators may vary even though they draw from the same assessment program's data. For example, Scotland did not participate in PIRLS 2011, but it did participate in 2001 and 2006; thus, it appears in the indicator on changes but not in the indicator on 2011 results. Any country participating in at least two of the years presented in the three-time-point trend indicators was included in those indicators. In general, the countries shown in exhibit 1-1 below are included in indicators using the identified sources. For example, the countries participating in PIRLS 2011, or at least two other cycles of PIRLS, include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom (including England, Northern Ireland, and Scotland), and the United States. In indicators using INES data, the reporting G-20 countries vary somewhat; these are shown in each indicator. Exhibit 1-1. G-20 country coverage in indicators, by data source While every effort was made to use the most up-to-date data available across the G-20 countries (usually from 2010, 2011, or 2012), data from earlier years were sometimes used if more recent data were not available. To make this clear to the reader, these occurrences are noted in relevant tables and figures"}, {"section_title": "Data Quality and Response Rates", "text": "Each of the international assessments has established technical standards of data quality, including participation and response rate standards, which countries must meet in order to be included in the comparative results. For the student assessments (PIRLS, TIMSS, and PISA), response rate standards were set using composites of response rates at the school, classroom, student, and teacher levels, and response rates were calculated with and without the inclusion of substitute schools that were selected to replace schools refusing to participate. 5 For the adult assessment (PIAAC), response rate standards were based on the participant response rate and were calculated with and without the inclusion of substitutes. These standards are described in detail in the respective technical reports (Martin and Mullis 2013;OECD 2014; OECD in press). Consistent with NCES statistical standards, item response rates below 85 percent are footnoted in the tables and figures of this report, as are instances where reporting standards are not met because there are too few observations to provide reliable estimates."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Testing", "text": "Eleven of the indicators presented in this report (indicators 1-4 and 23-29) are derived either from administrative records that are based on universe collections or from national sample surveys for which standard errors were not available. Consequently, for these indicators, no tests of statistical significance were conducted to establish whether observed differences from the U.S. average were statistically significant. However, for the 18 other indicators derived from PIRLS, TIMSS, PISA, and PIAAC data (indicators 5-22), standard t tests were calculated for comparisons of estimates within or between countries (e.g., to test whether a U.S. estimate is statistically different from other G-20 countries' estimates). Differences were reported if they were found to be statistically significant at the .05 level, using two-tailed tests of significance for comparisons of independent samples. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Where feasible, these differences are noted in the figures with an asterisk. The exceptions are the figures for indicators 5 through 8 and 20 through 21, where their presentation would be too distracting. Percentage-point differences presented in the text were computed from unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded whole numbers that appear in the tables and figures"}, {"section_title": "Earlier Reports in This Series", "text": "Prior to this report, NCES produced five earlier reports-in 2011, 2009, 2006, 2004, and 2002-in this series.

However, countries, there was a decline in the school-age population as a percentage of the total population from 2002 to 2012. This indicator describes the size of the school-age population in the G-20 countries both in absolute numbers and in terms of the percentage of the population. It focuses on the age group most likely to be enrolled in education (i.e., 5-to 29-year-olds), as well as on two subsets of that age group: those most likely to be enrolled in primary or secondary education (i.e., 5-to 19-year-olds) and those generally of postsecondary or higher education age (i.e., 20-to 29-year-olds). The indicator also describes changes in the percentage of the school-age population over time, from 2002 to 2012. In 2012, the total population across the G-20 countries ranged from 22 million in Australia to 1.3 billion in China, and the schoolage population of 5-to 29-year-olds ranged from 7.2 million in Australia to 554.8 million in India (table 1-1). In the United States, there were 106.2 million 5-to 29-year-olds, which represented 34 percent of the total population (table 1-2). In the other G-20 countries, the school-age population ranged from 25 percent of the total population in Italy and Japan to 50 percent in Saudi Arabia and South Africa. The subpopulation of 5-to 19-year-olds represented 20 percent of the total population in the United States in 2012 (table 1-2). The U.S. percentage of 5-to 19-year-olds was higher than the percentages in 10 other G-20 countries and lower than the percentages in 8 other countries. The percentages of 5-to 19-year-olds in the other G-20 countries ranged from 14 percent in Germany, Italy, and Japan to 29 percent in India, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. The subpopulation of 20-to 29-year-olds represented 14 percent of the total population in the United States in 2012, which was below the percentages in 11 other countries. The percentages in the other G-20 countries ranged from 11 percent in Italy and Japan to 21 percent in Saudi Arabia and South Africa. From 2002 to 2012, the school-age population and both subsets of that population decreased in Japan and the Republic of Korea, but increased in Argentina, Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United States (figure 1-1). The other G-20 countries experienced varied population changes over the same time period. For example, in Canada, China, Germany, and the Russian Federation, the population of 5-to 29-year-olds and 5-to 19-year-olds decreased, but the population of 20-to 29-year-olds increased. In Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, the population of 5-to 29-year-olds and 20-to 29-year-olds increased, while the population of 5-to 19-year-olds decreased. However, despite the net percentage increases in the school-age population just described for some countries, in all reporting G-20 countries, there was a decline in the school-age population as a percentage of the total population from 2002 to 2012."}, {"section_title": "Definitions and Methodologie", "text": "In each country, the percentage of the population of 5-to 29-year-olds in 2002 and 2012 was calculated by dividing the population of 5-to 29-year-olds by the total population. The percentage change in the population of 5-to 29-year-olds was calculated by subtracting the population of 5-to 29-year-olds in 2002 from this population in 2012 and dividing by the 2002 population of 5-to 29-year-olds. These calculations were applied in the same way to the 5-to 19-year-old and 20-to 29-year-old age groups. As a percentage of the total population, an age group (e.g., 5-to 29-year-olds) might have declined from 2002 to 2012 even though its size increased. This would occur if there was a higher rate of increase in the total population than in the specific age group Indicator 1     Australia,Brazil,Canada,China,France,Germany,Indonesia,Italy,Japan,Mexico,Republic of Korea,Russian Federation,Saudi Arabia,South Africa,Turkey,United Kingdom,United States In 2011, the percentage of 15-to 19-year-olds enrolled in formal education programs ranged from 34 percent in China to 92 percent in Germany. This indicator describes the percentage of the population enrolled in formal education in the G-20 countries. It focuses on four age groups (3-to 4-year-olds, 5-to 14-year-olds, 15-to 19-year-olds, and 20-to 29-year-olds) and the percentage of the population in these groups enrolled in formal education (generally corresponding to preprimary education, primary and lower secondary education, upper secondary education, and higher education, respectively). It also examines the age ranges at which 90 percent or more of the population is enrolled in formal education in the G-20 countries and the age at which compulsory education ends. In 2011, almost all 3-to 4-year-old children in France (99 percent) were enrolled in preprimary or primary education programs (table 2-1). In several other G-20 countries (Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom), the enrollment rates of 3-to 4-year-olds also exceeded 90 percent. The lowest enrollment rates were in Turkey (12 percent) and Indonesia (17 percent). In the United States, 64 percent of 3-to 4-year-olds were enrolled in preprimary or primary education, and it was not until age 6 that at least 90 percent of the population was enrolled in formal education (figure 2-1) In 2011, the United States and all other reporting G-20 countries had universal or near universal school participation of children ages 5-14 (table 2-1). The lowest enrollment rate for this age group was in the Russian Federation, at 92 percent. The United States had an enrollment rate of 80 percent in 2011 for youth ages 15-19. In the other G-20 countries reporting data, the percentage of 15-to 19-year-olds enrolled in formal education programs ranged from 34 percent in China to 92 percent in Germany (table 2-1). The large variation in enrollment among 15-to 19-year-olds may reflect, in part, different policies regarding the age at which compulsory education should end. Compulsory education ends at age 17 in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, the Russian Federation, and the United States; at age 16 in Canada, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom; at age 15 in Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, and South Africa; and at age 14 in the Republic of Korea and Turkey (figure 2-1). 6 Saudi Arabia has the lowest age when compulsory education ends (age 11), while Germany has the highest (age 18). Enrollment rates were at 90 percent or higher through the end of compulsory education in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom, but fell below this level in the other G-20 countries reporting data, including the United States. Enrollment rates for 20-to 29-year-olds were below 30 percent in every G-20 country reporting data, except Australia, Germany, and the Republic of Korea (table 2-1). The U.S. enrollment rate of 27 percent was lower than the rates in Argentina (28 percent), Australia (33 percent), Germany (32 percent), and the Republic of Korea (30 percent), but higher than the rates in the other G-20 countries.\n\"Formal education\" is defined as education provided in the system of schools, colleges, universities, and other formal education institutions; it normally constitutes a continuous ladder of full-time education for children and young adults. The percentage of the population at given ages enrolled in education is called an \"enrollment rate.\" In this indicator, the term \"enrollment rate\" refers to the \"net enrollment rate\" and is defined as the number of students in a particular age group enrolled in education divided by the population of that same age group. The reference year is 2011 for population and enrollment data in all countries except Argentina and Canada, which have a reference year of 2010. However, because of different reference dates for school enrollment and population data within the reference year, enrollment rates may exceed 100 percent for some countries and some age groups. Enrollments include all full-time and part-time students in public and private institutions. Enrollment in preprimary education programs (generally the 3-to 4-year-old age group) includes only children in preschool, nursery, or center-based day-care programs and excludes children in day-care programs operated in homes. Compulsory education ends at the age at which individuals are no longer legally required to participate in formal education. For example, if compulsory education ends at age 18, it indicates that all students are legally obliged to participate in formal education until they reach that age. Universal enrollment indicates an enrollment rate of over 90 percent. Table 2-1.

For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A. The percentage of the population at given ages enrolled in education is called an \"enrollment rate.\" In this indicator, the term \"enrollment rate\" refers to the \"net enrollment rate\" and is defined as the number of students in a particular age group enrolled in education divided by the population of that same age group. The reference years are 2001 and 2011 for population and enrollment data in all countries except Argentina and Canada, where the reference years are 2001 and 2010. However, because of different reference dates for school enrollment and population data within the reference year, enrollment rates may exceed 100 percent for some countries and some age groups. Enrollments include all full-time and part-time students in public and private institutions. Enrollment in preprimary education programs (generally the 3-to 4-year-old age group) includes only children in preschool, nursery, or center-based day-care programs and excludes children in day-care programs operated in homes.

NOTE: Reference dates may differ within the given years; thus, percentages shown in the table are approximations. As described in the source cited below, enrollment rates for some countries were reported as slightly exceeding 100 percent in one or more age groups (e.g., 5-to 14-year-olds) due to different reference dates for school enrollment and population data. Enrollment in formal education at the preprimary education level includes children in preschool, nursery, and center-based programs and excludes children in home-based early childhood education. SOURCE: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). (2003 Brazil,Canada,China,France,Germany,Indonesia,Italy,Japan,Republic of Korea,Russian Federation,Saudi Arabia,South Africa,Turkey,United Kingdom,United States International students made up a smaller percentage of enrollment in higher education in the United States (3 percent) than in every other G-20 country with data, including Australia (20 percent), the United Kingdom (17 percent), Canada (7 percent), and Japan (4 percent). This indicator presents the prevalence of international and foreign students studying in higher education in the G-20 countries in 2011, including students in academic programs below the doctoral level and at the doctoral level. International students refer to students who have left their country of origin (i.e., where they obtained their prior education credential) for the purpose of studying; six G-20 countries report data for these students. Foreign students refer to students who are not citizens of the countries in which they are enrolled, but may be long-term residents or may have been born in that country; 10 G-20 countries report data for these students. Both types of data provide information on the internationalization of higher education; however, the former measure may provide a more accurate measure of student mobility. In higher education overall, the United States had the smallest percentage of international students (3 percent) of the five G-20 countries with data, including Australia (20 percent), the United Kingdom (17 percent), Canada (7 percent), and Japan (4 percent) (Germany did not report data at the overall level) (figure 4-1). However, while the relatively small U.S. percentage suggests that the impact of international students on the overall education system is low, the absolute number of international students in the United States is larger than in any other G-20 country reporting data (OECD 2013, web table C4.7). International students made up a smaller percentage of enrollment in academic higher education below the doctoral level than at the doctoral level in every reporting G-20 country except Germany. (Australia had the largest percentage of international students enrolled below the doctoral level, at 21 percent.) At the doctoral level, international students made up more than 20 percent of enrollment in four of the six G-20 countries reporting data: the United Kingdom (41 percent), Australia (31 percent), the United States (28 percent), and Canada (22 percent). Japan followed closely, with international students making up 18 percent of enrollment at the doctoral level. In Germany, international students made up only 6 percent of enrollment at the doctoral level. In higher education overall, foreign students made up less than 5 percent of total enrollment in 8 of the 10 G-20 countries reporting this measure (figure 4-2). In South Africa and France, foreign students made up 7 percent and 12 percent, respectively, of the total enrollment in higher education. Similar to the data reported for international students, all seven countries that reported data for foreign students at all levels had smaller percentages of enrollment in academic higher education below the doctoral level than at the doctoral level, except Indonesia (where enrollment rounded to zero at both levels). Below the doctoral level, foreign students made up the largest percentage of enrollment in France, at 13 percent, while they made up less than 4 percent of enrollment in the rest of the G-20 countries reporting data. At the doctoral level, foreign students made up 42 percent of enrollment in France, followed by 11 percent in Italy and 8 percent in the Republic of Korea. In Turkey, Brazil, China, and Indonesia, foreign students made up less than 4 percent of enrollment at the doctoral level.\n\"Higher education\" is used synonymously with \"tertiary education,\" which includes \"tertiary type A\" programs (ISCED97 5A), which are largely theoretically based and designed to provide qualifications for entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements; \"tertiary type B\" programs (ISCED97 5B), which are more occupationally oriented and lead to direct labor market access; and advanced research programs (ISCED97 6), which lead directly to the award of an advanced research qualification (e.g., a Ph.D.). \"Academic higher education below the doctoral level\" is synonymous with \"tertiary type A\" (ISCED97 5A).\" Academic education at the doctoral level\" includes ISCED97 6.

However, reference dates may differ within that year; thus, the percentages shown in the table are approximations. As described in the source cited below, enrollment rates for some countries were reported as slightly exceeding 100 percent in one or more age groups (e.g., 5-to 14-year-olds) due to different reference dates for school enrollment and population data.

This indicator describes changes in the percentage of the population enrolled in formal education between 2001 and 2011. Like Indicator 2, it focuses on the four age groups-3-to 4-year-olds, 5-to 14-year-olds, 15-to 19-year-olds, and 20-to 29-year-olds-that generally correspond to the ages of the children and adults enrolled in preprimary education, primary and lower secondary education, upper secondary education, and higher education, respectively. In all G-20 countries reporting data except France and Italy (where rates were already over 90 percent), the percentage of 3-to 4-year-old children enrolled in preprimary or primary education programs increased from 2001 to 2011 (table 3-1). The largest increase (from 18 to 82 percent) occurred in the Republic of Korea. In the United States, the enrollment rate of 3-to 4-year-olds increased from 47 percent in 2001 to 64 percent in 2011. There were fewer changes in the percentage of 5-to 14-year-olds enrolled in formal education, mainly because of the strong correspondence in many systems between this age group and the ages covered by compulsory education, resulting in high rates of enrollment. For example, in both 2001 and 2011, Argentina, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom had at least 99 percent school participation of children ages 5-14. The United States had 100 percent school participation of children ages 5-14 in 2001 and 96 percent in 2011. For youth ages 15-19, enrollment in formal education programs showed little change from 2001 to 2011, with increases of only 2 percentage points in Brazil (from 75 to 77 percent) and Germany (from 90 to 92 percent) and a decrease of 2 percentage points in France (from 86 to 84 percent). The biggest increase in the enrollment rate of 15-to 19-year-olds from 2001 to 2011 was in Turkey (from 30 to 64 percent), followed by increases in Indonesia (from 45 to 61 percent) and Mexico (from 42 to 56 percent). Comparing 2001 and 2011, the United Kingdom was the only reporting G-20 country to show a decrease between 2001 and 2011 in the enrollment rate for 20-to 29-year-olds-the age group that corresponds most closely to the typical ages of enrollment in higher education. In the United Kingdom, the enrollment rate decreased from 23 to 19 percent. The biggest change in enrollment rates among 20-to 29-year-olds was an increase in Turkey, from 5 to 21 percent.

Students at the Advanced benchmark can apply their understanding and knowledge in a wide variety of relatively complex situations to solve problems involving fractions, decimals, proportions, area, and rotation. At the fourth-grade level in science, students at the Low benchmark have some elementary knowledge of the Earth, life, and physical sciences, such as simple facts about human health, ecosystems, and the behavioral and physical characteristics of animals. At the Intermediate benchmark, students can apply basic knowledge and understanding to practical situations in the sciences, such as knowing some basic information related to the characteristics of living things, their reproduction and life cycles, and their interaction with the environment. At the High benchmark, students can apply knowledge and understanding to explain everyday phenomena, such as demonstrating some knowledge of life processes, the solar system, and properties of matter. Students at the Advanced benchmark can apply knowledge and understanding in beginning scientific inquiry, such as demonstrating understanding of the properties of light and relationships among physical properties of materials. In each of the assessments, there may be students who do not reach the Low benchmark, indicating that their abilities could not be described based on their responses. These students are indicated by the percentages for Below Low in the figures and are referred to as those not reaching the Low benchmark in the text. Indicator 5 This indicator draws on data from TIMSS 2011 to describe eighth-grade students' performance in mathematics and science in terms of four international achievement benchmarks (Low, Intermediate, High, and Advanced), which were established to describe the knowledge and skills that students display at different points on a performance scale (described in \"Definitions and Methodology\" below). For each subject, the indicator first describes the percentage of students reaching at least the Intermediate level of performance. Next, the indicator describes the percentage of students reaching the highest international benchmark (Advanced), followed by the percentage reaching only the Low benchmark. In mathematics in 2011, three-quarters or more of eighth-grade students in 3 out of 10 G-20 countries reached the Intermediate international benchmark or higher (that is, at Intermediate, High, or Advanced); these countries were Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation (figure 6-1). However, only 68 percent of U.S. students reached this level of performance. At the Advanced benchmark, the Republic of Korea and Japan stand out, with 47 and 27 percent of students, respectively, reaching this level. In addition to these two countries, the Russian Federation (14 percent), Australia (9 percent), and the United Kingdom (England) (8 percent) had higher percentages at the Advanced benchmark than the United States (7 percent). Turkey had the same percentage at this level as the United States, and three countries had a smaller percentage (3 percent or less). The Republic of Korea was the only country in which less than 10 percent of students reached only the Low international benchmark. In addition to Korea, Japan (10 percent), the Russian Federation (16 percent), and the United Kingdom (England) (23 percent) had lower percentages of students at the Low benchmark than the United States (24 percent). The remaining five countries had higher percentages at the Low benchmark, ranging from 26 percent in Australia, Italy, and Turkey to 28 percent in Indonesia. One-third of the students in Turkey and over half of the students in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia did not reach the Low international benchmark. In science in 2011, at least three-quarters of eighth-grade students in 4 out of 10 G-20 countries reached the Intermediate international benchmark or higher; these countries were Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom (England) (figure 6-1). In the United States, 73 percent of students reached this level of performance. At the Advanced benchmark, the Republic of Korea, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom (England) had larger percentages of eighth-grade students (20, 18, 14, and 14 percent, respectively) than the United States (10 percent). The U.S. percentage was not measurably different from the percentages in Australia (11 percent) and Turkey (8 percent), but was larger than those in Italy (4 percent) and Saudi Arabia and Indonesia (1 percent or less).

In addition to these countries, the Russian Federation (15 percent) had a lower percentage of students at the Low benchmark than the United States (19 percent). The U.S. percentage was not measurably different from the percentages in the United Kingdom (England) (17 percent) and Australia (22 percent), but was lower than those in Italy and Turkey (25 percent each) and Indonesia and Saudi Arabia (34 percent each).

READING, MATHEMATICS, AND SCIENCE LITERACY PERFORMANCE OF 15-YEAR-OLD STUDENTS Australia,Brazil,Canada,France,Germany,Indonesia,Italy,Japan,Mexico,Republic of Korea,Russian Federation,Turkey,United Kingdom,United States In reading literacy among 15-year-olds, the United States had larger percentages of high performers and smaller percentages of low performers than 9 of the 14 other participating G-20 countries, but Australia, Canada, France, Japan, and  Indicator 7 draws on data from PISA 2012 to describe 15-year-old students' performance in reading, mathematics, and science literacy. Similar to other indicators in this section, it examines the percentages of students reaching different levels of proficiency on a performance scale. In PISA, the proficiency levels range from below level 1 to level 6 in all three subjects. For each subject, the indicator focuses on the percentages of students at the high and low ends of the scale (that is, those at level 5 or 6 and those at level 1 or below, respectively). In 2012, the percentage of students reaching the high end of the performance scale in reading literacy (i.e., at level 5 or 6) in the participating G-20 countries ranged from 1 percent or less in Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico to 18 percent in Japan. In the United States, 8 percent of students reached level 5 or 6. The percentage of students at the low end of the performance scale (i.e., at level 1 or below) ranged from 8 percent in the Republic of Korea to 55 percent in Indonesia; it was 17 percent in the United States. The United States had larger percentages of high performers and smaller percentages of low performers than 6 of the 14 other participating G-20 countries, but Australia, Canada, Japan, and the Republic of Korea each had larger percentages of high performers and smaller percentages of low performers than the United States. There were no measurable differences in the percentages of high or low performing students between the United States and the remaining 4 countries. In mathematics literacy, the percentage of students at the high end of the performance scale ranged from 1 percent or less in Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico to 31 percent in the Republic of Korea. In the United States, 9 percent of students reached level 5 or 6, which was not measurably different from two participating G-20 countries, higher than in five countries, and lower than in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom. The percentage of students at the low end of the performance scale ranged from 9 percent in the Republic of Korea to 76 percent in Indonesia. All but four of the participating G-20 countries (Canada, Germany, Japan, and the Republic of Korea) had higher percentages of students at level 1 or below than at level 5 or 6. The percentage of U.S. students at level 1 or below was 26 percent, which was higher than in all but 5 of the 14 other participating G-20 countries. In science literacy, the percentage of students at the high end of the performance scale ranged from less than 1 percent in Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico to 18 percent in Japan. In the United States, 7 percent of 15-year-olds reached level 5 or 6, which was not measurably different from two participating G-20 countries, higher than in six countries, and lower than in Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom. The percentage of students at the low end of the performance scale ranged from 7 percent in the Republic of Korea to 67 percent in Indonesia. The percentage of U.S. students at level 1 or below was 18 percent, which was lower than in all but 6 of the 14 other participating G-20 countries.\nIn PISA 2012, countries were required to sample students who were between the ages of 15 years and 3 months and 16 years and 2 months at the time of the assessment and who had completed at least 6 years of formal schooling, regardless of the type of institution in which they were enrolled. PISA scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. The PISA achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, and the metric of the scales was established for reading in 2000, mathematics in 2003, and science in 2006. To help in interpreting what students' scores mean in substantive terms, the scale is divided into levels, based on a set of statistical principles. Based on the tasks that are located within each level, certain kinds of skills and knowledge are needed to complete them successfully. The cutpoint scores for each level differ between subjects, but in each subject there may be students who perform below level 1. (In the case of reading literacy, level 1 includes two sublevels, level 1a and 1b.) In reading literacy, toward the top of the scale, students can handle texts that are unfamiliar in either form or content. They can find information in such texts, demonstrate detailed understanding, and infer which information is relevant to the task. They are also able to critically evaluate such texts and build hypotheses about them, drawing on specialized knowledge and accommodating concepts that may be contrary to expectations. Near the bottom of the scale, students begin to demonstrate the reading literacy competencies that will enable them to participate effectively and productively in life. Questions require recognizing the main idea in a text, understanding relationships, or construing meaning within a limited part of the text when the information is not prominent and the reader must make low-level inferences. The levels, with score-point cutoffs in parentheses, are 1b (262.04 to less than 334.75), 1a (334.75 to less than 7 407.47), 2 (407.47 to less than 480.18), 3 (480.18 to less than 552.89), 4 (552.89 to less than 625.61), 5 (625.61 to less than 698.32), and 6 (above 698.32). In mathematics literacy, toward the top of the scale, the tasks typically involve a number of different elements and require high levels of interpretation. Usually, the situations described are unfamiliar and so require some degree of thoughtful reflection and creativity. Typical activities involved include interpreting complex and unfamiliar data, imposing a mathematical construction on a complex real-world situation, and using mathematical modeling processes. Near the bottom of the scale, questions set in simple and relatively familiar contexts require only the most limited interpretation of a situation and direct application of well-known mathematical concepts. Typical activities include reading a value directly from a graph or table, performing a very simple and straightforward arithmetic calculation, ordering a small set of numbers correctly, counting familiar objects, using a simple currency exchange rate, and identifying and listing simple combinatorial outcomes. The levels, with score-point cutoffs in parentheses, are 1 (357.77 to less than 420.07), 2 (420.07 to less than 482.38), 3 (482.38 to less than 544.68), 4 (544.68 to less than 606.99), 5 (606.99 to less than 669.30), and 6 (above 669.30). In science literacy, typical questions near the top of the scale involve interpreting complex and unfamiliar data, imposing a scientific explanation on a complex real-world situation, and applying scientific processes to unfamiliar problems. At this part of the scale, questions tend to have several scientific or technological elements that need to be linked by students, requiring several interrelated steps. On the bottom of the scale, questions require less scientific knowledge and are applied in familiar contexts, with easy scientific explanations that arise directly from given evidence. The levels, with score-point cutoffs in parentheses, are 1 (334.94 to less than 409.54), 2 (409.54 to less than 484.14), 3 (484.14 to less than 558.73), 4 (558.73 to less than 633.33), 5 (633.33 to less than 707.93), and 6 (above 707.93). # Rounds to zero.

See the \"Definitions and Methodology\" section of Indicator 7 for specific score cutpoints at each proficiency level for each subject. Proficiency levels define student performance along a continuum, with level 1 or below indicative of the lowest performing students and levels 5 and 6 being indicative of the highest performing students.

SOURCE: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), 2012.\nThe Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) is a household study that has been developed under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). In the United States, data were collected in 2011 and 2012 for the first administration of PIAAC from a nationally representative sample of 5,000 adults between the ages of 16 and 65. The goal of PIAAC is to assess and compare the basic skills and the broad range of competencies of adults around the world. Specificall , PIAAC measures relationships between individuals' educational background, workplace experiences and skills, occupational attainment, use of information and communications technology, and cognitive skills in the areas of literacy, numeracy, and problem solving. The literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving scales each range from 0 to 500. Literacy is defined by PIAAC as understanding, evaluating, using, and engaging with written texts to participate in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential. Adults performing below proficiency level 1 (a score lower than 176) are able to read brief texts on familiar topics and to locate a single piece of specific information. Only basic vocabulary knowledge is required. Adults reaching level 1 (a score from 176 to 225) are able to read relatively short digital or print texts to locate a single piece of information that is identical to or synonymous with the information given in the question or directive. Adults reaching level 4 (a score from 326 to 375) can perform multi-step operations to integrate, interpret, or synthesize information from complex or lengthy texts of a variety of types. Complex inferences and application of background knowledge 8 may be needed to perform the task successfully. Adults reaching proficiency level 5 (a score higher than 376) are able to search for and integrate information across multiple, dense texts; construct syntheses of similar and contrasting ideas or points of view; and evaluate evidence-based arguments. Numeracy is defined by PIAAC as the ability to access, use, interpret, and communicate mathematical information and ideas, in order to engage in and manage the mathematical demands of a range of situations in adult life. Adults performing below proficiency level 1 (a score lower than 176) in numeracy are capable of carrying out simple processes such as counting, sorting, or performing basic arithmetic operations with whole numbers or money. Adults reaching proficiency level 1 (a score from 176 to 225) can carry out basic mathematical processes in common, concrete contexts where the mathematical context is explicit with little text and minimal distractors. Adults reaching proficiency level 4 (a score from 326 to 375) understand a broad range of mathematical information that may be complex, abstract, or embedded in unfamiliar contexts. Adults reaching level 5 (a score higher than 376) are able to integrate multiple types of mathematical information where considerable translation and interpretation is required; draw inferences; develop or work with mathematical arguments or models; and justify, evaluate, and critically reflect upon solutions or choices. Problem solving in technology-rich environments is defined by PIAAC as using digital technology, communication tools, and networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others, and perform practical tasks. Adults performing at proficiency level 2 (a score from 291 to 340) are able to use both generic and more specific technology applications to perform a task that may involve multiple steps and operators. Adults performing at proficiency level 3 (a score higher than 340) are also able to use both generic and specific technology applications as well as integration and inferential reasoning to a large extent. 1 Literacy is defined by PIAAC as \"understanding, evaluating, using, and engaging with written texts to participate in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential.\" 2 Numeracy is defined by PIAAC as \"the ability to access, use, interpret, and communicate mathematical information and ideas, in order to engage in and manage the mathematical demands of a range of situations in adult life.\" 3 Problem solving in technology-rich environments is defined by PIAAC as \"using digital technology, communication tools, and networks to acquire and evaluate information, communicate with others, and perform practical tasks.\" NOTE: PIAAC scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 500. See the \"Definitions and Methodology\" section of Indicator 8 for specific score cutpoints at each proficiency level for each subject. Proficiency levels define student performance along a continuum, with level 1 or below indicative of the lowest performing adults and levels 4 and 5 (in literacy and numeracy) indicative of the highest performing adults. France and Italy did not participate in the assessment of problem solving in technology-rich environments. Detail may not sum to totals due to rounding.

As defined by PIRLS and TIMSS, the first year of formal schooling begins with the first year of primary school (ISCED 97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. (Note that kindergarten is not counted.) For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade or its national equivalent. PIRLS and TIMSS scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Since both the PIRLS and TIMSS achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, the metric of the scales was established originally in 2001 for PIRLS and in 1995 for TIMSS, the first year in which each assessment was administered.\nIn TIMSS 2011 at the eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years. As defined by TIMSS, the first year of formal schooling begins with the first year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. (Note that kindergarten is not counted.) For most countries, the target grade was eighth grade or its national equivalent. TIMSS scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Since the TIMSS achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, the metric of the scales was established originally in 1995, the first year in which the assessment was administered. The TIMSS 2011 assessment at the eighth grade includes four domains that define the mathematics content covered: number, algebra, geometry, and data and chance. The number content domain includes understanding numbers, ways of representing numbers, relationships among numbers, and number systems. The algebra content domain includes recognizing and extending patterns, using algebraic symbols to represent mathematical situations, and developing fluency in producing equivalent expressions and solving linear equations. The geometry content domain includes analyzing the properties and characteristics of a variety of two-and three-dimensional geometric figures, including lengths of sides and sizes of angles, and providing explanations based on geometric relationships. The data and chance content domain includes knowing how to organize data that have been collected and how to display data in graphs and charts that will 10 be useful in answering questions, as well as understanding issues related to misinterpretation of data. The TIMSS 2011 assessment at the eighth grade includes four domains that define the science content covered: biology, chemistry, physics, and Earth science. Together, these content domains cover most of the topics in the various countries' curricula. The biology content domain includes students' understanding of the structure, life processes, diversity, and interdependence of living organisms. The chemistry content domain includes students' understanding of the classification and composition of matter, properties of matter, and chemical change. The physics content domain includes students' understanding of concepts related to physical processes and energy. The Earth science content domain includes the study of Earth and its place in the solar system and the universe. Figure 10-1. Average scores of eighth-grade students in mathematics and science, by content domain and country: 2011 The algebra content domain includes recognizing and extending patterns, using algebraic symbols to represent mathematical situations, and developing fluency in producing equivalent expressions and solving linear equations. 3 The geometry content domain includes analyzing the properties and characteristics of a variety of two-and three-dimensional geometric figures, including lengths of sides and sizes of angles, and providing explanations based on geometric relationships. 4 The data and chance content domain includes knowing how to organize data that have been collected and how to display data in graphs and charts that will be useful in answering questions, as well as understanding issues related to misinterpretation of data. 5 The biology content domain includes students' understanding of the structure, life processes, diversity, and interdependence of living organisms. 6 The chemistry content domain includes classification and composition of matter, properties of matter, and chemical change. 7 The physics content domain includes students' understanding of concepts related to physical processes and energy. 8 The Earth science content domain includes the study of Earth and its place in the solar system and the universe. NOTE: Shown are the scores for four TIMSS mathematics content domains (number, algebra, geometry, and data and chance) and four TIMSS science content domains (biology, chemistry, physics, and Earth science  Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States The U.S. mean score on the change and relationships subscale was 488, lower than the scores of the Republic of Korea, Japan, Canada, Germany, and Australia; not measurably different from those of France, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation; and higher than those of six other G-20 countries. In PISA 2012, the overall performance scale in mathematics literacy was composed of four subscales, allowing a more detailed look at student performance within mathematics content areas. (Mathematics, but not reading or science, had subscales because it was the focus in the 2012 assessment.) Indicator 11 examines the mean performance of 15-year-old students on these subscales in order to highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses in mathematics both within and across the participating G-20 countries. The mathematics subscales in PISA relate to mathematics content domains and include change and relationships, space and shape, quantity, and uncertainty and data. The range of mean scores was similar for change and relationships and space and shape, with 194-and 192-point differences between the lowest and highest scoring G-20 countries, respectively (figure 11-1). Quantity had a 175-point difference between the lowest and highest scoring G-20 countries, and uncertainty and data had the smallest range, at 154 points. The U.S. mean score on the change and relationships subscale was 488, lower than the scores of the Republic of Korea, Japan, Canada, Germany, and Australia; not measurably different from those of France, the United Kingdom, and the Russian Federation; and higher than those of six other countries. The performance of the United States was similar on the uncertainty and data subscale, with a mean score (488) below those of the Republic of Korea, Japan, Canada, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom; not measurably different from those of France and Italy; and higher than those of six other countries. Of the four subscales, the performance of U.S. students was the strongest on these two. In contrast, on the quantity subscale, eight countries (the Republic of Korea, Japan, Germany, Canada, Australia, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy) had mean scores that were higher than the U.S. mean score of 478; one country (the Russian Federation) had a score that was not measurably different from the U.S. score; and five countries had scores that were lower. Similarly, the U.S. mean score on the space and shape subscale was 463, lower than the scores of nine countries (the Republic of Korea, Japan, Canada, Germany, Australia, the Russian Federation, France, Italy, and the United Kingdom) and higher than those of the other five countries.\nIn PISA 2012, countries were required to sample students who were between the ages of 15 years and 3 months and 16 years and 2 months at the time of the assessment and who had completed at least 6 years of formal schooling, regardless of the type of institution in which they were enrolled. PISA scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. The PISA achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, and the metric of the scales was established for reading in 2000, mathematics in 2003, and science in 2006. The PISA assessment of mathematics literacy includes four domains that define the mathematic content covered: change and relationships, space and shape, quantity, and uncertainty and data. The change and relationships content subscale includes settings such as growth of organisms, music, the cycle of seasons, weather patterns, employment levels, and economic conditions and includes the use of algebraic expressions, equations and inequalities, and tabular and graphical representations. The space and shape content subscale encompasses phenomena encountered in our visual world: patterns, properties of objects, positions and orientations, representations of objects, decoding of visual information, and navigation. It utilizes geometry, spatial visualization, measurement, and algebra. The quantity content subscale incorporates aspects of quantitative reasoning, such as number sense, multiple representations of numbers, computation, mental calculation, estimation, and assessment of the reasonableness of results. The uncertainty and data content subscale is based on the theory of probability and statistics and includes recognizing the place of variation in processes, having a sense of the quantification of that variation, acknowledging uncertainty and error in measurement, and knowing about chance. In addition to the four domains, the PISA mathematics literacy assessment collects data on three mathematical processes: formulating, employing, and interpreting. Each mathematics item is classified into one of the four content domains as well as into one of the three mathematical processes. PIRLS and TIMSS are both conducted on regular cycles-PIRLS every 5 years since 2001 and TIMSS every 4 years since 1995-in order to provide information on changes in student performance. Using these data, Indicator 12 examines how fourth-grade mean student performance in reading, mathematics, and science has changed over time, using the next most recent and the initial assessment years of the respective assessments as comparison points to the most recent assessment year. For each of the three subjects examined in the indicator (reading, mathematics, and science), the indicator first identifies the countries in which there have been changes in students' mean performance and then describes the time period or periods over which that change occurred. In reading, of the eight G-20 countries participating in at least two cycles of PIRLS, the mean scores of fourth-grade students in reading literacy were measurably different in 2011 than in at least one previous cycle (2001 or 2006)  In mathematics, there were measurable differences in fourth-grade students' performance in 2011 from at least one previous cycle in five of the nine G-20 countries participating in at least two cycles of TIMSS ( figure 12-1). In all five countries-Australia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom (England), and the United States-mean scores in mathematics increased between 1995 and 2011, ranging from an increase of 18 points in Japan to 58 points in the United Kingdom (England). In the United States, the difference was 23 points. Additionally, the mean scores of students in Japan and the United States increased from 568 and 529, respectively, in 2007 to 585 and 541, respectively, in 2011. In science, fourth-grade students' mean scores in TIMSS decreased from 2007 to 2011 by 12, 11, and 13 points in Australia, Italy, and the United Kingdom (England), respectively (figure 12-1). Over the longer time period of 1995 to 2011, students' mean scores increased by 6 points in Japan and 11 points in the Republic of Korea. The mean score of U.S. students in 2011 was not measurably different from that in 1995 or 2007. Looking across the subject areas, the mean scores of fourth-grade students in the United States in 2011 were higher than in 2006 for reading literacy and higher than in 1995 and 2007 for mathematics. U.S. students' scores did not change measurably in science.\nIn PIRLS 2011 and TIMSS 2011 at the fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIRLS and TIMSS, the first year of formal schooling begins with the first year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. (Note that kindergarten is not counted.) For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade or its national equivalent. PIRLS and TIMSS scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Since both the PIRLS and TIMSS achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, the metric of the scales was established originally with the 2001 assessment (for PIRLS) and the 1995 assessment (for TIMSS), the first year in which each assessment was administered.\nIn TIMSS 2011 at the eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling (the end of primary school), providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years. As defined by TIMSS, the first year of formal schooling begins with the first year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. (Note that kindergarten is not counted.) For most countries, the target grade was eighth grade or its national equivalent. TIMSS scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. Since the TIMSS achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, the metric of the scales was established originally in 1995, the first year in which the assessment was administered. Indicator 13   Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States In science, there were fewer observed differences in 15-yearolds' performance over time than in reading or mathematics, with 11 countries (including the United States) showing no measurable change from 2006 or 2009 to 2012. In order to provide information on changes in student performance, PISA has been conducted every 3 years since 2000. Drawing on these data, Indicator 14 examines how the mean performance of 15-year-old students in reading, mathematics, and science literacy in 2012 (the most recent assessment year) has changed since 2009 (the next most recent assessment year) and the initial year in which the subject was a major domain (2000 for reading, 2003 for mathematics, and 2006 for science). For each subject, the indicator first identifies the countries in which there have been changes in students' mean scores and then describes the time period or periods over which that change occurred. In reading literacy, there were differences in mean scores over time in 11 of the 15 G-20 countries participating in at least two cycles of PISA; most of the differences were in the direction of growth (figure 14-1). In 6 countries (Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the Russian Federation), students' mean scores were higher in 2012 than in 2000. In 3 of these countries (Germany, Japan, and the Russian Federation), scores were also higher in 2012 than in 2009, as they were in France and Turkey. Students' mean scores decreased in Argentina, Australia, and Canada from 2000 to 2012. There were no measurable changes in the reading literacy scores of 15-year-olds in Italy, Mexico, and the United States over either time period. In mathematics literacy, there were differences in mean scores over time in 11 of the 15 G-20 countries participating in at least two cycles of PISA, with most of the differences again in the direction of growth. In 8 countries (Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and Turkey), students' mean scores were higher in 2012 than in 2003. The Russian Federation was the only participating country with a higher score in 2012 than in 2009. Students' mean scores decreased in Australia  In science literacy, there were fewer differences in mean scores over time than in the other subjects. Only in Brazil, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Turkey did 15-year-old students' mean scores increase, and the increase occurred over only one time period (from 2006 to 2012). Canadian students' mean scores, in contrast, decreased from 2006 to 2012. Again, there were no measurable changes in the science literacy scores of U.S. students and those in 10 other countries. Looking across subject areas, Brazil, the Republic of Korea, and Turkey showed increases in students' mean scores over time in all three subject areas, and five countries (Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, and the Russian Federation) showed increases in two subjects. In Canada, students' mean scores decreased in all three subjects over time and Australia showed decreases in two subjects.\nIn PISA 2012, countries were required to sample students who were between the ages of 15 years and 3 months and 16 years and 2 months at the time of the assessment and who had completed at least 6 years of formal schooling, regardless of the type of institution in which they were enrolled. PISA scores are reported on a scale from 0 to 1,000, with the scale average fixed at 500 and the standard deviation fixed at 100. The PISA achievement scales were designed to reliably measure student achievement over time, and the metric of the scales was established for reading in 2000, mathematics in 2003, and science in 2006.\nThis indicator is based on three indices formed using data from the PIRLS 2011 student questionnaire. The questionnaire obtained information about students' home and school lives, including basic demographic information as well as information about students' home environments, school climate for learning, and self-perception and attitudes toward reading. Students were assessed on whether they liked reading based on the extent of their agreement with the following statements-I read only if I have to; I like talking about what I read with other people; I would be happy if someone gave me a book as a present; I think reading is boring; I would like to have more time for reading; and I enjoy reading-as well as on how often they reported reading for fun and reading things they chose themselves outside of school. To determine whether students were motivated to read, students were asked to rate their agreement with the following statements: I like to read things that make me think; it is important to be a good reader; my parents like it when I read; I learn a lot from reading; I need to read well for my future; and I like it when a book helps me imagine other worlds. To determine students' confidence in reading, students were asked to rate their agreement with the following statements: I usually do well in reading; reading is easy for me; reading is harder for me than for many of my classmates; if a book is interesting, I don't care how hard it is to read; I have trouble reading stories with difficult words; my teacher tells me I am a good reader; and reading is harder for me than any other subject. In PIRLS 2011 in the fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIRLS, the first year of formal schooling begins with the first year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. (Note that kindergarten is not counted.) For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade or its national equivalent. (3) I would be happy if someone gave me a book as a present; (4) I think reading is boring; (5) I would like to have more time for reading; and (6) I enjoy reading-as well as on how often they reported (1) reading for fun and (2) reading things they chose themselves outside of school. This indicator presents data only for students in the highest category: like reading. The other categories (not shown) are somewhat like reading and do not like reading.      Australia,Brazil,Canada,France,Germany,Indonesia,Italy,Japan,Mexico,Republic of Korea,Russian Federation,Saudi Arabia,Turkey,United Kingdom,7  This indicator examines the differences between male and female students' attitudes toward mathematics across the G-20 countries that participated in TIMSS 2011 and PISA 2012. For fourth-and eighth-graders, it is based on an index formed using data from TIMSS 2011: the Students Like Learning Mathematics index. This index placed students into one of three categories (like learning mathematics, somewhat like learning mathematics, and do not liking learning mathematics) based on whether they agreed a lot, agreed a little, disagreed a little, or disagreed a lot with the statements listed in \"Definitions and Methodology\" below. The data in this indicator are for the highest category (i.e., like learning mathematics) in the index. For 15-year-olds, the data are based on a question from PISA 2012 that asked students about their intrinsic motivation to learn. The question asked students whether they strongly agreed, agreed, disagreed, or strongly disagreed with the following statement: I am interested in the things I learn in mathematics. The indicator reports the percentage of students who agreed or strongly agreed with this statement. Looking across the TIMSS and PISA data, there are four countries (among those that participated in both assessments) in which higher percentages of males than females liked mathematics or were interested in what they learned in mathematics: Australia, Italy, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. In contrast, in the United States, there were small or no differences between the percentages of male and female fourth-and eighth-graders who liked mathematics, but a 7-point difference between the percentages of male and female 15-year-olds who were interested in what they learned in mathematics (with males being more interested). In 7 of 11 participating G-20 countries, there were differences in the percentage of fourth-grade males and females who liked mathematics. In five countries (Australia, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the Republic of Korea), higher percentages of fourth-grade males than females liked mathematics, with differences ranging from 5 percentage points in Italy to 13 percentage points in Germany ( figure 16-1). In two countries, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, higher percentages of females than males liked mathematics (by 20 and 6 percentage points, respectively). Forty-five percent of fourth-grade males in the United States liked mathematics, which was lower than in Italy, the Russian Federation, and Turkey and higher than in Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland). Forty-four percent of U.S. fourth-grade females liked mathematics, which was lower than in Italy, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey and higher than in Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland). In 7 of 10 G-20 countries, there were differences in the percentages of eighth-grade males and females who liked mathematics. In all of these countries except Turkey, higher percentages of males than females liked mathematics, with differences ranging from In 12 of 15 participating G-20 countries, higher percentages of 15-year-old males than females were interested in what they learned in mathematics, with differences ranging from 2 percentage points in Mexico to 17 percentage points in Germany ( figure 16-3). The difference between the percentages of U.S. males and females who were interested in what they learned in mathematics was 7 percentage points. Fifty-three percent of males in the United States were interested in what they learned in mathematics, which was lower than in 12 countries and higher only than in Japan. Forty-seven percent of females in the United States were interested in what they learned in mathematics, which was lower than in nine countries, higher than in Japan, and not different from the percentage in the Republic of Korea. Twenty percent of eighth-grade males in the United States liked mathematics, which was lower than in the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey and higher than in Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom (England). Among females, 18 percent of U.S. eighth-graders liked mathematics, which, as for males, was lower than in the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey and higher than in Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom (England), as well as higher than in Australia and Italy.\nThis indicator is based on data from the TIMSS 2011 and PISA 2012 student questionnaires. Both questionnaires obtained information about students' home and school lives, including basic demographic information, as well as information about students' home environment, school climate for learning, and self-perception and attitudes toward mathematics. In TIMSS 2011 at the fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. In TIMSS 2011 at the eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years. As defined by TIMSS, the first year of formal schooling begins with the first year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. (Note that kindergarten is not counted.) For most countries, the target grades were fourth and eighth grades or their national equivalents. In PISA, four questions were used to measure 15-year-olds' intrinsic motivation to learn mathematics. The questions asked students whether they strongly agreed, agreed, disagreed, or strongly disagreed with the following statements: (a) I enjoy reading about mathematics; (b) I look forward to my mathematics lessons; (c) I do mathematics because I enjoy it; and (d) I am interested in the things I learn in mathematics. This analysis uses the percentage of students who agreed or strongly agreed with (d) I am interested in the things I learn in mathematics as a measure of students' attitudes toward mathematics. In PISA 2012, countries were required to sample students who were between the ages of 15 years and 3 months and 16 years and 2 months at the time of the assessment and who had completed at least 6 years of formal schooling, regardless of the type of institution in which they were enrolled.     The difference between female and male students is statistically significant in all countries except Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and Turkey. In the PISA student questionnaire, one of the four questions asked students whether they strongly agreed, agreed, disagreed, or strongly disagreed with the following statement: I am interested in the things I learn in mathematics. This figure shows data for students who reported that they agreed or strongly agreed with the statement. This indicator examines differences between the percentages of males and females across the participating G-20 countries who reported they liked learning science. It is based on an index, Like Learning Science, formed using data from the TIMSS 2011 student questionnaire. The index placed students into one of three categories (like learning science, somewhat like learning science, and do not like learning science) based on whether they agreed a lot, agreed a little, disagreed a little, or disagreed a lot with the statements presented in \"Definitions and Methodology\" below. This indicator presents data only for students in the highest category: like learning science. At the fourth-grade level, there were differences between the percentage of males and females who liked learning science in 6 of the 11 participating G-20 countries ( figure 17-1). In Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom (England), higher percentages of males than females liked learning science, with differences ranging from 6 percentage points in the Republic of Korea to 12 percentage points in Japan. In the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, higher percentages of females than males liked learning science, with differences ranging from 7 percentage points in the Russian Federation to 22 percentage points in Saudi Arabia. In the United States, there was no measurable difference at the fourth-grade level between the percentages of males and females who liked learning science. Fifty-seven percent of fourth-grade males in the United States liked learning science, which was lower than the percentage in Turkey and higher than the percentages in Italy, the Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland). Among females, there were more differences between countries in the degree to which fourth-grade students' liked learning science. The percentage of U.S. fourth-grade females who liked learning science (55 percent) was higher than the percentages in Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland) and lower than the percentages in the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. At the eighth-grade level, higher percentages of males than females liked learning science in all eight countries with data except Turkey (in which more females liked learning science) and Saudi Arabia (in where there were no gender differences) (figure 17-2). The largest difference between males and females was 12 percentage points, in Japan. In the United States, 33 percent of males liked learning science, compared to 25 percent of females. Compared to other countries, the percentage of eighth-grade males in the United States who liked learning science was lower than the percentages in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom (England), and higher than the percentages in Italy, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. A lower percentage of females in the United States than in Saudi Arabia and Turkey liked learning science, and a higher percentage of females in the United States than in Australia, Italy, Japan and the Republic of Korea did so.\nThis indicator is based on an index formed using data from the TIMSS 2011 student questionnaire. The questionnaire obtained information about students' home and school lives, including basic demographic information, as well as information about students' home environment, school climate for learning, and self-perception and attitudes toward mathematics and science. In TIMSS 2011 at the fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. In TIMSS 2011 at the eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years. As defined by TIMSS, the first year of formal schooling begins with the first year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. (Note that kindergarten is not counted.) For most countries, the target grades were fourth and eighth grades or their national equivalents.    Using data from PIRLS 2011, this indicator presents teachers' reports about the strategies that they used to help fourth-graders having difficulty reading. Teachers were given a list of strategies and asked whether each one was used if a student begins to fall behind in reading. This indicator focuses on three strategies in particular: asking parents to help their child with reading, working with students individually, and waiting and seeing if performance improved with maturation. The indicator also addresses the availability of a specialized professional to work with students who have difficulty reading The percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported asking parents to help their child with reading ranged from 88 percent in France to 100 percent in Germany and the Russian Federation ( figure 18-1). Ninety-five percent of U.S. fourth-graders had teachers who reported using this strategy. The percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported working with students individually ranged from 77 percent in Germany and Indonesia to 97 percent in the Russian Federation. In Australia, Canada, France, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), and the United States, teachers worked with students individually about as frequently as they asked parents to help their child with reading. In contrast, the percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported waiting and seeing if performance improved with maturation ranged widely, from 22 percent in the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) to 79 percent in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, in 7 of the 11 G-20 countries (including the United States), fewer than half of fourth-graders had teachers who reported using this strategy, and in all countries it was the least frequently used of the three strategies reported in this indicator. PIRLS also asked teachers of fourth-graders about their access to specialized reading professionals. The United States had the largest percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers indicated that reading professionals were always available (45 percent), as well as the smallest percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers indicated that reading professionals were never available (12 percent) (figure 18-2). In general, the G-20 countries could be categorized into two groups based on this characteristic. In six of the countries (Australia, Canada, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom [England and Northern Ireland], and the United States), about three-quarters or more of the students had teachers who reported having access to a reading professional at least sometimes. In the other five countries (France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, and Saudi Arabia), nearly two-thirds or more of the students had teachers who reported they never have access to a reading professional to assist with students' reading.\nData for this indicator are from the PIRLS 2011 fourth-grade teacher questionnaire, which was administered to the teachers of the students sampled for PIRLS. The questionnaire included questions on teachers' background and on their teaching practices in the sampled students' classes. One or two classes were randomly sampled in each school, and teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire for each class they taught that contained sampled students. Thus, if a teacher taught two classes with sampled students, he or she was expected to complete a questionnaire for each of these classes. It should be noted that the PIRLS 2011 fourth-grade teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. Rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. Teachers' reports about the use of various strategies to help fourth-graders having difficulty reading are based on the percentages of students whose teachers responded \"yes\" to a list of strategies that follow the question, \"What do you usually do if a student begins to fall behind in reading?\" Teachers' reports about the availability of specialized reading professionals to assist fourth-graders having difficulty reading are based on their responses to the question, \"Are the following resources available to you to deal with students who have difficult with reading?\" As shown in figure 18-2, the results are based on the percentages of students whose teachers responded \"always,\" \"sometimes,\" or \"never\" to the availability of a specialized reading professional either in the classroom or in a remedial reading classroom. In PIRLS 2011, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIRLS, the first year of formal schooling begins with the first year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. (Note that kindergarten is not counted.) For most countries, the target grade was fourth grade or its national equivalent.\nThis indicator is based on an index formed using data from the TIMSS 2011 fourth-and eighth-grade teacher questionnaires, which were administered to the teachers of the students sampled for TIMSS. The teacher questionnaires were designed to obtain information about the classroom contexts for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science and about the implemented curriculum in these subjects. For each participating school, one teacher questionnaire that addressed both mathematics and science was administered to the classroom teacher of the sampled fourth-grade class, and separate versions of the questionnaire were administered to the mathematics teacher and the science teacher of the sampled eighth-grade class. It should be noted that the TIMSS 2011 teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. Rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade and eighth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. To develop the Collaborate to Improve Teaching index, teachers were asked to indicate how often they interacted with other teachers to (a) discuss how to teach a particular topic; (e) work together to try out new ideas. The index places teachers into one of three categories (very collaborative, collaborative, or sometimes collaborative) based on whether they answered that they daily or almost daily, 1-3 times per week, 2 or 3 times per month, or never or almost never engaged in the five interactions described above. (Note that the TIMSS international report uses slightly different language to describe these categories; this indicator draws on the language used in the international codebook and the IDE.) In TIMSS 2011 at the fourth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. In TIMSS 2011 at the eighth grade, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 8 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 13.5 years. As defined by TIMSS, the first year of formal schooling begins with the first year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. (Note that kindergarten is not counted.) For most countries, the target grades were fourth and eighth grades or their national equivalents.  \nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2011 teacher questionnaire, which was designed to obtain information about the classroom contexts for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science and about the implemented curriculum in these subjects.

It should be noted that the TIMSS 2011 teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. Rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade and eighth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level.\nData for this indicator are from the TIMSS 2011 teacher questionnaire, which was designed to obtain information about the classroom contexts for the teaching and learning of mathematics and science and about the implemented curriculum in these subjects.

Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level.\nThis indicator is based on an index formed using data from the PIRLS 2006 and 2011 fourth-grade teacher questionnaires, which were administered to the teachers of the students sampled for PIRLS. The questionnaire included questions on teachers' background and on their teaching practices in the sampled students' classes. One or two classes were randomly sampled in each school, and teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire for each class they taught that contained sampled students. Thus, if a teacher taught two classes with sampled students, he or she was expected to complete a questionnaire for each of these classes. It should be noted that the fourth-grade teachers do not constitute representative samples of teachers. Rather, they are the teachers for nationally representative samples of fourth-grade students. Thus, the teacher data presented in this indicator were analyzed at the student level. In PIRLS 2006 and 2011, countries were required to sample students in the grade that corresponded to the end of 4 years of formal schooling, providing that the mean age at the time of testing was at least 9.5 years. As defined by PIRLS, the first year of formal schooling begins with the first year of primary school (ISCED97 level 1), which should mark the beginning of formal instruction in reading, writing, and mathematics. (Note \nTeacher salary data refer to the 2010-11 school year. Data for GDP per capita are for calendar year 2011. Dollar figures for teacher salaries and GDP per capita were converted to U.S. equivalent dollars using purchasing power parities (PPPs), which equalize the purchasing power of different currencies. Using PPPs to convert all teacher salary data to U.S. equivalent dollars allows for costof-living differences across countries to be taken into account. Salaries refer to scheduled salaries according to official pay scales and are defined as before-tax, or gross, salaries (the total sum paid by the employer for the labor supplied), excluding the employer's contribution to social security and pension (according to existing salary scales). In addition, differences by country in taxation and social benefit systems as well as the use of financial incentives (including regional allowances for teaching in remote regions, family allowances, reduced rates on public transport, tax allowances on purchases of cultural goods, and other entitlements that contribute to a teacher's basic income) make it important to exercise caution in interpreting comparisons of teachers' salaries. Countries with centralized systems of education typically have national salary schedules. In countries like the United States, with decentralized systems, local or regional governments establish their own salary schedules. The national averages shown here do not represent the within-country variation that exists in teacher salaries. The minimum training necessary to be fully qualified varies by country. In the United States, teacher training is decentralized and varies by state; the average teacher salary is the median of the self-reported salaries of teachers with two or fewer years of experience in a sample representative of public school teachers in the United States. As shown in the accompanying figure and   Australia,Brazil,Canada,France,Germany,Italy,Japan,Mexico,Republic of Korea,Russian Federation,Turkey,United Kingdom,United States In 2010, total expenditures per student and the portion of these expenditures devoted to core education services were higher in the United States than in any other reporting G-20 country at both the combined primary and secondary education levels and the higher education level. This indicator begins by examining public and private education expenditures per student across the G-20 countries in 2010, including total education expenditures as well as the portion of total expenditures devoted to core services. Expenditures are examined at the combined primary and secondary education levels as well as at the higher education level. 8 At the primary and secondary education levels, total education expenditures are the combined expenditures for core and ancillary services; at the higher education level, total expenditures also include research and development activities. Core services expenditures pertain to spending on instructional services, including faculty/staff salaries, professional development, and books and other school materials. Ancillary services expenditures, which pertain to spending on education services other than instruction (such as meals at school, transportation to and from school, and campus housing), are included in the total expenditures in this indicator, but are not examined separately. Using data from 2000 and 2010, the indicator also presents annual public and private education expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), allowing a comparison of countries' education expenditures relative to their overall economic output. In 2010, total education expenditures per student and the portion of these expenditures devoted to core education services were higher in the United States than in any other reporting G-20 country at both the combined primary and secondary education levels and the higher education level (figure 24-1) Annual expenditures per student on core education services in the United States were about $10,900 at the combined primary and secondary education levels and about $19,700 at the higher education level. In the other G-20 countries reporting data, annual expenditures per student on core education services ranged from about $1,900 in Turkey to $9,600 in Australia at the combined primary and secondary levels and from about $5,900 in Italy to $15,100 in Canada at the higher education level. In 2000, overall (i.e., at the primary, secondary, and higher education levels combined), the United States spent a higher percentage of GDP on education (5.9 percent) than any other G-20 country reporting data ( figure 24-2). In 2010, the United States and the Republic of Korea spent a higher percentage of GDP on education (6.8 percent) than any other G-20 country, followed by Canada (6.6 percent). The Russian Federation spent the lowest percentage in 2000 (2.2 percent) and in 2010 (3.7 percent). In both 2000 and 2010, all reporting G-20 countries spent a larger percentage of GDP at the combined primary and secondary education levels than at the higher education level. In 2000, spending on primary and secondary education as a percentage of GDP ranged from 1.7 percent in the Russian Federation to 4.3 percent in France. In contrast, spending on higher education as a percentage of GDP ranged from 0.5 percent in the Russian Federation to 2.3 percent in Canada. In 2010, the Russian Federation again had the lowest spending on primary and secondary education as a percentage of GDP, at 2.1 percent; the highest spending was in the United Kingdom, at 4.8 percent. Spending on higher education ranged from 0.9 percent in Brazil to 2.8 percent in the United States. Besides the United States, only Canada and the Republic of Korea spent more than 2 percent of GDP on higher education in both years. 9 Between 2000 and 2010, spending at all levels of education tended to hold steady or increase in the reporting G-20 countries. At the primary and secondary levels, only France saw a reduction in the ratio of spending on education to GDP (from 4.3 to 4.1 percent), although in both years it was among the higher spending countries. At the higher education level, there were increases in spending as a percentage of GDP of no more than two-tenths of a percentage point in Brazil, Japan, Italy, France, and Australia. However, in the United States, the percentage of GDP spent on higher education increased by six-tenths of a percentage point between 2000 and 2010, and in the Russian Federation, it increased by 1.1 percentage points.\nExpenditures per student (see figure 24-1 -Not available. 1 Core services data are included in total services data at the primary and secondary education levels for Brazil and Mexico and at the primary and secondary and higher education levels for Argentina, the Russian Federation, and Japan. 2 Public institutions only (for Canada, in tertiary education only; for Italy, except in tertiary education). 3 Excludes postsecondary nontertiary data. 4 Reference year is 2009 rather than 2010.

The net graduation rate is calculated by dividing the number of graduates by the population for each single year of age. The gross graduation rate is calculated by dividing the total number of graduates by the population at the typical age of graduation. At the upper secondary level, graduation rates in China, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom are calculated as gross rates (with the graduation rates in Canada, Mexico, Turkey, and the United States calculated as net rates). At the level of academic higher education below the doctoral level, graduation rates in Japan, Turkey, and the United States are calculated as gross rates (with the graduation rates in Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Mexico, and the United Kingdom calculated as net rates). Typical graduation ages in these countries-at both the upper secondary education level and the academic higher education below the doctoral level-vary depending on the specifi program type and duration. Please see the education system charts in appendix A for further information on age of graduation. Mismatches between the coverage of the population data and the graduation data mean that the graduation rates for those countries that are net exporters of students may be underestimated and those that are net importers may be overestimated. As shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the 1997 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97). The graduation rate in upper secondary education includes first-time graduates at ISCED97 level 3. The graduation rate in academic higher education below the doctoral level includes first-time graduates at ISCED97 level 5A. For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A.

This indicator describes the highest levels of education attained in 2011 by two groups in the populations of the G-20 countries: 25-to 64-year-olds (i.e., the working age population generally) and 25-to 34-year-olds (i.e., young adults). First, the indicator presents the percentages of the working age population who completed each of three levels of education as their highest level: lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, 10 or higher education. Then, focusing solely on higher education, the indicator compares the percentages of the young adult population and the working age population, as well as the percentages of young adult males and females, at this level of education.\nAs shown in the figures, education levels are defined according to the 1997 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97).

Brazil,Canada,France,Germany,Italy,Japan,Mexico,Republic of Korea,Russian Federation,Turkey,United Kingdom,United States In the United States and all other G-20 countries reporting data in 2011, higher employment rates were associated with higher levels of educational attainment.\nThe employment rate of adults at a particular level of educational attainment is calculated as the number of individuals with that level of educational attainment who are employed divided by the total number of individuals with the same level of educational attainment. This indicator examines the employment rate of adults ages 25 to 64. As shown in the accompanying figures, education levels are define according to the 1997 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97). For more information on the ISCED97 levels, see appendix A. Individuals whose highest level of education is academic higher education have completed at least a first university degree program, which prepares students for advanced research and highly skilled professions. First university degree programs vary in duration in different countries in different programs of study. In the United States, first university degree programs include bachelor's degree programs, but not associate's degree programs. Percentage-point differences presented in the text were computed from unrounded numbers; therefore, they may differ from computations made using the rounded whole numbers that appear in the figures Indicator 28   Brazil,Canada,France,Germany,Italy,Republic of Korea,United Kingdom,United States At each successively higher level of education, there were higher percentages of adults ages 25 to 64 across the reporting G-20 countries who earned more than the median income, as well as who earned more than twice the median income, than their counterparts with less education. This indicator examines the relationship between education and income among adults ages 25 to 64 in the G-20 countries. It compares the percentages of adults with different levels of education at different points on the income distribution, including those who earn more than the median income in their countries, as well as those at the extremes of distribution ( i.e., below half of the median income and more than twice the median income). 13 The education levels examined are lower secondary education or below, upper secondary education, and academic higher education. Income comparisons are made relative to each country's respective median income and are generally for 2011. In all reporting G-20 countries, higher levels of education were associated with higher income (as well as lower rates of low income). At each successively higher level of education, there were larger percentages of adults ages 25 to 64 who earned more than the median income and more than twice the median income than their counterparts with less education (as well as smaller percentages of adults who earned at or below half of the median income) ( figure 29-1 and table 29-1) Among U.S. 25-to 64-year-olds whose highest level of educational attainment was lower secondary education or below, 15 percent earned more than the median income in 2011 ( figure 29-1). The U.S. percentage was lower than that in any other G-20 country reporting data, where the percentages ranged from 16 percent in the Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom to 46 percent in Brazil. Three percent of U.S. 25-to 64-year-olds with this level of education earned more than two times the country's median income (table 29-1). The corresponding percentages in the other G-20 countries ranged from 1 percent in, again, the Republic of Korea and the United Kingdom to 13 percent in Brazil. In contrast, 47 percent of such U.S. adults earned at or below half of the country's median income, which was a higher rate than that in any other G-20 country reporting data, where the percentages ranged from 23 percent in Brazil to 37 percent in the United Kingdom. Among U.S. 25-to 64-year-olds whose highest level of educational attainment was upper secondary education, 38 percent earned more than the median income in 2011 ( figure 29-1). The U.S. percentage was lower than that in any other G-20 country reporting data except the Republic of Korea, which also had 38 percent. The corresponding percentages in the other G-20 countries ranged from 40 percent in the United Kingdom to 54 percent in Italy. (Italy was the only reporting G-20 country in which more than half of the adults with an upper secondary education earned more than the country's median income.) Eight percent of U.S. 25-to 64-year-olds with an upper secondary education earned more than two times the country's median income (table 29-1). The corresponding percentages in the other G-20 countries ranged from 5 percent in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom to 32 percent in Brazil. In contrast, 26 percent of such U.S. adults earned at or below half of the country's median income; in the other G-20 countries, the percentages ranged from 6 percent in Brazil to 27 percent in Canada. Among U.S. 25-to 64-year-olds who had completed academic higher education, 68 percent earned more than the median income in 2011 ( figure 29-1). The corresponding percentages in the other G-20 countries ranged from 65 percent in Canada to 94 percent in Brazil. Thirty percent of U.S. 25-to 64-year-olds with this level of education earned more than two times the country's median income (table 29-1). The corresponding percentages in the other G-20 countries ranged from 24 percent in France to 74 percent in Brazil. In contrast, 13 percent of such U.S. adults earned at or below half of the country's median income; in the other G-20 countries, the percentages ranged from 2 percent in Brazil to 18 percent in Canada.\nIncome refers to pretax income. As shown in the accompanying table and figure, education levels are defined according to the 1997 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED97).

In the United States, 12 percent of adults reached level 4 or 5 in literacy. This indicator draws on data from the 2012 Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), a new assessment of adults ages 16 to 65 in literacy, numeracy, and problem solving in technology-rich environments. Similar to the other indicators in this section, it examines the percentages of adults reaching different levels of proficiency on a performance scale. (In PIAAC, the proficiency levels range from below level 1 to level 5 in literacy and numeracy and from below level 1 to level 3 in problem-solving in technology-rich environments.) For literacy and numeracy, the indicator focuses on the percentages of adults at the high and low ends of the scale (that is, those at level 4 or 5 and those at level 1 or below, respectively). For problem solving in technology-rich environments, because there are fewer levels designated along the performance scale, the indicator focuses on those adults reaching levels 2 and 3. In 2012, the percentage of adults reaching the high end of the performance scale in literacy (i.e., at level 4 or 5) in the nine participating G-20 countries ranged from 3 percent in Italy to 23 percent in Japan (figure 8-1). In the United States, 12 percent of adults reached level 4 or 5, which was not measurably differ than in Germany and the United Kingdom (England/Northern Ireland); higher than in France, Italy, and the Republic of Korea; and lower than in Australia, Canada, and Japan. The percentage of adults at the low end of the performance scale (i.e., at level 1 or below) ranged from 5 percent in Japan to 28 percent in Italy. All of the participating G-20 countries except Japan and Australia had higher percentages of adults at level 1 or below than at level 4 or 5. The percentage of U.S. adults at level 1 or below was 18 percent, which was lower than in France and Italy but higher than in Australia, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. In numeracy, the percentage of adults at the high end of the performance scale ranged from 4 percent in Italy to 19 percent in Japan. In the United States (and France), 9 percent of adults reached level 4 or 5, which was higher than in Italy and the Republic of Korea, but lower than in the other participating G-20 countries. The percentage of adults at the low end of the performance scale ranged from 8 percent in Japan to 32 percent in Italy. All but one of the participating G-20 countries (Japan) had higher percentages of adults at level 1 or below than at level 4 or 5. The percentage of U.S. adults at level 1 or below was 30 percent, which was higher than in all participating countries except France and Italy. Comparing literacy and numeracy, there were higher percentages of adults at level 1 or below in numeracy than in literacy in all participating G-20 countries except Germany. In three of those countries (Australia, Japan, and the United States), there were lower percentages of adults at level 4 or 5 in numeracy than in literacy, as well. Germany and Italy, on the other hand, had higher percentages of adults at level 4 or 5 in numeracy than in literacy. In problem solving in technology-rich environments (where the proficiency levels ranged from below level 1 to level 3), over half of the participating adults in Japan reached proficiency level 2 or 3 (though it should be noted that response rates for Japan were 50 percent). Thirty-nine percent of participating U.S. adults reached level 2 or 3, which was lower than in any other participating G-20 country except the United Kingdom (England/ Northern Ireland). In all countries except Japan, where 13 percent of adults reached this level, the percentage of adults at level 3 was between 5 and 9 percent.\nIn PIRLS 2011, which tested fourth-graders, the United States' mean score on the reading for literary experience subscale was 563, not measurably different from the Russian Federation's score and higher than scores in eight other G-20 countries. In PIRLS 2011 and TIMSS 2011, as in previous cycles, the overall performance scales in reading, mathematics, and science were composed of subscales that allow a more detailed look at student performance within each content area. Indicator 9 examines he mean performance of fourth-grade students on these subscales in order to highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses in reading, mathematics, and science both within and across the participating G-20 countries. As the indicator shows, the United States performed strongest on the reading and science subscales at the fourth grade, generally outperforming more countries than on the mathematics subscales. There also was generally more variation in the United States' performance relative to other countries on the mathematics subscales compared to the reading and science subscales. In PIRLS 2011, the reading subscales relate to the purposes for reading and include reading for literary experience and reading to acquire and use information. Mean scores for fourth-grade students on the literary experience subscale ranged 149 points, from 418 in Indonesia to 567 in the Russian Federation (figure 9-1). Mean scores on the acquire and use information subscale had a smaller range (131 points), from 439 in Indonesia to 570 in the Russian Federation. The U.S. mean score on the literary experience subscale was 563, not measurably different from that of the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) and the Russian Federation, and higher than scores in eight other G-20 countries. On the acquire and use information subscale, the U.S. mean score was 553, lower than that of the Russian Federation, not measurably different from the United Kingdom's (Northern Ireland and England) mean scores, and higher than the scores in seven other G-20 countries. In TIMSS 2011, the mathematics subscales at grade 4 relate to specific content domains and include number, geometric shapes and measures, and data display. The range of mean scores was similar on each of the three content domain subscales, with 196-, 203-, and 200-point differences between the lowest and highest scoring G-20 countries on number, geometric shapes and measures, and data display, respectively (figure 9-2). The U.S. mean score on the number subscale was 543, lower than the scores of the Republic of Korea, Japan, and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), not measurably different from those of the Russian Federation and the United Kingdom (England), and higher than those of five other countries. The performance of the United States was similar on the data display subscale, with a mean score (545) below those of the Republic of Korea, Japan, and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), not measurably different from those of the United Kingdom (England) and Germany, and higher than those of five other countries. On the geometric shapes and measures subscale, four countries-the Republic of Korea, Japan, and the United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland)had mean scores that were higher than the U.S. mean score of 535, three countries (the Russian Federation, Germany, and Australia) had scores that were not measurably different from the U.S. score, and three countries had scores that were lower. The science subscales in TIMSS 2011 at grade 4 also relate to specific content domains and include life science, physical science, and Earth science. The range of mean scores on the science subscales was smaller than the range on the mathematics subscales, with 156-, 158-, and 171-point differences between the lowest and highest scoring G-20 countries on life science, physical science, and Earth science, respectively (figure 9-2). The U.S. mean score on the life science subscale was 547, lower than the scores of the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation and higher than those of eight other countries. The United States' mean score on the physical science subscale was 544, lower than the scores of the Republic of Korea and Japan, not measurably different from that of the Russian Federation, and higher than those of seven other countries. On the Earth science subscale, the Republic of Korea, Japan, and the Russian Federation had higher mean scores than the United States (539), but the United States had a higher mean score than seven other countries.\nIn terms of rankings relative to other G-20 countries, the United States performed stronger on the algebra subscale in eighth-grade mathematics than on the number, geometry, or data and chance subscales. In TIMSS 2011, as in previous cycles, the overall performance scales in mathematics and science were composed of subscales that allow for a more detailed look at student performance in specific subcontent areas. Indicator 10 examines the mean performance of eighth-grade students on these subscales in order to highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses in mathematics and science both within and across the participating G-20 countries. In TIMSS 2011, the mathematics subscales in grade 8, which relate to specific content domains, include: number, algebra, geometry, and data and chance. The smallest range in mean scores between the lowest and highest performing G-20 countries was in algebra, with a 224-point difference (figure 10-1). The range between countries on the three other subscales was similar but larger, with 243 , 247-, and 240-point differences in number, geometry, and data and chance, respectively. Compared with other participating G-20 countries, the United States performed strongest on the algebra subscale, with a mean score (512) that was lower than the mean scores of three G-20 countries, but higher than those of six others. Three countries also had higher mean scores than the United States in number and data and chance, although two countries in number, and one in data and chance, had mean scores not measurably different from the U.S. score. Geometry was the weakest area for the United States, with a mean score (485) that was lower than the scores of six countries and higher than those of three others. The mean scores of students in the Republic of Korea and Japan were higher than the mean scores of U.S. students on all four subscales. Students from the Russian Federation also outperformed U.S. students in number, algebra, and geometry, but underperformed U.S. students in data and chance. U.S. students outperformed students in Turkey, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia on all four subscales and in Italy on all subscales except geometry; on the geometry subscale, Italian students had a higher mean score than U.S. students (512 vs. 485, respectively). The science subscales in TIMSS 2011 also relate to specific content domains: biology, chemistry, physics, and Earth science. The range of mean scores among the participating G-20 countries on the science subscales was smaller than the range on the mathematics subscales (with 151-, 182-, 180-, and 137-point differences in biology, chemistry, physics, and Earth science, respectively) (figure 10-1). The U.S. mean scores on the Earth science (533) and biology (530) subscales were lower than the mean scores of Japan and the Republic of Korea; not measurably different from the mean scores of the United Kingdom (England), the Russian Federation, and Australia; and higher than those of four other countries. On the chemistry subscale, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Korea had higher mean scores than the United States; the U.S. mean score (520) was not measurably different from the score of the United Kingdom (England), but was higher than those of the remaining five countries. On the physics subscale, the Republic of Korea, Japan, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom (England) had higher mean scores than the United States; the U.S. mean score (513) was not measurably different from Australia's, but was higher than those of the remaining four countries.\nIn all G-20 countries, higher percentages of fourth-grade females than males liked reading, with differences ranging from 8 percentage points in France to 25 percentage points in Saudi Arabia. This indicator examines the differences between fourth-grade male and female students' attitudes toward reading across the participating G-20 countries. It is based on three indices formed using data from PIRLS 2011: the Like to Read index, the Motivated to Read index, and the Confident in Reading index. Each index places students into one of three categories based on whether they agreed a lot, agreed a little, disagreed a little, or disagreed a lot with the statements described in \"Definitions and Methodology\" below. For instance, the Like to Read index categorizes students into those who like reading, somewhat like reading, and do not liking reading. This indicator presents data only for students in the highest category (e.g., like reading) in each index. In all G-20 countries, higher percentages of fourth-grade females than males liked reading, with differences ranging from 8 percentage points in France to 25 percentage points in Saudi Arabia (figure 15-1). In the United States, the difference between females and males was 13 percentage points. Thirty-three percent of fourth-grade females in the United States liked reading, which was lower than in Canada, Germany, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia. Twenty percent of U.S. fourth-grade males liked reading, which was lower than in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and Indonesia, but higher than in Italy and Saudi Arabia. In all G-20 countries except Indonesia, there were differences in the percentages of females and males who were motivated to read. In the 10 remaining countries, a higher percentage of females than males were motivated to read, although the differences (ranging from 4 percentage points in France to 16 percentage points in Saudi Arabia) were generally smaller than for those who liked reading (figure 15-2). In the United States, the difference between females and males was 7 percentage points. Seventy-four percent of fourth-grade females in the United States were motivated to read, which was lower than in Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and Saudi Arabia, but higher than in France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland). Among males, 67 percent of U.S. fourth-graders were motivated to read, which, as for females, was lower than in Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and Saudi Arabia. However, the U.S. percentage for males was higher than the percentages in Italy and the United Kingdom (England and Northern Ireland). In 8 of the 11 participating G-20 countries, higher percentages of fourth-grade females than males expressed confidence in reading, with differences ranging from 5 percentage points in Canada to 20 percentage points in Saudi Arabia (figure 15-3). The difference between the percentages of U.S. females and males who expressed confidence in reading was 6 percentage points. The percentages of both females and males in the United States who had confidence in reading were among the highest in the participating G-20 countries. Forty-three percent of females in the United States had confidence in reading, lower only than in Germany and Saudi Arabia and higher than in Australia, France, Indonesia, Italy, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom (England). Thirty-seven percent of males in the United States had confidence in reading, lower only than in Germany and higher than in France, Indonesia, Italy, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland).\nThe United States was the only participating G-20 country where at least half of the eighth-grade students had teachers who reported participating in professional development in mathematics in each of four areas: content, pedagogy, assessment, and integrating information technology into instruction. TIMSS 2011 asked teachers of fourth-and eighth-graders to report on their participation in several areas of professional development in mathematics in the 2 years before the assessment. This indicator examines the results in four areas of professional development: content, pedagogy, assessment, and integrating information technology (IT) into instruction. In 2011, the percentage of fourth-graders whose teachers reported participating in professional development in mathematics content in the previous 2 years ranged from 10 percent in Turkey to 68 percent in the United States ( figure 20-1). In the United States, participation in this area of professional development was higher than in any other area. The percentage of students whose teachers reported participating in professional development in mathematics pedagogy ranged from 11 percent in Turkey to 73 percent in Saudi Arabia. Fifty-five percent of fourth-graders in the United States had teachers who reported participating in this area of professional development, which was lower than in the United Kingdom (England) (71 percent) and Australia (65 percent), not significantly different than in the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), the Russian Federation, and Japan (64, 59, and 59 percent, respectively), and higher than in the remaining countries. Fifty-three percent of fourth-graders in the United States had teachers who reported participating in professional development in mathematics in the area of assessment, as did 49 percent in the area of integrating IT into instruction. As in the United States, in five other countries (Australia, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Saudi Arabia), these were the two areas in which fourth-graders' teachers were the least likely to receive professional development. The most notable exception was the Russian Federation, where 64 and 65 percent of students' teachers reported receiving professional development in assessment and integrating IT into instruction, compared to 58 and 59 percent in content and pedagogy, respectively. The Russian Federation, however, was one of two G-20 countries in which more than half of fourth-grade students' teachers reported participating in professional development in each of the four areas. (The United Kingdom [Northern Ireland] was the other.) In Turkey, the percentages of students whose teachers reported participating in professional development in any area were uniformly low (ranging from 9 to 12 percent). In contrast to other G-20 countries particularly Germany, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United Kingdom (England)-teacher participation in professional development varied to a greater degree among the different areas. At the eighth-grade level, higher percentages of students in most countries had teachers who reported participating in professional development in mathematics in each of the areas than they did at the fourth grade. The exceptions were Saudi Arabia, in all areas; Italy and Australia, in content; and the Russian Federation, in assessment. The percentage of eighth-grade students whose teachers reported participating in professional development in mathematics content ranged from 23 percent in Italy to 73 percent in the United States. The United States also had the highest percentage of students whose teachers reported participating in professional development in mathematics pedagogy (73 percent), along with the United Kingdom (England) (73 percent), Japan (70 percent), the Russian Federation (69 percent), and Australia (65 percent). Turkey had the lowest percentage of students whose teachers reporting participating in professional development in this area, with 41 percent. The percentage of eighth-grade students whose teachers reported participating in professional development in mathematics assessment ranged from 26 percent in Turkey, Japan, and Italy to 71 percent in Indonesia, with 61 percent in the United States. In the area of integrating IT into instruction, the percentages ranged from 23 percent in Japan to 72 percent in the Russian Federation, with 68 percent in the United States. The United States was the only participating G-20 country where at least half of the eighth-grade students had teachers who reported participating in professional development in mathematics in each of the four areas. In Australia, Indonesia, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom (England), at least half of the eighth-grade students had teachers who reported participating in professional development in three of the areas. In Indonesia and the United Kingdom (England), integrating IT into instruction was the area in which relatively fewer students' teachers participated in professional development, whereas in the Russian Federation and Australia the area with the lowest rate of professional development was assessment.\nOf the G-20 countries reporting data in 2011, Germany reported the highest average starting salary of public school teachers at both the primary and upper secondary levels, followed by the United States. This indicator compares the average annual starting salaries of full-time public school teachers who have completed the minimum training necessary to be fully qualified at the beginning of their teaching careers. Average starting salaries are compared across countries for teachers at both the primary and upper secondary levels. The indicator also presents the ratio of these average starting salaries to the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for each of the reporting countries. This ratio provides an indication of how starting teachers' salaries compare with average levels of income, with higher ratios suggesting that starting salaries are high relative to average income and lower ratios indicating they are low relative to average income. Of the G-20 countries reporting data in 2011, Germany reported the highest average starting salary of public school teachers at both the primary and upper secondary levels, followed by the United States ( figure 23-1). In Germany, the average starting salary of public school teachers in 2011 was $47,500 at the primary level and $57,400 at the upper secondary level. In the United States, average starting salaries for public school teachers were $37,600 and $38,000 at the primary and upper secondary levels, respectively. Indonesia reported the lowest average starting salary at both levels ($1,600 at the primary level and $2,000 at the upper secondary level). In most of the reporting G-20 countries in 2011, public school teachers at the beginning of their careers earned less than the average GDP per capita in their respective countries (with the exception of Germany and Turkey) (table 23-1). For example, in the United States, the average starting salary of public primary and upper secondary school teachers was about 78 and 79 percent, respectively, of the U.S. GDP per capita of $48,112. In Turkey, however, public primary and upper secondary school teachers earned 137 and 141 percent, respectively, of the Turkish GDP per capita."}, {"section_title": "9", "text": "The PIRLS assessment of reading literacy focuses on the two purposes that account for most of the reading done by young students both in and out of school: reading for literary experience and reading to acquire and use information. Each of these purposes for reading is often associated with certain types of texts. For example, reading for literary experience is often accomplished through reading fiction, while reading to acquire and use information is generally associated with informative articles and instructional texts. In literary reading, the reader engages with the text to become involved in imagined events, settings, actions, consequences, characters, atmosphere, feelings, and ideas, and to enjoy language itself. In reading for information, the reader engages not with imagined worlds, but with aspects of the real world. Readers can go beyond the acquisition of information and use it in reasoning and in action. The TIMSS 2011 assessment at the fourth grade includes three domains that define the mathematic content covered: number, geometric shapes and measures, and data display. The number content domain includes place value, ways of representing numbers, and the relationships between numbers. The geometric shapes and measures domain includes properties of geometric figures such as lengths of sides, sizes of angles, areas, and volumes. The data display content domain includes reading and interpreting displays of data. The TIMSS 2011 assessment at the fourth grade includes three domains that define the science content covered: life science, physical science, and Earth science. Together, these content domains cover most of the topics in the various countries' curricula. Life science includes characteristics of the life processes of living things, the relationships between them, and their interaction with the environment.

In mathematics, there were measurable differences over time in 7 of the 11 G-20 countries participating in at least two cycles of eighth-grade TIMSS; most of the differences were in the direction of growth (figure 13-1). In the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation, eighth-grade students' mean scores were higher in 2011 than in both 1995 and 2007.

Male-female differences also were small, or nonexistent, in two countries with relatively low graduation rates: China (where females had a 2-percentage-point higher rate than males) and Turkey (with no difference). The largest differences in upper secondary graduation rates between males and females were in the United States and Mexico (where females had a 7-percentage-point higher rate than males), followed by Canada and Italy (where females had a 6-percentage-point higher rate than males). Graduation rates from academic higher education below the doctoral level ranged from a low of 18 percent in Saudi Arabia to a high of 55 percent in the United Kingdom ( figure 25-2). Besides the United Kingdom, only Australia had a graduation rate of at least 50 percent from academic higher education below the doctoral level; the graduation rate in the United States was 39 percent. As with upper secondary graduation rates, females' graduation rates from academic higher education below the doctoral level were higher than males' in most G-20 countries. The largest differences were in Australia and Canada (where females' rates were 18 and 17 percentage points higher, respectively, than males'). Differences greater than 10 percentage points were also observed in Italy, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The remaining countries (Germany, Japan, Mexico, and Turkey) had differences of less than 10 percentage points; in two of these countries (Japan and Turkey), males had higher graduation rates from academic higher education than females."}, {"section_title": "25", "text": "In seven of the reporting G-20 countries (Argentina, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey), over 50 percent of 25-to 64-year-olds had completed lower secondary education or below as their highest level of educational attainment ( figure 26-1). In Italy, too, the largest percentage of 25-to 64-year-olds (44 percent) had completed lower secondary education or below. Among the G-20 countries, upper secondary education was the highest level of education attained by the largest percentage of 25-to 64-year-olds in France, Germany, the Republic of Korea, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. 11 In these countries, the percentages of 25-to 64-year-olds completing upper secondary education ranged from 41 percent in the Republic of Korea to 59 percent in Germany. The countries in which higher education represented the highest level of education attained by the largest percentage of 25-to 64-year-olds were Australia (38 percent), Canada (51 percent), and the Russian Federation (53 percent). In the United States, 42 percent of 25-to 64-year-olds completed higher education, a percentage similar to the United Kingdom (39 percent), the Republic of Korea (40 percent), and Japan (46 percent). Compared to 25-to 64-year-olds, larger percentages of young adults (25-to 34-year-olds) had completed higher education in most of the G-20 countries ( figure 26-2). The largest differences were in the Republic of Korea, France, and Japan (by 24, 13, and 13 percentage points, respectively). Only in Germany were the rates of completion of higher education by young adults and 25-to 64-year-olds the same (28 percent), although the differences were small in Brazil (1 percentage point), the United States (1 percentage point), and the Russian Federation (3 percentage points). In most G-20 countries, more female than male young adults had completed higher education, with the differences ranging from 3 percentage points in the United Kingdom to 16 percentage points in Canada. In the United States, 48 percent of young adult females had completed higher education, compared to 38 percent of young adult males. These findings are consistent with historical data showing that more bachelor's degrees have been awarded to women than to men since about the early 1980s (Snyder and Dillow 2013, table 310).

They vary in duration in different countries in different fields of study. In the United States, first university degree programs include bachelor's degree programs, but not associate's degree programs. This indicator compares the percentage of first university degrees awarded in four combined fields of study in 2011: social sciences, business, and law; science, mathematics, and engineering; the arts and humanities; and education. In 2011, a greater percentage of first university degrees were awarded in the field of social sciences, business, and law than in any other field in 13 of 16 G-20 countries reporting data, including the United States (figure 27-1). In these 13 countries, about one-third to one-half of first university degrees were awarded in this field. Germany, the Republic of Korea, and Saudi Arabia were the exceptions. In science, mathematics, and engineering, the percentage of first university degrees awarded in the United States was among the lowest in any of the reporting G-20 countries. Sixteen percent of first university degrees in the United States were awarded in this field, as were 10 percent in Brazil and 15 percent in Argentina. Germany and the Republic of Korea, which are two of the exceptions noted above, awarded the highest percentages of first university degrees in science, mathematics, and engineering (30 and 34 percent, respectively). Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States were the only reporting G-20 countries in which the percentage of first university degrees awarded in science, mathematics, and engineering did not exceed the percentage awarded in the arts and humanities. Rather, in Saudi Arabia and the United States, the percentage of degrees awarded in the arts and humanities (38 and 18 percent, respectively) was higher than the percentage of degrees awarded in science, mathematics, and engineering (23 and 16 percent, respectively), and in Japan the percentage was the same in both fields (19 percent). Indonesia awarded the lowest percentage of first university degrees in the arts and humanities (1 percent). Elsewhere, the percentages ranged from 2 percent in Brazil to 38 percent in Saudi Arabia. The arts and humanities was the field of study in which the smallest percentage of first university degrees were awarded in Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, the Russian Federation, South Africa, and Turkey. In most G-20 countries, however, education was the field of study in which the smallest percentage of first university degrees were awarded. This was true in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In these countries, the percentage of first university degrees awarded in education ranged from 5 percent in the United Kingdom to 11 percent in Australia and Canada. Brazil awarded the highest percentage of first university degrees in education (28 percent). In absolute numbers, the United States and the Russian Federation awarded the most first university degrees overall, with over 2.1 and 1.8 million degrees, respectively, conferred in 2011 (table 27-1).\nThis indicator examines the employment rate of 25-to 64-year-olds (i.e., adults of typical working age). High employment rates in the working age population can be one aspect of a strong economy, but may also reflect social and economic policies. This indicator examines employment rates among the working age population by different levels of education for men and women. In the United States and all other G-20 countries reporting data in 2011, higher employment rates were associated with higher levels of educational attainment ( figure 28-1). For example, employment rates for 25-to 64-year-olds with academic higher education were 76 percent or higher in all reporting G-20 countries, compared with employment rates of 67 percent or below for 25-to 64-year-olds with lower secondary education or below as their highest level of education. Germany had the highest employment rate (88 percent) for working age adults with academic higher education; in the United States, the employment rate for this group was 81 percent. In every reporting G-20 country, employment rates rose with each successively higher education level, but the specific advantage of higher levels of education varied by country. The advantage of upper secondary education over lower secondary education or below ranged from 3 percentage points in Brazil to over 20 percentage points in Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom. In these latter four countries as well as four others (Australia, Canada, France, and the United States), this advantage was greater than that of academic higher education over upper secondary education. In the United States, the difference in the employment rate between 25-to 64-year-olds with upper secondary education and those with lower secondary education or below was 16 percentage points. The advantage of academic higher education over upper secondary education ranged from 5 percentage points in Australia and the United Kingdom to 15 percentage points in Brazil. In Brazil, the Republic of Korea, and Turkey, this advantage was greater than that of upper secondary education over lower secondary education or below. In the United States, the difference in the employment rate between 25-to 64-year-olds with academic higher education and those with upper secondary education was 14 percentage points. Examining differences in employment rates among 25-to 64-yearolds by sex shows that, in all reporting G-20 countries, men at all education levels had higher employment rates than women with comparable education (figure 28-2). For example, men who had completed academic higher education had employment rates of 84 percent (in Turkey) to 92 percent (in Brazil and Japan), whereas women with the same level of education had employment rates of 62 percent (in the Republic of Korea) to 84 percent (in Germany). For men who had completed upper secondary education, employment rates ranged from 72 percent (in the United States) to 89 percent (in Australia and Brazil); for women, they ranged from 30 percent (in Turkey) to 73 percent (in Germany and the United Kingdom). For men who had completed lower secondary education or below, employment rates ranged from 57 percent (in the Russian Federation) to 87 percent (in Mexico); for women, they ranged from 26 percent (in Turkey) to 57 percent (in the Republic of Korea). In five countries (Brazil, Japan, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, and Turkey), a higher percentage of men who had completed any education level were employed than were women who had completed academic higher education. 12 Moreover, for men, the association between having only lower secondary education or below and employment rates was weaker than it was for women in all countries except Japan and the Republic of Korea. Differences between 25-to 64-year-olds with academic higher education and those with lower secondary education or below were 30 percentage points or more among women in 9 countries (including the United States), whereas they were no more than 25 percentage points in any country among men (except the Russian Federation, where the difference was 34 percentage points). Employment rates for men in all but two G-20 countries (the Republic of Korea and the United States) also were less likely than those for women to be affected by the lack of academic higher education than by the lack of upper secondary education. This was especially true in Turkey, where the gap between 25-to 64-year-olds at these two levels of education was 2 percentage points among men and 34 percentage points among women. In the United States, the advantage of academic higher education over upper secondary education was 14 percentage points for both men and women."}, {"section_title": "28", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "29", "text": "2 Reference year is 2010 rather than 2011. 3 Includes ISCED97 levels 0 (preprimary education), 1 (primary education), and 2 (lower secondary education). 4 Includes ISCED97 levels 3 (upper secondary education) and 4 (postsecondary nontertiary programs). 5 Includes ISCED97 levels 5A (academic higher education below the doctoral level) and 6 (doctoral level of academic higher education).

Education at a Glance 2013: OECD Indicators, web table A6.4a. Paris: Author. Differences in the structure of countries' education systems often make international comparisons difficult. To improve the comparability of education indicators, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization created an internationally comparable method for describing levels of education across countries called the International Standard Classifi ation of Education (ISCED). This classification system was revised in 1997 and is referred to as the ISCED97. Using the ISCED97 classifi ations as a starting point, NCES worked with education professionals in the G-20 countries to create an overview of each country's education system. There are differences within the education systems of some G-20 countries because responsibilities and oversight for education take place at the regional or local level. However, the charts and accompanying text in this appendix are intended to give the reader a general overview of the education system in each G-20 country, from the preprimary to the doctoral level. The reader is encouraged to seek out additional resources to gain a fuller understanding of each country's education system.

The ISCED97 levels address the intent (e.g., to study basic subjects or prepare students for university) of each year of a particular education system, but do not indicate the depth or rigor of study in that year. Thus, the ISCED97 is useful when comparing the age range of students in upper secondary schools across nations; however, it does not indicate whether the curriculum and standards are equivalent within the same year of schooling across nations. The ISCED97 allows researchers to compile statistics on education internationally. The ISCED97 levels are as follows: \u2022 ISCED97 level 0 is classified as preprimary education. This is defined as the initial stage of organized instruction, designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment. ISCED97 level 0 programs can either be centeror school-based. Preschool and kindergarten programs in the United States fall into the level 0 category, although kindergarten is typically considered an elementary grade in the United States. \u2022 ISCED97 level 1 consists of primary education, which usually lasts 4 to 6 years. ISCED97 level 1 typically begins between ages 5 and 7, and is the stage where students begin to study basic subjects, such as reading, writing, and mathematics. In the United States, elementary school (grades 1 through 6) is classified as level 1 \u2022 At ISCED97 level 2, or lower secondary education, students continue to learn the basic subjects taught in level 1, but this level is typically more subject-specific than level 1 and may be taught by specialized teachers. ISCED97 level 2 usually lasts between 2 and 6 years, and begins around the age of 11. Middle school and junior high (grades 7 through 9) in the United States are classified as level 2 \u2022 At ISCED97 level 3, or upper secondary education, student coursework is generally subject specific and often taught by specialized teachers. Students often enter upper secondary education at the age of 15 or 16 and attend anywhere from 2 to 5 years. ISCED97 level 3 can prepare students for university, other postsecondary education, or the labor force. Senior high school (grades 10 through 12) is considered level 3 in the United States. \u2022 ISCED97 level 4 programs consist of postsecondary nontertiary programs. Postsecondary nontertiary programs are primarily vocational and are taken after the completion of secondary school, though the content is not more advanced than the content of secondary school courses. Although not included in the charts, postsecondary nontertiary programs are described in the text. ISCED97 level 4 programs in the United States are often in the form of 1-year certificate programs \u2022 Tertiary programs 3 are divided into ISCED97 levels 5A, 5B, and 6. ISCED97 level 5A refers to academic higher education below the doctoral level. Level 5A programs are intended to provide sufficient qualifications to gain entry into advanced research programs and professions with high skill requirements. The international classification includes programs of medium length that last less than 5 years and long programs that last 5 to 7 years. In the United States, bachelor's, master's, and first professional degree programs are classified as ISCED97 level 5A. ISCED97 level 5B refers to vocational higher education. Level 5B programs provide a higher level of career and technical education and are designed to prepare students for the labor market. In the international classification, these programs last 2 to 4 years. In the United States, associate's degree programs are classified at this level.

NOTE: All three types of upper secondary school (enseignement professional, technologique, and g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) qualify a student to enter university, although certain tracks are more likely to lead to university: the academic branch (enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) typically leads to university and other forms of higher education; the technological branch (enseignement technologique) may also lead to specialized technological or professional forms of higher education; and the vocational branch (enseignement professional) more often leads to the labor force and/or job training.

However, the purpose of this document is to present a brief, general summary of education in Germany. The sources cited at the end of this section provide more specific details  During the last few years, many L\u00e4nder have decided to focus on combining Hauptschule and Realschule rather than to continue with the separate educational tracks, mainly due to the decrease in the number of pupils. The secondary school that a student in Germany attends is determined by a combination of factors, depending on the L\u00e4nder: admissions tests, previous grade point average, teacher recommendations, and parents' wishes. The degree of flexibility that parents have in choosing which educational track their child enters also varies among L\u00e4nder. However, the type of school that a student attends is sometimes less important than the chosen track: at the end of lower secondary, all students who meet the requirements receive a leaving certificate. At the Hauptschule, it is generally the Hauptschulabschluss. In some L\u00e4nder, students who excel may receive a Qualifizierter Hauptschulabschluss at the end of grade 9. In some L\u00e4nder, students may obtain a Realschulabschluss on completing grade 10. (At the Realschule, students typically receive the Realschulabschluss-also called the Mittlerer Schulabschluss-and at the Gesamtschule, both types of diplomas are offered.) Although regulations differ between L\u00e4nder, most students attending Gymnasium who advance to the upper secondary level automatically receive the Realschulabschluss. Some L\u00e4nder also have an orientation phase during the firs 2 years of lower secondary school, which gives parents and teachers 2 more years to decide a child's educational path. In L\u00e4nder with a 6-year primary school, lower secondary school is 2 years shorter. Upper secondary: \u2022 Common name: General education: Gymnasiale Oberstufe: Academic upper secondary school. Students typically continue from lower secondary Gymnasium or Gesamtschule. Comprises grades 11 to 13 or 10 to 12. Vocational education: Berufsschule: 3-to 4-year vocational school, which regularly includes an apprenticeship; students attend school part time while also doing an apprenticeship. Berufsfachschule: 1-to 3-year full-time specialized vocational school. Fachoberschule: 2-year specialized vocational high school. \u00dcbergangssystem: 1-year prevocational training or basic vocational training year for young people who do not have a training contract, helping them to choose a career and providing them with vocational basic training.   NOTE: In the case of 8-year programs, the main pattern followed is 5 years of primary and 3 years of upper primary education. In the case of 7-year programs, the main pattern is 4 years of primary and 3 years of upper primary education. Common degree programs: \u2022 Polytechnic: 3-year certificate and diploma programs (often technical or engineering) that are offered at the level of both secondary and higher vocational education. Admission requirement is having completed grade 10. \u2022 Bachelor's: 3-year degree programs in arts, commerce, and science; 4-year degree programs in professional fields (e.g., agriculture, dentistry, engineering, pharmacy, technology, and veterinary medicine); 5-year programs in law and architecture; and 5 \u00bd-year programs in medicine. \u2022 Master's: Degree that requires 2 years to attain and can either be coursework-based without a thesis or research alone. \u2022 Master's of Philosophy (MPhil): Predoctoral research program that requires a master's degree for admission. It can either be completely research-based or also include coursework. \u2022 Doctorate: Degree that requires 3 years after the master's degree (or 2 years after the MPhil degree).

GCSEs are at level 2 of the national qualifications framework and provide access to level 3 programs, such as the General Certificate of Education (GCE) Advanced levels (A levels) in the final 2 years of upper secondary education (sixth form). NOTE: For the post-compulsory upper secondary phase, students apply for a specific program at a secondary school, sixth form college, or further education college. Programs that provide access to higher education are at level 3 of the national qualifications framework and include both academic and vocationally oriented programs. There are also training and apprenticeship programs, which incorporate part-time study at a college or with a training provider. GCE A levels form the biggest group of academic programs. They are single-subject qualifications that may be studied in any combination within the limitations of a school's or college's resources. Students typically take three or four subjects in the first year of study to gain the intermediary AS qualification (separately certified) and then continue with three of these subjects to gain full A levels in them after the second year of study. Admission to higher education programs is made on the basis of subjects/grades in A levels (or equivalent qualifications) and subjects/grades at GCSE, together with a personal statement and a confidential reference. Additional admissions tests and interviews are used for a few highly competitive, creative, or care-related course programs, such as teaching and medicine. Common degree programs: \u2022 Certificates of higher education, Higher National Certificate: 1-year program, often with a vocational orientation. \u2022 Foundation degree, Diploma of Higher Education, Higher National Diploma: 2-year program, often with a vocational orientation. \u2022 Bachelor's degree: 3-or 4-year academic programs at colleges or universities: 3-year programs are more common; 4-year programs typically incorporate a placement year. Most programs lead to the award of a degree with honors, graded on a 4-point scale, although \"ordinary\" degrees (i.e., without honors) also exist. An honors degree is an entrance requirement for most graduate programs. \u2022 Advanced short programs: Short programs up to a year in length, for students who have already acquired a bachelor's degree. Some are at the same academic level as a bachelor's degree (e.g., graduate certificates), and some are at the same level as a master's degree (e.g., postgraduate certificates) Programs lead to a professional qualification (for example, the Postgraduate Certificate of Education/Qualified Teacher Status [PGCE/QTS] is for teachers). \u2022 Master's degree: 1 year or more beyond an honors bachelor's degree or a teaching or research postgraduate degree. There are also some 4-year integrated master's degrees in scientific, engineering, and mathematical subjects that span the bachelor's and master's levels. \u2022 Doctorate: Research-oriented postgraduate degree. Minimum of 3 years in duration. NOTE: Training for some professions consists of an undergraduate program leading to a specialist degree recognized by the relevant professional or statutory body. In the case of medicine, this is a 5-year program that spans bachelor's and master's level study, but for historical reasons is titled bachelor's. This is followed by further professional training, but not necessarily by a further academic degree.\nEurydice. (2013).  NOTE: The education system in Scotland is historically separate from the systems in the rest of the United Kingdom. Since devolution in 1999, the education system is the responsibility of the Scottish government. \u2022 Entrance/exit criteria: After 2 years, at the end of S4, students take Standard Grades, a series of single-subject externally certificated qualifications. These are at level 5 of the Scottish credit and qualifications framework and provide access to level 6 programs, such as \"Highers.\" NOTE: For the post-compulsory upper secondary phase, students apply for a specific program at a school or college. Programs that provide access to tertiary programs are at levels 6 and 7 of the Scottish credit and qualifications framework. There are also nationally supported training and apprenticeship programs, which incorporate part-time study at a college or with a training provider. Highers are usually taken in S5, the penultimate year of school or college. They are single-subject qualifications at level 6 of the Scottish credit and qualifications framework that can be studied in any combination within the limits of the school's or college's resources or combined with qualifications at a lower or higher level. It is possible for students to enter university directly from S5 if they have already achieved sufficient success in their Highers; however, most choose to continue at school or college for another year (i.e., in S6). Advanced Highers, which are taken at the end of S6, extend the skills and knowledge gained at the Higher level and are additional qualifications useful for entry into higher education or the workplace. Admission to tertiary programs is made on the basis of subjects/grades at Higher/Advanced Higher (or the equivalent) and subjects/grades at Standard Grade, together with a personal statement and a confidential reference. Additional admissions tests and interviews are used for a few highly competitive, creative, or care-related programs, such as teaching and medicine. A new curriculum for ages 3 to 17 began to be implemented in 2010/11. The Curriculum for Excellence extends the broad general education phase to the end of S3, before learners move on to take qualification programs in S4 to S6. New qualifications to support the Curriculum for Excellence started to replace existing qualifications in August 2 13. Postsecondary and tertiary: Common degree programs: \u2022 Certificates of higher education, Higher National Certificate: 1-year program, often with a vocational orientation. \u2022 Foundation degree, Diploma of Higher Education, Higher National Diploma: 2-year program, often with a vocational orientation. \u2022 Bachelor's degree: 3-or 4-year academic programs at colleges or universities: 3-year programs are more common; 4-year programs typically incorporate a placement year.

Minimum of 3 years in duration. NOTE: Training for some professions consists of an undergraduate program leading to a specialist degree recognized by the relevant professional or statutory body. In the case of medicine, this is a 6-year program that spans the bachelor's and master's level study, but for historical reasons retains the title of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. This is followed by further professional training, but not necessarily by a further academic degree. The Education System in the United States Figure A-  NOTE: There are differences within the education system of the United States because responsibilities and oversight for education take place at the regional or local level. However, the purpose of this document is to present a brief, general summary of education in the United States. The sources cited at the end of this section provide more specific details NOTE: Based on the ISCED97, the 3 years of schooling following primary school are classified as lower secondary in the United States. Students may attend 2-or 3-year junior high schools or middle schools.

Though the Vestibular is the most traditional means to assess students' knowledge gained in secondary school, and some universities still use it, the middle school national exam (Enem) and the secondary school periodic evaluation are other ways for students to enter higher education programs. The Enem is a voluntary examination for those finishing secondary school and is now widely used for students applying to public or private universities. The secondary school periodic evaluation takes place in a progressive manner, with tests taken at the end of each secondary school grade. NOTE: Higher education is provided at two levels of study: graduate and postgraduate. The latter includes both lato sensu (refresher courses, further education, or specialization courses) and stricto sensu (master's and doctoral programs). Higher education is provided by higher education institutes and universities. Highlevel training of professionals for one or more professions or careers is provided mainly by nonuniversity institutions. Universities must promote basic and applied research, as well as provide services to the community in the form of courses and other extension activities.
