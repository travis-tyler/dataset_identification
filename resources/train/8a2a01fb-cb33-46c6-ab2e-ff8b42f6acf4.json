[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "It is not known exactly where amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) fibrils begin to accumulate in individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we showed that abnormal levels of A\u03b242 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be detected before abnormal amyloid can be detected using PET in individuals with preclinical AD. Using these approaches, here we identify the earliest preclinical AD stage in subjects from the ADNI and BioFINDER cohorts. We show that A\u03b2 accumulation preferentially starts in the precuneus, medial orbitofrontal, and posterior cingulate cortices, i.e., several of the core regions of the default mode network (DMN). This early pattern of A\u03b2 accumulation is already evident in individuals with normal A\u03b242 in the CSF and normal amyloid PET who subsequently convert to having abnormal CSF A\u03b242. The earliest A\u03b2 accumulation is further associated with hypoconnectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and the frontoparietal network, but not with brain atrophy or glucose hypometabolism. Our results suggest that A\u03b2 fibrils start to accumulate predominantly within certain parts of the DMN in preclinical AD and already then affect brain connectivity."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "A ccumulation of aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) in the brain is believed to be the first pathological mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 1 . Previous studies have shown that cerebral deposition of A\u03b2 fibrils can occur for decades before an individual with AD reaches the dementia stage 2 . The widespread cerebral distribution of A\u03b2 in later AD stages is wellestablished 3, 4 , however it has been difficult to accurately identify the initial brain regions of A\u03b2 accumulation due to the long time-lag between the start of the pathophysiology and onset of symptoms.\nA neuropathological staging of different A\u03b2 phases in AD has been proposed based on post-mortem examinations and it has been shown that the first phase is characterized by A\u03b2 deposits throughout the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital neocortex 5 . Studies employing positron emission tomography (PET) to visualize fibrillar A\u03b2 deposits have also attempted to identify early A\u03b2-accumulating regions. For example, when analyzing the earliest data from AD mutation-carriers, most cortical areas except for the sensorimotor cortex showed A\u03b2 accumulation as early as 15 years before the expected onset of symptoms 6 . A shortcoming of such studies is the cross-sectional design, which precludes conclusions about longitudinal events. Another issue is that it has previously been difficult to identify the earliest preclinical AD cases; when mixing such cases with later asymptomatic AD cases that have been accumulating A\u03b2 fibrils for years, the cortical sites of accumulation of A\u03b2 identified are widespread.\nIn the present study, we applied a novel methodology of combining data obtained regarding A\u03b2 levels in the brain via PET, and levels of the A\u03b242 peptide in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), to identify individuals who have just recently started to accumulate A\u03b2 in the brain. Previous cross-sectional studies indicate that A\u03b242 levels decrease in the CSF as A\u03b2 starts to accumulate, before fibrillar plaques can be detected with PET [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Recently, this was confirmed longitudinally in a cohort of more than 400 non-demented individuals where we found that those with abnormally low CSF levels of A\u03b242, but with still normal A\u03b2 levels detected by PET (CSF+/PET\u2212), accumulated A\u03b2 fibrils longitudinally at a similar rate as those who had both abnormal CSF levels of A\u03b242 and abnormal levels of A\u03b2 detected by PET (CSF+/PET+) and four times higher than those with normal biomarker results on both parameters (CSF\u2212/PET\u2212) 12 . This indicates that individuals with AD may first be defined as being CSF+/PET\u2212, and then progress to CSF+/PET+. It might therefore be possible to identify the earliest stages of preclinical AD by 186 (52) 234 (27) 165 (23) 136 (22) A-B < 0.001 B-C < 0.001 A-C < 0.001 CSF T-tau (ng/L) 79 (46) 59 (26) 60 (31) 109 (53) A-B = 0.95 B-C < 0.001 A-C < 0.001 CSF P-tau (ng/L) 39 (23) 28 (12) 30 (26) 54 (25) A-B = 0.19 B-C < 0.001 A-C < 0.001 CN cognitively normal, CSF cerebrospinal fluid, CSF+/\u2212 abnormal/normal CSF A\u03b242 levels, MCI mild cognitive impairment, MMSE Mini Mental State Examination, N number of subjects, PET+/\u2212 abnormal/normal florbetapir SUVR, SD standard deviation, SUVR standardized uptake value ratio (using a composite reference region) corrected for partial volume errors. Comparison between nonaccumulators (CSF\u2212/PET\u2212), early A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET\u2212), and late A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET+). Values are given in mean (SD) if not otherwise specified. Groups were compared with Mann-Whitney U statistics if significant after the Kruskal-Wallis test. Significant p values are in bold. The CSF\u2212/PET+group was not included in this table as a separate group since they were not used in any analysis and they were also too few to be used in the group comparisons (n = 5) studying individuals with abnormal CSF A\u03b242 and normal A\u03b2 PET (CSF+/PET\u2212, also referred to as early A\u03b2 accumulators to indicate their stage in the accumulation of A\u03b2).\nThe main hypothesis in the present study was that A\u03b2 fibrils are more prone to start aggregating in certain regions of the brain before they can be found throughout the neocortex, and before neurodegeneration is present. Identifying these regions and examining their properties can provide important information about why A\u03b2 aggregation starts in sporadic AD, which is a crucial step for developing disease-modifying drugs. The aim of the study was therefore to identify such regions by comparing the longitudinal fibrillar A\u03b2 deposition rates in different brain regions of early A\u03b2 accumulators (termed CSF+/PET\u2212) with non-accumulators (termed CSF\u2212/PET\u2212). To avoid bias from non-optimal cut-offs for CSF A\u03b242 levels, we also examined the correlation between continuous CSF A\u03b242 levels and the regional A\u03b2 PET signal in PET negative subjects. We performed the analyses in 68 predefined anatomical regions as well as employing voxelwise statistics. The analyses were performed both in a main cohort and an independent validation cohort. As the main cohort, we used the North American Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and included all non-demented participants with CSF A\u03b242 and longitudinal A\u03b2 PET data (473 individuals). The Swedish BioFINDER study was used as the validation cohort, from which we included all non-demented participants with baseline CSF A\u03b242 and A\u03b2 PET data (406 individuals).\nWe also examined early regional A\u03b2 accumulation in the presumably earliest A\u03b2 accumulators; those with normal CSF A\u03b242 and normal A\u03b2 PET at baseline who converted to abnormal CSF A\u03b242 levels at follow-up but still had a normal A\u03b2 levels identified by PET scan (CSF\u2212/PET to CSF+/PET\u2212). Consistently, using different cohorts and methods, we identified a specific set of early A\u03b2-accumulating regions, which largely corresponded to a functional brain network, the default mode network (DMN). The relationship between early stage A\u03b2 accumulation and wholebrain functional connectivity was examined in detail and revealed that hypoconnectivity, especially within the DMN and between DMN and the frontoparietal network, was associated with low CSF A\u03b242 levels in individuals that still had normal A\u03b2 PET scans.\nTo test the hypothesis that early A\u03b2 accumulation is an upstream mechanism that precedes overtly decreased energy metabolism and cell death, we compared the longitudinal changes in 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the different groups. Finally, we examined the validity of using CSF/PET groups to stratify A\u03b2 stages by comparing early (CSF+/PET\u2212) and late (CSF+/PET+) accumulators to identify known late regions of A\u03b2 accumulation, including the sensorimotor cortex."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": "Experimental outline and baseline characteristics. We first analyzed the longitudinal results from the ADNI cohort, then replicated the result in the BioFINDER cohort and finally analyzed functional connectivity in BioFINDER.\nBaseline characteristics of the ADNI sample and the different CSF/PET groups are provided in Table 1 . Early stage A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET\u2212) had significantly higher prevalence of the APOE \u03b54 genotype and a slightly higher neocortical florbetapir standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), but similar baseline cognition, hippocampal volume, and CSF tau levels as non-accumulators (CSF\u2212/PET\u2212) ( Table 1) . By contrast, the nondemented late stage A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET+) showed, at baseline, signs of neurodegeneration with hippocampal atrophy, higher CSF tau levels and worse cognition, and had per definition significantly increased florbetapir SUVRs (Table 1) .\nIdentifying early A\u03b2-accumulating regions. To identify early A\u03b2 accumulation regions, longitudinal voxelwise comparisons of accumulation rates (SUVR/year) were performed between CSF +/PET\u2212 (early A\u03b2 accumulators) and CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 (non-accumulators). The results are shown in Fig. 1a (see Supplementary  Fig. 1 for whole-brain axial images). The brain regions showing significant increases in A\u03b2 PET signal over time in CSF+/PET\u2212 cases included the medial orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior, and isthmus cingulate cortex, precuneus and to a lesser extent temporal regions. Similar significant regions were identified by correlating CSF A\u03b242 levels with the accumulation rates in PET\u2212 subjects to remove potential biases from the A\u03b242 cut-off (Fig. 1b) . In the region of interest (ROI)-based 6 t 2 a b c Fig. 1 Regions of A\u03b2 accumulation from longitudinal voxelwise analyses in ADNI. a shows the regions where A\u03b2 fibrils start to accumulate by comparing the annual florbetapir SUVR rate during 2 years between early stage A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET\u2212, n = 59) and non-accumulators (CSF\u2212/PET\u2212, n = 218). The lateral and medial projections in a show that the most significantly increased accumulation rate among the early A\u03b2 accumulators was located in the posterior cingulate cortex, the precuneus, and the medial orbitofrontal cortex. A PET-data-derived ROI of these early-accumulating A\u03b2 regions is available at http://biofinder.se b confirms the regions in a without biases from a specific CSF A\u03b242 cut-off. Here, we performed voxelwise correlations between annual florbetapir SUVR rates and CSF A\u03b242 levels in A\u03b2 PET negative individuals (n = 277). To contrast the early stage A\u03b2 regions, c shows the regions with significantly increased annual SUVR rate in late stage A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET+, n = 191) compared with non-accumulators (CSF\u2212/PET\u2212). A widespread pattern of A\u03b2 accumulation is seen in these non-demented CSF+/PET+ subjects. Voxelwise two-sample t-tests were used and all analyses in a-c are adjusted for age and gender. The significant threshold was set at p < 0.001. The red and yellow colors illustrate significant t values according to the scale on the left comparisons, 15 of 68 cortical regions had an increased rate in the CSF+/PET\u2212 subjects compared to the CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 subjects ( Table 2 and Supplementary Movie 1). The significant differences were in agreement with the voxelwise analyses and were mainly seen in the orbitofrontal cortex, precuneus, insula, and the posterior/isthmus cingulate cortex. On average the yearly A\u03b2 accumulation rate of the CSF+/PET\u2212 group was~4-5 times that of the CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 group in the significant brain regions ( Table 2 ). All results were corrected for multiple comparisons and adjusted for gender, age, and time between PET scans. To account for atrophy as a confounding factor, we also adjusted all significant models for the annual change in cortical thickness of each ROI. After this adjustment, all 15 regions still differed significantly between the two groups. The 15 early A\u03b2 regions were also significant when adjusting for diagnosis (MCI or healthy control). Finally, we adjusted for APOE genotype to examine if different early A\u03b2 patterns were observed depending on whether one carried an APOE \u03b54 allele, but the same regions as in Table 2 were found (details shown in Supplementary Table 1 ). The distinct pattern of early A\u03b2 accumulation (Fig. 1a , b, Table 2 ) can be contrasted to the more global A\u03b2 accumulation pattern seen in late, but still non-demented, A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET+) compared with non-accumulators (CSF\u2212/PET\u2212) (Fig. 1c) .\nEarly A\u03b2 accumulating regions in CSF converters. Previous studies have found that non-demented CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 individuals, that during follow-up show abnormal CSF A\u03b242 levels, might represent the earliest preclinical AD phase 13, 14 . We therefore examined CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 subjects who, after 2 years, converted to CSF+/PET\u2212 (referred to as CSF converters). In the ADNI cohort there were 112 CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 subjects with longitudinal CSF data that could be included in this analysis. At follow-up investigation, 11 of these 112 subjects had converted to abnormal CSF A\u03b242 levels (CSF+/PET\u2212) while 101 subjects remained stable with normal CSF A\u03b242 levels (CSF\u2212/PET\u2212). Significant differences in A\u03b2 accumulation rate (A\u03b2 PET SUVR/year) between the two groups were seen in the left posterior cingulate and right medial orbitofrontal cortex (p = 0.02-0.03). The group comparisons were still significant after adjustment of age, gender, and time between PET scans, but probably because of the limited statistical power (n = 11) there were no significant differences after multiple comparison correction. Given the agreement with the previously identified regions (Fig. 1a, b and Table 2 ), we interpreted the identified regions as true and not a statistical type 1 error. For the CSF converters, the SUVR increased significantly with mean rates of +2.3-2.5% per year in the left posterior cingulate cortex and the right medial orbitofrontal cortex. No significant increase was seen in these regions among the non-converters and the corresponding mean rates were +0.3% (95% CI \u22120.24 to +0.90%) and +0.3% (95% CI \u22120.7 to +1.2%).\nA\u03b2 accumulation and functional brain networks. The regional distribution of the early accumulation of cortical A\u03b2 fibrils (Fig. 1a, b) resembled the brain regions involved in the DMN. This led us to examine early accumulation of A\u03b2 fibrils within the different functional brain networks. We applied the early accumulation regions from Fig. 1a to a functional connectivity network atlas 15 in order to determine the involvement of the different networks in early A\u03b2 accumulation. Figure 2 shows that early A\u03b2 accumulation predominantly overlapped with the DMN (Jaccard coefficient, JC, 0.14), but also with the frontoparietal network (JC 0.07). The networks that were the least involved in early A\u03b2 accumulation were the sensorimotor (JC 0.01) and visual networks (JC 0.01). Tables 2 and 3 ). The corresponding voxelwise comparisons between early and late accumulators are shown in Fig. 3 and highlight similar late regions (greatest significant difference in the sensorimotor cortex and parts of the occipital lobe)."}, {"section_title": "Validation of our", "text": "Atrophy and glucose metabolism in relation to A\u03b2 accumulation. To test the hypothesis that atrophy, as a marker of neuronal and synaptic degeneration, starts after the initiation of A\u03b2 accumulation, we compared the longitudinal change in gray matter (GM) volumes between the CSF/PET groups using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis ( Replication of the early A\u03b2 regions in the BioFINDER cohort.\nTo test the generalizability of our results we replicated the early A\u03b2 accumulation regions in the BioFINDER cohort. Only crosssectional data was available from the BioFINDER study. Although longitudinal comparisons are preferred given our hypothesis, regional differences in A\u03b2 deposition should still be noticeable when comparing CSF+/PET\u2212 and CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 subjects crosssectionally. A strength of this cohort is that another A\u03b2 PET ligand ( 18 F -flutemetamol) as well as another immunoassay for CSF A\u03b2 (INNOTEST) were used, and the results would therefore be more generalizable if they were replicable in this cohort. The characteristics of BioFINDER is provided in Supplementary Table 2 . Similar early A\u03b2 accumulation regions were identified as in ADNI when comparing cross-sectional 18 F-flutemetamol SUVRs between CSF+/PET\u2212 and CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 subjects using ROI-based analyses in BioFINDER (Supplementary Table 3 ). The most significant regions were found in the orbitofrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the precuneus (Supplementary  Table 3 , which can be compared with ADNI data in Table 2 ). Further, the cross-sectional voxelwise comparisons between CSF +/PET\u2212 and CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 subjects in BioFINDER showed significant changes predominantly in the orbitofrontal cortex and posterior cingulate similar to the longitudinal analyses in ADNI ( Early A\u03b2 accumulation and functional connectivity. Restingstate functional MRI was available in the BioFINDER study and this cohort was therefore used for this analysis. To examine the association between early A\u03b2 accumulation and functional networks beyond the anatomical similarities ( Fig. 2) we correlated levels of CSF A\u03b242 with whole-brain connectivity (Fig. 6 ). The groups of interest were the early A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET\u2212) and biomarker normal individuals with close to abnormal CSF A\u03b242 (CSF-low /PET\u2212). In the CSF+/PET\u2212 group we found a significant network component where reduced connectivity was associated with decreasing levels of CSF A\u03b242. The component predominantly consisted of intra-DMN links, but also links between the DMN and the frontoparietal network (Fig. 6a) . The summed connectivity on the significant correlation component changed most drastically when CSF A\u03b242 levels were closer to the cut-off (400-516 ng/L for the INNOTEST ELISA) and seemed to reach a floor effect as A\u03b242 reached levels of around 350 ng/L. (Fig. 6b) . Interestingly, the correlation was in the opposite direction showing an increased connectivity as CSF A\u03b242 levels dropped from normal levels towards the abnormal cut-off. In summary, Fig. 6 indicates that when CSF A\u03b242 levels drop within the near abnormal range they might be associated with an increased connectivity in connections involving the DMN. Then, when CSF A\u03b242 levels become abnormal and decrease further as A\u03b2 accumulates, they are instead clearly associated with a decreased connectivity within the DMN and mainly between the DMN and the frontoparietal network. The associations with hypoconnectivity and hyperconnectivity were similar when adjusting for CSF P-tau and T-tau, indicating the independent effect of A\u03b2 on the connectivity ( Supplementary  Fig. 3 )."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study examined where A\u03b2 fibrils are more prone to start accumulating, by comparing the longitudinal outcome of nondemented subjects with early signs of A\u03b2 accumulation (CSF +/PET\u2212) to those with no measurable signs of A\u03b2 accumulation (CSF\u2212/PET\u2212), in a large cohort of 473 subjects. The results showed significantly increased rates of A\u03b2 fibril accumulation predominantly in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex in this early A\u03b2 stage. When examining subjects with even earlier signs of A\u03b2 accumulation (CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 subjects who converted to CSF+/PET\u2212 within 2 years), significantly increased A\u03b2 fibril accumulation rate was again seen in the medial orbitofrontal and posterior cingulate cortex, compared with stable CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 subjects. These regions were replicated in an independent cohort (n = 406). To our knowledge, this is the A significantly increased SUVR rate is seen in the sensorimotor cortex, occipital lobe, and dorsal temporal lobe in late compared with early A\u03b2 accumulators. Voxelwise two-sample ttests were used and all comparisons were adjusted for age and gender. The significance threshold was set at p < 0.001. The red and yellow colors illustrate significant t values according to the scale on the left first study to identify a group of early stage A\u03b2 accumulators and detect increased A\u03b2 accumulation rates specifically in these regions using longitudinal data. Previous longitudinal studies have either failed to detect an early increase in regional A\u03b2 deposition 16 or identified a rather large early stage A\u03b2 region including the posterior temporal, inferior parietal, posterior cingulate, precuneus, and occipital areas 4 . Those previous results indicate that there might have been methodological issues in correctly identifying the preclinical AD cases who have just started to accumulate A\u03b2. There are a few previous studies where cross-sectional results have been used to approximate early stage A\u03b2 accumulation regions. In a subanalysis of a study aimed to identify different A\u03b2 PET cut-offs, voxelwise comparisons were made between a reference group with very low A\u03b2 PET SUVR (n = 22) and several groups of subjects (n = 22 in each group) with increasingly higher global SUVRs 17 . They found that the first significant SUVR differences between the controls and a group with sub-threshold SUVRs were located in the medial frontal cortex and the precuneus, similar to our early A\u03b2 regions. Another cross-sectional study used a different methodology to approximate the cortical spread of A\u03b2 in 67 healthy controls and 128 patients with MCI or AD dementia 18 . By assuming that earlier regions would show increased A\u03b2 PET signal in a greater number of subjects, they found an initial A\u03b2 region involving the areas in Fig. 1a , but also affecting middle and inferior temporal regions, and superior and middle frontal regions. In neuropathological studies, the results are mixed. One study reported that the presumably first A\u03b2 phase had A\u03b2 deposits throughout the neocortex 5 , while a prior publication by Braak & Braak 19 showed an early pattern of A\u03b2 deposits in the basal parts of the medial and anterior regions of the prefrontal cortex, and the basal anterior temporal lobe. The differences are probably partly explained by the different staining methods and their affinity to different A\u03b2 forms (discussed in the methodological aspects below). A clear advantage of the present study is that longitudinal A\u03b2 changes in the whole brain has been analyzed, instead of cross-sectional examinations in predetermined regions as in neuropathological studies.\nThe early A\u03b2 regions we identified were mainly located within the DMN (Fig. 2) . The DMN has a core network located in the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortex 20 . It is almost always active, but increasingly so during daydreaming, activation of episodic memory and other internally directed activities and decreasingly during task-based activities and interaction with the external environment 21, 22 . A certain overlap between the DMN and the distribution of A\u03b2 fibrils in AD has also been noted in previous publications [23] [24] [25] [26] . The cause of A\u03b2 aggregation within the DMN is currently unknown. One explanation is that the deposition of A\u03b2 fibrils could be caused by the high neuronal activity within the DMN, which is supported by animal studies showing that A\u03b2 secretion and deposition is enhanced by neuronal activity [27] [28] [29] . An alternative explanation is that A\u03b2 accumulation is caused by the high metabolic demand and metabolic stress in these neurons (high energy consumption (Fig. 1a, b) . Note that the BioFINDER analysis included cross-sectional data and fewer subjects compared to ADNI, which results in less statistical power. Voxelwise two-sample t-test was used. The significance threshold was set at p < 0.001 and the comparison was adjusted for age and gender. and frequent fluctuations in activation and deactivation) and not the neuronal activation per se 30 . Although the core DMN was the most prominent network that we found that had anatomical overlap with the early A\u03b2 regions, we want to point out that involvement of other networks was also evident in the early A\u03b2 accumulation, especially the frontoparietal network (Fig. 2) . This indicates that early stage accumulation is not related to a unique feature of the DMN, but in a more general sense to hubs in the brain with high connectivity. This interpretation is supported by previous studies showing an association between A\u03b2 distribution and several networks and network hubs 25, 31, 32 .\nThe association between functional networks and earliest stages of A\u03b2 accumulation was further examined using functional connectivity analyses in BioFINDER. When we correlated wholebrain functional connectivity and CSF A\u03b242 levels in the early stage A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET\u2212), we found a decreased connectivity in intra-DMN connections and between DMN and the frontoparietal network as CSF A\u03b242 decreased (Fig. 6a) . The disruption of these connections in BioFINDER is especially interesting given the distribution of early A\u03b2 fibrils in ADNI in the DMN and frontoparietal networks (Fig. 2) . This correlation between the disruption of functional connectivity and A\u03b2 pathology has recently been described in AD 32, 33 , but to our knowledge the present study is the first to show that this association is present already at the very earliest preclinical stages of AD when A\u03b2 fibrils are just starting to accumulate. In our second connectivity analysis (Fig. 6b) we examined the correlation between functional connectivity and CSF A\u03b242 in those with indications of very early A\u03b2 accumulation (close to abnormal CSF A\u03b242 and normal A\u03b2 PET; CSF-low /PET\u2212). The results indicate that when A\u03b242 drops towards abnormal levels in the CSF the connectivity instead increases in similar DMN-related connections in which there was a positive correlation between decreased connectivity and decreasing levels of CSF A\u03b242 within the abnormal A\u03b242 range (compare connectograms in Fig. 4a, b) . Interpretations of this preliminary finding are speculative, but it might be that cortical hubs like the medial frontal lobe and posterior cingulate exhibit increased activity before A\u03b2 fibrilcontaining senile plaques are formed in preclinical AD. This is supported by experimental cell and animal work suggesting that neural activity leads to increased A\u03b2 generation and secretion 27, 34 . Later, the hypoconnectivity might develop when A\u03b2 fibrils starts accumulating and causes neuronal dysfunction. Alternatively, early and soluble A\u03b2 oligomers might instead trigger the initial hyperactivity, which is supported by studies in refer to Spearman correlation between summed connectivity and CSF A\u03b242 levels. Age, gender, and APOE \u03b54 status was controlled for by partial correlation. Network components correlating with CSF A\u03b242 were calculated using a method similar to the NBS algorithm (see \"Methods for the BioFINDER study\" for statistical details). Acronyms: BG basal ganglia, CSF-low normal CSF A\u03b242 levels close to the abnormal cut-off (517-750 ng/L), DA dorsal attention, DM default mode, FP frontoparietal, FT frontotemporal, HI hippocampus, QC quality control, SM sensorimotor, VA ventral attention, VI visual network transgenic AD models suggesting that neurons become hyperactive very early, independently of the deposition of A\u03b2 into plaques, and that the silencing of neurons emerges only later in the disease course 35 . Although altered functional connectivity was found already in the early A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET\u2212), our longitudinal analyses (Fig. 4a, c) showed that no changes in glucose metabolism or atrophy were present at this stage. However, decreased temporoparietal glucose metabolism and atrophy was observed in the late A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET+; Fig. 4b, d and Supplementary  Fig. 2A, B) . This finding can have practical implications for the enrollment in anti-A\u03b2 clinical trials since anti-A\u03b2 agents should be introduced after A\u03b2 accumulation has started but before neurodegeneration is present. This should make CSF+/PET\u2212 subjects suitable for inclusion in clinical trials, especially if the drug is intended to target A\u03b2 accumulation over long time periods using AD biomarkers as outcomes of its efficacy in this preclinical disease stage.\nThe temporal sequence of A\u03b2 accumulation preceding neurodegeneration confirms the most acknowledged hypothetical model on the development of AD 1 . It also strengthens the rationale for using CSF/PET groups as proxies for A\u03b2 stages in AD. To further validate the use of CSF/PET groups, we compared A\u03b2 accumulation in our proxy group for early A\u03b2 accumulation (CSF+/PET\u2212) with the proxy group for late A\u03b2 accumulation (CSF+/PET+). As hypothesized, we identified known regions of late stage A\u03b2 accumulation, including the sensorimotor cortex and occipital lobe (Fig. 3 , Supplementary Movie 2 and Table 3 ) 3, 19 . In a recent study, we also showed that CSF+/PET\u2212 subjects accumulated A\u03b2 at a similar rate as CSF+/PET+ subjects and about four times higher than CSF\u2212/PET\u2212 subjects 12 . The high accumulation rate in CSF+/PET\u2212 subjects was not accompanied by cognitive decline, but we found a subtle decline in memory over 5 years in CSF+/PET+ subjects that further validates the use of CSF/PET groups for stratifying A\u03b2 stages. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that CSF+/PET\u2212 subjects are not all early A\u03b2 accumulators since this state also can be caused by CSF analytical factors, failed PET scans, and medical conditions other than AD [36] [37] [38] .\nAs part of our methodology we chose to primarily compare longitudinal changes between the CSF/PET groups instead of comparing cross-sectional values or just within-group changes to the identify the early A\u03b2 regions. This had the advantage of accounting for physiological differences in A\u03b2 burden, age-related non-specific A\u03b2 accumulation rates, and the fact that the individuals within each CSF/PET stage had reached slightly different time points in the disease progression. In addition, the early A\u03b2-accumulating brain regions remained significant when adjusting for confounding factors such as longitudinal changes in cortical thickness, APOE genotype and clinical status. These adjustments show that the results were not confounded by differences in atrophy between the groups or differences between healthy controls and MCI subjects (discussed further in the Methods section). It should be noted that the early A\u03b2 regions are derived from group analyses, which show where A\u03b2 is prone to start accumulating but they do not exclude the possibility that the accumulation might start in other regions in some individuals.\nA limitation of our early A\u03b2 regions is that they have been identified using PET ligands that bind to primarily dense-core A\u03b2 aggregates and to a lesser extent or not at all to diffuse plaques 39, 40 . We can therefore not pinpoint the exact A\u03b2 forms within the early A\u03b2 regions, neither can we say if A\u03b2 aggregates not detected by PET are present in other areas of the brain at this early stage. Future PET ligands that binds to different forms, e.g., A\u03b2 protofibrils, might reveal a different early A\u03b2 pattern 41 . The binding affinity of current PET ligands could explain some of the differences with neuropathological studies that either use silver technique 19 , which stain not only A\u03b2 but also tau, or anti-A\u03b2 antibodies 5 that bind to specific A\u03b2 epitopes and stain different A\u03b2 forms. Nonetheless, a strength of the methodology is that we could detect similar early A\u03b2 regions in two different cohorts using two different types of PET ligands; 18 F-florbetapir (a stilbene compound) and 18 F-flutemetamol (an 18 F-labeled analog of 11 C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) derived from thioflavin T) 40 . The cut-offs for the two PET ligands were established separately in each cohort, and the data were not pooled in the analyses, nor were the groups compared to each other. We therefore chose to not transform SUVR into a standardized scale such as centiloid units 42 .\nTo conclude, we believe that the identified early A\u03b2 regions can have several important implications. These brain regions give a pathophysiological insight into where A\u03b2 fibril accumulation is prone to start in AD and its relationship to functional networks and their connectivity. Our data indicated that A\u03b2 starts accumulating before overt metabolic changes or atrophy, and that hypoconnectivity within the early A\u03b2-accumulating regions has already occurred when A\u03b2 fibrils just starts to accumulate. The most prominent early A\u03b2-accumulating regions were the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and the medial orbitofrontal cortex, possibly with an overlap to the anterior cingulate. Based on our results, future studies should be able to examine early unique pathophysiological events and triggering mechanisms of A\u03b2 accumulation by comparing molecular and physiological properties of the early-accumulating regions to lateraccumulating regions. These early-accumulating A\u03b2 regions should also be advantageous to use in an A\u03b2 PET composite ROI to better assess early fibrillar A\u03b2 deposition (available at http:// biofinder.se), which can have practical implications for early AD diagnostics, A\u03b2 staging and enrollment in clinical trials that target A\u03b2 accumulation."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": "Study data. Longitudinal data from the ADNI were used for all the statistical analyses in the study, except for replicating the finding of early A\u03b2 accumulating regions and for the functional connectivity analyses for which data from the Swedish BioFINDER study were used. The methodology described in the next sections refers only to analyses performed in the ADNI cohort. Methodology referring to analyses in the BioFINDER cohort is described separately under Methods for the BioFINDER study.\nParticipants. Only non-demented individuals were included in this study (characterized as either cognitively normal or diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, MCI). Demented subjects were excluded since the study aim was to identify early AD pathology. We chose to include MCI subjects in addition to healthy controls since the cognitive impairment did not necessarily have to be caused by an underlying AD process and because about a third of MCI subjects have shown to be incorrectly diagnosed with cognitive impairment [43] [44] [45] . We also attempted to include a range of different pre-dementia AD phases for a better staging of late A\u03b2 accumulators, early A\u03b2 accumulators and non-accumulators. To account for this inclusion the models were adjusted for clinical status (MCI/healthy control) in subanalyses. The specific inclusion/exclusion criteria for the ADNI cohort can be found at http://www.adni-info.org. Briefly, all subjects were enrolled from the ADNI-2 study, were between the ages of 55 and 90 years, were fluent in Spanish or English, had completed at least six years of education, had a Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE) of \u226524 46 , and were free of any significant neurologic disease other than AD. Subjects classified as cognitively normal (n = 176) had a Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) score of 0 47 . MCI (n = 297) was defined as having preserved activities of daily living, absence of dementia, and an objective cognitive impairment as shown on the delayed recall test of the Wechsler Memory Scale -Logical Memory II as well as a CDR score of 0.5. Only subjects with a complete set of baseline and follow-up A\u03b2 PET scans and baseline CSF A\u03b242 data were included. Our study baseline was defined as the first visit where both CSF and PET data were available. Study subjects gave written informed consent and the study was approved by each participating site's Institutional Review Board.\nImage acquisition. For MRI, 3 Tesla scanners were used. High-resolution 3D T1-weighted images were acquired for volumetric measures, anatomical segmentation, NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/s41467-017-01150-x ARTICLE and template normalization using an MPRAGE sequence (for details, see ref. 48 ). Fibrillar A\u03b2 pathology was measured using the PET ligand 18 F-florbetapir. Image data were acquired 50-70 minutes post-injection (see http://adni.loni.usc.edu/wpcontent/uploads/2010/05/ADNI2_PET_Tech_Manual_0142011.pdf). Glucose metabolism was measured employing FDG PET with images acquired 30-60 min post-injection. Florbetapir PET, FDG PET, and MR images from baseline and the 2-year follow-up visit were downloaded from the LONI database (http://ida.loni. usc.edu) and further processed locally. Longitudinal 18 F-florbetapir was available in all subjects, longitudinal MRI in 468 subjects (218 CSF\u2212/PET\u2212, 59 CSF+/PET\u2212, and 191 CSF+/PET+), and longitudinal FDG PET in 318 subjects (153 CSF\u2212/PET\u2212, 41 CSF+/PET\u2212, and 124 CSF+/PET+).\nImage processing. The motion corrected PET data was time-averaged and rigidly aligned with the anatomical MRI scan. SUVR were then calculated by normalizing to averages of appropriate reference regions. For florbetapir, the reference region consisted of the whole cerebellum, the pons/brainstem region, and eroded cortical white matter as this composite region has produced more reliable results in longitudinal analyses 49 . For FDG, a composite region comprising vermis/cerebellum superior to the horizontal fissure and pons were used as reference region 50 . Freesurfer version 5.3 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu; Desikan-Killiany Atlas) segmentations of the structural MR images were applied to extract SUVRs from 68 predefined ROIs. Partial volume error (PVE) correction was performed for florbetapir SUVRs with the geometric transfer matrix (GTM) method 51 using Freesurfer segmented regions 52 (all florbetapir results shown in the tables and figures are from PVE corrected data).\nThe MRI volumes were further normalized to MNI152 standard space 53 using a nonlinear diffeomorphic transformation 54 enabling motion and PVE voxelwise 55 corrected SUVRs to be transformed to MNI standard space for voxelwise analyses. VBM as implemented in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) version 12 (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK; http://www.fil.ion. ucl.ac.uk/spm) was used to evaluate GM intensity as a measure of atrophy. All individual T1-weighted MR images were segmented into tissue classes using SPM's unified segmentation algorithm. The GM segmentations were subsequently warped into a common MNI152 standard space using a cohort-specific template and the SPM Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) toolbox and Jacobian scaled to estimate GM intensity. The resulting maps were smoothed with 8 mm full-width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. Intracranial volume (ICV) was calculated by summating the volumes of GM, white matter, and CSF based on the SPM tissue segmentations. Using the corrected SUVRs in standardized space, we also proceeded to calculate summed values within the functional MRI (fMRI) resting-state networks enumerated in the low resolution atlases with seven networks calculated by Yeo et al. (see details below) 15 .\nFlorbetapir and FDG PET images were co-registered to their respective MRI and subsequently warped into a common MNI152 space using the transformation information derived from warping the MRI scans. To assess changes over time in GM intensity (MRI), amyloid accumulation (florbetapir PET), and glucose metabolism (FDG PET) between baseline and follow-up examinations, parametric change maps were created. For longitudinal VBM, a midpoint average MRI was created for each subject based on the baseline and follow-up images using SPM12, resulting in Jacobian determinant maps showing local volumetric change between baseline and follow-up for each subject. Midpoint average images were GMsegmented and subsequently used to create a DARTEL template that was affinetransformed to the common MNI152 space. Midpoint average GM segmentations were multiplied by the Jacobian maps to create individual GM change maps, which were warped to the MNI-transformed DARTEL template and smoothed by an 8 mm FWHM isotropic Gaussian kernel to create longitudinal change maps. A GM mask was created using the same approach as for the cross-sectional data (see above). The florbetapir and FDG change maps were created using the warped images and FSL (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk) according to the equation SUVR change \u00bc \u00f0PET image followup \u00c0 PETimage baseline \u00de=years between scans CSF biomarkers. CSF A\u03b242, total tau (T-tau), and tau phosphorylated at Thr181 (P-tau) were measured using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX, USA) with the INNOBIA AlzBio3 kit (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) 56, 57 . Data was combined from the available online files \"UPENN-BIOMK8.csv\", \"UPENNBIOMK7.csv, \"UPENNBIOMK6_07_02_13.csv\", and \"UPENNBIOMK5_10_31_13.csv\". Only cross-sectional CSF data from baseline were used in the analyses (n = 473), except for the analysis of \"CSF converters\" where longitudinal 2-year data was used (n = 112). In the case of one subject with stable A\u03b242 levels, only 3-year follow-up data was available. The mean difference between baseline CSF sampling and the florbetapir PET scan was 9.6 days (ranging from 0 to 110 days).\nGroup classifications. All subjects were categorized into different groups according to their CSF A\u03b242 and A\u03b2 PET status. The following groups were derived from the baseline results: (1) normal CSF A\u03b242 and A\u03b2 PET (CSF\u2212/PET\u2212) referred to as non-accumulators (n = 218), (2) abnormal CSF A\u03b242 and normal A\u03b2 PET (CSF+/PET\u2212) referred to as early A\u03b2 accumulators (n = 59), and (3) abnormal CSF A\u03b242 and A\u03b2 PET (CSF+/PET+) referred to as late A\u03b2 accumulators (n = 191). Those with normal CSF A\u03b242 and abnormal A\u03b2 PET were not used in any analysis (n = 5). Abnormal CSF A\u03b242 values were defined using the previously established cut-off of <192 ng/L [57] [58] [59] . The cut-off for abnormal A\u03b2 PET SUVR was determined using a mixture modeling analysis since no previous cut-off had been established for PVE corrected florbetapir data in ADNI (using the GTM method). Mixture modeling statistics provide an unbiased threshold for abnormality (i.e., the diagnosis or status is not used in analysis) and it is a well-established method for defining A\u03b2 PET cut-offs 12, 17, 60, 61 . To achieve a robust threshold we derived the cut-off from a larger ADNI sample (n = 663, all non-demented subjects with CSF and A\u03b2 PET data). This resulted in a cut-off of >0.872 SUVR for an abnormal A\u03b2 PET using PVE correction and the composite reference region.\nMethods for the BioFINDER study. The Swedish BioFINDER study was used for replicating the main results from ADNI and for the functional connectivity analyses. BioFINDER is a prospective study that focuses on identifying key mechanisms and improvement of diagnostics in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. For details about study design, methods, and specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, see http://biofinder.se. The study was approved by the ethical review board in Lund, Sweden, and all participants gave their written informed consent. All nondemented individuals with CSF and A\u03b2 PET data were selected for this study. This resulted in a cohort consisting of cognitively healthy elderly subjects (n = 138) and consecutively recruited patients who had been referred to memory clinics due to cognitive complaints (n = 268). The PET ligand 18 F-flutemetamol was used for A\u03b2 PET, and images were acquired 90-110 min post-injection. The PET scanning procedures have been described previously 60 . CSF A\u03b242 and P-tau were analyzed with INNOTEST ELISAs (Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, Belgium) and T-tau with EUROIMMUN ELISAs (EUROIMMUN AG, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) as previously described 60, 62 . Mixture modeling was performed in the sample to determine the cut-offs for abnormal CSF A\u03b242 (<517 ng/L) and abnormal A\u03b2 PET (>0.759 SUVR). Only baseline data was available for analysis in the BioFINDER cohort.\nImaging was performed on a 3 Tesla Siemens Tim Trio scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The high-resolution 3D T1-weighted volume used for segmentation and normalization was acquired using an MPRAGE sequence (in-plane resolution = 1 \u00d7 1 mm 2 , slice thickness = 1.2 mm, TR = 1950 ms, TE = 3.37 ms, flip-angle = 9\u00b0). Spontaneous BOLD oscillations in the absence of external stimuli were imaged with a gradient-echo planar sequence (eyes closed, in-plane resolution = 3 \u00d7 3 mm 2 , slice thickness = 3mm, TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip-angle = 90\u00b0, 180 dynamic scans, 6 min).\nResting-state data preprocessing was performed with a pipeline composed of FSL 63 , AFNI 64 , and ANTS 65 . Anatomical processing involved skull stripping, segmentation of white matter (WM)/GM/CSF and normalization to MNI152-space 53 . Dropping the first five frames in anticipation of steady state, functional data was bulk motion, and slice timing corrected, furthermore nuisance regressed using the WM/CSF average signal, 6 components of physiological noise 66 , 24 motion parameters 67 , and linear/quadratic trends. Finally, the functional data was transformed to MNI space. Frames causing outliers in total frame-to-frame signal variation were censored, on average constituting 4% of the fMRI series 68 . The signal was band-pass filtered to 0.01-0.1 Hz, further discriminating against scanner drift and physiological noise. No spatial smoothing was applied.\nSubjects with a mean/maximum frame-wise displacement 29, 69 exceeding 0.6/ 3.0 mm were excluded. As an extra precautionary step, the voxel-to-voxel BOLDsignal correlations across the whole brain (including GM, WM, and CSF) was calculated and summed. Outliers in this measure likely originate in a motioninduced global signal confound capable of eluding conventional motion estimation 70 and were removed.\nThe processed fMRI data was resampled using trilinear interpolation to 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 mm 3 resolution and masked with GM derived from a cortical resting-state network atlas 71 and Harvard-Oxford subcortical atlas 72 . Fisher-z transformed Pearson correlation between the resulting 5071 GM voxel time series then yielded a measure of functional connectivity (FC), corresponding to a weighted graph with nodes (voxels) and links (voxel BOLD time series correlations).\nNetwork components correlating with CSF A\u03b242 were calculated using a method similar to the NBS algorithm 73 . We calculated the largest network component C (defined as a connected set of links), for which r ij > r 0 , where r ij is the Spearman correlation over all subjects between CSF A\u03b242 and z ij for the link between voxel i and j (Fisher z-transformed voxel BOLD time-series correlation), and r 0 controls the component size and significance level of constituent links. We chose r 0 corresponding to approximately p = 0.001 given the number of subjects in the calculation. Component size was then defined as the sum of all r ij \u03f5C multiplied by the Spearman correlation of the sum of all z-values in the component and CSF levels. This last step allows for reasonable and natural variations on the extracted component. The component size was compared to a permutation-generated null distribution of sizes, thus controlling for the family-wise error rate in the weak sense at \u03b1 = 0.05 The result of the algorithm is a network component on which sum of z-scores correlates significantly higher than for randomized sets of subject FC-CSF pairs. Age, gender and APOE \u03b54 status was controlled for by partial correlation.\nIn order to simplify the analysis of network components, we grouped nodes using a resting-state network atlas 71 containing: default mode, dorsal and ventral attention, sensory motor, visual, fronto-parietal, and fronto-temporal (medial temporal lobe/orbitofrontal cortex). To this set of labels we added two anatomically defined subcortical structures from the Harvard-Oxford atlas 72 : the Basal Ganglia (BG: thalamus, caudate, putamen and pallidum) and hippocampus/amygdala (HI). Note that the permutation-based approach generates p values for the network component as a whole, but since these are too large and complex to visualize, a network-based break up is necessary.\nOnly A\u03b2 PET negative subjects were used in the connectivity analysis. In addition to the previously described group of early A\u03b2 accumulators (CSF+/PET\u2212, n = 23 after fMRI quality control) we also defined a group of biomarker negative subjects with indications of very early A\u03b2 accumulation (n = 80). Those with low levels of CSF A\u03b242, but still within the normal range, have a high risk of becoming abnormal within the next couple of years 13 , which suggests that sub-threshold CSF A\u03b242 levels indicate very early A\u03b2 accumulation. This group was characterized as A\u03b2 PET negative with CSF A\u03b242 between 517-750 \u03bcg/mL (CSF\u2212 low /PET\u2212).\nStatistical analysis. Group comparisons of baseline characteristics (Table 1 and  Supplementary Table 2 ) was performed with Mann-Whitney U statistics if significant after the Kruskal-Wallis test. For ROI analyses, full factorial general linear models were used to analyze group differences and correlations of the 68 available cortical Freesurfer ROIs from the Desikan-Killiany Atlas. The dependent variable was A\u03b2 accumulation rate ([SUVR at follow-up -SUVR at baseline]/years between baseline and follow-up) in ADNI and baseline A\u03b2 PET SUVR in BioFINDER. The variance of the SUVRs were similar in each group. All results were adjusted for gender and age and, in the longitudinal analyses, time between A\u03b2 PET examinations. We also performed additional analyses adjusting for changes in cortical thickness over 2 years in each ROI and clinical status (healthy control/MCI) in addition to the above covariates. Longitudinal changes within a specific group of subjects were analyzed with the Paired T-test. Because of the limited number of subjects in the subanalysis of \"CSF converters\" (n = 11), we primarily used nonparametric statistics for this subgroup (the Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed rank test). To control for multiple testing in the ROI-based analyses we used the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with a conservative false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 (not to be confused with a p value of 0.05) 74 . Original p values are presented for the ROI-based analyses but are only reported as significant if they are significant after the FDR correction. The effect size of the significant results when comparing the CSF/PET groups are given in % annual increase of SUVR (yearly SUVR change divided by SUVR at baseline) for an easier comparison between different PET ligands and brain regions (and when comparing the results to other studies that use different reference regions). However, statistical significances were determined using actual SUVR or SUVR/year data. SPM12 was used for all voxelwise analyses. We employed voxelwise two-sample t-test and multiple regressions using age, gender, and ICV (for analyses involving VBM data) as covariates. All images had been transformed into common MNI space by using transformation measures from warping the co-registered MRI scans to the 2 mm MNI152 MRI template and smoothed with an 8 mm FWHM kernel. The resulting t-maps were thresholded to present results with a p < 0.001 height, uncorrected for family-wise error, and a k > 100 voxels cluster extent. For the resting-state correlation analysis, a component (consisting a connected set of links correlating with CSF biomarker levels above a p = 0.001 threshold) was assigned a p value as a whole based on the component size relative a permutation-generated null distribution, thus correcting for family-wise cerror in the weak sense (see \"Methods for the BioFINDER study\" for details). Finite mixture models for establishing biomarker cut-offs were performed with the package \"mixtools\" in R version 3.2.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria, 2013). FDR correction of multiple comparisons was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg formula in an Excel sheet (Microsoft Excel for Mac, 2011, version 14.4). All other statistical analyses were performed with SPSS for Mac, version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).\nData availability. MRI and PET images were downloaded online at https://ida. loni.usc.edu and further processed locally (see Image Processing above). All other ADNI data were also downloaded from the same site. BioFINDER data and processed ADNI data are not publicly available for download, but might be retrieved from the principal investigator Oskar Hansson.
