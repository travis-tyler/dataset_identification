[{"section_title": "I. Introduction", "text": "The Immigration and Nationality Act provides two types of \"nonimmigrant\" (i.e., nonpermanent) visas for persons wishing to study in the United States. The \"F-1\" visa is for academic studies, and the \"M-1\" visa is for vocational studies. The number of visas issued to foreign students increased greatly in recent decades. In 1980, 155.0 thousand foreigners were granted temporary visas to study in the United States. By 2000, the number of student visas totaled 315.4 thousand, with the bulk of the visas (98.0 percent) being granted to persons enrolled in academic programs. As a result of the increasing number of visas granted to foreign students, the ethnic composition of students in higher education has changed dramatically, particularly at the graduate level. The share of nonresident aliens enrolled in graduate programs rose from 5.5 percent in 1976 to 12.4 percent in 1999. 1 The impact is even greater in some educational programs. For example, nonresident aliens receive a disproportionately high share of the doctoral degrees awarded in the physical sciences (38.2 percent of all doctorates awarded in 1999-2000), engineering (52.1 percent), the life sciences (26.6 percent), and the social sciences (22.8 percent). In contrast, nonresident aliens received only 9.2 percent of the doctorates awarded in education. 2 Despite the dramatic impact of foreign students on the higher education sector, it seems that the program has grown with little systematic thinking on whether such a large-scale visa program is beneficial. Remarkably, there has been practically no research analyzing the costs and benefits of foreign students. We know almost nothing about their impact on the higher education system, their impact on the U.S. labor market, and their impact on the economies of the source countries. In contrast to the voluminous literature that analyzes the labor market consequences of immigration, there has not been any analysis of the impact of foreign students on the educational opportunities available to native persons, of the trends in the quality of foreign students, of the selection process that determine which foreign students remain in the country after completing their education, and of the costs and benefits that the increased diversity (as well as the ample availability of low-wage foreign teaching and research assistants) imparts on universities. 3 This paper begins the process of examining some of the consequences of the foreign student program. In particular, it investigates how the rapid growth in the number of foreign students enrolled in graduate programs affected native enrollment in those programs. If the number of slots in graduate programs were fixed, any increase in the number of foreign students would crowd out natives who would presumably have filled those positions. Even if the graduate programs were expanding, an increase in the supply of foreign students might sufficiently alter 2 U.S. Department of Education (2002), Table 275. 3 The exceptions mainly include studies that examine how foreign-born teaching assistants affect the educational outcomes experienced by native-born undergraduates; see Borjas (2000), Fleisher, Hashimoto, and Weinberg (2002), and Jacobs and Friedman (1988). I will discuss other research more directly related to this paper in the next section. incentives for natives to pursue some programs, particularly if many foreign students stay in the United States and reduce economic opportunities in some occupations. I analyze these questions using graduate enrollment data drawn from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) as well as data on doctoral degrees awarded from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED). On aggregate, the analysis shows that there is little evidence of a crowdout effect for the typical native. This result, however, masks a great deal of variation within the native population. In particular, the impact of foreign students on native educational outcomes differs dramatically across ethnic groups and between native men and women. The evidence reported below documents a strong negative correlation between increases in the number of foreign students enrolled at a particular university and the number of white native men enrolled in that university's graduate program. Similarly, the data reveal a significant negative correlation between the number of doctoral degrees awarded to foreign students by a particular school and the number of doctoral degrees awarded to white native men by that school. The study thus suggests that the growth in the size of the foreign student population has indeed altered the educational opportunities available to white native men."}, {"section_title": "II. The Crowdout Effect", "text": "A university's decision to admit additional foreign students to its graduate program obviously depends on many factors, including the relative quality of the applicants, the possibility that foreign students pay for a higher fraction of their education, the widespread adoption of the axiom that \"diversity\" is beneficial in a university setting, and the relative marginal products of the foreign and native students as employees of the university (since many graduate students typically work as research assistants or teaching assistants). Some of these factors may imply that, other things being equal, admission officers would prefer to admit a foreign student over a native-born applicant. The admission and eventual enrollment of foreign students alters the educational opportunities available to qualified natives in two distinct ways. First, it may be the case that the number of slots available in a particular graduate program is fixed in the short run. The enrollment of an additional foreign student would then necessarily imply that one fewer native student would be enrolled. This is the simplest and clearest case of a crowdout effect. Even if the university were expanding and admitting more foreign and more native students, there may still be a crowdout effect in the sense that native enrollment would have risen faster if the university had not increased its supply of foreign students. In the empirical analysis reported below, I adopt the conservative definition of a crowdout effect that requires native enrollment to actually fall (rather than not rise as much as it would have risen otherwise) when the number of foreign students increases. The entry of foreign students can alter the educational decisions made by native students in another, less direct, way. In particular, an increase in the number of enrolled foreign students may affect the incentives that natives have to pursue some educational programs. Suppose, for instance, that many of the foreign students enrolled in a particular program (e.g., computer science) remain in the United States after graduation. One would then expect that wages in these computer-related occupations would fall and those occupations would become relatively less attractive to natives. The foreign students may still choose to enter those low-paying jobs because their career decisions are mainly guided by the fact that the student visa is perceived as providing an entry ticket into the United States, so that they would be comparing the low U.S. wage in a computer-related occupation with the even lower wage that would be available if they remained in the source countries. In contrast, native students have many more career choices, and would shy away from applying to those educational programs where foreign students cluster. In the long run, this behavioral response would again imply that an increase in the enrollment of foreign students in a particular program would reduce the number of natives enrolled in that program. There is one important distinction between the two types of crowdout effects discussed above. The first crowdout effect is specific to a particular university-and indicates how native enrollment in that institution changes as the number of foreign students enrolled in that institution increases. The second crowdout effect results from an economy-wide behavioral response that effectively inhibits natives from pursuing particular educational programs in all universities (or perhaps from pursuing a graduate education altogether if the labor supply increase resulting from the foreign student program is sufficiently large in all fields). The empirical analysis presented below nets out these economy-wide fluctuations and examines the shifts that occur in native enrollment within a particular university as the size of the foreign student population increases. The study, therefore, will isolate the institution-specific type of crowdout effect. The conjecture that immigrants adversely affect the economic opportunities of competing native workers in the labor market has long been a central component of the immigration debate. As a result, the resurgence of large-scale immigration in the past few decades motivated a great deal of research examining this issue (Grossman, 1982;Card, 1991;and Borjas, 2003). Although the evidence is mixed, more recent studies tend to conclude that immigration indeed lowers the earnings of similarly skilled native workers. Despite the rapid rise in the number of foreign students enrolled in graduate programs, however, there has been little systematic study of how foreign students alter the educational opportunities available to natives. Hoxby (1998) and Betts (1998) present some of the only evidence on this issue. Hoxby uses the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study to calculate the correlation between the fraction of a college's students who are black or disadvantaged and the fraction of the students who are foreign born, and finds the correlation to be negative. Using Census data, Betts finds that young black and Hispanic natives are less likely to have completed high school if they reside in areas where immigrants tend to cluster. The empirical analysis presented below differs from these initial studies in a number of ways. My study focuses specifically on crowdout effects in the graduate sector, and exploits the panel feature of the data to estimate institution-specific adjustments in native enrollment as the size of the foreign student population changes."}, {"section_title": "III. Data", "text": "Since 1986, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) has collected detailed information on enrollment, employment, and finances in institutions of higher education. Each institution reports the number of persons enrolled in particular programs both at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including the gender and race of students, as well as the number of nonresident aliens (which, for simplicity, I will refer to as \"foreign students\"). The educational institution also reports detailed information on expenditures in various categories relevant to the higher education sector (e.g., instruction and research). Prior to 1986, the same type of information was collected by the Higher Education General Information System (HEGIS), a precursor of the IPEDS data. My empirical analysis uses enrollment information provided by both of these surveys. My analysis focuses on enrollment trends in graduate programs. Unless specifically noted, these enrollment statistics do not include students who attend professional schools. 4 Further, the analysis is restricted to higher education institutions in the United States that are accredited at the college level by the U.S. Department of Education and that are legally authorized to offer at least a one-year program of study creditable to a degree. 5 My empirical study of enrollment trends uses the cross-sections observed in 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998. In each of these cross-sections, I calculate the total number of graduate students enrolled in each institution, regardless of whether they are enrolled full-time or part-time. The choice of the timing of the cross-section snapshots is due to two factors. Prior to the 1990s, the IPEDS surveys were not conducted annually, and some of the available crosssections do not contain any information on the number of foreign students enrolled in the institution. Further, the four-year gap across cross-sections implies that there is a significant turnover in the graduate student population of a particular institution from survey to survey, minimizing the problems that would arise if many students were double-counted because they appeared in several surveys. 6 Because the IPEDS contains only limited information on field of study, I restrict the analysis to the size of the entire graduate program at a particular institution. I will return below to a study of crowdout effects within fields using an alternative data set better suited for that purpose. Table 1 summarizes the enrollment trends. 7 There has been a substantial increase in the number of foreign students enrolled in graduate programs. The number of foreign students more than doubled between 1978 and 1998, from 79.4 thousand to 194.3 thousand. Much of the growth in the size of the foreign student population in the 1990s can be attributed to the increase in the number of female foreign students. The number of male graduate students was roughly constant at around 118.0 thousand during this decade. In contrast, the number of female graduate students rose from 18.7 thousand in 1978 to 50.9 thousand in 1990, and to 73.4 thousand in"}, {"section_title": "1998.", "text": "There has also been a sizable increase in the number of native-born graduate students. In 1978, there were 1.2 million native graduates students, and this number increased to 1.4 million in 1990, and to 1.6 million in 1998. It turns out, however, that all of this growth occurred among native women. The number of female native-born graduate students rose from 612 thousand in 1978 to 798 thousand in 1990, and to 938 thousand in 1998. In contrast, the number of male native-born students hovered around 600 thousand throughout the entire period. There is one particular group of natives-white men-that will play a significant role in the empirical analysis reported below. They are the only native group that had a lower enrollment in graduate programs at the end of the period than at the beginning. In particular, there were 556.0 thousand white native men enrolled in graduate programs in 1978. This statistic 7 There are some minor differences between the data reported in Table 1 and the official statistics published by the Department of Education in the Digest of Education Statistics. The total counts of students enrolled in graduate programs matches exactly in some survey years, but differs slightly (by less than 10 thousand students) in other years. These minor differences arise because the two calculations use slightly different sets of accredited institutions. fell to 539 thousand in 1990, and to 509 thousand in 1998. It is worth noting, however, that graduate enrollment for this group did not decline monotonically throughout the period. All other ethnic groups in the native population report (sometimes large) increases in graduate enrollment. For example, black graduate enrollment rose from 76.4 to 138.6 thousand between 1978 and 1998; Asian enrollment rose from 27.5 to 86.2 thousand; and Hispanic enrollment rose from 27.9 to 82.7 thousand."}, {"section_title": "IV. Estimating Crowdout Effects in Graduate Enrollment", "text": "This section addresses a simple question: What happens to the enrollment of natives when a university increases the number of foreign students enrolled in its graduate program? Let N it denote the number of native graduate students enrolled in university i at time t, and let F it denote the respective number of foreign students. Much of the empirical analysis reported in this paper stacks the enrollment data obtained from the HEGIS and IPEDS across universities and surveys and estimates the regression model: (1) where s i is a vector of fixed effects indicating the university; and \u03c0 t is a vector of fixed effects indicating the time period. The university fixed effects absorb any university-specific factors that may determine the size of native enrollment. Similarly, the period fixed effects absorb any timespecific factors that determine the size of the native population interested in pursuing a graduate education at a particular point in time. 8 Throughout the analysis, the regression will be weighted by the total enrollment of the graduate program in a particular university at a particular point in time (or N it + F it ). Further, the standard errors are clustered by university to adjust for possible serial correlation within a particular institution. Under some conditions, the sign and magnitude of the coefficient \u03b8 can provide valuable information about the crowdout effect suggested by the enrollment data. In particular, note that \u03b8 measures what happens to native enrollment within a particular university when that institution decides to enroll one more foreign student. If the estimate of \u03b8 were zero, for example, the data would indicate that the enrollment of an additional foreign student simply expands the university above its current size and has no effect on its pre-existing (native) enrollment. If the estimate of \u03b8 were \u22121, however, the data would suggest a one-to-one crowdout effect. The total number of students enrolled in the university's graduate program is constant, and each additional foreign student simply displaces a native student who presumably would have otherwise enrolled. Of course, the regression analysis may also indicate that \u03b8 is positive, perhaps even exceeding one. Over time, some universities have expanded, and the coefficient \u03b8 would measure how the expansion affect affected the relative enrollment of natives and foreign students. The regression coefficient \u03b8 thus captures the net impact of expansion and crowdout effects. 9 The top panel of Table 2 presents the coefficient \u03b8 estimated from the basic specification of the model. To better understand the presentation of the results, consider the first coefficient reported in the table, where the dependent variable is the total number of natives (both men and women) enrolled in school i at time t and the independent variable gives the total number of foreign students enrolled in that school at that time. The estimated coefficient is .046 (with a standard error of .279), indicating that each additional foreign student enrolled in this program, at the margin, had essentially no impact on the number of natives enrolled at that institution. 10 It turns out, however, that this aggregate correlation masks a great deal of variation in the data, particularly in terms of the impact of foreign students on the enrollment of natives who differ in their gender and ethnic background. The second and third columns of the first row report the estimated coefficients when the dependent variable measures graduate enrollment for native men and women separately. It is evident that the weak correlation revealed by the first column is essentially obtained by adding a negative (though imprecisely measured) impact of foreign students on male enrollment and a positive impact of foreign students on female enrollment. In particular, each additional foreign student is associated with a reduction in the number of male students of -.198 (.152), and an increase in the number of female students of .244 (.141). The data seems to be indicating, therefore, that crowdout effects, if they exist at all, are likely to be concentrated in the sample of male natives. The remaining rows of the top panel of Table 2 estimate the same generic regression but define the dependent variable as the number of natives within particular race and ethnic groups, specifically Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and white natives. The difference in the impact of foreign students on the enrollment of natives belonging to different ethnic categories is quite striking. For example, there is a positive and significant correlation between foreign students and the enrollment of Asian, black, and Hispanic natives. In contrast, there is a significant negative correlation between foreign students and the enrollment of white natives. For white natives, the coefficient is -.488 (.268). It is important to note that the negative coefficient estimated for white natives, and particularly for white native men, does not indicate that graduate enrollment for this group was declining at every university. That potential trend is absorbed by the period dummies included in the regression model. Instead, the estimated coefficient indicates that the enrollment of white native men fell most in those schools that had larger increases in the number of foreign students enrolled. In short, the evidence suggests a significant institution-specific crowdout effect of foreign students on the enrollment of white men. 11 The nature of the data underlying the estimated crowdout effect for white native men can be easily illustrated. There is an important sense in which the results presented in the top panel of Table 2 suffer from endogeneity bias. Suppose that natives crowded out of slots in graduate departments switch to other parts of the higher education sector, particularly professional schools of law and regression. medicine (which have, in fact, enrolled relatively few foreign students in the past two decades). It could then be the case that the impact of foreign students on native enrollment estimated in the top panel of the table overstates the magnitude of the crowdout effect, as many of the affected students simply made different career choices that involved attending professional schools instead of graduate programs. Panel B of Table 2 examines this hypothesis by estimating the relation between native enrollment and foreign student enrollment in both graduate departments and professional schools. It turns out that the coefficient \u03b8 for the most affected group-white native men-is even more negative when I use this definition of enrollment. In particular, the coefficient is -.576 (.145). In short, for every two additional foreign students enrolled in graduate and professional programs at a particular university, roughly one fewer native ended up attending these programs. There is no evidence, therefore, suggesting that the restriction to enrollment in graduate programs (which I will use throughout the remainder of the analysis) misses an important part of the substitution that takes place as some natives respond to the possible crowdout effects of foreign students. Because graduate education for both foreign and native students is highly subsidized by U.S. taxpayers (Winston, 1999), it is of interest to determine if the crowdout effect differs between public and private institutions. 12 Table 3 estimates the basic regression model in each of the two sectors. The evidence indicates that the crowdout effect on white native men is negative and significant in both sectors, but is substantially larger in private universities. In particular, the coefficient \u03b8 is -.272 (.139) for public universities and -.589 (.222) for private universities. It is also worth noting that the regressions for white native women also suggest the existence of a potentially important crowdout effect in private institutions. The coefficient for white native women is -.267 (.239). As a result of the sizable crowdout effects for all white natives enrolled in private universities, the coefficient for total white native enrollment in this sector is -.856 (.428), essentially indicating a one-to-one displacement of white natives as foreign student enrollment increases. It is also important to show that the crowdout effect of foreign students on white native men isolates a unique relationship that is not found when one contrasts the enrollment trends of white native men with other groups. As I showed in the last section, the 1980s and 1990s were accompanied not only by large increases in foreign enrollment, but also by a very large increase in the number of native women who chose to enroll in graduate programs. It is of interest, therefore, to determine if the enrollment of white men reacts to an increase in the number of native women in the same way that it reacts to an increase in the number of foreign students. To determine this correlation, I estimate a slightly more general version of the regression model in equation 1. In particular, I now also include the number of native women as a regressor. Specification 1 in Table 4 shows that the negative correlation between the enrollment of white men and foreign students remains even after controlling for the increasing number of native women. Equally important, the coefficient of female native enrollment is positive, so that there is no evidence that native women crowd out native men from graduate programs. Instead, the enrollment of these two groups moved together. Table 4 generalizes the regression model to examine how the enrollment of white native men responded to increases in the number of black natives enrolled at the particular university. The regressors in the model now include the number of foreign students, the number of white native women, and the number of black natives. The results again indicate that the negative impact of foreign students on the enrollment of white native men is unique. Increases in either female enrollment or black enrollment (due perhaps to affirmative action pressures) did not reduce the number of white native men enrolled at the university."}, {"section_title": "Specification 2 in", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Crowdout and School Quality", "text": "It is unlikely that the foreign student population is randomly distributed across graduate programs in the United States. Any cost-benefit assessment of the crowdout effect documented above obviously depends on the nature of the constraints that the enrollment of foreign students imposes on the educational access available to natives. As a result, it is important to examine how the crowdout effect varies across institutions that differ in the quality of their graduate programs. To assign a quality ranking to a particular institution, I used the data on instructional expenditures reported in the IPEDS files. I calculated the average per-student instructional expenditures for the survey years 1990-1993. 13 The averaging of the expenditure data over the four years helps to minimize the problem of both measurement error and short-run fluctuations in instructional expenditures. I restricted the set of institutions to those that reported an average perstudent expenditure of less than $100,000. This restriction eliminates almost all medical schools, law schools, and theological schools from the data. I then divided the remaining population of institutions into 50 quantiles. There are approximately 1,100 institutions in my data extract, so that each quantile of the distribution contains around 22 schools. 14 The top two quantiles of this distribution contain the list of \"usual suspects,\" including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and the California Institute of Technology. It is instructive to illustrate how the enrollment of native and foreign students varies among the institutions defined in terms of these 50 quality quantiles. Equally important, there is an important difference in how enrollment grew over the 1978-1998 period for foreign and native students across the various quantiles of the quality distribution. Figure 3 shows that native enrollment tended to grow fastest at the lower-quality institutions, while the enrollment growth of foreign students tends to rise steadily with the quality measure. Table 5 reports the coefficient \u03b8 from regression models estimated separately in sets of institutions of roughly similar quality. In particular, I estimate the crowdout model in the set of institutions in the bottom 10 quantiles, in quantiles 11 through 40, in the top 10 quantiles (41-50), as well as in the \"elite\" institutions that occupy the 50 th quantile. The results are quite striking. The correlation between the enrollment of white native men and foreign students is slightly positive for the low-quality schools (.188, with a standard error of .281), turns zero for schools in the middle of the quality distribution (-.038, with a standard error of .140), and becomes quite negative for schools at the top of the distribution (-.493, with a standard error of .167). In fact, the coefficient is most negative when the regression model is estimated in the subset of elite institutions in the 50 th quantile. Among these institutions, the crowdout effect for white native men is -.605, with a standard error of .253. In fact, the table suggests that there is also a crowdout effect for white native women at these elite institutions. The coefficient for white native women is -.277, with a standard error of .236."}, {"section_title": "Alternative Interpretations", "text": "Although my discussion of the regression results has interpreted the negative sign of the coefficient \u03b8 for white native men as evidence of a \"crowdout effect,\" it is worth examining if there are alternative hypotheses that might explain the results for this group. One simple alternative hypothesis is that the decline in the number of white native men enrolled in graduate programs reflects a decline in the number of white native men who could be potential graduate students. One problem with this alternative story is that the regressions already control for demographic trends by including a vector of period fixed effects. These fixed effects absorb the impact of any variable-such as a change in the size of the available pool of potential graduate students-that is fixed at a particular point in time. Moreover, the evidence regarding the demographic trends does not seem to be consistent with the trends in the enrollment of white native men in graduate programs. thousand throughout the past two decades. In short, the evidence does not suggest that graduate enrollment of white native men declined faster in those periods when the pool of potential graduate students was shrinking the most. 15 There is also the possibility that the results summarized in the crowdout regressions are capturing a reverse causality. The institutions increased their enrollment of foreign graduate students because they faced a substantial decline in the number of (qualified) white native men who wished to enroll in graduate programs. This counterfactual resembles the often-heard argument that \"immigrants do jobs that natives do not want to do\" in the U.S. labor market. If one takes this set of arguments seriously, it would seem to imply that there are few jobs that natives do want to do. After all, the argument is used to justify why immigrants do not compete with low-skill workers, such as gardeners, taxi drivers, and maids-since natives do not want to perform those presumably menial jobs. It is also used to justify why high-tech immigrants who enter the United States through the H1-B program do not compete with natives in the high-tech sector-since natives do not want to be software programmers. And, in the current context, it is used to explain why immigrants do not crowd out natives from graduate programs, since white native men no longer wish to attend graduate school. It is unlikely that this conjecture can be true in the current context (if it is ever true in any context!). After all, the greatest declines in the enrollment of white native men occurred at highquality institutions. Surely all potential graduate students-regardless of their race and ethnic background-would prefer to attend those institutions that provide the best job market opportunities after graduation. 16 In sum, the evidence summarized in this section documents a strong negative correlation between the enrollment of white native men in graduate programs and the enrollment of foreign students. Those educational institutions that experienced the largest increases in foreign enrollment are also the institutions that experienced the steepest drops in the enrollment of white native men. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that foreign students limit the opportunities available to white native men in graduate education, particularly at the most elite institutions. It would seem, therefore, that any assessment of the foreign student program must include an accounting of the cost that the program imposes on a sizable part of the native population in terms of foregone educational opportunities."}, {"section_title": "V. Estimating Crowdout Effects in Earned Doctorates", "text": "The previous section estimated the correlations between the enrollment of native and foreign students in graduate programs. I now examine if the crowdout effect for some native groups can also be observed in terms of a key \"outcome\" variable in the higher education sector, the number of doctorates granted to native students. The analysis uses data drawn from the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED), a data file collected and maintained by the National Science Foundation. This micro data file is effectively a population census of all persons who receive doctorates in a particular calendar year, with a response rate of around 90 percent. I restrict the analysis to persons who received their doctoral degree from a U.S. institution between 1975 and 1998. I aggregate the individual data to the level of an educational institution, so as to calculate the number of doctorates awarded by an institution to particular groups at a point in time. The SED collects information on whether the doctoral recipient was a non-citizen at the time that the doctorate was awarded. I use this variable to calculate the number of doctorates awarded to foreign students and to \"natives\" (all the doctoral recipients who were citizens at the time they received their doctorate). 17 As before, the study will use information on the doctoral recipient's race and sex to determine if the crowdout effect of foreign students differs across various groups of native students. There is a great deal of short-run variation in the number of doctorates awarded by particular institutions over time. To eliminate some of this variation, I aggregate the data into four-year brackets: 1975-78, 1979-82, 1983-86, 1987-90, 1991-94, and 1995-98. An observation in my data extract, therefore, provides information on the number of doctorates awarded by a particular institution in a particular four-year time period. 17 The classification of students into \"foreign students\" and \"natives\" used in the SED differs from that used in the IPEDS. The IPEDS specifically asks the institutions to report the number of nonresident aliens (i.e., of foreign-born persons who are in the United States on a temporary visa). The SED does not contain any information on the type of visa used by foreigners to enter the United States. Instead, I define a foreign student as someone who is a non-citizen at the time the doctorate was awarded. A non-citizen, however, need not be a nonresident alien. For example, someone who has a \"green card\" and has not yet been naturalized is a non-citizen, but is not a nonresident alien. Table 6 begins the analysis of the SED data by reporting the trends in the number of doctorates granted to native and foreign students between 1975 and 1998. As is well known, there has been a substantial rise in the number of doctorates awarded to foreign students in the past two decades. Between 1975 and1978, 14.0 thousand foreign students received doctorates, and this statistic almost tripled to 37.3 thousand by 1995-98. In contrast, the number of natives receiving doctorates rose by only 16 percent, from 113.6 to 131.6 thousand. As suggested by the enrollment data presented in the previous section, the number of white native men receiving doctorates declined from 83.4 to 71.0 thousand, while the number of native women receiving doctorates doubled from 30.1 to 60.7 thousand. Table 7 estimates the generic crowdout regression model using the SED data. The dependent variable is the number of native doctorates (in a particular ethnic and gender group) awarded by a particular institution during a four-year time period. The regressions are weighted by the size of total graduate enrollment in that institution. This statistic is obtained from the IPEDS data used in the previous section, and gives total graduate enrollment observed at the end of each four-year time bracket. Finally, the standard errors are clustered by university to adjust for possible serial correlation. The results reported in Panel A of Table 7 are similar to those obtained from the enrollment data in the IPEDS. Overall, there is only a weak correlation between the number of doctoral degrees awarded to natives and the number of doctoral degrees awarded to foreign students within a particular institution. It turns out, however, that this weak correlation masks a substantial difference between the correlation for male natives and female natives. In particular, the estimated coefficient \u03b8 is negative and significant for men (-.233, with a standard error of .120), and positive and significant for women (.381, with a standard error of .071). As in the previous section, the largest crowdout effects are estimated for white native men, where the estimated coefficient is -.242 (.081). As before, the underlying data responsible for the crowdout effect found in the sample of white native men is easy to illustrate. Figure 5 presents the scatter diagram relating the change between 1975-78 and 1995-98 in the number of doctorates earned at a particular university by foreign students and white native men. The scatter has an obvious negative slope, indicating that the number of white native men earning doctorates declined the most in those universities that had the largest increases in earned doctorates by foreign students. The bottom two panels of Table 7 replicate the analysis for public and private universities. As with the enrollment data, the crowdout effects are strongest for white native men enrolled in private institutions, where the coefficient is -.405 (.117). This contrasts with a crowdout effect of -.229 (.096) for white native men enrolled in public institutions. The SED data also shows that the (within-school) negative correlation between the number of doctorates granted to foreign students and the number of doctorates granted to white native men is unique, and cannot be found when the enrollment trends of white native men are compared to those of native women or blacks. Specification 1 of Table 8 reports the results when the regressors include the number of foreign students and the number of native women. The regression coefficients reveal that the number of doctorates granted to white native men is negatively correlated with the number of doctorates granted to foreign students, but positively correlated with the number of doctorates granted to women. Specification 2 of the table expands the model to also include the number of blacks granted doctorates. As before, the negative correlation between doctorates granted to white native men and foreign students seems to isolate a unique crowdout effect. In short, it is the increase in the supply of foreign doctoral students, and not the increase in the supply of other native groups, that limited the number of white native men who earned doctorates at a particular university. Unlike the IPEDS, the SED data provides detailed information on the field in which the persons received their doctoral degrees, making it possible to estimate crowdout effects within particular fields. I aggregated the SED data into ten general fields, and estimated the crowdout model separately in each of these fields. The dependent variable in these regressions, therefore, is the number of doctorates awarded in a particular field by a particular institution during a particular time period. Table 9 reports the results. The crowdout coefficient for white native men is negative in five out of the ten fields, and is negative in the three fields that account for the largest number of doctoral degrees: biological sciences (-.266, with a standard error of .076), social sciences (-.385, with a standard error of .144), and physical sciences (-.122, with a standard error of .089). Finally, it is important to note that, as with the enrollment data, there is a significant difference in the magnitude of the crowdout effect across institutions of different qualities. The nature of the results is perhaps most evident in the data illustrated in Figure 6. I used the 50quantile distribution of quality defined in the previous section, and calculated the difference between the number of doctoral degrees awarded to white native men or foreign students in 1995-98 and the corresponding number awarded in 1975-78. As the figure shows, the decline in the number of doctorates awarded to white native men was greatest in the high-quality institutions, precisely the institutions that experienced the largest increase in the number of doctorates awarded to foreign students. Table 10 summarizes this evidence in a regression format by estimating the crowdout model in particular sets of institutions differentiated by quality. It is evident that the crowdout effect is much larger in the more elite institutions. In the case of white native men, for example, the coefficient is .647 (.103) in institutions that are in the lowest 10 quantiles of the quality distribution; -.098 (.138) in the institutions between the 11 th and 40 th quantiles; and -.302 (.097) in the institutions in the top 10 quantiles. In fact, the crowdout effect is -.701 (.146) in the elite institutions that occupy the 50 th quantile of the quality distribution. It is also worth noting that foreign students also have a significant crowdout effect for white native women in these elite institutions. The crowdout coefficient is -.389 (.273). In fact, the sum of the crowdout effects for white men and white women implies that an additional foreign student earning a doctorate in the most elite institutions is associated with a decline of one white native earning a doctorate at those institutions."}, {"section_title": "Affirmative Action and Crowdout Effects", "text": "Up to this point, the analysis has ignored the racial background of the foreign student population. It is possible, however, that university admission officers consider such factors as the race and gender of foreign students so that they can tally some foreign students as belonging to particular minority groups. For example, a Hispanic foreign student could be used to increase the count of Hispanics enrolled at a university. This decision would then allow the university to meet certain affirmative action goals without having to admit a less-qualified Hispanic native. The SED data (unlike the IPEDS) reports the ethnic and racial background of all doctoral recipients, including the foreign students. I classify the foreign students into the following categories: Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white; and \"other\". As Figure 7 shows, there are sizable differences in the trends of doctorates awarded to these various groups. In fact, much of the growth in the number of doctorates awarded to foreign students can be attributed to an increase in the number of Asian doctoral recipients. The number of doctorates awarded to Asians rose from 4.9 thousand in 1975-98 to 23.3 thousand in 1995-98. In contrast, the number of doctorates awarded to white foreign students rose only from 5.6 to 9.4 thousand. Table 11 estimates a slightly more general specification of the crowdout regression model. In particular, the foreign student variable is replaced by a vector of variables indicating the number of foreign students in the various race groups. The estimated coefficients yield two interesting results. First, there is no evidence to suggest that the number of doctorates awarded to foreign students in a particular racial group has an adverse effect on the number of doctorates awarded to natives in that same racial group. For example, an increase of 10 Asian foreign students is associated with an increase of 2.0 Asian natives earning doctorates. Similarly, an increase of 10 black foreign students is associated with an increase of 6.0 black natives earning doctorates. Finally, an increase of 10 Hispanic foreign students is associated with an increase of 2.3 native Hispanics earning doctorates. Second, the results suggest that the crowdout effect on white native men can be mostly attributed to the large increase in the number of Asian foreign doctoral recipients. This is not surprising since Asians account for practically all of the growth in the number of doctoral degrees awarded to foreign students."}, {"section_title": "VI. Policy Implications of Crowdout Effects", "text": "It is far from clear that the crowdout effect of foreign students on the enrollment of white native men (and sometimes white native women) in graduate programs signals a suboptimal allocation of resources in the higher education sector. The policy implications of the finding-as well as the recommended policy tools that can be used to adjust the outcomes-depend crucially on three related issues. First, what happens to the displaced white native men? Second, what happens to the foreign students after they complete their education? And third, what are the benefits that the foreign student program imparts on universities and the U.S. labor market? The first of these questions is perhaps the most difficult question to answer, as we simply do not know the career choices made by the displaced white men (and it is difficult to imagine a simple way of observing these career choices). Did these men move on to lower-quality graduate programs, or did many of them decide to forego a graduate education altogether? Moreover, any cost-benefit analysis requires information on how these men would have fared had they attended the graduate program of their choice (in the absence of foreign students). We could potentially learn much more about the career choices and economic contributions made by the foreign students after they complete their graduate education. Finn 2000and Finn, Pennington, and Anderson (1995) estimate the stay rate for nonresident aliens who receive their doctorates in the United States. The stay rate was around 42 percent for foreigners who received their doctorates in the 1980s, but increased to around 53 percent for those who received their doctorates in 1992. These data suggest a number of important questions that have not been sufficiently analyzed: What is the nature of the selection that determines the population of stayers? How has this selection changed over time, as the number of foreign students enrolled in graduate programs increased? And how do the foreign students who remain in the United States fare in the labor market? 18 Finally, the foreign graduate students, both those who stay in the United States as well as those who go back, impart additional costs and benefits on the country. For example, foreign students pay tuition, and these tuition revenues-if they were to exceed the actual cost of providing the education to the foreign students-could be an additional source of economic benefit. It turns out, however, that the pricing of higher education in the United States is highly distorted in both private and public institutions, with the typical tuition payment not being sufficiently large to cover the actual cost of the education (even in the absence of financial aid). Winston (1999) estimates that the average per-student subsidy (in 2001 dollars) is $8,800 in private universities and $10,000 in public universities, with the subsidy being substantially higher at the most elite institutions. In short, even if the foreign graduate students enrolled at public universities paid the full nominal tuition, their payments would fail to cover the true cost of their education since both public and private universities receive substantial taxpayer subsidies. In fact, these large subsidies introduce a difficult wrinkle in any policy discussion of the crowdout effect. If immigration policy is supposed to benefit the native population, it is difficult to justify a subsidy system that limits educational opportunities for a large group of native students unless the economic gains from foreign students are very large. However, the available evidence on the economic gains from immigration suggests that these gains are likely to be small. The \"textbook\" model of the economic impact of immigration suggests that immigration reduces the total income accruing to native-born workers, while raising the profits of the firms that employ those workers. The gains accruing to the firms exceed the total losses accruing to the workers, so that the nation as a whole gains. The existing studies conclude that a 10 percent increase in labor supply due to immigration almost certainly increases the GDP accruing to the native population by about 0.1 percent, or less than $10 billion a year (Borjas, 1995;Johnson, 1998;Smith and Edmonston, 1997). A fraction of this $10 billion net gain should be attributed to the economic gains associated with the employment of low-wage foreign student workers in American universities and to the economic contributions of the foreign students who remain in the United States. The size of these populations, although large and growing, represent but a small fraction of immigration. In March 2002, there were 20.3 million foreign-born persons in the labor force. Unless foreign students generate sizable positive externalities on the United States, it is unlikely that they are responsible for much of the $10 billion net gain."}, {"section_title": "VII. Conclusion", "text": "The number of foreign students enrolled in graduate programs increased dramatically in the past two decades. At some universities, in fact, foreign students now make up the majority of graduate enrollment in many fields. Despite the rapid growth in the size of the foreign student population, little is known about the educational and economic consequences of the program. This paper is an attempt to begin a systematic appraisal of the role that foreign students play in the higher education system. The paper addresses a simple question: does the enrollment of foreign students in graduate programs alter the educational opportunities available to natives? I used data drawn from the Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS) and the Survey of Earned Doctorates (SED) to examine the link between the admission of foreign students and the enrollment and educational outcomes of various groups of natives, differentiated by gender and ethnicity. return to their source countries. On aggregate, there is little evidence that foreign students displace the typical native from a graduate education. This finding, however, hides a great deal of variation in the impact of foreign students on the educational outcomes experienced by different ethnic groups in the native population, as well as between native men and women. Although the number of native women or native minorities enrolled at a particular university increased at the same time that the number of foreign students was rising, there was also a substantial decline in both the number of white native men enrolled in those graduate programs and in the number of white native men receiving doctoral degrees. Moreover, the crowdout effect for white native men was strongest at the most elite graduate institutions. It is difficult to determine if this crowdout effect is ultimately beneficial or harmful for the United States. The foreign students enrolled in the graduate programs-many of whom remain in the country after completing their education-may be better qualified than the displaced natives who would have otherwise attended those programs. However, the graduate education of both foreign and native students is heavily subsidized by the government. These subsidies are, in effect, being used to displace many white native men from a graduate education in high-quality schools. Any assessment of the foreign student program will obviously require some information on the long-run outcomes experienced by the displaced natives, as well as a full accounting of the costs and benefits that the foreign student program imparts on the U.S. economy.     1978and 1982HEGIS, and the 1986, 1990, 1994 IPEDS.
