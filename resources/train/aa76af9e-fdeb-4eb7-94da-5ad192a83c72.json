Contribution and participation was sought from these groups by holding a series of workshops, meetings, and presentations in strategic locations throughout southern Louisiana. When the first CZB was proposed, 22 biophysical parameters were evaluated to determine if there was any one parameter that controlled the distribution of any or all of the other parameters. Best-fit correlations showed that the line of Pleistocene/Recent contact, which is approximated by the 5-foot contour line, provided the best measure approximation of the boundary line. To evaluate the current CZB, several tasks were necessary, including: 1) Analysis of parameters used in delineating the original CZB; 2) Collection and analysis of data that were unavailable at the time of the original study; and 3) Compilation of data sets into comparable Geographic Information System (GIS) layers for analysis and delineation of the CZB. In addition, during the evaluation of the current CZB it was necessary to be aware of constraints and directions included in both the CZMA (16 USC 33:1451 et seq.) and the SLCRMA (R.S. 49:214.21 et seq.). Based on these two statutes, a number of objective criteria became clear, including that the redefined CZB needed to include: \u2022 The inland extent of area needed to fully implement the state Master Plan; \u2022 The inland extent of coastal waters as defined by law; \u2022 The inland extent of tidal influence; \u2022 The inland extent of wetland vegetation closely associated with coastal ecosystems; \u2022 The inland extent of fish and wildlife closely associated with coastal ecosystems; \u2022 The inland extent of coastal watersheds; \u2022 The inland extent of projected effects of climate change, including sea level rise, storm surge, back water flooding and other coastal hazards; \u2022 The inland extent of basic geological features frequently associated with shorelines, such as the Pleistocene terrace; \u2022 The inland extent of the location of coastal dependent or coastal enhanced industry or other commercial activities closely related to the coast; \u2022 The inland extent of coastal recreational activities; and \u2022 The inland extent of population centers economically tied to coastal dependent or enhanced economic activities. Technology has improved since 1975 and more data were available for the CZB re-evaluation than were available 30 years ago. Data acquired that were not available in 1975 included National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Sea, Lake, and Overland Surge from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model outputs, Light Detecting and Ranging (LIDAR) Elevation data, National Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) soils data, Multi-resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MLCD) National Land Cover (NLC) vegetation data, and sea-level rise predictions for the next century. The SLOSH model is the primary computer model used by NOAA to forecast the inland extent of storm surge. LIDAR data were used to determine elevation contours. The NRCS STATSGO soil data were utilized to identify riparian areas within watersheds that touch the coast. MLCD NLC vegetation data were found to be more extensive within the area of interest than United States Geological Survey (USGS) marsh data. In addition, as sea levels rise and the Louisiana coast subsides, changes in the coastline are expected to occur which should have an impact on coastal zone management, thus, sea level predictions were given consideration when re-evaluating the CZB. Animal habitat data were not included in the present study, instead extensive regional vegetation data were relied upon to determine the inland extent of saltwater intrusion. The boundary of LDNR's Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (CNPCP) was included to evaluate the impact of drainage basins in watersheds that drain to the Gulf of Mexico. These data are discussed in more detail in the body of this report. GIS layers of data sets included in the current study were compiled and a series of questions were applied to the layers in order to numerically define areas of the coastal zone. The area to which questions were applied was limited to major watersheds that touch the coast (e.g., the study area). The study area was separated into a series of 1-km 2 areas that were approximately 247 acres each, for a total of 39,764 1-km 2 areas. Each question was asked in each of the 1-km 2 areas and the resulting answer could be either \"Yes\" or \"No\". The questions included: 1) Is any part of the 1-km 2 area at or below the line of contact between Pleistocene and Holocene sediments? 2) Is any part of the 1-km 2 area within the current coastal zone? 3) Is any part of the 1-km 2 area within the boundary of the existing CNPCP area? 4) Does the 1-km 2 area contain emergent herbaceous wetlands (fresh, intermediate, brackish or salt marsh)? 5) Is any part of the 1-km 2 area contained within the inland extent of storm surge per the Maximum of MEOWs (MOMs) map? 6) Is any part of the 1-km 2 area at an elevation of 5 feet or lower? 7) Is any part of the 1-km 2 area at an elevation of 8 feet or lower? 8) Is any part of the 1-km 2 area at an elevation of 10 feet or lower? 9) Does the 1-km 2 area contain soils classified as floodplains, marsh, backswamp, or water? If the answer was \"Yes\", then the 1-km 2 area received a score of 1 and if the answer was \"No\" the area received a score of 0. If any part of the 1-km 2 area contained the vegetation, elevation, etc for the query, the answer for the entire 1-km 2 area was \"Yes\". Values of 1 or 0 for each 1-km 2 grid were recorded in an attribute table and summed for the nine data layers queried, resulting in scores ranging from 0 to 9 for each grid. A score of 7 to 9 represented areas with a high level of coastal influence. A score of 3 to 6 represented areas with a moderate level of coastal influence. A score of 1 or 2 indicated a low level of coastal influence and a score of 0 represented areas with no coastal influence. Scores for grids within the current CZB were examined and it was found that approximately 95% of the grids scored 7 or greater,"}, {"section_title": "ES -4", "text": "Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone with 99.9% scoring 3 or greater. Only four grids within the current CZB received a score of 2, and no grids received scores of 1 or 0. The 1-km 2 areas were grouped according to the four levels of coastal influence and color coded for visual display. There were fairly distinct strata associated with areas highly influenced by coastal processes and those moderately impacted by coastal process. But, the areas barely influenced by coastal processes and those areas not influenced by coastal processes under normal circumstances tended to be more sporadic, with coastal processes extending to the limits of the study area in many of the 1-km 2 areas. Therefore, all 1-km 2 areas scoring between 0 -2 were grouped together. Based on analyses conducted during this evaluation, a proposed updated inland boundary for the Louisiana Coastal Zone, which employs a hierarchal management structure, was established. Designated the 2010 Science-Based Boundary (2010 SBB), it was developed based on scientific analysis and it divides the coastal zone into two management areas based on the degree of coastal influence and the nature and the degree of management required. Activities in the coastal zone would be subject to the enforceable policies of the SLCRMA. Areas not in the coastal zone, but contained within or adjacent to watersheds which have potential coastal impacts, are included in the watershed planning area; activities in the planning area would not be subject to the enforceable policies of the SLCRMA (unless an activity having a specific effect on coastal waters was demonstrated). The recommended management areas include: \u2022 o Located outside of the coastal zone but within the identified planning area o Coastal zone management program might choose to participate in coastal planning efforts, with or without contributing funding, if the particular planning effort will have coastal ramifications. The newly delineated coastal zone, with the proposed boundaries of the IGC and CUP areas, is shown on Figure ES 1 (Text Figure 30), and the parishes included in each area, in whole or in part, are listed in Table ES-1 (Text Table 10). The generally proposed boundary for each area is described in Section 3.5.1: Management Areas. Adoption of the CUP area proposed updated inland boundary would add only a single new parish, a portion of Ascension, to the area now subject to coastal use permitting. Act 956 of the 2010 Regular Session of the Louisiana Legislature provides authorization to add all or any portion of Ascension within six months of approval of the boundary change for that parish by the CPRA. While it is true that other areas of the proposed CUP area are expanded by this proposal, certain areas in Livingston and Tangipahoa parishes are proposed to be deleted from the area subject to coastal use permitting, although they would remain in the IGC area of the broader coastal zone. While this report provides a framework for establishing an expanded coastal zone with hierarchical management, changes in state law would be required for implementation. If the 2010 science-based boundary is approved, a significant rewriting of the current coastal zone boundary statute, La. R.S. 49:214.24, would have to be completed to accommodate the new management areas. New statutes would need to be adopted to create and to establish the CUP and IGC areas. The statutes should include a description and purpose of these two management areas. Existing statutes would also need to be reviewed to determine if use of the term \"coastal zone\" in all instances appropriately refers to both management units and if other minor changes were needed to make sure that the hierarchical management approach is implemented effectively and efficiently. Additional changes to state law that may be needed if recommendations included in this report are accepted are discussed in 4.0 Next Steps: Implementing an Updated Coastal Zone. This document presents the findings of a comprehensive science-based evaluation of the adequacy of the current inland boundary to meet the state's present and future needs to manage, protect, and restore its coastal resources. A guiding principle for this study was the need for balance between creating an overly expansive coastal zone and identifying a coastal zone that was sufficient to manage emerging coastal issues over the next several decades, especially those pertaining to climate change, sea level rise, nonpoint source pollution, and coastal and marine spatial planning. In addition, a critical factor to consider was delineating a management area based on science and geography that would allow for coastal management in the area covered by the Louisiana Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast."}, {"section_title": "ES -7", "text": "Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone "}, {"section_title": "PARISH", "text": "Based on the analyses presented in this document, it is recommended that the current coastal zone boundary be expanded and a hierarchical management approach be adopted that would allow the state to effectively manage, protect, and restore its coastal resources.

The proposed boundary line tracks generally West to East beginning at the Louisiana-Texas state line in Calcasieu parish and ending at the Washington-St. Tammany parish boundary where it meets the Louisiana-Mississippi state line. From West to East, the boundary follows Louisiana state highway 27 (LA 27) to its intersection with U. S. highway 190 (US 190), continues east following US 190 to the west Atchafalaya levee, then proceeds north to the Old River Control Structure, then south along the east Atchafalaya levee to its intersection with US 190, then eastward along US 190 to its intersection with Louisiana highway 67 (LA 67) then northerly along LA 67 to its intersection with Louisiana highway 10 (LA 10), then east along LA 10 to its intersection with U.S. highway 51 (La 51), then north along US 51 to its intersection with Louisiana highway 38 (LA 38), then east along LA 38 to its intersection with Louisiana highway 1061 then south along LA 1061 to its intersection with Louisiana highway 10 (LA 10), then east along LA 10 to the Louisiana-Mississippi state line. As proposed, the IGC boundary would include the geographic extent of all Master Plan measures and their respective buffer areas, with the exception of two buffer areas. The two buffer areas that extend northward of the IGC boundary are associated with watershed management plan features for the Mermentau and Sabine basins. Within the broader coastal zone, as described above for the IGC, the CUP area comprises a smaller geographic area with greater affinity to coastal processes and nearer to the coast line. The CUP area, as defined by the project analysis approximates, and in some cases follows, the science-based CZB line recommended by the 1975 study. The CUP area line generally trends from west to east beginning at the Louisiana-Texas state line in Calcasieu parish just north of the Cameron parish line and ending at the Louisiana-Mississippi state line slightly north and east of the city of Slidell, in St. Tammany parish. This proposed new CUP inland boundary tracks slightly north of the existing coastal zone boundary in the Chenier plain but includes a northern extension that include riparian areas to the MHW line of Lake Charles and the Calcasieu River. Farther east, the newly proposed line follows the current coastal zone boundary along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway through Vermilion parish then loops northward in Iberia parish to include Lake Peigneur. More of the Atchafalaya River basin area would be included in the proposed updated CUP area where the proposed boundary would cross following the southern parish lines of upper St. Martin and Iberville parishes. In the central region of the state the proposed CUP area would be expanded to include all of Terrebonne, Lafourche and Assumption parishes. East of the Mississippi River, the updated CUP area boundary would pass through Ascension parish beginning at a point east of Louisiana highway 70 (LA 70) at the Ascension-St. James parish line and proceeding northward following local land features, township lines and bearings to the Ascension-Livingston parish line. The boundary then proceeds south along the Ascension-Livingston parish line to Louisiana highway 22 (LA 22), then follows LA 22 to its intersection with Louisiana highway 16, then continues northward to the junction with Louisiana highway 42 (LA 42). In the parishes north of Lake Pontchartrain, the boundary is proposed to move southwards slightly and transfer a portion of what is the current regulated coastal zone into the IGC management area by following the following route through Livingston, Tangipahoa and St. Tammany parishes. From LA 16 following Louisiana highway 42 (LA 42) eastward to the town of Springfield, then continuing eastward on LA 22 to the St. Tammany parish line, then northward along the parish line to its intersection with Interstate Highway 12 (I-12), then eastward along I-12 to its intersection with I-10, continuing eastward following I-10 to the Louisiana-Mississippi state line. Adoption of the CUP area proposed updated inland boundary would add only a single new parish, a portion of Ascension, to the area now subject to coastal use permitting. While it is true that other areas of the proposed CUP area are expanded by this proposal, certain areas in Livingston and Tangipahoa parishes are proposed to be deleted from the area subject to coastal use permitting, although they would remain in the IGC area of the broader coastal zone. An analysis of the proposed inland boundary for the CUP management area of the coastal zone shows that there will be a net increase of 1,997 mi 2 (Table 11) in that portion of the coastal zone subject to regulation through the coastal use permit program of OCM. While this may initially seem to be a large area to add to the regulated coastal zone, when considered in the context of long-term land loss in the Louisiana coastal zone, it is not nearly so large. The USGS (Barras et al., 2004) has projected the amount of land loss in coastal Louisiana to be 2,038 mi 2 between the years 1956-2050. Assuming this to be the case, and that the proposed CUP boundary were to be adopted, the land area of the CUP management zone could actually be 41 mi 2 smaller in the year 2050 than it was in 1956.

During recent years, significant weather events including hurricanes, droughts, and regional sealevel rise, coastal land loss, advances in measuring and monitoring ecological change, and, state and federal legislative actions and programs have focused attention on that part of Louisiana subject to coastal processes. For these reasons, the Louisiana legislature determined that an evaluation of the adequacy of the current inland coastal zone boundary was needed 31 years after the current boundary was established by Act 361 of 1978, which was the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA). To conduct the evaluation, the legislature passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 60 (SCR 60, Appendix A) in 2009 which directed the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) to undertake a comprehensive, science-based evaluation of the current inland boundary. The boundary, if revised, would need to meet Louisiana's future goals to manage, protect and restore its coastal resources. The CPRA by Resolution dated June 29, 2009 (Appendix B), tasked the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Office of Coastal Management (OCM) to carry out this effort based upon \"\u2026its unique knowledge of intricacies of Louisiana's existing coastal zone boundary and the challenges that surround any effort to evaluate and/or make recommendations to redraw this line.\" The OCM worked in cooperation with CPRA member agencies and additional state, local, and federal organizations to carry out this evaluation. The OCM retained contractual services to provide expert technical scientific and legal services to assist its staff in carrying out this task. This report presents the background, methodology, findings, and recommendations of a science-based evaluation of the inland boundary of the Louisiana coastal zone."}, {"section_title": "Evolution of the Current Coastal Zone Boundary", "text": "The federal Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA) defines the coastal zone of a state as the coastal waters and adjacent shoreland, which should extend inland only to the extent necessary to control shorelands on which activities have direct and significant impact on coastal waters, and/or are likely to affected by or be vulnerable to sea-level rise. Excluded from the coastal zone are those lands subject solely to the discretion of, or held in trust by, the Federal Government, its officers or agents (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453 \u00a7 304(1)). Louisiana's first formal coastal zone boundary (CZB) was proposed in 1975 based on research sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), of the U.S. Department of Commerce (McIntire et al. 1975). That proposed inland boundary was based on an analysis of biophysical parameters and it served as a baseline for legislative deliberations to establish a CZB so that Louisiana could receive federal approval for a coastal zone management program under the CZMA. The inland boundary first established for the Louisiana coastal zone by Act 705 of the Regular Session of the 1975 Louisiana Legislature encompassed only a narrow band of shoreland extending landward three miles from the Gulf of Mexico. This boundary was deemed by NOAA to be inadequate to support a federally approved coastal management program and, therefore, was not approved. After additional deliberation and consultation with NOAA, the state developed and adopted an approved CZB by Act 361 of the 1978 Regular Session of the Louisiana Legislature, the SLCRMA. Since that time changes have been made to the inland CZB on three occasions (Emmer 1989). First, minor changes allowed by the language of Act 361 were made to the boundary line around corporate limits of communities as the official boundary maps were drawn. Then, in 1979 the CZB was legislatively amended to include all of St. James, St. John the Baptist, and St. Charles parishes, along with additional areas of Livingston, Lafourche, St. Mary, and Assumption parishes. Finally, in 1980 the CZB was again amended to include a portion of St. Martin parish. Currently, the Louisiana coastal zone includes all or part of 19 parishes and an area of approximately 5.3 million acres (Emmer 1989;Figure 1). A more detailed legislative history of Louisiana's coastal zone boundary is provided in Appendix C. "}, {"section_title": "Concerns with the Current Coastal Zone Boundary", "text": "From 1975-1978, when determinations were being made as to where the inland CZB would be, there was much debate regarding how far inland the coastal zone should extend. The boundary that was finally adopted represented a compromise between the minimalist view represented by Act 705 and the sciencebased recommendation of the time developed by MacIntire et al. (1975). The resultant boundary was, therefore, not fully based on science. Since the adoption of the CZB in 1978, much has changed in coastal Louisiana. It was widely believed that the inland boundary of the coastal zone was, from the start, insufficient to adequately manage Louisiana's coastal resources. Three primary deficiencies of the inland boundary were listed by Emmer (1989): 1) Water quality in the coastal zone can be significantly affected by activities occurring outside the coastal zone; 2) Some parishes, or parts of parishes, outside the coastal zone have the same physical and biological characteristics as lands inside the coastal zone; and 3) Riparian wetlands along rivers which influence the coastal zone are not included in the coastal zone. In the time since the establishment of the coastal zone, there have also been a number of other state and federal coastal programs established in south Louisiana which are based on some aspect of coastal science, but which also conform to particular coastal policy criteria. The boundaries established for these programs encompass not only most or all of the coastal zone as it now exists, but often extend far beyond the current inland boundary. These programs include the Atchafalaya Basin Program, the Barataria-Terrebonne National Estuary Program (BTNEP), the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act (CWPPRA), Louisiana Coastal Wetlands Conservation Plan, Louisiana Coastal Area (LCA) Ecosystem Restoration Plan 2004, the Louisiana Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (LCNPCP; CZARA \u00a7 6217), the Louisiana Nonpoint Source Management Program (CWA \u00a7 319), and the Louisiana Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast. The boundaries of these various programs are depicted in Figure 2 and Table 1 summarizes the programs and their features. To integrate the state's federally approved coastal zone with currently existing coastal programs and the enforceable policies and management mechanisms pertaining to its coastal areas was an important consideration in evaluating the current CZB. Another important consideration when evaluating the current CZB is that the Louisiana coastline has changed in the past several decades due to land loss, subsidence, and sea-level rise. In the 1975 boundary study, the line of contact between Pleistocene and recent geological surfaces was the parameter found to be most closely associated with other factors evaluated in this study. That contact line closely approximates the 5-foot contour but the 5-foot contour line has changed due to changes in the coastline. Thus, a re-evaluation of the boundary line is necessary due to environmental changes that have occurred since the original boundary was delineated. Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone Established in 1991, the mission of the BTNEP is the preservation and restoration of the estuarine system, the 4.2 million acre region between the Atchafalaya and Mississippi Rivers. The goal of the National Estuary Program is to prevent activities that: threaten an estuary's public water supply; are harmful to shellfish, fish and wildlife populations; and, negatively impact recreational opportunities for estuary residents."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and", "text": "Restoration Act"}, {"section_title": "CWPPRA Task Force", "text": "The Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act program (CWPPRA or \"Breaux Act\") provides for targeted funds to be used for planning and implementing projects that create, protect, restore and enhance wetlands in coastal Louisiana. It was passed in 1990, and is authorized until 2019. The Master Plan was developed to fulfill the mandates of Act 8, which was passed by the Louisiana Legislature in 2005 to integrate flood control projects and coastal restoration. The act created the CPRA and charged it with coordinating the efforts of local, state, and federal agencies to achieve long-term and comprehensive coastal protection and restoration. All state agencies are required to administer their regulatory practices, programs, contracts, grants, and all other functions vested in them in a manner consistent with the Master Plan and public interest to the maximum extent possible (Executive Order No. BJ 2008-7). The Master Plan boundary includes the coastal area potentially at risk under an extreme storm event (the 0.2% annual probability was used during plan formulation). The Master Plan coastal area extends much further inland than the current coastal zone boundary. Therefore, a Master Plan Buffer boundary was established around proposed Master Plan measures to define the area within which an activity could potentially impact implementation of the measure (Halcrow, 2008).  During these events, stakeholders provided valuable input to the process, progress, and goals of this study. Several commenters suggested areas and factors that should be included in the re-evaluation of the boundary. These suggestions consisted of reconsidering the current fastland exemption, evaluating the inclusion of the Atchafalaya Basin and the Old River Control Structure within the CZB, considering the impacts of salinity intrusion in western Louisiana, and determining the effects of downstream flooding from watersheds outside of the current coastal zone. Stakeholders additionally suggested the study team consider data such as fault lines, wind, and the actions of surrounding states as possible data evaluation parameters. The expansion of the role of local and state programs if the current boundary is enlarged was also discussed at several events. The potential for these programs to become overburdened financially and the possibility of existing coastal funding being divided between more parishes were concerns repeated by several stakeholders. Although funding allocation is beyond the scope of the current study, the study team considered several potential solutions to this obstacle. Additional sources such as increased federal funding through NOAA grants and Clean Water Act 319 funds will be explored if the coastal zone is enlarged."}, {"section_title": "Challenges Facing the Louisiana Coast", "text": "Coastal Louisiana contains 40% of the wetlands and 30% of the coastal marsh found in the lower 48 states. Current estimates are that coastal Louisiana has lost about 1352 square miles (mi 2 ) of coastal wetlands between 1956 and 2006 (~27 mi 2 /yr; Barras et al., 2008). In addition, according to land loss estimates, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita transformed 217 mi 2 of marsh to open water in coastal Louisiana (USGS 2006). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that the rate of global sea-level rise is increasing, with a predicted eustatic (global) sea-level rise of 0.2-0.6 m (0.7-2 ft) by the year 2100 (Meehl et al. 2007). However, recent reports indicate that eustatic sea-level rise will likely be one meter (3 ft) or more by 2100 (Vermeer and Rhamstorf 2009). Accelerated rates of eustatic sea-level rise combined with deltaic subsidence significantly increase rates of relative sea-level rise and, subsequently, coastal land loss (Blum and Roberts 2009). Coastal land loss in Louisiana is critical primarily because of the enormous economic value of this area to the state and because of the value of coastal wetlands for storm protection, urban development, and fish and wildlife habitat. Louisiana produces or transports nearly one-third of the nation's oil and gas supply and is tied to 50% of the nation's refining capacity. Ten major navigation routes are located in south Louisiana, along with five of the busiest ports in the U.S. Louisiana provides 26% (by weight) of the commercial fish landings in the lower 48 states and more than five million migratory waterfowl spend the winter in Louisiana's marshes. Forested wetlands also provide stopover habitats for neo-tropical migratory birds crossing the Gulf of Mexico (CPRA 2007). In addition, more than 60% of the state's population lives in Louisiana's coastal parishes (U.S. Census 2008). Coastal land loss is also a contributing factor to the water quality challenges facing the Gulf of Mexico. Wetlands reduce nitrogen and phosphorous in nonpoint source pollution, filter and trap sediments in surface water, and remove Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone some chemical pollutants such as pesticides and heavy metals from water. These wetlands also play an important role in recharging local and regional aquifers. Land loss in coastal Louisiana is directly tied to the forces that formed the coast (Day et al. 2007). Prior to human modification, seasonal overbank flooding of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers deposited large amounts of sediments into the interdistributary wetlands of the Mississippi deltaic plain. Not only did these floods provide an allochthonous source of mineral sediments, which contributed directly to vertical accretion, but also the nutrients associated with these sediments promoted vertical accretion through increased autochthonous organic matter production and deposition and formation of soil through increased root growth. This vertical growth of the wetland surface helped offset high relative sea-level rise caused by natural subsidence of the delta plain, which is as high as 1.5 cm/year (Cahoon et al. 1995(Cahoon et al. , 1999. The construction of flood control levees and closure of distributary channels began soon after colonization of New Orleans by the French in 1719 (Welder 1959, Boesch 1996, Colten 2000. After the great flood of 1927, levees were upgraded and made continuous through the deltaic plain, hydrologically isolating wetlands from nearby rivers and resulting in vertical accretion deficits (relative sea-level rise > accretion) throughout the coastal region. Wetlands have been shown to persist in the face of relative sealevel rise when vertical accretion equals or exceeds the rate of subsidence (Baumann et al. 1984;Delaune et al. 1983;Stevenson et al. 1986), but without the annual flooding and subsequent distribution of sediments, accretion rates decline and wetlands degrade. Even without the problems attributed to flood control levees and closure of channels, Blum and Roberts (2009) estimated that the sediment load of the Mississippi River has declined by 50% through dam construction in the Mississippi Basin, which further compounds the problem of subsidence. Contributing further to vertical accretion deficits, many wetlands in the deltaic region have been hydrologically isolated from surrounding marshes, swamps and bayous due to construction of canals and spoil banks during the past century (Turner and Cordes 1987). In addition to impeding drainage and physically impounding wetlands, spoil banks prevent the overland flow of sediments and nutrients into coastal wetlands, creating essentially ombrotrophic systems from what were naturally eutrophic or mesotrophic systems. In addition, canals promote saltwater intrusion and limit freshwater exchange (Bass and Turner 1977, Deegan 1984, Swenson and Turner 1987. The low-laying lands of southern Louisiana constitute an extremely dynamic environment. It is, therefore, very appropriate that the legally defined area of the coastal zone be reviewed and updated periodically. This report has been designed to provide information necessary for decision makers to consider possible changes to the CZB for the continued effective management of the Louisiana coastal zone. Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone"}, {"section_title": "Public Involvement", "text": "Involving the stakeholders of coastal Louisiana was critical in identifying concerns and potential changes to the current coastal zone boundary. The stakeholders who participated in the public involvement aspect represent a diverse group of governmental entities, civic groups, industry representatives, and individual citizens. Contribution and participation was sought from these groups by holding a series of workshops, meetings, and presentations in strategic locations throughout southern Louisiana. The dates and locations of these events are shown in Table 2. The CZB study Stakeholder Advisory Group (SAG) was created to represent the interests of nongovernment organizations, university researchers, industry leaders, and civic group members. Local government interests were also represented through members of the Parishes Against Coastal Erosion (PACE) group. The OCM conducted two (2) separate meetings with the SAG to receive input for development of the study. The purpose of the initial SAG meeting was to receive input on which vital data parameters should be included in the study and evaluation, while the second meeting was to present a methodology concept and the data sets that were to be analyzed. Stakeholders provided feedback and additional input regarding data analysis and other potential data sets. The Office of Coastal Protection and Restoration (OCPR) stakeholder workshops were an opportunity to present the outline of the study during previously scheduled coastal restoration workshops in New Orleans, Houma, and Lake Charles. Although the OCPR workshops were not originally designated for the purpose of introducing the study to the public, concerned citizens who attended these events were given a presentation of the study and participated in a CZB study question and answer period with the OCM. Members of the Coastal Protection Restoration Authority (CPRA) were also presented with an overview of the study and its progress. The CPRA includes representatives from numerous state agencies. The status presentation was a part of the monthly meeting for December 2009. Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone"}, {"section_title": "Framework", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Criteria for a Redefined Coastal Zone", "text": "In determining appropriate criteria for evaluating Louisiana's current coastal zone and recommending changes that may be desirable, it was necessary to be aware of constraints and directions included in both the CZMA (16 USC 33:1451 et seq.) and the SLCRMA (R.S. 49:214.21 et seq.). Each statute provides guidance and definitions of the term \"coastal zone\" which govern the area appropriate for inclusion in the coastal zone. While the Louisiana SLCRMA could possibly be amended if necessary, attempting to amend the CZMA for this purpose would likely be a long, arduous proposition with little chance of success. In determining what area should be included in the coastal zone of any state, reference must be made to the federal definition of \"coastal zone\" found in \u00a71453(1) of the CZMA that states: \"The term 'coastal zone' means the coastal waters (including the lands therein and thereunder) and the adjacent shorelands (including the waters therein and thereunder), strongly influenced by each other and in proximity to the shorelands of the several coastal states, and includes islands, transitional and intertidal areas, salt marshes, wetlands, and beaches. \u2026The zone extends inland from the shorelines only to the extent necessary to control shorelands, the uses of which have a direct and significant impact on the coastal waters, and to control those geographical areas which are likely to be affected or vulnerable to sea level rise. Excluded from the coastal zone are lands the use of which is by law subject solely to the discretion of or which is held in trust by the Federal Government, its officers or agents.\" The coastal zone has been defined by law in the SLCRMA at \u00a7214.23(5) as: \"\u2026the coastal waters and adjacent shorelands within the boundaries of the coastal zone established by R. S. 49:214.23, which are strongly influenced by each other, and in proximity to the shorelines, and uses of which have a direct and significant impact on coastal waters.\" To further understand the context of the definition of the \"coastal zone\" it is necessary to refer to the definition of \"coastal waters\" defined in the SLCRMA at \u00a7214.23(4) as: \"\u2026bays, lakes, inlets, estuaries, rivers, bayous, and other bodies of water within the boundaries of the coastal zone which have measurable seawater content (under normal weather conditions over a period of years).\" This definition is essentially the same as that which is in the CZMA at \u00a71453 for \"coastal waters\". Louisiana law has a second definition of \"coastal waters\" located in another statute. This definition was developed for the purpose of oil spill contingency planning included in R.S. 30: \u00a72454(2) and states: \"Coastal waters means the waters and bed of the Gulf of Mexico and within the jurisdiction of the state of Louisiana, including the arms of the Gulf of Mexico subject to tidal influence, estuaries, and any other waters within the state if such other waters are navigated by vessels with a capacity to carry ten thousand gallons or more of oil as fuel or cargo.\" To further understand the legal criteria for a CZB meeting federal standards under the CZMA, it is useful to review the federal definition in the CZMA at \u00a71453(2) for the term \"coastal resource of national significance\" defined as: \"\u2026any coastal wetland, beach, dune, barrier island, reef, estuary, or fish and wildlife habitat, if any such area is determined by a coastal state to be of substantial biological or natural storm protection value.\" Because the state coastal zone management program is a federally approved program, any change to the CZB must be approved by NOAA through procedures specified in the CZMA before the new boundary can be recognized as part of the state's approved management program. Federal CZM Program Regulations for implementation of the CZMA set forth the requirements for state coastal management program approval, review of approved programs, and any amendments to an approved program (15 CFR \u00a7923.1 et seq.). These regulations reiterate that \"geographic areas likely to be affected by or vulnerable to sea-level rise\" are subject to the management program, and that an approved program must enable a state to manage certain coastal features and resources through policies that specifically: \"\u2026provide for management of those land and water uses having a direct and significant impact on coastal waters and those geographic areas which are likely to be affected by or vulnerable to sea level rise\u2026 minimize the destruction, loss or degradation of wetlands and preserve and enhance their natural values\u2026 reduce risks of flood loss, minimize the impact of floods on human safety, health and welfare, and preserve the natural, beneficial values served by floodplains\u2026\" The regulations also state at 15 CFR \u00a7932.3(d) that: \"The policies in the program must be appropriate to the nature and degree of management needed for uses, areas, and resources identified as subject to the program.\" Subpart D of the CZM Program Regulations (15 CFR \u00a7923.30 -923.34) sets forth the requirements for management program approvability with respect to boundaries of the coastal zone. Section 923.31 et seq. gives specific requirements with respect to procedures for determining and identifying the inland boundary. These requirements specify that the inland boundary should be described by easy to understand landmarks, stating in part: The inland boundary must be presented in a manner that is clear and exact enough to permit determination of whether property or an activity is located within the management area. \u2026an inland coastal zone boundary defined in terms of political jurisdiction (e.g., county, township or municipal lines) cultural features (e.g., highways, railroads), planning areas (e.g., regional agency jurisdictions, census enumeration districts), or a uniform setback line is acceptable so long as it includes the areas identified.\" The section on inland boundaries also states that the inland boundary of a state's coastal zone may include: \"Watersheds -A state may determine some uses within entire watersheds which have direct and significant impact on coastal waters or are likely to be affected by or vulnerable to sea level rise. In such cases it may be appropriate to define the coastal zone as including these watersheds.\" \"Areas of tidal influence that extend further inland than waters under saline influence; particularly in estuaries, deltas and rivers where uses inland could have direct and significant impacts on coastal waters or areas that are likely to be affected by or vulnerable to sea level rise.\" Louisiana's changing coastal landscape and the management goals and mandates of the CZMA and the SLCRMA provide ample guidance for justifying a revision to the area encompassed by the inland portion of the CZB of Louisiana. This is particularly relevant in light of the great strides made over the past 30 years in the understanding of ecosystem-and watershed-based natural resource management, and with the increased awareness and appreciation for the need to restore and to protect the coast of Louisiana. In the post-Katrina/Rita era of coastal zone management in Louisiana, the scale of management needed is much greater than was thought in the mid-1970s when coastal zone management concepts were just being developed. But both the CZMA and the SLCRMA continue to provide a viable framework for modern ecosystem-based management. The CZMA, as originally drafted, provides criteria for addressing sea-level rise, which now is better understood and regarded more broadly as multiple effects of climate change. In addition, Louisiana amended the SLCRMA in 2007 to restate public policy in coastal zone management to provide for adaptation to climate change within the program. This adaptation is included in the SLCRMA at R. S. 49: \u00a7214.22(8) as: \"To support sustainable development in the coastal zone that accounts for potential impacts from hurricanes and other natural disasters and avoids environmental degradation resulting from damage to infrastructure caused by natural disasters.\" From this there are clearly suggested a number of objective criteria, in both the natural and social sciences, which are appropriately considered to define the state's coastal zone. These are: \u2022 The inland extent of area needed to fully implement the state Master Plan. \u2022 The inland extent of coastal waters as defined by law. \u2022 The inland extent of tidal influence. \u2022 The inland extent of wetland vegetation closely associated with coastal ecosystems. \u2022 The inland extent of fish and wildlife closely associated with coastal ecosystems. \u2022 The inland extent of coastal watersheds. \u2022 The inland extent of projected effects of climate change, including sea-level rise, storm surge, back water flooding and other coastal hazards. \u2022 The inland extent of basic geological features frequently associated with shorelines, such as the Pleistocene terrace. \u2022 The inland extent of the location of coastal dependent or coastal enhanced industry or other commercial activities closely related to the coast. \u2022 The inland extent of coastal recreational activities. \u2022 The inland extent of population centers economically tied to coastal dependent or enhanced economic activities. Thus, there is a clear nexus drawn between the goals and objectives of coastal zone management under the CZMA and SLCRMA and guidance provided regarding the area for inclusion in the state's coastal zone. It is both reasonable and proper for a state to revise and adjust its CZB as conditions change and better scientific information emerges. Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone"}, {"section_title": "Management Scenario for a Redefined Coastal Zone", "text": "Louisiana is one of 35 states and territories eligible to establish a Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) under the federal CZMA, and it has had an approved program since 1980. Many of the eligible states and territories have faced coastal management challenges in delineating the inland extent of their boundaries. Therefore, the coastal zone management programs for other eligible coastal states and territories were evaluated to determine if certain management approaches would be compatible with the Louisiana coastal zone. A matrix was developed to demonstrate the CZMPs based on inland boundary parameters, level of management, and federal, state, and local government involvement (Table 3). States with CZMPs similar to those of Louisiana's existing CZMP were reviewed to determine if specifics from these plans would be of use in the re-evaluation of the coastal zone. An updated inland CZB for Louisiana should encompass all areas subject to coastal processes and all uses which have the potential to impact coastal waters. However, the degree of management needed may vary by location and use. Accordingly, states with hierarchical management or \"tiered\" approaches were analyzed more intensely to evaluate the implementation of a stratified CZB that would include regulation, intergovernmental coordination, and planning area. Eight of the programs reviewed included the entire state or territory within their CZB. Puerto Rico was the only island program that did not include all of its land within its CZB, but rather limited the CZB to land within 1000 feet of the mean high watermark (MHW). Although all of Florida was included inside of its CZB, regulatory authority and program funding were limited to Gulf and Atlantic coastal cities and counties that are contiguous to state water bodies and dominated by marine species of vegetation. Similarly, a total of 16 other programs reviewed utilized some form of management hierarchy to delineate regulatory and/or funding priorities. Like Florida, Rhode Island includes the entire state within its CZB, but limits regulatory authority through a combination of coastal setbacks (200 feet inland from any coastal feature), watersheds and use designations. North Carolina's CZB includes the 20 counties adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean or coastal sound(s) and has further delineated lands into Areas of Environmental Concern (AEC) and those lands adjacent to AEC. AEC are subject to more thorough regulatory controls. Land uses outside of the AEC that have the potential to affect coastal waters are also regulated. Alaska's CZB has three tiers based on biophysical relationships, including: the zone of direct interaction, the zone of direct influence, and the zone of indirect influence. Connecticut has a two-tiered CZB, which includes 36 coastal townships. The highest regulatory management occurs in the first tier which is delineated by 1000 feet setbacks measured from the MHW mark in coastal waters or tidal wetlands; the second tier includes the area between the first tier and the inland boundary of the 36 coastal townships. August 2010   16Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone  Based on the success of hierarchical management in other states, a stratified CZB with management levels for regulatory permits, coastal consistency determinations, and planning is proposed for consideration in Louisiana. Clearly, the area of coastal Louisiana subject to a high level of coastal processes where activities would result in impacts to wetlands and have direct and significant impacts on coastal waters should be included within the updated CZB and should be managed by the strongest tool available, the coastal use permit (CUP) process. Those areas subject to a moderate level of coastal influence adjacent to or having a direct nexus to the CUP strata should also be managed through the coastal zone management program, but the nature and degree of management could be less stringent than the CUP process. Therefore, the proposed hierarchical management approach for the updated Louisiana coastal zone would include management authority defined for areas subject to high and moderate levels of coastal influence. Each of the two management areas would be defined by science-based parameters that describe the level of application of the enforceable policies and mechanisms of the state's coastal management program. Areas not in the coastal zone but contained within or adjacent to watersheds which have potential coastal impacts would be designated as the watershed planning area; activities in the planning area would not be subject to the enforceable policies of the SLCRMA unless an activity's specific effect on coastal waters was demonstrated. However, within the watershed planning area, the coastal zone management program might choose to participate in coastal planning efforts, with or without contributing funding, if the particular planning effort will have coastal ramifications. Nomenclature from the Alaska's CZMP was adapted for use in defining hierarchical management for Louisiana. The proposed hierarchical management for the Louisiana coastal zone is described below."}, {"section_title": "Coastal Use Permit (CUP) Management Area (Zone of Direct Interaction)", "text": "Regulatory management by means of the Coastal Use Permitting (CUP) procedure would be the primary management tool used to regulate activities having a direct and significant impact on coastal waters in this zone of direct interaction.

The boundary for the CUP or regulatory area would be based on the results of the science-based analysis and would include to the maximum extent practical all areas subject to a high level of coastal processes.

The management goal would be to implement Louisiana's Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast through use of intergovernmental coordination mechanisms already in the SLCRMA by their application to governmental bodies at the state and federal level as provided for in the CZMA. Federal consistency review (15 CFR \u00a7 930.1 et seq.) and other management tools would also be used when appropriate. This management area would include areas adjacent to wetlands but at an elevation that generally excludes them from being considered subject to coastal use permitting. It would also include areas that could reasonably be subjected to sea-level rise and storm surge, along with fastlands and federally excluded lands embedded in the CUP management area. The management mechanism for the coordination area would be through review of Corps of Engineers, or other federal and state permits under the federal permit or license provisions, federal assistance, or direct federal action provisions of the CZMA. This mechanism would provide the state the option of influencing the outcome of proposed activities within fastlands or above the 5-foot contour when they were in conflict with the state Master Plan. Activities within the IGC area, particularly those activities related to water quality, hydrologic modifications, sediment budgets, or flood damage reduction, can affect coastal waters and coastal resources of the state. Delineation of an IGC management area would provide a focus area for more intense review of governmental activities in this zone of direct influence, but would in no way limit the authority granted to the Louisiana CZMP through the federal consistency provisions (Section 307 of the federal CZMA), or through any provisions of the existing SLCRMA, to review an activity within or outside the coastal zone for consistency with the Louisiana Coastal Management Program when that activity affects any land or water use or natural resource of the coastal zone.

The CNPCP does not require compliance through permitting but encourages the implementation of BMPs in conjunctions with such agencies as LDEQ and Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry (LDAF). This zone would be the geographic area adjacent to the CUP and IGC areas where only certain activities affect the coastal zone and which are subject to coastal processes only in extreme events related to climate change, such as inundation by severe hurricane or other rainfall event. State influence over land use activities in this management area would be through incentive programs or adoption of watershed or other land use plans. In rare instances, certain uses in the WSP area, such as a major hydrologic modification, could still be subject to review for consistency with the Louisiana coastal management program.

The Pleistocene epoch is followed by the Holocene epoch. Most surface exposures in Louisiana consist of Pleistocene and Holocene sediment. Holocene deposits include alluvium of the Mississippi, Red, Ouachita, and other rivers and smaller tributaries and coastal marsh deposits (Mossa 1996). Holocene deposits occupy about 55% of the surface of Louisiana. Pleistocene deposits consist of sand, gravel, and mud, but underlie raised, flat surfaces with varying degrees of tilt and dissection depending on their relative age. These deposits occupy about 20% of the state's surface and are remnants of pre-existing flood plains, forming along the major rivers in north Louisiana and coast-parallel belts in southern Louisiana. Pleistocene deposits were raised as the coastal plain tilted in response to downwarping of the crustal floor of the Gulf of Mexico. A topographic break occurs at the contact between the Pleistocene and Holocene deposits and this break generally trends in an east-west direction across the state between river basins and north-south along basin corridors. The line of contact is useful in defining the distinction between coastal and non-coastal and wetland and non-wetland characteristics (McIntire et al. 1975).

This is especially true for spatial data, such as Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) and Geographic Information System (GIS), which were extremely useful for completing this project. Table 4 provides a comparison between data utilized in 1975 and data currently available. Much of the data used in the 1975 study were not included in the current study, either because another data source was found to be better suited to the project or because data were available that were not available in 1975. For the delineation of the line of contact between Pleistocene and Holocene sediments, the original study utilized a map provided by Saucier (1974). For the current study a GIS layer (USGS 1998) was available that illustrated the boundary between the two depositional periods. This GIS layer provided a more accurate delineation of the line than was available from Saucier (1974). To identify the 5-foot contour in the 1975 study, the line was transferred from quadrangle maps. LIDAR data was available for the current study showing contour lines in 1-foot increments and these data are more accurate than data available in 1975. Eight-and 10-foot contours from LIDAR data were also used in the current study, but these data were not available in the 1975 study. In the 1975 study, soils data were utilized from Louisiana parish soil maps. These data were used as an indicator of wetlands and uplands (i.e., hydric and non-hydric soils). Because extensive data now exist Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone delineating vegetation type, the soils data were considered unnecessary and, thus, were not included in the current study. In the 1975 study, data from NASA high altitude false-color infrared photography were used to identify coastal marshes and swamps, but no attempt was made to separate the two. Although recent data exist for coastal vegetation types (Sasser et al. 2008), the data set does not extend past the current CZB. In some parishes, the data do not even extend to the current boundary. For the present study, data for the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MLCD) -National Land Cover (NLC) classification were used because these data more fully covered the area of interest than the Sasser et al. (2008) data. Areas inundated by the 100-year flood and tidal inundation were plotted on a map based on information compiled by the USGS and the USACE for the 1975 boundary delineation. Instead of using these data for the current study, data generated by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) using the SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes) model to estimate storm surge heights and winds were used (http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/HAW2/english/surge/slosh.shtml). This model utilizes information about air pressure, hurricane size and speed, and winds and displays color-coded storm surge heights for a particular area in feet above the reference level (the National Geodetic vertical datum). The SLOSH model is generally accurate within plus or minus 20 percent. For inland intrusion of salinity, point-source data were examined and plotted on a map for the 1975 boundary delineation. Because salinity can vary with season and weather (e.g., hurricane or storm passage) and because long-term continuous monitoring were not available, point-source salinity was not considered a reliable indicator of long-term patterns. In addition, salinity was used primarily to indicate areas of intermediate, brackish, and salt marsh. However, vegetation data are considered to be a better indicator of salinity than point-source data and, thus, the NLC data were used for the current study. In the 1975 study, habitat data for Rangia cuneata, Callinectes sapidus, and various fishes were evaluated to help delineate the inland extent of marine influence along the coast, but these data were spotty and ranges of different species can vary from year to year. Habitat data for mammals, reptiles, and birds were also utilized to help delineate non-wetland areas, but the same limitations as previously mentioned for R. cuneata and C. sapidus apply.

In that USGS national map series, the U.S. is divided into 21 major regions and these 21 regions were then subdivided into 222 subregions, 352 accounting units, and 2,150 cataloging units (each of these subdivisions also being represented by 2-digit numbers) to establish the original 8-digit hydrologic unit codes (HUC). For example, for the 8-digit cataloging unit 08060201, the 2-digit region is 08, the 4-digit subregion is 0806, and the 6-digit accounting unit is 080602 (Wilson et al. 2008). The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) uses a coding system similar to that described above. However, the hydrologic coding system for the LDEQ watershed data is based on subdivisions of the 12 major watersheds or river basins (Table 5) into smaller sub-watersheds or management segments. A six-digit number describes the geographic extent of a management area representing the hydrologic basin, watershed segment, and sub-segment. The first two digits represent the hydrologic river basin followed by four more digits that subdivide the basin into two more increments. The hydrology is described with regard to man-made features such as dams and weirs. This coding system, specific to Louisiana, was developed in response to the Clean Water Act of 1972, and is still in use today for many of the state's regulatory programs. Comparison between HUC coding system and the LDEQ coding system was made and the greatest conformity between watershed areas was between the LDEQ river basins and a grouping of the 8-digit HUCs (see Figure 3). While the USGS HUC coding system is the newest generation of watershed, and may become the standard in the future, the LDEQ watershed coding system was used for this study to maintain geographic continuity with other state level regulatory and management policies. Of the 12 major watersheds defined by LDEQ, 10 ultimately drain directly into state coastal waters by their major rivers (or basins), including the Atchafalaya, Barataria Basin, Calcasieu, Mermentau, Mississippi, Pearl, Pontchartrain, Sabine, Terrebonne Basin, and Vermilian-Teche (Figure 4). Because these 10 watersheds drain into the Gulf, their waters have the capacity to directly and significantly impact coastal waters. Thus, delineation of the CZB began at the broadest scale where those 10 watersheds were defined as the study area from which to delineate a coastal zone. As described previously, the line of contact between Pleistocene and more recent (Holocene) sediments provides a basic break between coastal and non-coastal areas. The National Wetlands Resource Center (NWRC) 1998 geology data layer from the May 2007 Louisiana GIS Digital Map compilation DVD was used for the current study. The data set was digitized from a scanned version of a 1:500,000-scale hard copy map of the Geologic Map of Louisiana developed by the Louisiana Geological Survey. The classified data were derived from actual field identification and sampling performed by the Louisiana Geological Survey. These data cover the entire state of Louisiana (USGS, 1998).  The Pleistocene terrace layer of the data set was used to determine the break between Pleistocene and Holocene sediments ( Figure 5). These data show a clear line of contact along the eastern and western areas of the delta, but in the central part of the state alluvial Holocene sediments extend far inland along the Mississippi floodplain. In order to draw the line of contact in the floodplain, Louisiana's Coastal Wetlands Conservation Plan (CWCP) inland boundary, which closely approximates the Louisiana Coastal Area (LCA) Ecosystem Restoration Study boundary line, was also used. The northernmost CWCP designated boundary overlaps the current CZB, falling in and outside of that boundary as determined by the inland limit of tidally influenced fresh marsh and bald cypress/tupelo gum swamps (LDNR 2009; Figure 6)."}, {"section_title": "Description of elevation data set", "text": "NOAA defines LIDAR as a remote sensing system used to collect topographic data. This technology is used by NOAA and the NASA scientists to document topographic changes along shorelines. These data are collected with aircraft-mounted lasers capable of recording elevation measurements at a rate of 2,000 to 5,000 pulses per second with a vertical precision of 15 centimeters (6 inches). The most commonly used source of LIDAR data is dated 2003 and is obtained from the USGS and Louisiana State University's Atlas website (http://atlas.lsu.edu/). The 2003 LIDAR data were used to evaluate elevation for the current study (Figure 7). Five-, eight-and ten-foot elevation contours were evaluated. The fivefoot contour was used because this elevation is generally accepted as the breakpoint between coastal wetland and non-wetland areas. The eight-and ten-foot elevation contours were considered when defining the coastal zone because of the potential for sea-level rise to change coastal land elevation. If the \"worst case\" predictions of eustatic sea-level rise are realized, then land which is currently at an elevation of 5 feet will be at an elevation of 2 feet by the year 2100. If this occurs, land that is currently at an elevation of 8 feet will have an elevation of 5 ft by 2100 and land that currently has an elevation of 10 feet will have an elevation of 7 feet by 2100. Consideration of changes in sea-level rise are important when delineating a new coastal boundary because, particularly in Louisiana, changes in sea level will have significant impacts on coastal areas. It should be noted that while LIDAR data are extremely convenient and typically accurate to plus or minus six inches, the data are not error free especially in densely developed areas where buildings and man-made structures interfere with the detection of true ground elevation. In the absence of groundtruthed data, which have a much greater degree of accuracy but are expensive to collect, LIDAR data are widely used and accepted as a common source for topographic data. "}, {"section_title": "Description of vegetative land cover data sets", "text": "The primary vegetation data sources selected for evaluating the Louisiana CZB were the USGS marsh type classification maps and the MLCD NLC data. The USGS data set encompasses the southern extent of Louisiana (Figure 8) and depicts fresh, intermediate, brackish, and saline marsh. The data were collected by recording vegetation type at pre-determined points along north to south ground transects at evenly spaced intervals. Ground truth points were interpolated and converted into digital polygons that represent marsh type for different years, including 1949, 1968, 1978, 1988, and 2007. The marsh change data layers were derived from digital change detection between years. The MLCD is composed of several federal agencies working together to provide land cover data to the nation. Some of the federal entities include the USGS, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), NOAA, U.S. Forest Service (USFS), NASA, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and NRCS. The NLC data set is a result of multivariate statistical analysis of digital brightness values derived from a satellite sensor. It characterizes the land cover of Louisiana from a regional perspective for year 2001 ( Figure 9). Its native digital format can discern land cover types by its spectral reflectance properties using color infrared light. The NLC data set has fifteen land cover classifications, which include nine vegetative attributes. The MLCD data are a result of multivariate statistical analysis of digital brightness values. A pixel representing 30 square meters on the earth's surface is classified into a land cover category. Thirty square meter representation is intended to capture general categories such as wetlands, forests, and urban developed land cover as opposed to the more specific USGS marsh type classification. The NLC emergent herbaceous wetlands land cover category used for this study is roughly equivalent to the fresh, intermediate, brackish and salt marsh categories in the USGS data set ( Figure 10). Although collected using different methods, the NLC satellite sensor and USGS marsh type data can be integrated to convey a more comprehensive evaluation of Louisiana's coastal zone. However, for the purposes of this study, only the NLC data set was used because it covered more area than the USGS data set, which primarily characterized marsh vegetation below the current CZB.

In Louisiana, activities such as agriculture, forestry, urban runoff, home sewage systems, sand and gravel mining, construction and hydromodifications contribute to NPS pollution when proper management practices are not followed. While NPS pollution was not considered in the 1975 study, it was important in the current study to include the contribution of NPS pollution to coastal eutrophication in watersheds that drain to the Gulf of Mexico. Louisiana's Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Control Program (CNPCP) is managed by LDNR and was established after the U.S. Congress passed the Coastal Zone Act Reauthorization Amendments that entrusted states to develop and implement coastal nonpoint source pollution control programs. Nonpoint source pollution is important to consider when delineating a new coastal zone boundary because there are 10 watersheds that ultimately drain to the Gulf of Mexico within Louisiana. Thus, in order to protect coastal waters, nutrients and sediments draining from these watersheds must be managed. The CNPCP has legally defined boundaries which identify the legal jurisdiction of the program and which identifies those areas most in need of NPS pollution management to reduce impacts to the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure  11).

If one takes the maximum the water reaches at any point in time at every grid cell in a SLOSH basin, a composite \"Maximum Envelope of Water\" (MEOW) plot can be made. MEOW plots are created for every category of storm moving in a particular direction, usually stratified by forward speed and tide elevation. Simulations are run using a variety of storm sizes. If the maximum storm surge height for all the MEOW plots at every grid cell is taken, a worst-case storm surge for the coast for each Saffir-Simpson hurricane categories (Category 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) can be generated. The \"Maximum Of the MEOWs\", or \"MOMs\" are plotted in the SLOSH storm surge images ( Figure 12) and are the composite worst-case scenario storm surges from about 15,000 different hypothetical hurricanes for each SLOSH basin. All of the MOM images provided in this analysis are for high tide and were performed using the 2009 version of the NOAA SLOSH Display Package. The colors show either the water depth as pure surge above the vertical datum level (at mean tide), or the storm tide (i.e., the height above the vertical datum level of the storm surge plus an additional rise in case the storm hits at high tide). The geographic extent of the state Master Plan was defined by the area potentially at risk of inundation under the 0.2% annual probability of occurrence (1 in 500 years) storm event (Halcrow, 2008).

Among the 50 states in 2007, Louisiana ranked 1 st in oil production, and 2 nd in marketed gas production. Louisiana ranked 3 rd in natural gas reserves in 2007. Thousands of miles of pipelines cross the coastal wetlands carrying crude oil from the Gulf of Mexico to refineries in Louisiana and other states and transporting natural gas and refined products such as gasoline to all parts of the U.S. Employment in nonagricultural jobs for 2007 show 46,764 in oil and gas production, 25,998 in the chemical industry, 12,233 in petroleum and 1,168 in the pipeline industry (LA Energy Facts Annual 2008). Oil and gas resources are found in large reserves offshore from Louisiana in the federally controlled Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) in the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico OCS is the largest U.S. oil-producing region and contains some of the nation's largest oil fields. Crude oil reserves in Louisiana account for approximately 2 percent of total U.S. oil reserves, and about 5 percent of U.S. natural gas reserves. Employment in the oil and gas industry provides 320,000 jobs, producing more than $12.7 billion in household income, and creating $70.2 billion in sales for Louisiana companies (Louisiana Economic Development 2009).

The effects of these hazards are magnified due to increasing coastal populations and the continued loss of natural protection features such as coastal wetlands and barrier islands. As Louisiana residents know too well, the economic impacts of natural disasters on businesses, private citizens, the public sector, and infrastructure can be quite significant. Therefore, reducing the risks from coastal hazards is a key component of the Louisiana CZMP. Managing development in a sustainable manner can help to reduce risk, but the only way to effectively protect people is evacuation. Figure 16 and Figure 17 depict phased evacuation areas and designated evacuation routes. The Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP) has developed an evacuation plan for coastal Louisiana which includes phased evacuation (Figure 16). A threat of a hurricane will begin a phased evacuation of citizens based on the location and time the storm is forecasted to impact coastal areas. Phase I will begin 50 hours before onset of tropical storm winds and include areas south of the Intracoastal Waterway. These areas are outside any hurricane protection levee system and are vulnerable to Category 1 and 2 storms. These areas are depicted in red on the Evacuation Map.

If this natural capital were treated as an economic asset, the delta's minimum asset value would be $330 billion to $1.3 trillion (Batker et al. 2009). Valuable goods and ecosystems services of marine waters, wetlands, swamps, agricultural lands, and forests include hurricane and flood protection, water supply, water quality, recreation, and fisheries. The Mississippi River Delta is a vast natural asset and it was built by building land with sediment, fresh water, and the energy of the Mississippi River (Batker et al. 2009). However, rising sea levels, along with other factors such as levee construction and subsidence, cause land loss and, thus, result in a loss of economic assets. Rising sea level will have serious socioeconomic implications for the state of Louisiana. As shown earlier in the report, it is likely that sea level will rise by at least one meter by 2100. Two recent reports suggest that sea-level rise will be between 1.0 and 1.5 m by 2100 (Pfeffer et al. 2008, Vermeer andRahmstorf 2009). The projected rates of sea-level increase by Vermeer and Rahmstorf are shown in Figure 18. The lower three bars of Figure 18 show earlier projected sea-level rise using a 3.2 mm/year rise. Sea level is currently rising at between 3.5 and 4.0 mm/year. The curves in Figure 18 show new estimates for sea-level rise. The range of estimates is from 0.75 to 1.90 meters with best estimate mid range projections of 1.0 to 1.5 m. Such high rates of sea-level rise have serious implications for coastal Louisiana. Blum and Roberts (2009) developed a projection for coastal wetlands taking into consideration accelerated sea-level rise and reduction of sediment transport in the Mississippi River. They used a sea-level rise rate of 0.4 m by 2100. This is about one third to one half of current projections for sea-level rise, so the results of Blum and Roberts should be considered conservative. They produced a map of the loss of coastal wetlands that shows that most wetlands will be lost by 2100 ( Figure 19). Over half of the population of Louisiana lives in the southern part of the state and according to NOAA Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone about one third, or about 1.3 million people live at or below sea level. Over 70% of the population of Jefferson and Orleans parishes live below sea level. Rising sea levels will put these people at increasing risk. There is also a tremendous amount of infrastructure in the coastal zone that is at increasing risk because of sea-level rise. Source: Mississippi Delta in 2100.

The term \"integrated coastal zone management\" was coined in 1992 during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro and it describes an adaptive, integrated approach for achieving sustainable resource management that seeks to balance economic development and use of the coastal region, protection and preservation of coastal areas, minimization of loss of human life and property, and public access to the coastal zone. Ecosystem-based management aims to protect ecosystem structure, functioning, and processes; recognize the interconnectedness within and among systems; integrate ecological, social, economic, and institutional perspectives; and be place-based or area-based (NOAA, 2010). Effective coastal spatial planning has three essential attributes. They are: 1. Multi-objective -Coastal spatial planning balances ecological, social, economic, and governance objectives. 2. Spatially focused -The coastal area to be managed must be clearly defined and large enough to incorporate relevant ecosystem processes. 3. Integrated -The planning process should address the interrelationships and interdependence of each component within the defined management area, including natural processes, activities, and authorities. To delineate zones for coastal management based on available spatial data, a modified version of the ArcGIS natural breaks method was used. This method uses a statistical formula, known as Jenks algorithm, to determine natural clusters of attribute values. The Jenks algorithm is a standard method for dividing a dataset into a certain number of homogenous classes or zones. The purpose is to minimize the variance within a class and to maximize the variance between classes. The natural breaks method can be used on many different types of data, as long as the data are represented spatially. One example of the use of this method in coastal zone management is described below. Paxinos et al. (2008) describes a GIS-based zoning methodology for the development of marine planning in South Australia. The goal of this ecosystem-based approach was to create a zoning system using habitat and species occurring within the marine environment, and to identify and define spatial boundaries of each zone. The key assumption of this type of approach was that the data available reasonably reflected the correct spatial distribution of the ecological parameters fundamental to the function of the ecosystem and its biological diversity. GIS data for the planning area were collected and approximately 70 GIS spatial layers were developed based on environmental and habitat data. The planning area was then divided into grid cells of equal size (5x5 km).

The Intergovernmental Coordination (IGC) area would consist of that portion of the study area subject to a moderate level of coastal processes and, as measured by the ecological analysis methodology employed for this project, receiving a grid score of 3-6. The management strategy used in the IGC is proposed to be the management of the direct actions of governmental bodies affecting the coastal zone. But within this area the individual actions of residents, private businesses, private industry, and landowners on a project-by-project basis would not be scrutinized. A Watershed Planning (WSP) area, in addition to the two management areas contained with the 2010 SBB, is also recommended. The adjacent watershed planning area (WSP) located north of and adjacent to the coastal zone, would not be a part of the coastal zone, but would be eligible for participation in certain broad, watershed planning efforts that overlap portions of the legally defined coastal zone. The WSP would be the area defined as having a low score of coastal affinity, based on the ecological analysis methodology used for this project, and receiving a ranking score lower than 3. This could include some areas with a score of 0 in the ecological analysis, but that are nonetheless important areas where planning initiatives relative to water quality, ecosystem protection and flood control would be appropriate.

The generally proposed boundary for each area is described in this section.  "}, {"section_title": "Next Steps: Implementing an Updated Coastal Zone", "text": "This document presents the findings of a comprehensive science-based evaluation of the adequacy of the current inland boundary to meet the state's present and future needs to manage, protect, and restore its coastal resources. A guiding principle for this study was the need for balance between creating an overly expansive coastal zone and identifying a coastal zone which was sufficient to manage emerging coastal issues over the next several decades, especially those pertaining to climate change, sea-level rise, nonpoint source pollution, and coastal and marine spatial planning. In addition, a critical factor to consider was delineating a management area based on science and geography that would allow for coastal management in the area covered by the Louisiana Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast. The Coastal Management Program and the Master Plan should work in tandem to protect coastal waters and coastal resources and to insure that upstream activities do not inadvertently limit the state's ability to implement Master Plan measures. Based on the analyses presented in this document, it is recommended that the current coastal zone boundary be expanded and a hierarchical management approach be adopted that would allow the state to effectively manage, protect, and restore its coastal resources. The expanded coastal zone would include two management areas and would encompass all areas subject to high and moderate coastal processes; activities in the coastal zone would be subject to the enforceable policies of the SLCRMA. Areas not in the coastal zone but contained within or adjacent to watersheds that could potentially affect the coastal zone would be managed by planning initiatives; activities in the planning area would not be subject to the enforceable policies of the SLCRMA unless an activity specific effect on coastal waters was demonstrated. The recommended management areas would include: There are potential benefits to an expanded coastal zone. Increased planning initiatives in watersheds that are partially within the coastal zone or adjacent to watersheds that touch the coastal zone will strengthen the state's ability to work with local governments to reduce nonpoint source pollution and limit other factors which could potentially affect coastal waters and coastal resources. Increased oversight in the IGC management area of riparian activities and public works projects that include hydrologic modifications would insure that these activities do not limit the long term planning goals established by the state Master Plan. Table 12 lists some potential advantages of being in the coastal zone and Table 13 provides a comparison between the CUP and IGC management areas.

More opportunities and options for certain mitigation activities may be available."}, {"section_title": "Necessary Changes in State Law", "text": "While this report provides a framework for establishing an expanded coastal zone with hierarchical management, changes in state law would be required for implementation. If the 2010 science-based boundary is approved, a significant rewriting of the current coastal zone boundary statute, La. R.S. 49:214.24, would have to be completed to accommodate the new management areas. Statutory changes would need to be adopted to create and to establish the CUP and IGC areas. The statutory changes should include a description and purpose of these two management areas. Existing statutes would also need to be reviewed to determine if use of the term \"coastal zone\" in all instances appropriately refers to both management units and if other minor changes were needed to make sure that the hierarchical management approach is implemented effectively and efficiently. The current inland boundary of the Louisiana coastal zone is very complex and, in some places, seems illogical when viewed on a map of the state or traveling along one of the highways or waterways that is a designated boundary segment. Consider, one example, the three \"fingers\" of ridge land that are outside of the coastal use permit area in the Terrebonne-Lafourche basin. The Bayou Dularge, Bayou Petit Caillou, and Bayou Grand Caillou ridges all are outside of the current boundary but are surrounded by land that is within the coastal zone. Further, the law defines the boundary as the \"edge of the ridge\" which is somewhat subjective and, given the high rate of subsidence and low elevations, this boundary can change over time. Similarly, in western Louisiana, the Intracoastal Waterway serves as the coastal zone boundary, but the environment outside the coastal zone is indistinguishable from that inside the Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone coastal zone. Likewise, in southeastern Louisiana, the coastal zone boundary meanders along waterways and parish boundaries in a convoluted way that excludes nearly all of Assumption and Ascension parishes, despite the fact that there are extensive \"coastal\" wetlands in both parishes that are contiguous with wetlands included in the coastal zone. Delineating an expanded CUP management area would correct the deficiencies of an outdated coastal zone boundary that was established in an era when the importance of coastal resources, particularly for storm surge reduction, was not fully appreciated. It would also help to reduce some of the confusion that the public experiences with regard to wetlands permitting. Many people cannot recognize wetlands subject to USACE Section 404 jurisdiction and erroneously believe that if an area is outside of the coastal zone and is not marsh then a permit is not needed. This may lead to the issuance of a USACE cease and desist order or other action, which can be very costly in terms of time and money. Inclusion of an IGC management area within the coastal zone would allow the state to more efficiently regulate alterations of upland and inland water resources that may affect surface water flows, including addressing issues of flooding and stormwater treatment. These types of alterations are generally associated with public works projects and are often well beyond the planning stage before they come under review for potential effects on coastal waters or coastal resources. While current coastal management regulations allow the OCM to review these types of governmental activities for consistency with the coastal management plan, they are not subject to routine review and many activities are fully implemented before their effects are realized. Because the Master Plan and coastal zone boundaries do not coincide, the effects of activities outside of the current coastal zone could result in consequences that are inconsistent with the Master Plan. The IGC boundary would identify those areas where upland activities have a higher potential to affect downstream resources or Master Plan measures and provide a process for governmental agencies to apply for a consistency concurrence prior to committing scarce funding to a project that may come under scrutiny down the line. Further, including areas subject to a moderate level of coastal affinity within the coastal zone would relieve the OCM from the often timeconsuming task of substantiating that a particular project outside of the coastal zone would impact coastal waters or coastal resources, every time a project was reviewed outside the CUP area. The concept of a stratified coastal zone with resources managed through two zones and an adjacent planning zone that includes coastal watersheds and watersheds adjacent to the coastal zone would not necessarily expand governmental control, but would memorialize Executive Order BJ 08-07 which states: \"All state agencies shall administer their regulatory practices, programs, contracts, grants, and all other functions vested in them in a manner consistent with the Master Plan and public interest to the maximum extent possible.\" The updated coastal zone would also expand the defined area of concern for the state with regard to federal agency policy and action in the IGC under federal law. For example, federal operation of the Old River Control Structure would be a direct federal action performed in the coastal zone and would therefore require a consistency determine from the state prior to a direct federal action. As the coastal zone exists now, the state would first have to document how the direct federal action would impact the coastal zone prior to reviewing the action for coastal consistency. Many circumstances have changed over time in the arena of coastal zone management, along with advances in the science on which that management is based. As the state moves forward with its coastal restoration initiative, it has become increasingly evident that rejection of the 1975 science-based coastal zone boundary in favor of a smaller, more politically acceptable coastal zone has unwittingly created challenges that must be overcome. A prime example is Bayou Lafourche. Poorly planned development in the bayou's riparian zone and hydrologic modifications that limit the freshwater flow are challenges that must be overcome in order to protect the drinking water source of over 300,000 citizens and restore the region's coastal wetlands south of the Mississippi River. Reconnecting Bayou Lafourche and the Mississippi River is imperative to the survival of the region, but the fear of flooding and negative impacts to bayou side facilities and other structures build close to the water's edge have hampered efforts to reintroduce freshwater into the bayou. Congress is currently poised to reconsider the CZMA and is likely to reauthorize the legislation with significant modification and Louisiana has initiated the 2012 Master Plan Update. For these reasons it is both timely and appropriate to update Louisiana's coastal zone boundary to more accurately reflect current conditions and to incorporate the current paradigm of integrated coastal zone management for sustainable development. An expanded coastal zone that includes two management levels and an adjacent planning area would allow for appropriate management of the entire coastal area based on the nature and degree of management needed for specific uses, areas and resources. It should be noted that the Louisiana Legislature has already approved the addition of Ascension parish to the Louisiana coastal zone. Senate Bill 65, adopted in the 2010 Regular Session and enrolled as Act No. 956, established that \"the inland boundary of the coastal zone shall also include all or any portions of the parishes of Ascension and Iberville recommended for inclusion in the coastal zone by the final report of the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana prepared in response to Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 60 of the 2009 Regular Session.\" Accordingly, Ascension parish will be incorporated into the Louisiana Coastal Zone six months following approval of the boundary change for that parish by the CPRA."}, {"section_title": "Implementation Mechanisims", "text": "One approach is to allow the Secretary of DNR, through the OCM, to determine the exact boundary based on the results of this study and to implement it through either rulemaking or by resolution approved by the legislature. This means the inland coastal zone boundary would no longer be legislatively defined. La. R.S. 49:214.24 would remain largely the same and the seaward and interstate boundaries would not change. However, subsection C, governing the inland boundary, would be modified to allow the Secretary to define the inland boundary in accordance with the Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act. Subsection D would also be modified to authorize the secretary to amend the boundary in accordance with the Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act. Lastly, a subsection E could be written to require the Secretary to conduct periodic reviews of the inland boundary to ensure the coastal zone covers all areas necessary for effective management of the state's coastal resources. A second approach would be to parallel the way the current boundary is regulated in the SLCRMA. La. R.S. 49:214.24 would remain largely the same and the seaward and interstate boundaries would not change. However, subsection C, governing the inland boundary, would be modified by legislative act to define the two management areas of the coastal zone and their respective boundaries. Thus, the updated coastal zone boundary, consisting of the two management areas recommended in this report could be implemented thorough regulation or statue. The Legislature enacts statutes. Administrative agencies adopt, amend and repeal regulations under the authority granted to them by statutes and in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act. Other coastal states have used both methods in establishing their coastal zone, with many providing a brief boundary description in the enabling legislation for their coastal management program that refers to the full boundary description contained in the coastal zone management plan, as approved by NOAA. Other states make reference to official boundary maps maintained by the regulatory agency. This referencing of the approved NOAA plan or official maps seems to rely on the rule-making process since a specific boundary description is usually not included elsewhere in the statue. The statute method is more often used when the boundary is simple and based on political subdivisions. For example, the coastal zone of Mississippi is defined by statute as comprising all of Handcock, Harrison and Jackson Counties (Mississippi Code, 15 \u00a757-15-6(f)), and the coastal zone of Georgia is defined as: \"\u2026all tidally influenced waters and submerged land seaward to the state's jurisdictional limits and all lands, submerged lands, waters, and other resources within the Counties of Brantley,Bryan,Camden,Charlton,Chatham,Effingham,Glynn,Long,Liberty,McIntosh, The states of Alabama, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Texas all use the administrative rule making process to define their coastal zones. Alabama uses a coastal zone definition adapted from the federal CZMA in its statue: Regardless of the implementation approach chosen to update Louisiana's coastal zone, future evaluations of the CZB should be conducted. Because of the dynamic nature of the coast and the implications of rising sea level, it is recommended that the CZB be re-analyzed periodically to evaluate the effects on the landscape, coastal populations, and infrastructure. Because of the rapidity of change, this should be done every ten years. The re-evaluations should use a GIS approach and similar methods as were used in this study. New technology and approaches should be incorporated as appropriate. Additionally, the coastal zone boundary should be maintained in an electronic GIS format on a website that is publically available. In this way, it can be consulted by any person or group considering any activity in the coastal zone."}, {"section_title": "Federal Requirements for Amending the State's Coastal Zone Management Program", "text": "In order to maintain a national CZM program with an updated boundary, the NOAA program change process must be conducted. Under NOAA's CZM program, a substantial change in a state's coastal zone boundary is considered an \"amendment\" to its coastal zone program (as opposed to a \"routine program change,\" which has a different set of procedures that are generally less burdensome). Coastal states are allowed to amend their approved coastal zone management programs but only under certain conditions. Proposed amendments must be submitted by the head of the state agency in charge of the management program (for Louisiana: Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources) to the Assistant Administrator for Ocean Services and Coastal Zone Management for approval. At least one public hearing must be held on the proposed amendment with notice of the hearing given at least 30 days prior to the hearing. The amendment requests must include: 1. A description of the proposed change, 2. An explanation of why the change is necessary and appropriate, including a discussion of the following factors as relevant: changes in coastal zone needs, problems, issues or priorities, 3. A copy of the public notice(s) announcing the public hearing(s), 4. A summary of the hearing(s) comments, and 5. Documentation of opportunities provided to relevant federal, state, regional, and local agencies, port authorities and other interested public and private parties to participate in the development and approval at the state level of the proposed amendment. After submission of the request, the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) will review the request to make a preliminary determination as to whether the state's management program would still constitute an approved program if the proposed change(s) were implemented. If the program would still constitute an approved program, the Assistant Administrator will then determine whether a National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) environmental impact statement is required. The Secretary of Commerce has 30 days to approve or disapprove the proposed amendment; he may extend this review period up to 120 days (from the date he received the proposed amendment) in order to meet the requirements of NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). For a complete review of the statutory requirements for amending a coastal zone management program see 15 CFR 923.80 et seq. and 16 USC 1455(e)."}, {"section_title": "Financial Effects of Amending the Coastal Zone Boundary", "text": "The overall goal for amending the CZB is effective management over the full range of south Louisiana subject to coastal processes. However, recognizing that governmental resources are finite, the implemented plan should not grow state government without providing options for also growing the resources needed to implement the recommended management strategy, and then only to the minimum extent necessary. The expanded coastal zone would only add one parish, Ascension, to the coastal zone management area subject to CUP regulation. An additional 15 parishes would be added to the coastal zone through inclusion wholly or partially within the IGC management area. Some parishes would also be included in the adjacent WSP area, but these parishes would not be part of the designated coastal zone. Increased regulatory responsibility requiring additional resources will be a major concern, especially for parish governments having or contemplating an LCP. This is a valid concern for parishes where management by CUP could be expanded, but less so for those which would be essentially the same. In addition to the potential for an increase in workload, parishes that currently have an approved LCP might require additional resources to review and to update their coastal management program documents. The recommended CZB would increase the number of parishes in the CUP area from 19 to 20, which could reduce resources for the CUP area if alternative funding is not identified. Potential funding options include use of either the state or local portion of GOMESA funds, except for Ascension parish, which would not be eligible for local GOMESA funds unless federal laws were changed. But, more importantly, state GOMESA funds could be used for any parish in the defined coastal zone under current GOMESA guidelines. Provisions for a hierarchical funding structure could be made in the legislation revising the coastal zone. Only parishes with an approved LCP which regulates uses in the CUP management area should be afforded full funding since this management strategy would require the greatest level of effort. Parishes in the IGC management area should be funded at a lesser level when additional funds become available because of their lesser responsibility. Funding should be contingent upon development of a source of recurring revenue, such as state GOMESA funds, which might support an IGC coastal advisory committee or similar parish entity at some determined level. IGC parishes should also be eligible for inclusion in any emerging revenue stream, such as an Ocean and Coastal Trust Fund at the national level. Both the Pew Oceans Commission and the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy support a permanent Ocean Policy Trust Fund or similar permanent fund with dedicated sources of revenues to fund coastal and ocean policy (Pew Oceans Commission, 2003;U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy. 2004). Planning initiatives and development of watershed management plans for the WSP area would be eligible for funding on a project by project basis for planning and implementation, especially as it might pertain to implementing and advancing the goals of the CNPCP."}, {"section_title": "Increase in Permitting Jurisdiction", "text": "Louisiana's CZMP is funded in large part by a grant from NOAA, authorized under Section 306 of the CZMA. Louisiana receives $2,000,000 per year under this grant and this amount is the maximum that any one state may receive. This money must be matched by the state dollar for dollar. Fees related to permitting and consistency determinations, as well as other fees generated by the CZMP, are deposited into the Coastal Resources Trust Fund (CRTF) and used to match the NOAA grant. Logically, an increase in the size of the coastal zone would equate to a larger area that would be subject to coastal use permitting. The CZMP also receives state money from the Coastal Protection and Restoration Trust Fund each year, which is also used as match for federal CZMA funds. LDNR, in running Louisiana's CZMP, is responsible for facilitating the permitting process and the agency incurs costs in doing so. However, some of these administrative costs would likely be covered by the fees attached to permitting applications and consistency determinations. It is difficult to determine whether LDNR would suffer a significant financial burden from increased permitting. On the other hand, additional parishes would be added to the coastal zone, and these newly added parishes could seek to have their own local coastal management programs. LDNR shares the costs of establishing such programs with the local authority. The funds LDNR currently receives would likely be insufficient to cover the costs of establishing new local coastal management programs. LDNR should seek other sources of funding or cut costs in other areas in order to meet its share of establishing new local programs. Another solution is to push for the Congressional Appropriations Committee to remove the $2,000,000 cap on coastal management funds, seeking higher appropriations for states through CZMA within NOAA budget. Under the formula for awarding such funds, Louisiana would receive an increase in funds if the cap were removed. Lastly, GOMESA funds could be used to help cover the costs associated with establishing local programs in the expanded coastal zone, since the SLCRMA is a federally-approved coastal management plan, and implementation of a federally-approved marine, coastal, or comprehensive conservation management plan is an authorized use of GOMESA funds."}, {"section_title": "Effects on Parishes Already in the Coastal Zone", "text": "Adopting an updated inland boundary to the coastal zone will have little effect on most of the 19 parishes already in the Louisiana coastal zone. And, as previously discussed, the issue areas will be associated with increased workload in a parish where more area is included into the coastal zone and which has an approved local coastal program, and from potentially diminished opportunities for funding of local coastal programs should one or more additional parishes ultimately be included into the CUP area or otherwise be authorized for funding through OCM's existing resources. It is worth noting that currently only nine of the 19 eligible coastal parishes have approved local programs funded by OCM. Several other parishes have expressed an interest in establishing such programs, so OCN's limited ability to find local programs is already stretched. The issue which the state should focus on is securing sufficient funding to adequately support the implementation of local coastal programs as discussed elsewhere in this report. The recommendations made in this document will not significantly alter the state's ability to fund existing local programs when compared to the pressure already potentially present from eligible parishes not yet seeking local programs. Certain federal programs related to OCS revenue sharing have attracted the attention of coastal parishes. The Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) allocates $250 million of Outer Continental Shelf revenues per year (from 2007 -2010) to eligible states. Some of this money can go directly to a parish if it is included in Louisiana's coastal zone. However, newly included parishes would not qualify to receive the funds due to certain time and geographic restrictions. The state could spend CIAP money on projects in newly included parishes only in very limited circumstances because of authorized use restrictions. Funding through GOMESA is under similar restrictions as CIAP, and CIAP will soon expire unless reauthorized. CPRA has \"discretion to approve all requests for integrated coastal protection programs and projects in the coastal area, insofar as such requests are for funds to be appropriated from the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund.\" Coastal Protection and Restoration funds are not allocated to parishes within the coastal area on any type of pro-rata basis but rather on a project specific basis. Projects are thoroughly evaluated and subject to a \"project benefit scoring procedure\" before being selected for funding. These checks and balances would prevent an increase in the coastal zone from significantly decreasing the CPRA funds available for projects in parishes already in the coastal zone. Therefore, even though parishes receive some funds on the basis of being in the coastal zone, an increase in the coastal zone is likely to have little effect on those funds. Other programs were identified as being sources of funds for coastal protection and restoration but did not have provisions relating to the coastal zone and would therefore be unaffected by an increase in the coastal zone. Both issues are covered in greater detail in Appendix D. Defining Louisiana's Coastal Zone"}, {"section_title": "Conclusions and Recommendations", "text": "The purpose of this study was to conduct a science-based evaluation of the adequacy of the current inland boundary of the coastal zone of Louisiana to meet the state's current and future needs to manage, protect and restore its coastal resources, as directed by Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 60, Regular Session 2009 of the Louisiana Legislature. A guiding principle for this study was the need for balance between creating an overly expansive coastal zone and identifying a coastal zone which was sufficient to manage emerging coastal issues over the next several decades, especially those pertaining to climate change, sealevel rise, nonpoint source pollution, and coastal and marine spatial planning. In addition, a critical factor to consider was delineating a management area based on science and geography that would allow for coastal management in the area covered by the Louisiana Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast. Based on the analyses presented in this document, it is recommended that the current coastal zone boundary be expanded and a hierarchical management approach be adopted. The expanded coastal zone would include two management areas and would encompass all areas subject to high and moderate coastal processes; activities in the coastal zone would be subject to the enforceable policies of the State and Local Coastal Resource Management Act (SLCRMA). Figure 30 depicts the recommended coastal zone boundary. Areas not in the coastal zone but contained within or adjacent to watersheds that could potential affect the coastal zone would be managed by planning initiatives; activities in the planning area would not be subject to the enforceable policies of the SLCRMA unless an activity specific effect on coastal waters was demonstrated. The two recommended management areas would include a Coastal Use Permit (CUP) area and an Intergovernmental Coordination (ICG) area. The Coastal Use Permit (CUP) area is defined by this report as that area of the coastal zone having a high level of affinity for coastal processes as measured by the methodology employed by this project, a grid score of 7-9. This area is most subject to coastal processes and most in need of a high level of management. The CUP area was found to be most of the current coastal zone, but extends farther north in much of the study area as shown in Figure 30. The management methods employed for the CUP area would be as they are for the current coastal zone, relying primarily on the coastal use permit authority of the state to manage land and water activities. Appropriate intergovernmental coordination management methods would also apply in this area. Delineating an expanded CUP management area would correct the deficiencies of an outdated coastal zone boundary that was established in an era when the importance of coastal resources, particularly for storm surge reduction, was not fully appreciated. It would also help to reduce some of the confusion that the public experiences with regard to wetlands permitting. Activities in wetland areas, even those outside of the current coastal zone, are already regulated by the USACE. Expanding the CUP boundary will bring more area under state management where activities might be eligible for permits through the programmatic general permit process, which is much simpler and faster than the USACE Section 404 permit process. The Intergovernmental Coordination (IGC) area would consist of that portion of the study area having moderate association with coastal processes as measured by the ecological analysis methodology employed for this project, a grid score of 3-6. The management strategy used in the IGC is proposed to be the management of the direct actions of governmental bodies affecting the coastal zone. But within this area the individual actions of residents, private businesses, private industry, and landowners on a project-by-project basis would not be scrutinized. Inclusion of an IGC management area within the coastal zone would allow the state to more efficiently regulate alterations of upland and inland water resources that may affect surface water flows, including addressing issues of flooding and stormwater treatment. While current coastal management regulations allow the Office of Coastal Management (OCM) to review these types of governmental activities for consistency with the coastal management plan, they are not subject to routine review and many activities are fully implemented before their effects are realized. The IGC boundary would identify those areas where upland activities have a higher potential to affect downstream resources, allowing governmental agencies to apply for a consistency concurrence prior to committing scarce funding to a project that may come under scrutiny down the line. Including areas subject to a moderate level of coastal affinity within the coastal zone would relieve the OCM from the often time-consuming task of substantiating that a particular project outside of the coastal zone would impact coastal waters or coastal resources. A Watershed Planning Area (WPA) north of and adjacent to the coastal zone is also recommended in addition to the two management areas contained within the 2010 science-based boundary. The WPA would not be a part of the coastal zone, but would be eligible for participation in certain broad, watershed planning efforts that overlapped portions of the legally defined coastal zone. The WPA was determined to be the area defined as having a low score of coastal affinity based on the ecological analysis methodology used for this project, a ranking score lower than three. The recommended coastal zone boundary (CZB) would increase the number of parishes in the CUP area from 19 to 20. The additional parish added to the CUP management area would be Ascension. Act 956 of the 2010 Regular Session of the Louisiana Legislature provides authorization to add all or any portion of Ascension within six months of approval of the boundary change for that parish by the CPRA. An additional 15 parishes would be added to the coastal zone through inclusion wholly or partially within the IGC management area. Some parishes would also be included in the adjacent WSP area, but these parishes would not be part of the CZ nor eligible to establish a local coastal program. Adding one parish within the CUP area could slightly reduce resources if alternative funding is not identified. An increase in the size of the coastal zone would equate to a larger area that would be subject to coastal use permitting and, thus, an increase in fees related to permitting and consistency determinations, as well as other fees generated by the Coastal Zone Management Program. The Department of Natural Resources coastal use permit program will incur some increase in permit applications at both the state and local program level. However, a review of USACE permit applications from areas affected by a possible boundary change, suggests that the increase will be modest, and well within normal fluctuations of the current permit load. There are certain benefits to an expanded coastal zone and recognition of an adjacent watershed planning area: \u2022 It was widely believed that the inland boundary of the coastal zone was, from the start, insufficient to adequately manage Louisiana's coastal resources. \u2022 Data set evaluation for this study was based on integrated coastal zone management and ecosystem-based management planning tools, and included ArcGIS analysis of available data layers. This analysis found that approximately 1.4 million acres of land subject to a high level of coastal influence are outside of the current CZB. \u2022 In the time since the establishment of the coastal zone, there have also been a number of other state and federal coastal programs established in south Louisiana which are based on some aspect of coastal science, but which also conform to particular coastal policy criteria. The boundaries established for these programs often extend far beyond the current inland boundary. Of particular note are the boundaries of the Coastal Non-point Pollution Control Program (CNPCP) and the Louisiana Comprehensive Master Plan for a Sustainable Coast. \u2022 A significant area of the CNPCP outside of the current inland CZB exists along critical watersheds. Activities in these watersheds, which have downstream impacts, are not reviewed as stringently as activities inside the boundary in regards to coastal effects. Benefits of an expanded coastal zone for the CNPCP would include an improvement in coastal water quality by increasing the participation of state and federal agencies and implementation of voluntary management measures and those implemented through incentive programs. \u2022 Increased planning initiatives in watersheds that are partially within the coastal zone or adjacent to watersheds that touch the coastal zone will strengthen the state's ability to work with local governments to reduce nonpoint source pollution and limit other factors which could potentially affect coastal waters and coastal resources \u2022 A broader coastal zone would also provide enforceable policies in the CUP and IGC management areas that would help control nonpoint source pollution in much of the CNPCP area. \u2022 In addition, the inclusion of watersheds with critical downstream impacts in the WSP area strengthens the ability of coastal management to influence and to reduce nonpoint source pollution. \u2022 In the post-Katrina/Rita era of coastal zone management in Louisiana, the scale of management needed is much greater than was thought in the mid-1970s when coastal zone management concepts were just being developed. The state Master Plan was developed to fulfill the mandates of Act 8, which was passed by the Louisiana Legislature in 2005 to integrate flood control projects and coastal restoration. \u2022 Pursuant to Executive Order No. BJ 2009-7, state agencies are already required to conduct their activities in a manner consistent with the Master Plan. Implementation of an expanded inland CZB with two levels of management, CUP and IGC, would provide a formal process through which the recommendations of the Master Plan are incorporated into the review of proposed coastal activities. \u2022 As proposed, the updated coastal zone would include the geographic extent of all Master Plan measures and their respective buffer areas, with the exception of two buffer areas. The two buffer areas that extend outside of the proposed coastal zone are both watershed management features; these two features would be within the WPA. The low-laying lands of southern Louisiana constitute an extremely dynamic environment. It is, therefore, very appropriate that the legally defined area of the coastal zone be reviewed and updated periodically. The Louisiana coastline has changed in the past several decades due to land loss, subsidence, and sea-level rise. Management for coastal Louisiana should include planning for sea-level rise. \u2022 Based on evidence presented in a number of scientific studies, it is likely that sea level will rise by at least one meter by 2100. \u2022 Rising sea level will have serious socioeconomic implications for the state of Louisiana. \u2022 Over half of the population of Louisiana lives in the southern part of the state and according to NOAA about one third or about 1.3 million people live at or below sea level; rising sea levels will put these people at increasing risk. \u2022 There is also a tremendous amount of infrastructure in the coastal zone that is at increasing risk because of sea-level rise."}]
