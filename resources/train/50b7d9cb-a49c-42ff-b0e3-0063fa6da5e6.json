Latinos who speak only English earn $41,000 annually on average, which is lower than Whites' earnings ($50,000) but higher than Blacks' earnings ($38,000).  In this report, we use the term Latino to refer to people who identify as Hispanic or Latino and the term Black to people who identify as Black or African American. We use single terms-White, Black, and Latino-to alleviate ambiguity and enhance clarity. In charts and tables, we use White, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino. Latinos 1 have a long way to go in achieving educational and economic equality. Latinos are improving their high school completion but still lag Blacks and Whites. As a result, Latinos are also last in postsecondary enrollment. However, the number of Latinos who are enrolling in postsecondary education is growing the fastest compared to Whites. Latinos exceed both Blacks and Whites in completion of postsecondary certificates but have the lowest overall educational attainment. Due to their low educational attainment, Latinos have the lowest earnings. However, Latinos tend to earn more than Blacks if they have attained at least some postsecondary education ( Figure 1). One of the reasons the economic progress of Latinos has been difficult is that today's working Latinos cannot reap the same economic benefits that prior generations enjoyed from having good jobs that only required high school. Instead, they must acquire at least some college in order to enter the middle class. In the '70s, the most well-traveled pathway to the middle class was high school. Two in three workers had only high school or less, but most of them were in the middle class. Workers with high school or less accounted for 64 percent of workers with above median earnings in 1970 but only accounted for 21 percent of workers with above median earnings in 2016. 2 Less than a third FIGURE 1.

Moreover, two-thirds of the growth in earnings inequality since the early '80s-when inequality began its more than 30-year rise-is due to differences in access to postsecondary learning with labor market value. 5 In the 21st century, the demand for postsecondary education in the United States has increased. In 1992, 56 percent of jobs required some postsecondary education and, by 2020, 65 percent of jobs are projected to require the same. 6 Profound structural shifts in the economy have made the relationship between education and the economy a new game with new rules. Latinos recognize more than other Americans that a college degree is critical: 88 percent of Latinos believe a college degree is important for obtaining financial security compared to 74 percent of all Americans. 7 However, there are still some good blue-collar jobs for male high school graduates that Latino males in particular are increasingly employed in, but they represent no more than 20 percent of all jobs for high school-educated workers in the economy and are generally unavailable to women, including Latina women. 8 It is still true that workers with higher levels of postsecondary attainment earn more than workers with lower levels of attainment, but field of study often trumps degree level. 9 That is why 40 percent of bachelor's degree holders earn more than workers with graduate degrees; almost 30 percent of workers with associate's degrees earn more than the median bachelor's degree holder; and many certificate holders whose program took a year or less earn more than the median associate's degree holder. 10 So how are Latinos doing in the new game between education and the economy? The results are optimistic but mixed. Latinos are actually increasing their share of a diminishing supply of 3 For a historical review of the changing relationship between education and the economy see Rose, The Undereducated American, 2011, andRose, The Economy Goes to College, 2015. 4 Stepler and Brown, Statistical Portrait of Hispanics in the United States, 2016."}, {"section_title": "5", "text": "Autor, \"Skills, education, and the rise of earnings inequality among the 'other 99 percent,' \" 2014. 6 Carnevale et al., Recovery, 2013. 7 Lopez, Latinos and Education, 2009. 8 Carnevale et al., Career Clusters, 2011. 9 Carnevale et al., The Economic Value of College Majors, 2015. good jobs that only require high school. Using increased high school graduation as a launch pad, Latinos are climbing faster up the education pipeline but falling further behind because their population growth is increasing faster than their attainment of postsecondary credentials. Between 1992 and 2016, the Latino population share grew by 9 percentage points, while the share of Latinos with at least some postsecondary education grew by 6 percentage points. However, contrary to popular belief, there are still 30 million good jobs that pay that do not require a bachelor's degree. These middle-skill jobs tend to pay at least $35,000 in early careers and at least $45,000 at mid-career, with a median of $55,000 overall. Whites have lost lots of these good jobs that do not require a bachelor's degree, especially in manufacturing, but Latinos have made real gains, especially in construction. 11 Latinos have made the most progress in getting good jobs below a bachelor's degree level in part because of their progress in earning sub-baccalaureate credentials but also, in part, because they continue to gain an outsized share of good jobs that require high school or less at the entry level. But Latino progress in the sub-baccalaureate labor market comes with caveats. Latinos are not making as much progress finding good jobs that require bachelor's degrees or higher. They have increased their share of good jobs that require a bachelor's degree or higher, but it is not staying on pace with their growing population share. Thus, they are less represented in good jobs that require a bachelor's degree or higher than they were in 1991. 11 Carnevale et al., Good Jobs That Pay without a BA, 2017. Latinos are not making as much progress finding good jobs that require bachelor's degrees or higher."}, {"section_title": "LATINO EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC PROGRESS | RUNNING FASTER BUT STILL BEHIND", "text": "In spite of their educational progress, Latinos still tend to work in the bottom educational tiers of the labor market in general, and tend to work in the middle tiers of the growing postsecondary labor market in particular. Latinos are the fastest-growing share of the labor force, projected to increase to 30 percent by 2050. 12 But Latinos tend to be concentrated in occupations that require less education and where wage growth is slowest, oftentimes even when they acquire postsecondary credentials. Although Latinos account for 16 percent of the workforce, they compose a mere 10 percent of jobs that require postsecondary education. In addition, their share of jobs declines with level of education required. For instance, Latinos make up 20 percent of workers in jobs that require a high school diploma but only 7 percent of workers in jobs that require a graduate degree. There are significant differences among Latina women, Latino men, and the population overall. The Latina education and economic story is essentially this: they end up last in the earnings pecking order in the United States. The highest earners are White men, followed by 12 Carnevale and Smith, \"America's Future Workforce,\" 2013. 13 Burd-Sharps and Lewis, Promising Gains, Persistent Gaps, 2017;Fernandes-Alcantara, Disconnected Youth, 2015.

White women, Black men, Black women, Latino men, and Latina women. Like all minorities, the working class, the poor, as well as women in general, Latina women have used education as their primary strategy to escape patriarchy, as well as class and racial disadvantages. They have higher completion rates at all levels of postsecondary attainment compared to Latino men and, in the case of certificates and associate's degrees, higher completion rates than White men. However, like all women, Latina women tend to major in lower-paying fields of study and, even when they major in high-paying fields of study, they earn less than Latino men. Even more telling is that Latina women need to earn two additional degrees in order to have similar median earnings to White men. There is good news for Latinos, although it usually comes with caveats: \u2022 The Latino high school completion rate is behind White and Black completion rates but is growing the fastest, gradually narrowing race-based completion gaps. Latinos are improving the most in their high school completion rates and becoming more and more qualified in the race for college credentials. \u2022 Latinos are the least likely to enter college directly after high school (51%) compared to Blacks (56%) or Whites (69%) but do close the enrollment gap over time.  Latinos are more likely to be disconnected (14%) than Whites (10%), but less so than  \nThe long-term decline in blue-collar jobs in the economy can be attributed to the slower growth in good jobs that pay without a bachelor's degree. However, Latinos have experienced the largest growth in these good jobs. 66 This is mostly due to Latinos working in good jobs for workers with high school or less. The share of good jobs for workers with high school or less has decreased over the past decade, but the number of Latinos working in these good jobs has increased. 67 In fact, the share of Latinos in these good jobs is growing faster than their population share, suggesting they are edging Whites out of these jobs. However, while Latinos are more successfully finding good jobs for high school or less, they are making less compared to Whites than they were in 1991. This is due to the fact that Latino wages have stayed the same, while White wages have increased. Latinos are also increasingly working in good jobs for workers with at least some college ( Figure 5.2). But their employment share is increasing slower than their population share, suggesting that Latinos are not making progress in these good jobs fast enough. However, unlike good jobs for workers with high school or less, Latinos' earnings for those with some college or better have increased since 1991, and their wages are closer to that of Whites. Moreover, Latinos in these good jobs make more than Blacks.    are still more likely to be working in blue-collar and food and personal services occupations and less likely to be working in STEM occupations compared to all workers ( Figure 5.3). The large portion of Latinos in low-skill, low-wage jobs matters because it becomes more difficult for a family to bear the high costs associated with obtaining higher-level degrees. However, there is good news. When Latinos successfully complete bachelor's degrees or higher and work in high-paying occupations, they earn wages similar to Whites with the same level of education. For example, both Whites and Latinos with bachelor's degrees or higher who work in STEM occupations earn $85,000 annually on average. On the other extreme, Whites with a bachelor's degree or higher working in blue-collar occupations earn $52,000 annually on average compared to $36,000 for Latinos. Thus, while educational attainment and occupational choice 68 Grand\u00edn, \"Conditional occupational segregation of minorities in the US,\" 2013.    earnings ($50,000) but higher than Blacks' earnings ($38,000). Bachelor's Degree Majors: Latina Women Can't Win. Full distribution and earnings of majors can be found in Appendix 2. A college education has become the gateway to the middle class. is greatest in the highest-paying majors. This could be because the range in earnings within the highest-paying majors is greater than the range of earnings within the lowest-paying majors. Regardless, there is no major group where Latinos earn the same as Whites, but Latinos tend to earn more than Blacks in most majors. A key factor in explaining these earnings differences is the career pathways that bachelor's degree holders follow. In general, workers who major in programs leading to bachelor's degrees In general, women tend to choose less lucrative majors. A woman who majors in a STEM field would earn $900,000 more over a lifetime than if she had majored in liberal arts. 74 However, even when Latina women major in architecture and engineering, they have the lowest earnings. In fact, they earn slightly more than half (56%) of what White men in the same major earn. While architecture and engineering is the highest-paying major for all men and White and Black women, health is the highest-paying major for Latina women. Latina women who major in health, though, still earn 71 percent of what White men earn. This suggests that even when Latina women earn degrees in the highest-paying majors, they earn less. The occupations that women, Latina women in particular, end up working in could determine some of these earnings differences. Choosing a postsecondary program is the first big investment decision made by young people, especially the majority of students who will finance their postsecondary programs with student loans. They need to understand the risks and rewards associated with their choice of colleges and fields of study. As the cost of particular certificates and degrees grows and the labor market returns shift, prospective students need more information to guide their choices and to ensure high returns on their investments. Gains for college-educated individuals will continue, but pursuing a postsecondary degree without career planning may translate to high levels of debt and underemployment. It is clear that in order to improve opportunities for all students, including Latinos, and to meet the demands of the rapidly changing workforce, the current postsecondary education system must find new ways of linking particular courses of study to clear and viable career pathways. 75 In 2015, half of Latino adults said their family income was falling behind the cost of living but saw better economic times ahead after the 2008 recession. 76 Latino or otherwise, most economically disadvantaged families are not as familiar as economically fortunate ones with securing tax breaks, saving for retirement, or creating college savings plans. They also do not have access to the same knowledge networks as Whites, for example, to adequately plan their careers, or the financial literacy needed to help weigh their options when deciding which postsecondary credential to pursue and how much money they need to finance their education. Latinos overwhelming tend to enroll in open-access colleges instead of selective colleges. Polarization of the postsecondary system matters because resources matter in completion rates, learning, and earning. This polarization translates into racial inequality in the labor market, representing a loss of potential skilled labor for families, employers, and communities. More Latinos need to apply, be accepted into, and complete college at selective colleges than currently do so. If this trend takes hold, then it will alleviate the pressure on under-resourced middle-tier and open-access colleges and allow them to better serve those that come through their doors. In addition, we need to consider increasing the resources available to the middle-tier and openaccess colleges, where at least half of low-income students begin their postsecondary education. Individual interests and values should remain important in selecting schools, majors, and occupations, but differing interests and values are powerful biases that often result in occupational segregation. While the inherent and systematic biases of the labor market will take some time to disappear, Latinos are going to college and earning degrees in greater numbers, and they are more optimistic about the financial future for their children. 77 If progress can continue, Latinos may eventually achieve educational and occupational equality, which our country needs in order to fully prosper in both economic and moral terms."}, {"section_title": "One of the biggest challenges for", "text": "Latinos has been navigating a polarized postsecondary system with two unequal pathways.    help them apply to college because their parents are less likely to have attended college. 27 This lack of parental knowledge of the college application and enrollment process leads to Latinoseven those with high SAT/ACT scores-applying to fewer colleges, unaware that they are unlikely to pay the sticker price at the most selective colleges. 28 In addition, many Latinos desire to remain close to home due to family obligations and responsibilities, which is a major factor that explains differences between Latinos and Whites when they apply to college. 29 Access to the better-resourced selective colleges matters because such institutions spend more per student. Open-access colleges tend to be overcrowded because students see them as more affordable options. However, they are also underfunded because they receive far less state funding, which limits their ability to serve large student bodies.  (Figure 1.6). Open-access colleges are where we see the most growth in Latino enrollment (10 percentage point increase). This trend unfortunately mimics the racial and ethnic inequality in the K-12 system. It also serves to magnify the inequality that Latino students face in the postsecondary system depending on the major that they select and occupations they apply for once they enter the labor market. Latinos are the least likely to transfer from a two-year college to a four-year college-26 percent of Latinos who initially enrolled in a two-year college transfer to a four-year college within six years of initial enrollment compared to 28 percent of Blacks and 33 percent of Whites. However, Latinos are more likely than Blacks but less likely than Whites to transfer from a two-year college and complete a bachelor's degree at a four-year college. Overall, 19 percent of Whites, 11 percent of Latinos, and 9 percent of Blacks enrolled in an associate's degree program transfer and complete bachelor's degrees within six years of initial enrollment. 36 The award level that students enroll in also affects whether they progress through college.  As Latino high school sophomores continue through the education pipeline, the boost they received from postsecondary enrollment disappears; Latino sophomores are less likely to complete a bachelor's degree or any postsecondary award 38 compared to Whites. Forty-one percent of Latino high school sophomores eventually earn an award compared to 57 percent of Whites. There is an even bigger difference between the percentage of White sophomores who eventually earn a bachelor's degree and the percentage of Latino sophomores: 39 percent compared to 19 percent, respectively. However, Latino and Black sophomores have nearly equivalent completion rates for earning a bachelor's degree or award (Figure 3.1). Focusing on the students who do enroll in college for the first time, the progress that Latinos have made in postsecondary completion is concentrated at the sub-baccalaureate level. Latinos PART 3      (Figure 4.2). Educational attainment could be lower for foreign-born Latinos due to some immigrants not being able to transfer their training and credentials to the US labor market. 55 The educational attainment of native-born Latinos more closely mirrors the educational attainment of Blacks but is still lower than the educational attainment of Whites. Of course, this number can vary widely depending on country of origin, but Latinos born in the United States are closer to meeting the postsecondary workforce requirements (65%) than foreign-born Latinos. The educational attainment story changes slightly when examining foreign-born Latinos 54 Foreign-born refers to any Latino who was not born within the United States. While the US Census Bureau does not collect data on the legal status of foreign-born individuals, it can be assumed that some undocumented immigrants are included in this analysis since the US Census Bureau collects data on whoever participates regardless of their legal status. However, there is no way of knowing the proportion of undocumented immigrants in this analysis.     Looking at all workers, regardless of educational attainment, White men earn the most, followed by White women, Black men, Black women, and finally Latino men and Latina women. However, when earnings are analyzed by level of educational attainment, the results of the earnings race are not as drastic for Latinos, especially at higher education levels. For example, Latino workers with a bachelor's degree or higher are not last. White men still earn the most,   (Figure 5.1). 61 Thus, education is one solution to bridging the earnings gaps among different racial and ethnic groups. Wages associated with low educational attainment are especially detrimental for all Latinos, but especially for Latina women. In general, Latinos need to attain one more degree in order to earn wages similar to Whites. Overall, women also typically need to attain an additional degree in order to earn wages similar to men but, in the case of Latina women, they must earn two more degrees in order to earn wages similar to White men. For example, White men with an associate's degree earn $55,000. Latino men need a bachelor's degree and Latina women need a graduate degree in order to earn wages comparable to White men with an associate's degree. Latinos are mainly working in good jobs requiring high school or less, but their wages in these jobs have remained stagnant. Workers with bachelor's degrees have gained far more jobs since the Great Recession of 2007-09 than workers with less education, resulting in the share of workers with bachelor's degrees outnumbering the share of workers with a high school diploma for the first time. 63 This trend holds for good jobs 64 as well. The share of good jobs for workers with a bachelor's degree increased from 40 percent in 1991 to 55 percent in 2015, even though good jobs for workers without a bachelor's degree still increased in number. 65"}, {"section_title": "61", "text": "Earnings for all education levels by race and gender can be found in Appendix 4.
