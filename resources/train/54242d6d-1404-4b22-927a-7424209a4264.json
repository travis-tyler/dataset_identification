Additional plant pathology faculty and students outside the aforementioned systems were located by searching the APS membership database for faculty and student affiliations. Plant pathology faculty, as well as plant pathol-ogy graduate students, were essentially self-described as such, either by personal communication with a department member or by information provided on department websites.\nDisciplinary balance. Defining disciplinary balance itself is a challenge. Is balance to be sought between instruction, research, and outreach; field versus labbased programs; among commodities; among subject-matter areas (e.g., mycology, epidemiology, nematology, forest pathology, etc.); or between broadly trained and highly trained in a critical specialty? What balance should be sought in training graduates for academia, industrial product discovery and development, and as agricultural advisors? Are we speaking of balance at the national, regional, state, or department level?\nIf describing disciplinary balance in the present tense is complex, future trends are even more elusive. Balance in any of the foregoing is likely to be driven by changes in societal needs, breakthroughs in particular research areas, resource allocation, and funding opportunities. Thus, some imbalances may be logical consequences of spectacular growth in a particular sector, and are probably advantageous. A preconceived notion of balance may not be the most desirable state in all circumstances, because balance should also promote, not inhibit, adaptation of the profession. For purposes of discussion, we have defined disciplinary balance broadly to encompass all of the foregoing expressions of breadth and balance in the profession. Ultimately, \"disciplinary\" may not be the best adjective to describe exactly what we are studying, but we nevertheless found it to be a useful catch-all phrase.\nAlthough there are few sources of data at the national level on representation of subdisciplines within plant pathology, the committee found evidence of considerable declines in numbers of U.S. scientists engaged within two subdisciplines: nematology, and forest and shade tree pathology. The U.S.-based Society of Nematologists (SON) was founded in 1961, and membership peaked in 1987. Since that time, membership has declined steadily, and today it stands at approximately 50% of the 1987 membership level. As SON is comprised primarily of members concerned with plant-parasitic nematodes, the decline in membership likely mirrors a similar reduction in research and outreach effort directed toward plant nematology at the national level. With respect to forest and shade tree pathology, we identified 74 faculty at U.S. universities whose research and outreach programs focused primarily on this area for the period 1980 to 1990 (W. Sinclair, Cornell University, unpublished data). By 2008, only 34 faculty were engaged primarily in forest and shade tree pathology (J. Juzwik, APS Forest Pathology Committee, unpublished data).\nSimilar reductions (from 29 to 15) were documented over the same period in the numbers of forest pathologists employed by the USDA Forest Service. The committee lacked access to historical data on most other subdisciplines. However, both nematology and forest pathology experienced declines that were disproportionately large compared with observed reductions in general numbers of plant pathology faculty at universities, and the foregoing subdisciplines were the most frequently mentioned in interviews with department chairs and heads when discussing declines among other subdisciplines, such as epidemiology and mycology.\nA subdiscipline that would be expected to have grown over the last 30 years is molecular biology as it applies to hostpathogen interactions. Indeed, an oft-expressed opinion is that university departments have preferentially filled positions in molecular host-pathogen interactions at the expense of other subdisciplines within plant pathology, such as epidemiology or disease management. Molecular hostpathogen interactions is a relatively new branch of our discipline, thus the core of expertise within departments would have been created between 1980 and 1990 as the subdiscipline developed. However, the Committee found no evidence of preferential filling of positions in molecular biology at the national level beyond the initial creation of the aforementioned core of expertise. As a subgroup, U.S. university faculty who are self-described as working in the area of molecular host-pathogen interactions, with a median age of 50, are not substantially younger than the general faculty membership at 52. Indeed, the group of U.S. university plant pathology faculty who are members of the International Society for Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions (IS-MPMI) has a median age of 51. Furthermore, only 10% of either subgroup is presently under the age of 40, again similar to the overall age distribution of U.S. university plant pathology faculty (see section on Age Demographics below). The membership in IS-MPMI has remained relatively static since 1996, and has ranged from 4.7 to 7.9% of domestic APS membership. A similar plateau in growth can be seen in attendance at biennial meetings of IS-MPMI during the same period. This probably reflects both the maturation of molecular host-pathogen interactions as a subdiscipline within plant pathology and the widespread adoption of the tools of molecular biology throughout various other subdisciplines. Unfortunately, concerted efforts of departments across the United States to develop a critical mass of faculty in molecular hostpathogen interactions occurred during a period of reduced hiring at the national level in the 1980s and 1990s (Fig. 1) . The age demographic data cited above indicate that any national trend toward preferential hiring ended during the 1990s. Any resulting imbalances could as easily be attributed to the drastic reduction in overall hiring rates (Fig. 1) as to preferential hiring in any subdiscipline.\nInstitutional erosion. The Committee defined institutional erosion as a partial or complete undermining of an institution with respect to its mission of instruction, research, and outreach in plant pathology. As a case study, we considered the decline and near-disappearance of plant pathology at six New England Land Grant universities since 1985. Four of these universities formerly offered Ph.D. degrees specifically in plant pathology, and the remaining two offered doctorates in an allied discipline in which the research focused on plant pathology. All offered a variety of undergraduate and graduate courses in the discipline. The aggregate annual number of doctoral candidates produced by these six institutions from 1980 to 1985 approximated that presently produced by some of the largest departments of plant pathology in the United States. The aggregate annual enrollment in undergraduate plant pathology courses for the six departments was 210 in 1985. None of these institutions today have annual course offerings in plant pathology, and none identify the discipline of plant pathology in a department name. The process by which such institutional erosion occurred is noteworthy. In each case, there was a progressive subsuming of smaller departments of entomology and plant pathology, botany and plant pathology, etc., into multidisciplinary departments of \"Plant Biology\" or other such overarching units. Not surprisingly, the highest priorities of the omnibus department during the ensuing period of reduced hiring rates (Fig. 1) did not include refilling plant pathology positions (now a minority within the unit) as they became vacant. Eventually, graduate degree programs in plant pathology were compromised and ultimately abandoned along with nearly all graduate and undergraduate training in the discipline. Weinhold (16) provided a very detailed chronology of a similar process at work in the erosion and eventual disappearance of the Department of Plant Pathology at the University of California at Berkeley.\nTo a much lesser degree, erosion of larger departments occurred nationally. Data on eight such departments for the period from 1987 to 2007 is shown in Figure 2 . Most, but not all, departments surveyed lost faculty positions since 1987. The greatest reduction in average number of faculty positions (16%) occurred between 1987 and 1997, compared with an average reduction of 5% between 1997 and 2007 ( Fig. 2A) . Two surveyed departments did not decrease in size between 1997 and 2007, and one of these grew by 14% ( Fig.  2A) . Historical data to quantify the research and outreach programs of these departments were not available. Interestingly, there was little correspondence between department size at any time and the number of course offerings (Fig. 2B ). Neither was the number of courses offered by a department inversely proportional to how often they were offered. When expressed as number of courses offered, the instructional capacity of a department was largely maintained or increased slightly (Fig. 2B ) in the face of downsizing ( Fig. 2A) . The range in number of courses offered among departments, especially when compared with department size, does indicate that some departments, both historically and currently, commit a higher proportion of their personnel and resources to instruction than do others.\nHistorical data on faculty full time equivalents (FTEs) assigned to extension within eight plant pathology departments were also available to the Committee. Changes in the Extension FTEs are depicted in Figure 3 . There was no clear pattern of overall erosion among the departments. Seven of the selected departments were within 25% of 1987 FTE levels in extension, and four departments were at or slightly above 1987 levels (Fig. 3 ). This maintenance of FTEs in extension occurred despite a national trend of reduction in overall faculty numbers during the same period (Fig. 2) . However, one department had dropped to less than 25% of 1987 levels during 2007. In subsequent communications with the chair of this department, this seemed to represent an anomalous reduction in extension due to sudden losses of faculty, and failure to replace retiring faculty during a subsequent budget shortfall. Thus, among all but one surveyed department, faculty extension effort was reduced by no more than the overall reduction in the general faculty population, and in some cases it was either maintained at 1987 levels, or slightly increased.\nResearch funding. Research funding was broadly defined in order to encompass many types of support, including baselevel state support, federal formula funds, directed grants, competitive program funds, gifts, and contract research. A general perception encountered in many discussions and interviews was that research funding was inextricably linked to institutional erosion and disciplinary balance, i.e., lack of funding may exacerbate erosion, which cyclically results in reduced funding. With respect to disciplinary balance, real and perceived funding opportunities may redirect personnel and resources toward particular areas of a discipline and away from others. Strong and effective stakeholder support, not only financial, but also in the form of advocacy directed toward institutional administration and state legislatures, was perceived as critical to securing base-level state funding and maintaining relevant research positions. The need to engage stakeholders and decision-makers to engender support for the discipline, and the long-term consequences of a failure to do so, were succinctly voiced by William Merrill 29 years ago in an editorial in Plant Disease (11) .\nThe Committee obtained historical data on funding of all plant pathology research within USDA/Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) and from four mid-to largesized departments for the period 1996 to 2007. The funding levels reported included all competitive grants, contract research, federal formula funds, and gifts. All departments surveyed had gained increases in funds over 1996 levels (Fig. 4) . In Figure  4 , note that the vertical axis scale of panels A through D primarily reflects the ratio of funding received in 1996 to the maximum received, and should not be interpreted as evidence of differences in success in obtaining grant funds. However, applied over many years, this does allow the resolution of long-term trends in funds received. The proportion of funds received from each of the aforementioned sources (competitive grants, contract research, federal formula funds, and gifts) did not differ markedly among the departments, i.e., all departments appeared to be effective in obtaining funds across the full spectrum of sources, and to approximately the same degree (data not shown). Per capita grant funds varied among the departments, but to no greater degree than the observed year-toyear variation. Among eight plant pathology departments that provided additional detailed funding data to the committee, USDA/CSREES competitive grants provided an average of 41 agement) were consistently cited as major sources of funds for research and extension programs. NRI, the largest of the CSREES competitive grants programs, provided an average of 37% of all CSREES competitive funding of plant pathology nationwide between 2002 and 2007. For the surveyed group, which was comprised of midsized or larger stand-alone departments of plant pathology, USDA/CSREES competitive grants were critically important sources of funding between 2002 and 2007. Furthermore, it would appear that an important proportion of such funding was often dependent upon successful competition within the NRI.\nWhile the absolute level of funding increased over 1996 levels, when adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (1), there appeared to be a plateau in funding received among the selected departments that began approximately in 2002 (Fig. 4) . This trend mirrored that observed in total funds allocated to USDA/CSREES for plant pathology research and extension for the same period of time (Fig. 4E) , reflecting the relative importance of this source of funding among the surveyed departments. Although Figure 4 represents only four of the departments included in Table 1 , the four departments include 11% of the U.S. plant pathology faculty. Interviews with chairs of four additional departments indicated that they received a similar percentage of total funds from USDA/CSREES competitive grant programs. Age demographics. The committee studied the present and likely future age structure of the profession in both the public and private sector, trends in enrollment and present numbers of graduating M.S. and Ph.D. students, and likely retirements within the next 5 to 20 years. Perhaps more than the previous three items, this was easy to see as a future issue, as many retirements in the \"boomer\" generation will occur throughout society over the next 15 years. This has been discussed at length by higher administration of most universities, and within industry and the private sector (2-5,7-9). Again, this issue is closely linked to the previous three, as refilling vacated positions is done in light of attractiveness of disciplines to top student applicants, funding, and perceived strength and vitality of a profession, highlighting the interdependence of the issues under study.\nOur (Fig. 5) . However, the same survey also indicated a decline of approximately 16% in the number of doctorates awarded for the period from 2000 to 2005 compared with the period 1966 to 2000 (Fig. 5) .\nOf 673 plant pathology faculty nationwide, whether in stand-alone plant pathology departments or multidisciplinary departments, approximately 27% of faculty members held a doctorate in a field other than plant pathology (Table 1) . One might assume that this reflects the inclusion of faculty from several small or multidisciplinary departments, where professional responsibilities may necessarily diverge from plant pathology. However, among those units named exclusively as departments of plant pathology, an even greater percentage of the faculty (35%) were trained in another discipline. Nationwide, 81% of plant pathology faculty were members of APS, compared with 78% in the 17 standalone plant pathology departments. Al-\nThere was a substantial number of midsized groupings of plant pathologists within U.S. university departments (Table  1) . Eighteen departments employed 10 to 19 plant pathology faculty, although in some cases not all were located on a single campus or experiment station. These departments enrolled 40% of the plant pathology graduate student population. There were also 14 departments employing 20 to 40 plant pathology faculty. Again, not all faculty were located on a single campus or experiment station. The 14 largest departments accounted for 51% of the graduate students in plant pathology programs. Thus, only 9% of the graduate students (62 students nationwide) were enrolled in the 26 other departments with fewer than 10 plant pathology faculty. These departments were located in 24 states, and such units in 12 states did not currently enroll graduate students in the study of plant pathology."}, {"section_title": "Demographics of U.S. university faculty and historical and projected hiring trends.", "text": "The APS membership database contains information, including date of birth, professorial rank, and university affiliation that can be used to construct the age distribution of faculty at U.S. universities (Fig.  6) . The data set need not be complete to do this, so long as the sample of the population is unbiased. A total of 748 nonretired, nonemeritus individuals were included. This population contains most (81%) of the 673 self-identified plant pathology faculty located in the 2007 census, but also includes faculty from allied disciplines who maintain an interest in APS.\nThe median age of the general APS membership population (i.e., not limited to university faculty) is presently 48 and increasing (2007 APS membership survey). The median age of the university faculty population is older at 52, and the distribution is markedly compressed around the median. This is likely an artifact of the training period required and the possible duration of a career before reaching retirement age. Most do not become faculty until after age 30, and many retire between 64 and 65 (2007 APS department head survey). Thus, we can assume a career duration, preretirement, of approximately 35 years.\nThe historical causes of the age structure are similar to those in many areas of the present workforce. However, there are certain aspects that have possibly intensified the effect with respect to U.S. university faculty in general. Figure 1 hiring trends for new Ph.D. recipients in plant pathology since 1966 (2005 NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates). The inflation of the cohort near the median age is directly attributable to hiring rates during the period from 1966 to 1985. Many universities either created or expanded departments during this period. Once this accelerated hiring was complete, hiring rates dropped by nearly 50% for a period of about 20 years, and a large and even-aged cohort was created. The earlier institutional expansion was followed by a period of reduction at many (but not all) institutions. This has had the effect of depressing the number of faculty in all cohorts younger than the median age.\nGiven the lengthy training period required, the consequent age at which one enters the population of university faculty, and a common retirement age of 64 to 65, it is expected that approximately one-third of the population will retire in any 10-year period. In a uniform distribution with a steady state of hiring and retirement, approximately 2.8% of the individuals would retire in any given year. However, a total of 50% of the population in Figure 6 will reach retirement age within 12 years. Moreover, the annualized rate of retirement of the cohort near the median age (each year containing close to 5% of the total) will be close to five times the present rate (less than 1% of the population is within any one year between 65 and 70). To place this in better perspective from an employer's standpoint, consider that all other things being equal, if you are satisfied with the size and quality of the applicant pool now, you may be only 20% as satisfied in 8 years, and remain at that level of satisfaction for the subsequent 10 years. If you are presently unsatisfied, consider that the applicant situation will deteriorate substantially from your present perspective for nearly two decades. The accelerated rate of retirements began in 2008, and will continue to steadily increase before peaking in 2016. Thereafter, it may remain above the idealized rate of 2.8% per year until the present cohort near age 45 retires in approximately 20 years (Fig. 6) .\nThe above analysis is based upon an as- It is possible that the progressively increasing age at which workers are eligible for full Social Security retirement benefits, as well as recent declines in the value of stock-based retirement portfolios, might slightly delay retirements. However, the consistency of the average age at retirement dating back nearly four decades through three economic recessions and progressive increases in retirement eligibility suggests that decisions to retire within this population may not be overly sensitive to short-term economic considerations.\nAge demographics of the profession in federal programs and the private sector. The demographic trends seen among U.S. university faculty are mirrored in the population of plant pathologists in the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS). Among 172 research and supervisory plant pathologists currently employed by ARS, from 30 to 34% will be eligible to retire in 2009 (2006 to 2010 ARS Workforce Plan). A similar demographic trend is evident in data collected by the nation's largest group of professional crop consultants, the California Association of Pest Control Advisors (CAPCA). Among 3,100 members of CAPCA, approximately 40% are over the age of 55, only 17% are 44 or younger, and 35% are represented in the same predominant 45 to 55 cohort observed in the university faculty population (Fig. 6) . We found no evidence that the age distribution differed substantially among plant pathologists employed in the agrichemical industry. In fact, the median age of U.S. (Table 2) .\nApproximately one-half of all Ph.D. recipients committed to employment at the time of graduation are employed in positions outside of academe (Table 2) , and the proportion of degree recipients that become university employees (approximately 50 to 60%) compared with industrial or governmental employees has varied little over the last 40 years when viewed in 5-to 10-year increments ( Fig. 5 ) might seem adequate to meet demands for replacement faculty even at accelerated retirement rates, the age demographic trends we cite for university faculty are broadly applicable to any population comprised of Ph.D. scientists (2, 3, 7, 8) . Thus, all employment sectors (academe, government, industry, and private practice) within the profession will compete for what may be an insufficient supply of graduates. Furthermore, nearly all biological and agricultural sciences will face the same demographic trends, as they draw from the same generations of the general population and have the same self-imposed limits on the duration of a career (2, 3, 7, 8) . Thus, we cannot expect to disproportionately draw upon allied disciplines to meet the need for plant pathologists in the future. Summary assessment of challenges and recommendations for the future.\n\u2022 The committee was able to locate, collect, and analyze data that allowed all four areas of our charge (disciplinary balance, institutional erosion, funding, and age demographics) to be assessed quantitatively. However, the quantity and quality of available data were better for some areas (e.g., age demographics and funding) than for others (e.g., disciplinary balance). With respect to disciplinary balance, the most accessible and easily searched data reside within the APS membership database. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that APS develop the means by which individual member entries become sufficiently complete to allow more detailed analysis of disciplinary balance in the future.\n\u2022 The subdisciplines of nematology and forest pathology have experienced a reduction in numbers over the last 20 years that would appear to be disproportionate to the reduction in the general population of plant pathology faculty. The Committee recommends a focused review of how the profession could best preserve and enhance these subdisciplines.\n\u2022 With respect to funding, the Committee was impressed by the ability of several departments to compete for funding across a broad spectrum of sources. Given that success in this area will be a defining characteristic of career success, the Committee recommends that graduate and early-career training in grantsmanship be approached as a skill set deserving attention equal to that devoted to all other areas of academic training.\n\u2022 Although grant funds received increased substantially over 1996 levels, the committee found that research funding among most departments surveyed had reached a plateau or declined slightly since 2002 when adjusted for inflation. Interviews with department chairs and heads indicated a progressive reduction in the number of institutionally, state, and federally funded graduate student assistantships since 1996, resulting in a trend toward the support of a reduced number of graduate students on competitive grant funds. The above trend was often mentioned in interviews as having a negative impact on the enthusiasm of faculty to recruit graduate students due to uncertain funding. Given the coming need to expand graduate programs, the committee recognizes the identification and procurement of increased long-term funding specifically for graduate student training as a critical need for the continued health of the profession. The level of preliminary data required, short funding cycles, and relatively low success rates of many existing competitive grant programs conflict with the above need to have funds in place as a prerequisite to effectively recruit graduate students.\n\u2022 Institutional erosion was documented regionally and to a lesser degree nationally. At some institutions, this resulted in the complete loss of graduate programs in plant pathology and all undergraduate and graduate instruction in the discipline. At present, 14 large departments (20 to 40 plant pathology faculty) produce 51% of the Ph.D. recipients in the discipline. Despite the loss of faculty within the larger departments, those surveyed had stable teaching programs, and most had obtained increased funding, which possibly offset the impact of decreases in faculty numbers. Eighteen departments with 10 to 19 plant pathology faculty produced another 40% of the Ph.D. recipients. However, there appears to be a sharp break in plant pathology graduate student enrollment in departments with fewer than 10 plant pathology faculty, as 26 such departments produced only 9% of the Ph.D. recipients in the discipline. If this is indicative of a critical faculty size presently required to competitively operate a Ph.D. program in the discipline, it would appear that the midsized departments just above this level of staffing are at risk of losing graduate training programs in the discipline if further erosion occurs. Given the present substantial contribution of the midsized departments to the supply of new Ph.D. recipients, and the equally substantial number of faculty retirements in the immediate future, there appear to be only two effective options: either the present capacity of midsized departments must be preserved, or the capacity the larger departments to produce graduates must be nearly doubled. As the latter option seems unlikely, the Committee recommends that the national impact of further institutional erosion among the midsized departments with respect to national needs for Ph.D. graduates in the discipline be made clear to relevant decision-makers at the institutional, state, and national level.\n\u2022 While it was possible to deduce some trends from highly predictable age demographics, the Committee found it difficult to extrapolate most findings into the future due to the inherent unpredictability of scientific breakthroughs and the interdependence of the other issues under study. However, it is clear that the continued education of a sufficient number of both broadly trained and appropriately specialized plant pathologists represents the greatest immediate and future challenge to the profession. The need to produce the replacement population occurs at a time when production of Ph.D. graduates in the discipline appears to have declined substantially below the minimal replacement rate, and when the instructional capacity of some departments may be in jeopardy.\n\u2022 Perceptions of the coming retirement wave in the profession differed among different demographic groups. In particular, graduate students, while mindful of the loss of some of their most talented mentors in the near future due to retirement, were nonetheless positive in their perception of future employment opportunities. While the present economic recession may slightly moderate or delay the age demographic effects, they are ultimately inescapable: approximately one-half of the profession will retire within 10 years (Fig. 6 ). Even the most pessimistic projections allow for many, if not most of these positions to be eventually refilled. The Committee recommends that the profession capitalize upon this positive aspect of demographics and employment prospects in efforts to recruit graduates to the profession. Our vision for the future. As noted in the charge to our committee, we were directed to develop a vision of where plant pathology as a profession will be 10 to 20 years from now and how to achieve it. We believe that this role should be assumed by the APS President and Council, and offer the following brief thoughts to initiate the process.\nOur data produce several warning signals regarding the health of our profession. However, there are encouraging signs worth noting. For example, in an era when many professional societies are struggling and some have gone extinct, APS is financially sound and reached a record membership in 2008, its Centennial year. Nonetheless, plant pathology remains a small and largely invisible discipline to the general public. This lack of visibility breeds a lack of awareness and therefore appreciation of the contributions of our discipline to everyday life. Our invisibility impacts the profession from many directions: students cannot be attracted to a discipline of which they are completely unaware. Public funds will not be intelligently directed to plant pathology, no matter how meritorious the contribution of the discipline, if those contributions are never perceived (meritorious or otherwise) by the general public and their elected representatives. There are manifold reasons for this lack of visibility. Historically, plant pathology departments have functioned analogously to schools of medicine: we have focused our training primarily at the graduate level, have taught relatively few students compared with the many classes and large class sizes typical of undergraduate curricula in colleges of Letters & Science, and faculty appointments (and thus promotion and tenure) have focused primarily on research rather than teaching. This model may no longer serve us well in the politics of the university, although the solution clearly transcends plant pathology. Like medicine, plant pathology may continue as a primarily graduate field of study, but the future health of the profession will depend upon the rapid development and implementation of effective strategies to survive in this environment. The past successes, present contributions, and future need for plant pathology require more effective advocacy. While such strategies might be developed at the national level, their targets are the dozens of departments nationwide, where the priorities of our profession must mesh with those of individual departments, colleges, and state governments. The committee has no great collective wisdom to suggest how this might be accomplished, only the suggestion of its necessity based upon trends of the previous 40 years, and the present situation of many departments across the United States. There is little to be gained by remaining a well-kept secret.\nThis committee is not the first to note the relatively low profile of plant pathology. APS, as well as many plant pathology departments in the United States, have a number of initiatives and outreach programs intended to increase the visibility of the profession. However, are these collective efforts producing the desired effects? Are the efforts misdirected, or in conflict or competition with efforts of other departments, states, regions, or allied disciplines? If the effort produces an effect, is it of the magnitude needed to sustain the discipline in the future, or is it so small as to be trivial? As an example of the foregoing, we offer the following anecdote. With over 507,000 members, the Future Farmers of America (FFA) is the single largest agricultural organization of high school students in the United States. Most of these students are college-bound and have a proven interest in agricultural sciences and careers. APS has staffed a booth at the FFA national convention for many years, where nearly 10% of the total FFA membership regularly attends. Nonetheless, when we logged onto the FFA website, and repeatedly entered \"plant pathology\" or \"plant pathologist\" in various permutations into the \"career explorer\" application (http:// www.ffa.org/index.cfm?method=c_job.Car eerSearch), most entries returned the response: \"Your search did not return any matching results\". Initiatives to increase the visibility of the profession and its benefits to society must be teamed with metrics to gauge the efficacy of these initiatives \"on the fly\". The lack of an effective feedback mechanism to reconcile results (or lack thereof) to goals imperils any initiative of our profession, irrespective of how popular or well-intentioned.\nLeaders of our profession have repeatedly insisted on the need to maintain an unbroken link between plant pathology and production agriculture (14) , to effectively justify the continued need for our service to those upon whom we depend for support (11) , and to maintain a distinct identity, however obscure, as plant pathologists (15) . As articulated by Luis Sequeira (14) , \"the strength of our science depends on our ability to combine basic research with direct application of the results to the solution of problems in agriculture\". Otherwise, there is little to distinguish the plant pathologist from any microbiologist or biochemist, nor a need to support what we otherwise promote as a redundant discipline. The committee does not suggest that plant pathology become isolated from allied disciplines. Indeed, the discipline is among the most integrative, and as noted in 1963 by Walker (15) and later by Horsfall and Cowling (6), has always been so. Walker (15) saw specialization as a twoedged sword: necessary to advance a science, but potentially leading to the development of cults within a discipline that would effectively lose contact with the core. Specialization is not in need of assistance or facilitation: it abounds. What is critically needed is unity and a sense of common purpose among the diverse elements of our profession. Our discipline is in some ways expanding and diffusing into diverse new channels at the same time that it appears to be contracting in conventional channels or as narrowly defined. Thus, while bolstering plant pathology in the traditional mainstream of academia, the USDA, and industry, it is important that we look outward to incorporate these new tributaries, and to engage them in APS. Guiding this process toward the best possible end is a challenge that is ideally met by APS. As the parent society of plant pathology in the United States, APS occupies a unique position of being able to provide information and guidance on strategic issues to individual departments, college administrations, and government agencies on the impact of various future scenarios on the profession and the security of agriculture at the national and international level. Note well that we write of APS as a society. We can look to our officers and headquarters staff for leadership and coordination, but the challenges we face will require that the general membership of APS become engaged for the long haul in finding and implementing solutions.
