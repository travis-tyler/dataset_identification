One of the participants declined a screening exercise test and another presented with persistent atrial fi brillation and was not tested until normal sinus rhythm was achieved pharmacologically. All screening exams began at a workload of 60 watts for 2 minutes and increased by about 30 watts every 2 minutes until maximal exhaustion. Ventilatory fl ow was evaluated using an in-line pre-vent pneumotach (MedGraphics, St. Paul, MN ), and in-line gas exchange was evaluated using a metabolic cart (MedGraphics CPX/D)."}, {"section_title": "Exercise Testing", "text": "Four of fi ve participants performed a familiarization session to determine appropriate workloads for the maximal exercise test. Maximal exercise treadmill testing was performed within 2 weeks of the familiarization session using the same protocols that were used during the 30-year follow-up assessments in 1996. Due to severe low back pain, one of the participants performed the familiarization and maximal exercise testing on a recumbent elliptical machine. During all maximal tests, heart rate (HR) was monitored continuously by ECG, and blood pressure was monitored every 2 -3 minutes by recording brachial artery cuff pressure (Suntech Biosystems, Morrisville, NC ). Gas exchange analysis was performed by the technique of Douglas, with [CO 2 ], [N 2 ], and [O 2 ] determined by mass spectrometry (Marquette MGA 1100) ( 3 ); ventilatory volume was measured from Douglas bags collected for 60-second intervals with a Tissot spirometer. In-line breath-by-breath evaluation by mass spectrometry served as backup to the Douglas bag collections, and ventilatory fl ow was determined by a turbine fl owmeter in a Ventilatory Measurement Module (Interface Associates, Inc., Morrisville, NC). CO was determined with a standard inert gas rebreathing technique, with acetylene as the soluble gas and helium as the insoluble gas ( 15 , 16 ) . This technique has previously been validated at rest and exercise against the direct Fick equation by others and within our laboratory ( 17 , 18 ) . This technique was also used in these same participants in the 1966 and 1996 evaluations ( 1 , 3 ) . Arterialized lactate was determined via fi ngerstick samples at the end of exercise (Yellowspring International 2300 Stat Plus; YSI, Yellowsprings, OH).\nOxygen uptake and CO were determined at rest and at maximal effort. During maximal exercise testing, Douglas bags were collected in the second minute of each of the fi nal three stages (as predicted from screening test data), with consecutive 60-second collections when the participant was nearing maximal effort. CO was determined during the fi nal 10 seconds of maximal exercise, followed within 2 minutes by fi ngerstick sample collection for lactate determination. Maximal exercise was defi ned as an inability to continue exercise despite vigorous encouragement and confi rmed by respiratory exchange ratio greater than 1.1, (minute ventilation) /VO 2 greater than 35, arterialized lactate greater than 6.0 mmol/L, HR approximately 100% predicted maximum, and respiratory rate greater than 30. Mean arterial pressure obtained during each CO determination was divided by the respective CO to estimate total peripheral resistance ( 19 ) . CO was divided by HR during rebreathing to calculate stroke volume (SV). Oxygen uptake was divided by CO to calculate AV-DO 2 according to the Fick equation."}, {"section_title": "Body Composition", "text": "Underwater weighing was performed, with residual volume corrections made by rebreathing an inert mixture of helium in all participants ( 20 ) .

Participant D was being treated with a combination of ACE inhibitor, diuretic, and alpha channel blocker (Prinivil, HCTZ, and Cardura). Participant E was being treated with a combination of calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, and diuretic (Norvasc, Lisinopril, and HCTZ). Screening visits revealed persistent atrial fi brillation in one of the participants and paroxysmal atrial fi brillation in another, both of whom were referred to their primary care providers for treatment and exercise testing was not performed until restoration of normal sinus rhythm in both participants. A renal cell carcinoma that had metastasized into the lower lumbar vertebrae was discovered by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a third participant who had reported severe back pain for several months prior to his initial visit.

All participants achieved maximal exertion upon cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Absolute VO 2max declined in three of the fi ve men (mean decline = 17%) between 1996 and 2006 ( Figure 1 ). The magnitude of the decline in VO 2max was proportionally less when indexed to total body mass (8.0%; 31.0 vs 28.5 mL/kg/min) and FFM (9.6%; 42.9 vs 38.8 mL/kg FFM/min). Between 1996 and 2006, CO max declined in the same three of the fi ve participants (mean decline = 11%; Figure 2 ), secondary to a decline in both HR max (181 vs 174 b.p.m.) and SV max (121 vs 109 mL). AV-DO 2max also declined in three of the fi ve men (mean decline = 8%; Figure 3 ). Changes in CO max were linearly correlated with the change in VO 2max between 1996 and 2006 ( r = 0.77; Figure 4 ).\nSeveral differences in the changes in cardiopulmonary variables between the two follow-up intervals (1966 -1996 and 1996 -2006 ) are of particular interest ( Figure 5 ). The proportional decline in VO 2max was greater in the 10 years between 1996 and 2006 than the previous 30-year interval ( \u2212 17% vs \u2212 8%). In the interval between 1966 and 1996, the decline in VO 2max was attributed entirely to a 17% decline in AV-DO 2-max . Although the proportional decline in AV-DO 2max was slightly less between 1996 and 2006 (8%), it was accompanied by an 8.5% decline in CO max , whereas no decline in CO max had been observed during the previous 30-year interval."}, {"section_title": "Individual Results", "text": "Individual age-related changes in maximal oxygen uptake and its determinants are provided in Table 3 . Participant A was one of the sedentary participants from the 1966 study. At the time of his visit in 2006, he was being treated for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, with a combination of ACE inhibitor or diuretic and statin, respectively. He had not performed regular exercise for more than 20 years prior to the 30-year follow-up but was performing resistance exercise training 3 d/wk for 2 years prior to the 2006 study. Body weight and body fat increased between 1966 and 1996 by Note: HR = heart rate; VO 2 = oxygen uptake; CO = cardiac output; SV = stroke volume; AV-DO 2 = arteriovenous oxygen difference. Note: HR = heart rate; VO 2max = maximal oxygen uptake; CO = cardiac output; SV = stroke volume; AV-DO 2 = arteriovenous oxygen difference; LBM = lean body mass; MAP = mean arterial pressure; TPW = total peripheral resistance. 30-year follow-up, he had intermittently jogged and pedaled a stationary bicycle. Prior to the 2006 follow-up, participant C was not taking any medications and was cycling 3 d/wk for 30 -45 minutes on a recumbent cycle ergometer. Prior to the screening visit, participant C had been diagnosed with paroxysmal atrial fi brillation and was in atrial fi brillation during his screening visit. He was treated with a calcium channel blocker and low-dose beta blocker for 6 weeks prior to performing maximal exercise testing, at which time he was in normal sinus rhythm. In the 10 years following the 1996 visit, he had lost 10 kg and 7% body fat. VO 2max had increased between 1966 and 1996 by 15% but decreased by 23% (2.8 vs 2.1 L/min) during the last 10-year interval, secondary to a decline in both CO max (16.4 vs 15.4 L/min) and AV-DO 2max (16.8 vs 13.7 vol%). The decline in CO max could be attributed to a decline in SV max (86 vs 81 mL/beat), whereas HR max remained unchanged (190 vs 190 b.p.m.).\nParticipant D was sedentary prior to the 1966 study. He played soccer in a semiprofessional league intermittently between 1996 and 2006 and had recently taken up cycling 1 -2 d/wk. He was diagnosed with hypertension 2 years before the 1996 evaluation and was being treated with a combination of diuretic, alpha blocker, and ACE inhibitor. Following maximal exercise testing in 2006, participant D developed atrial fi brillation that was resolved within 1 month with beta-blocker therapy. During the 10-year interval, weight and body fat remained unchanged, whereas VO 2max was unchanged from the 1966 and 1996 visits. Accordingly, there was no change in CO max (22.6 vs 22.5 L/min) or AV-DO 2max (11.8 vs 11.7 vol%). The decline in HR max from 1996 (189 vs 171 b.p.m.) was matched by an increase in SV max (120 vs 131 mL/beat).\nParticipant E had played football at the college and semiprofessional level in 1966. He had been lifting weights 2 d/wk prior to the 1996 study but was completely sedentary prior to the 2006 visit, due to severe low back pain. Since the 1996 visit, participant E had developed hypertension and was being treated with a combination of calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, and diuretic. In 2003, participant E had lapband surgery and therefore experienced signifi cant declines in body weight from 1996 to 2006 (163 vs 146 kg) and percent fat (30% vs 27%). Because of his persistent back pain, an exploratory MRI revealed destructive changes of his lumbar spine and he was ultimately diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Since the 1996 visit, VO 2max declined by 46% (3.5 vs 1.9 L/min). This was explained by a 28.5% decline in CO max (27.0 vs 19.3 L/min) and a 25% decline in AV-DO 2max (13.0 vs 9.8 vol%). Although HR max remained unchanged (160 vs 157 b.p.m.), SV max decreased 52% (169 vs 123 mL/beat).\nParticipant E experienced the largest declines in maximal oxygen uptake and its determinants, due in large part to the extreme sedentary lifestyle invoked by low back associated with the renal cell carcinoma. To more accurately describe the age-related trends on cardiovascular function data at maximal exercise, we have provided a column of mean data where his values were excluded from the analysis ( Table 2 ) ."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "The present study is a 10-year extension of a previous 30-year follow-up and represents one of the longest follow-up studies of the determinants of VO 2max in nonathletes. With repeated measurements performed after the fi fth decade of life, it is also one of the few studies to demonstrate changes in the age-specifi c decrements to the cardiovascular system during exercise.\nThe major fi nding of the previous follow-up study was that 3 weeks of bed rest resulted in a greater deterioration in cardiovascular and physical work capacity than 30 years "}, {"section_title": "Aging and Cardiovascular Capacity", "text": "The infl uence of age on maximal fi tness is a controversial topic. Cross-sectional studies suggest that maximal oxygen uptake declines linearly with age at a rate of approximately 0.45 mL/kg/min ( 4 , 6 , 22 -27 ) . Short-term longitudinal studies (5 -15 years) of athletes and sedentary individuals suggest that maximal oxygen uptake declines nonlinearly ( 7 , 12 ) and accelerates signifi cantly after the age of 50 or 60 years ( 7 ) . The longitudinal data presented here support this concept as the annualized decline in VO 2max doubled after the age of 50 years. This accelerated decline in fi tness was evident whether it was expressed in absolute units (55 vs 10 mL/y) or relative to FFM (0.41 vs 0.23 mL/kg FFM/min/y), suggesting that the decrement in VO 2max is related to changes in cardiovascular function and not changes in muscle mass. The age-specifi c differences in the rate of decline in VO 2max observed here is remarkably similar to that reported in the segmented longitudinal follow-up of participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (12 vs 42 mL/y and 0.55 vs 0.27 mL/kg FFM/min/y at 20 and 50 years of age) ( 7 ).\nAs such it appears as though there may be an age-specifi c threshold at which cardiovascular and physical function begins to deteriorate exponentially. It should be noted though that if the participant who developed metastatic cancer is excluded from this analysis, the reduction in VO 2max normalized to FFM is greatly attenuated with no difference compared with 1996 values. This fi nding underscores the importance of the development of comorbidities to the reduction in functional capacity with age."}, {"section_title": "Mechanistic Considerations", "text": "The relative contribution of central (CO) and peripheral (i.e., blood fl ow distribution and oxygen extraction) components to VO 2max is a widely debated topic. A decline in HR max is frequently cited as the predominant contributor to the decline in maximal oxygen uptake with age ( 7 , 22 , 23 ) . Our previous report demonstrated that SV max increased over time to compensate for the declining HR max , thereby maintaining CO max ( 3 ) . As such, the decline in VO 2max was explained entirely by a reduction in AV-DO 2max ( 3 ) . In contrast to the previous follow-up, in the present evaluations, reductions in both CO max and AV-DO 2max contributed to the reduction in VO 2max . The reduced capacity for increasing SV max and CO max (i.e., central cardiovascular reserve), in the face of declining peripheral oxygen extraction, may explain the accelerated decline in VO 2max occurring after the age of 50. Indeed, the change in CO max during the 10-year follow-up was closely associated with the change in VO 2max within this small cohort ( r = 0.77; Figure 4 ) ."}, {"section_title": "Study Limitations", "text": "The present study has several limitations. Similar to the previous follow-up, this study was uncontrolled with regard to many confounding variables, including activity level, lifestyle, diet and nutrition, biology, and most importantly the development of coexistant pathology. The study design did not permit the exclusion of any of the original participants due to underlying cardiovascular disease. The superimposition of chronic disease does enhance the external validity of the data; however, it limits our ability to assess the infl uence of age alone on VO 2max . The signifi cant deterioration of maximal oxygen uptake and its determinants in the one individual who effectively became bed ridden secondary to severe low back pain exemplifi es this limitation. When his data are excluded from the analysis, the 10-year changes in cardiovascular function are substantially less profound. The small number of participants limits our interpretation of the independent effects of age, activity, and chronic illness on maximal cardiovascular function and precludes meaningful statistical evaluation. Finally, the study examines the changes in VO 2max in men only, therefore limiting the generalizability of the fi ndings."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In summary, maximal oxygen uptake declined at a more rapid rate in these fi ve individuals after the age of 50 years, secondary to a decline in both CO max and AV-DO 2max . The rate of decline in maximal fi tness was accelerated in the 10-year interval after the age of 50 when expressed in absolute terms or relative to body weight or FFM. The decline in maximal oxygen uptake after the age of 50 years was highly individualized and dependant upon collective changes in muscle mass, habitual physical activity, and development of chronic illness. These variables working in concert likely explain the disproportionate decline in maximal fi tness observed in these men after the age of 50. Impressively, the decline in VO 2max after 40 years of life was comparable to that experienced after 3 weeks of bed rest at the age of 20 years."}]
