NCES supports a wide range of activities, providing policy-relevant data on issues as diverse as enrollment trends, access of minorities to postsecondary education, the academic achievement of students, comparisons of the United States education system with education systems in other countries, and the effect of education on employment and economic productivity. NCES programs are directed toward: maintaining and analyzing the following major cross-sectional databases: at the elementary/secondary levelthe Common Core of Data (CCD), the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), and the Private School Survey; and at the postsecondary levelthe Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, the National Study of Postsecondary Faculty, and the Survey of Earned Doctorates Awarded in the United States. Together, these studies provide accurate, timely, and relevant data on the condition of American education, as well as how it has changed over time. In addition, NCES conducts a National Household Education Survey (NHES) covering various educational topics such as early childhood and adult education, program participation, education-related home activities, and parental involvement in education. conducting surveys and analyzing data from the NCES' Longitudinal Studies Programs: at the early childhood levelthe Early Childhood Longitudinal Studies with birth and kindergarten cohorts; at the secondary school levelthe National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (12th-grade cohort), the High School and Beyond Study of 1980 (10th-and 12th-grade cohorts), and the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (8th-grade cohort); and at the postsecondary levelthe Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study and Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, which follow students attending or completing postsecondary institutions. These studies address a variety of important education issues from birth through postsecondary school, including differences in student achievement, effects of financial aid on access to postsecondary education, youth employment, high school dropouts, discipline and order in schools, and the quality of education in public and private schools. conducting the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which assesses academic achievement in a number of domains, including reading, mathematics, writing, science, art, history, and geography. NAEP is administered every 2 years in grades 4, 8, and 12 at the national level, and at selected combinations of these grades and domains in states that choose to participate. participating in international surveys of educational achievement and programs to develop cross-national education data and indicators such as the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), the largest, most comprehensive international study of schools and students ever undertaken. 1 administering targeted surveys through the Fast Response Survey System and the Postsecondary Education Quick Information System that provide data rapidly on current policy issues. collecting and reporting information on libraries through the Public Library Survey, the Academic Library Survey, the School Library Media Center Survey, and the State Library Survey. analyzing and reporting data on vocational education. synthesizing information from various surveys for NCES' annual publications: Digest of Education Statistics, The Condition of Education, and Projections of Education Statistics. Each chapter in this publication contains a brief introduction; a section on data uses; summaries of the various programs and plans; a list of selected publications, tabulations, and data files; an NCES contact person; and a data collection calendar for that group of programs."}, {"section_title": "What Kind of Data Does NCES Collect?", "text": "NCES collects statistical data on all levels of education from preprimary education through graduate study, including adult education. The surveys address a full range of education issues including: student access, participation, and progress; achievement and attainment of students; organization and management of education institutions; curriculum, climate, and diversity of educational institutions; and financial and human resources of institutions; as well as economic and other outcomes of education. NCES surveys involve a broad spectrum of people and institutions involved in education. The following examples of topics illustrate the scope of NCES' data collection and analysis activities: Adults are asked about their participation in adult education and other learning activities. Parents are surveyed about their participation in their children's education. Teachers are asked to report information about their classes. Libraries report information on usage. NCES' data and tabulations are made available at various levels of aggregation, ranging from the institutional to the national level (see table 1). The availability of data at a particular level of education is based on a variety of factors, including survey design and protection of confidential data. The level of aggregation of the data may affect how the data are available, whether in printed copy or name and year of the data set from which information is to be obtained (e.g., the 1990 wave of NELS:88); specific survey component from which information is to be obtained (e.g., NELS:88 Parent Questionnaire); variables to be analyzed; populations of interest (e.g., public school teachers with 1 year of experience); type of statistical analysis to be performed (e.g., cross tabulations); and requested medium of final product (e.g., diskette, hard copy, e-mail). All requests must be submitted in writing. Requests for data analysis can be submitted to the NEDRC in three ways: E-mail: nedrc@pcci.

NCES is engaged in a set of agency wide activities that are intended to help attain these goals. First, with respect to high quality, the reputation of NCES as a statistical agency is dependent on the integrity and the relevance of the information it produces. Second, with respect to customer-driven products, the value of NCES to the education community is contingent upon a full understanding of the data needs and interests of our customers. Third, with respect to availability, the success of NCES in making as much information available as possible hinges upon the effective use of technological advances."}, {"section_title": "Statistics Standards and Technical Review", "text": "The NCES set of statistical standards provide the guiding principles for data collection, analysis, and reporting of education data. NCES' staff and contractors use these standards in an ongoing effort to ensure the development of high-quality education data. From study design to final analysis, NCES products are subjected to a rigorous technical review process that involves statistical and subjectmatter experts from NCES and the broader education community. During study design and data collection, NCES uses a combination of internal work groups, external technical review groups, and contractors to design and collect data to meet the needs of the education community. Data collection and processing frequently involve the collaboration of NCES staff and several contractors configured in a manner designed to ensure checks and balances on quality control. Analyses are conducted only after analysis plans are developed and reviewed. Finally, the report review process usually involves a series of reviews by subject-matter and technical colleagues, culminating in a formal review by a combination of internal and external reviewers. NCES continually strives to increase the efficiency of the full review process, while at the same time maintaining high standards. At the present time, work is under way to identify emerging issues and to update the 1992 statistical standards that are currently in use. Over the past several years, NCES has also participated in an agency wide effort to evaluate existing quality control procedures and to develop and implement new ones."}, {"section_title": "Quality Control", "text": "In the fall of 1996, the Commissioner convened the Task Force on Quality Systems to study NCES quality control procedures, with the goal of identifying ways to improve the current procedures. The first phase of this task force included a review of current procedures and resulted in a set of 9 findings and 20 recommendations. These findings and recommendations focused on five areas: spread existing skills within NCES, improve documentation and communication, improve uses of computer systems for checking key results, improve the review process, and improve contract procedures. NCES is using Quality Improvement Teams to develop action plans for the recommendations. A number of projects are under way. For example, NCES guidelines for tabular presentations are being updated, and a report that documents analytic techniques applied in NCES' publications is in development. In addition, checklists are being drafted that will promote improved communications between analysts and programmers to increase consistency in the review of electronic data products and to document table production."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "In an effort to document NCES data collection procedures, the Statistical Standards Program is sponsoring and monitoring the development of a handbook of NCES data collections. The handbook will document key aspects of the design, collection, and processing of NCES surveys. A related report that summarizes the imputation procedures in NCES data collections is also under development. In a complementary project, the Statistical Standards Program conducted a review of the response rates in each NCES data collection. The results of this review will also be published in an NCES report. Periodically, statistical questions emerge that break new ground for NCES. The Statistical Standards Program consults and advises in these situations, and in some instances a panel of experts is used to consult on or review specific problems. Recent examples of this process include reviews of the issues surrounding the inclusion of students with limited English proficiency and students with disabilities in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP); of the response probability decision rules that are applied in NCES assessments; and of the NCES policies and procedures for analyzing data with low response rates. representatives of the Statistical Standards Program, and a representative from the Census Bureau. This team reviews disclosure risk analyses that are conducted on NCES data files to ensure that data released for public use do not place the identity of any individual respondents in jeopardy. The second major activity in this area is to approve and monitor restricted-use data licenses. (Similar restricted-use data licenses, a concept pioneered by NCES, are now being used in other federal statistical agencies.) These licenses provide external researchers access to potentially individually identifiable NCES data covered under federal statutes and regulations by subjecting authorized users to the laws, regulations, and penalties that apply to the NCES use of confidential data. Under the license agreement, authorized users are subject to unannounced inspection visits. The Statistical Standards Program monitors the licensing process and the inspections. Based on an analysis of inspection reports, program staff developed a set of recommendations for improved quality control and increased customer service. As a result, annual reminder letters are being used to update information on licensees and authorized users. In addition, an automated system is being developed for the field inspections. This will facilitate immediate corrections of potential security problems and will allow NCES' staff to monitor licensees more effectively.

In an effort to meet this goal, data are made available in a variety of formatsfrom published statistical compendia and online data almanacs, to microdata files for secondary analysis. NCES reports range from detailed technical, methodological, and analytic reports that provide an in-depth analysis of a particular topic or issue to Statistical Briefs and Issue Briefs that provide a short focused analysis of a specific topic. In continuing the effort to make NCES statistics available to a broad audience, NCES launched the NCES Education Statistics Quarterly, a periodical that includes findings from all NCES reports on a quarterly basis. All NCES publications are available online at the NCES Web Site (http://nces.ed.gov). NCES also continues to explore new and innovative ways to use the World Wide Web to make education information available to as many data users as possible.

As a part of an ongoing effort to better understand the data needs and interests of the education community, this team conducts a biennial customer service survey. The purpose of the survey is to assess customer satisfaction with NCES products and services, and to identify areas that need improvement. The last customer survey was conducted in 1999. The survey's respondents do not include all of NCES' customers; instead, the survey focuses on specific customer groups. The 1999 survey targeted several large groups of current and potential users: federal, state, and local policymakers; academic researchers; and journalists. The response rate to the 1999 survey was 79 percent. The survey results indicate strong satisfaction with NCES and its products. However, awareness of NCES varies considerably between respondent groups and products. NCES' customers use data for many purposes. Three main uses cited in the survey were general information, research and analysis, and planning. The data also suggested that the more experienced the user, the higher the level of satisfaction. The survey also indicated less satisfaction with the timeliness of NCES publications and data files, and the need for NCES to increase awareness of agency products and services. These are areas that NCES managers are seeking to improve."}, {"section_title": "Outreach Partnerships", "text": "In an effort to improve dissemination and increase the use of NCES' education statistics, NCES has developed \"partnerships\" with external organizations whose members are either interested in education data or could become potential users. With NCES acting as a data \"broker,\" these new collaborative relationships provide an excellent means for expanding the NCES customer base and learning more about the needs of specific data users. And by making use of existing communication channels in other organizations, NCES is also able to make contact with potential customers. Collaborative activities include providing information on NCES products in association newsletters and online services; developing links to Web Sites; providing training on NCES databases and other activities; developing individual workshops for specific data users; and identifying and assessing data needs. This two-way interaction with outside networks increases the utility of NCES products and services by more accurately reflecting the needs of various constituencies."}, {"section_title": "Practitioner's Web Page", "text": "Through focus groups and customer surveys, NCES has determined that local education practitioners (e.g., educators, administrators, counselors, librarians, and parents) are not adequately aware of NCES products and services. As a result, NCES developed a Web page targeted to the data needs of these groups. This new online service, called \"The K-12 Practitioners' Circle\" (http://nces.ed.gov/practitioners), presents education data in a user-friendly manner and links to a wide range of NCES publications and other relevant resources. In addition to alerting users to NCES findings on both continuing and emerging education issues, it provides information on relevant Instructors for both in-house and external-data-users seminars are usually NCES' staff members who have extensive knowledge and experience in the given subject matter.

For more information on the NCES Customer Service Program, contact: E-mail address: samuel.peng@ed.gov Technology NCES uses technological advances to make programs and internal activities more efficient and effective. Advances in technology are also helping to position NCES for future operations and new methods of data collection, analysis, and dissemination. Programs and individual projects are designed to be consistent with an overall vision of expanding access to NCES data. Eventually, computer and telecommunications technologies will enable all members of the educational communitylearners, parents, teachers, and administrators, as well as observers and policymakersto come directly to NCES for information. Technology tools developed by NCES will help reduce the burdens of data collection, enhance accuracy and timeliness of analysis, and increase the ease of access to education statistics. A variety of plans are being implemented to fully incorporate current and emerging technologies into the NCES working environment, and to provide both internal and external customers with timely education statistics in useful formats. Internal activities include acquiring and supporting up-to-date desktop hardware and software to facilitate statistical analyses, developing integrated software solutions for program management, and leveraging local-and wide-area network resources to share information. NCES currently provides access to its databases through a variety of mechanisms. These include the dissemination of data via diskettes and CD-ROMs, or through the NCES Web Site. However, developments in Web-related software and data warehousing provide new opportunities to broaden and strengthen NCES' data offerings. A new initiative has been undertaken to construct a data warehouse that will ultimately contain most NCES databases. Several developments will enhance the utility of the Web Site by speeding the access time and expanding the material available. Planned improvements in indices, subject categorizations, and database search utilities will improve the ability of users to get answers to questions. Software now being developed will also allow users to conduct online analyses with the Common Core of Data (elementary/secondary) (CCD) and IPEDS databases. Current activities to enhance electronic access to NCES data include: dissemination of products and services via the Internet and World Wide Web; improved data administration and development of a data warehouse resource; development and support of improved CD-ROM products for NCES databases; fostering increased capabilities of data suppliers and users to submit and retrieve NCES data electronically through the Internet; and expanding customer options for retrieving timely education data."}, {"section_title": "World Wide Web", "text": "An important component of the NCES Technology Program is the NCES Web Site (http://nces.ed.gov).

Other data sets too large for Web access and restricted-use survey data sets are made available on CD-ROMs direct from NCES. The NCES Web Site is its largest and most visible dissemination platform. Since the site's inception in May 1996, it has grown to nearly 30,000 pages. Current usage statistics indicate that approximately 700,000 user sessions and almost 2,700,000 page views take place on a monthly basis. NCES has a full-time Webmaster and a Web team consisting of liaisons from all divisions and the Commissioner's office. The Web Site has become the primary mode of communication for NCES and its varied constituencies. Features of the NCES Web Site include: a complete catalog (over 1,700 products) of NCES publications and data products the catalog allows a customized search by title, author, subject, survey or program area, and other criteria (hup://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch); product information pages containing brief abstracts, links to accessible formats of the desired products, ordering information, and other useful information; a searchable staff directory, by subject or topic specialty or name; the Student's Classroom, for our school-age visitors, with a \"find your school\" feature, quizzes, games, an easy-to-use graphing function, and many more activities; daily \"Did You Know\" education facts; statistical tables and education indicators for quick answers to questions; the most recent data sets for downloading and analysis; descriptions of NCES programs, including separate Web pages for all surveys and program areas; a national global education locator that allows searches for public schools, school districts, private schools, public libraries, and postsecondary institutions (see example below); and a \"Newsflash\" subscription service (http://nces.ed.gov/newsflash) about breaking NCES news.

NCES is currently piloting the collection of sample survey data from individual respondents over the Internet. This effort involves breaking new territory in education data collection in the application of data encryption methods necessary for the protection of confidential data. As NCES surveys are periodically redesigned, the Technology Program will utilize the Internet to provide a comprehensive online environment for the collection, editing, tabulation, and publication of survey data. The first survey to be redesigned in this manner is IPEDS. The first online collection for IPEDS was conducted in summer 1999. An online collection and processing environment will allow NCES to increase timeliness and quality of data, while minimizing the reporting burden placed upon our respondents.

Data warehouses are the next logical step in the expansion of automated information systems. These warehouses include more data and enable more powerful and flexible analysis. With education statistics, analyses have often been constructed with specific survey data. Cross-survey or time-trend analyses frequently required long and expensive data massaging and custom analysis. A data warehouse of education information will provide a rich, yet convenient resource for in-depth research. It will also provide a mechanism to respond to simple, but specific queries, such as: 'How do enrollment changes in my school district compare with those in other similar districts in another state?' The objective is to build a new education information source within the Web Site that will eventually provide integrated access to survey and linked survey data, metadata, survey instruments and documentation, and ultimately reports and other published analysis. The warehouse will be distinguished from existing NCES products in three respects: it will be exclusively Internet based; it will contain a growing repository of linked data from different surveys; and it will feature tools that will enable customers to easily find, extract, and analyze NCES data directly. The NCES data warehouse will be designed to expand and improve as more data are uploaded and Internet tools become more powerful.

These databases are available at no charge in ASCII flat file format that can be used with statistical processing software such. as SAS and SPSS. The goal of the archive is to share information about education with researchers, academics, policymakers, service providers, and other customers. NCES currently maintains over 500 national data collections relating to education. The data are collected from elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and universities, as well as from elementary, secondary, and postsecondary students and teachers. Each data collection contains an abstract, codebook, and one or more data files for research use. No statistical tables or printed reports are included.

Data collections include information on today's important issues, such as equity between schools and school districts, access to preschool programs, student trends, persistence, and the climate in our schools and classrooms. Other important issues addressed are school finance, school safety, teacher qualifications, school reform, teacher professional development, and the education of special needs populations. The core program includes national, state, and local data collection systems on public elementary and secondary education (i.e., the Common Core of Data (CCD) Survey). Important additions to the NCES data collection programs in the last decade include the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), the Private School Universe Survey (PSS), and the National Household Education Survey (NHES). These surveys, along with the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, the National Longitudinal Study of 1972, High School and Beyond, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, and the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, supply a wealth of information about elementary and secondary education in the nation."}, {"section_title": "Data Uses", "text": "The statistics collected from state education agencies, other elementary/secondary institutions, staff, and students are used extensively by people outside of NCES. They are used for testimony before congressional committees, planning in various federal executive departments, and projects developed by professional organizations. They are used by state executive and legislative staff, state and local education agencies, and associations of local school systems. Other users are colleges, universities, education research facilities, businesses that work with educational institutions, and the media (for reporting on educational issues and events). Federal, state, and local governments make numerous requests for data. For example, representatives often request data on the demographic characteristics of school districts in their states; federal agencies request data on numbers of teachers and pupils by school level and type; state governments request data on high school dropouts and teacher attrition rates; and local governments request analyses of teacher demographics. In addition to federal, state, and local governmental requests for elementary and secondary information, foreign governments also request data on trends in American public schools. The media often need a great deal of data on elementary and secondary education for their reporting. For example, the media has used analyses of first-time teachers in the United States, characteristics of public schools, dropout rates, test scores, and urban school trends in their reporting. Colleges and universities request CD-ROMs of all of the elementary and secondary surveys. Some items of interest for college researchers have been teacher qualifications in mathematics and science, poverty status of schools and schoOl districts, free-lunch eligibility of students, dropout rates and high school completions, class size, crime and violence, and persistence and attainment. Business organizations, including marketing and survey firms, use demographic profiles of schools and districts in their research. Also, parents use data on elementary and secondary schools and school districts (such as per pupil expenditures and class size) when they are in the process of moving their families to a new location.\nThe NCES postsecondary education data systems provide information such as trends in enrollment and degree completion, patterns of expenditures and revenues of institutions, patterns of student financial aid, workload of faculty, and the relationship between educational experience and labor market outcomes. These data are used to describe the condition of postsecondary education and to monitor changes. Federal program staff have used IPEDS and student survey data to address policy issues on financial aid programs. Policymakers at the state and institutional levels have used IPEDS data for planning purposes. Government commissions have used these data to monitor compliance with federal legislation. Thousands of requests for information, based on IPEDS and other postsecondary programs, are received by NCES each year. Those requesting data fall roughly into the following seven categories: Members of the executive branch, Congress and congressional committees, and a number of independent federal agencies use information from NCES on a regular basis. For example, an office of the legislative branch used IPEDS information to develop a profile of proprietary, less-than-2-year institutions. Several executive branch offices use the information to track baccalaureate and higher degree data by selected fields of study and minority status of degree recipients. An independent . federal agency uses the information to track degree completions in engineering and scientific fields of study. State higher education agencies regularly use the data to help determine salary and fringe benefit packages for their full-time instructional staff. Other state agencies use the completions and institutional data on an annual basis to evaluate the availability of specific career training programs. Several state agencies have used the residence and migration data to determine where their high school graduates enroll in postsecondary education institutions. National and regional education associations annually request tabulations to determine enrollment patterns by racial/ethnic categories and fields of study, and finance data to review the economic health of postsecondary education institutions. Individual institutions use similar information at an institutional level for peer analyses and institutional planning purposes. These peer analyses range from comparing selected financial ratios to comparing proportions of minority student enrollments. The media, business community, and general public use the information in a variety of ways. For example, one newspaper used the data to develop a major article that compares public 4-year institutions across selected states. Members of the business community have used degree completion data to target minority recruitment efforts in selected fields of study. The general public regularly requests information on which institutions offer degrees in specific fields of study.\nThe NLS-72 data have been widely used for investigating educational policy issues. For example, in the early 1980s, a congressional committee turned to these data to develop a model for estimating the costs of tuition tax credits. Capsule descriptions of this cohort have been produced and attrition rates from college have been studied, as have transitions from high school and college into the workplace. Postsecondary attainment, access, and financial aid studies have all used NLS-72.\nNCES receives many requests for information about education in other countries, such as school achievement levels, school completion rates, school expenditure levels, and higher education enrollment rates. Policymakers, such as chief state school officers, governors, and local school officials, also want to know the average level of achievement in other countries. Most requests are for data concerning highly developed countries (e.g., AUstralia, Canada, England, France, Germany, and Japan). This particular concern relates to maintaining a leading position in the world economy. However, interest goes beyond how well the education systems do in preparing youth for the labor force, to questions of civic engagement and further participation in education. NCES also provides international data on instructional practices. These data are gathered through two vehicles: survey data gathered at the same time assessment data are collected and videotape data. Both vehicles allow researchers to examine and illustrate instructional practices around the world. Data from these international activities appear prominently in numerous publications produced not only in the United States, but also by international organizations. The OECD publication, Education at a Glance, relies heavily on data gathered through NCES. United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization reports on literacy have begun to follow the conventions developed by the International Adult Literacy Study, which NCES helped to underwrite.\nExcept for the School Library Media Centers Survey, each of the library surveys is a universe survey, and the data files resulting from these surveys can be used as a framework to develop samples of libraries for additional surveys by NCES, other agencies, or researchers. The data resulting from these surveys provide important information on monetary, human, and educational resources and services. Some of the descriptive information provided by the library survey data include staffing levels and size and content of the collections in libraries, populations served by the libraries, the number of items per year that libraries circulate, library expenditures, and the extent of public library services. The four library surveys provide the only current, national, and descriptive data on the status of libraries. They are used by professional associations, local practitioners, and federal, state, and local officials for planning, evaluation, and policymaking. These data are also available to researchers and educators to analyze the state of the art of librarianship and to improve its practice. In addition to the periodic surveys of libraries, NCES has carried out some sample surveys related to public librariesboth to assess the feasibility of incorporating certain items into its universe surveys and to obtain information that addresses more specific issues. For example, in 1993, NCES conducted a survey of public library services to children and young adults using the Fast Response Survey System (FRSS). Several items on the extent of children's services were added to the Public Libraries Survey in 1995 based on the results of this FRSS survey. NCES also collected information from households about frequency of use and the purposes for which households use public libraries through the National Household Education Survey in 1996. This usage information can be extremely helpful for policymakers setting priorities for libraries in relation to demands for 139 other public services. Having additional information on how individuals actually use libraries provides practitioners important insights on ways to serve their customers better."}, {"section_title": "Studies", "text": "\nIntegrated Postsecondary Education Data System IPEDS, established as the core postsecondary education data collection program for NCES, is a system of surveys designed to collect data from all primary providers of postsecondary education.

For example, they can be used to analyze differences in expenditures for education across large and small, or urban, suburban, and rural school districts. The CCD can be used to produce dropout rates for different types of school districts and track changes over time. It also can be used to measure changes in the racial/ethnic distribution of students in public schools. The school universe allows users to look at characteristics, such as pupil/teacher ratios at various instructional levels or to use the addresses in the school locator to request records for transferring students. All of this information can be found on the CCD Web Site (http://nces.ed.gov/ccd). In addition, an annually produced CD-ROM links all of the CCD data, fiscal and nonfiscal, with school district-level data from the 1990 Decennial Census in an easy-to-use format. (Census 2000 data will be added in 2003.) The CCD is an important resource for policymakers at the state and local levels. The CCD provides basic statistics on schools, school districts, and states. Some examples of descriptive statistics available from CCD are student enrollment by race/ethnicity, the number and types of schools, revenues and expenditures of school districts, and the number of high school completers and dropouts."}, {"section_title": "Design", "text": "The CCD survey collects data on all public elementary and secondary schools, local education agencies, and state education agencies (SEAs) throughout the United States. The CCD contains three categories of information: general descriptive information on schools and school districts, data on students and staff, and fiscal data. The general descriptive information includes school and district name, address, phone number, and type of locale (e.g., rural or urban), as well as some information about the type of school (e.g., magnet, charter) or district (e.g., regular, state operated). The data on students include demographic, enrollment, and outcome characteristics. The numbers and types of education staff are reported as well. The fiscal data cover revenues and expenditures by object and function. The CCD is made up of six surveys sent to state education departments. Most of the data are obtained from administrative records maintained by SEAs. Statistical information is collected annually from public elementary and secondary schools (approximately 89,000), public school districts (approximately 16,000), the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the U.S. Department of Defense overseas dependents' schools, and 5 outlying areas. The SEAs compile CCD data into prescribed formats and transmit the information to NCES.\nThe sample design for SASS is a stratified probability sample in which schools are selected first; then within schools, the principal and a sample of teachers are surveyed. The SASS sample has been designed to support the following types of estimates and comparisons: national and state estimates for public schools, teachers, and districts; national estimates for private schools and teachers by religious affiliation or type of school; national data on BIA schools; national data on public charter schools; and national comparisons of elementary, secondary, and combined schools and teachers. The teacher sample also supports comparisons of new versus experienced teachers, teachers by teaching assignment field, and many other characteristics of teachers. For the 1999-2000 administration of SASS, one major new component was added to the survey. SASS now has questionnaires that survey the entire population of public charter schools in the United States as of the 1998-99 school year, as well as their principals. In addition, in the same manner as for regular public and private schools, a sample of teachers within each charter school was surveyed. Also, the public and private school library media center components from the 1993-94 SASS were continued in the current administration, as well as the BIA school component and an oversample of schools in which American Indian students comprise 20 percent or more of the school's total enrollment. Teacher Follow-up SurveySee later description in this section.\nTwo questionnaires comprise the TFS: The Teacher Follow-up Survey Questionnaire for Former Teachers and the Teacher Follow-up Survey Questionnaire for Current Teachers (those who remained in the same school as well as those who moved to another school). These questionnaires ask teachers about their current status, occupational changes and plans, reasons for staying in (or leaving) teaching, and attitudes about the teaching profession. The first administration of the TFS was in the 1988-89 school year with a sample from the 1987 88 SASS of about 2,500 teachers who had left teaching and 5,000 who were still in teaching. The size of the sample is approximately the same for every cycle of the TFS. There have been two more administrations of the TFS, 1991-92 and 1994-95. Each collection of the TFS is a follow-up to the SASS sample of the previous year. The fourth and latest administration of the TFS, 2000-01, is a follow-up to the 1999-2000 SASS. Information on the TFS can be found on the Internet (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/sass) and by contacting NCES staff: \nThe target population for the universe survey consists of all private schools in the United States that meet NCES criteria of a school (i.e., a private school is an institution that provides instruction for any of grades K through 12, has one or more teachers to give instruction, is not administered by a public agency, and is not operated in a private home). The survey universe is composed of schools identified from a variety of sources. The main source is a list frame, initially developed for the 1989 90 PSS. The list is updated regularly with lists provided by nationwide private school associations, state departments of education, and other national guides and sources that list private schools. In addition, the general public may make suggestions for additional schools for the survey through the NCES Web Site. The other source is an area frame search in approximately 120 geographic areas conducted by the Bureau of the Census. [1999][2000] Private School SurveySurvey of private schools to ascertain level of school, religious orientation or other affiliation, size of school, length of school year and school day, total enrollment (K-12), race/ethnicity of students, whether a school is coeducational or single sex, number of high school graduates, number of teachers, program emphasis, whether school offers a kindergarten program, and whether school has a library media center.\nThe NHES is designed as a mechanism for collecting detailed information on educational issues from a relatively large and targeted sample of households in a timely fashion. Households are selected using random-digit-dialing methods and data are collected using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) procedures. The sample for the NHES is drawn from the civilian population in households having a telephone in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In each NHES, between 44,000 and 64,000 households are screened, and individuals within households who met predetermined criteria are sampled for more detailed or extended interviews. The data are weighted to permit estimates of the entire population. The NHES survey for a given year typically consists of a screener questionnaire that collects household composition and demographic data and 2 to 3 substantive surveys addressing education-related topics. Generally, between 10,000 and 15,000 interviews are obtained for each survey. One of the goals of the NHES is to produce reliable national estimates of the characteristics of children's and adults' educational experiences for the targeted populations and for relevant subgroups defined by race and ethnicity. Estimates by race and ethnicity are of great interest, especially for monitoring education trends over time. Therefore, the NHES design oversamples minorities in order to increase the reliability of estimates for these groups. Another goal of the NHES is to monitor educational activities over time. The NHES has collected data by repeating topical surveys on a rotating basis in order to provide comparative data across survey years (with the exceptions of NHES:93 (School Safety and Discipline) and NHES:96 (Household Public Library Use) surveys). Each administration of the NHES has benefited from experience with previous cycles, resulting in enhancements to the survey procedures and content.\nFRSS surveys collect and report data on key education issues at the elementary and secondary levels. A similar survey system, the Postsecondary Education Quick Information System (PEQUIS), conducts time-sensitive surveys at the postsecondary level (see description in chapter 4). Data collected through FRSS surveys are representative at the national level, drawing from a universe that is appropriate for each study. The FRSS collects data from SEAs and national samples of other educational organizations and participants, including: local education agencies; public and private elementary and secondary schools; elementary and secondary school teachers and principals; and public and school libraries. In order to present high-quality data quickly, the FRSS provides the following services: research on survey topics and questionnaire design, pretest of survey questionnaires, quality control of survey data, national estimates reported within 1 year of survey mail-out, guarantee of response rates of 90 percent or higher, tabulations and other analyses of data, and preparation of survey reports. The FRSS also has the capability to conduct brief surveys of households using random-digit-dialing telephone techniques. thereafter. The focus of the supplement is on crimes committed against 12-to 18-year-olds in elementary and secondary schools.\nThe School Crime Supplement is conducted from January through June of the collection year in all NCVS sample households. Within these households, eligible respondents for the School Crime Supplement are household members between the ages of 12 and 18 who attended school at any time in the previous 6 months. The school had to be one that would advance them toward the receipt of a high school diploma. Eligible individuals are administered the supplemental questions only after the entire NCVS interview is completed. More than 10,000 interviews of youth are obtained in the School Crime Supplement. A rotation scheme is used in order to reduce the burden on respondents that could result if they were permanently in the sample. The same rotation scheme employed for the NCVS survey design is used for the School Crime Supplement. The sample of households is divided into groups or rotations. One rotation group enters the sample every 6 months and the corresponding rotation group from a previous sample is phased out. Households remain in the sample for 3 years, and each household is interviewed once every 6 months during that time. Households in the sample for the first time are in the incoming rotation and are interviewed in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone except the in-person fifth interview to reestablish personal contact. In 1995 and 1999, about 30 percent of the households were interviewed by telephone from a centralized dialing facility using CATI techniques. Other telephone interviews were conducted by the same interviewer who conducted the personal interviews. The Census Bureau conducts the data collection. Reports released by the Bureau of Justice Statistics using NCES data can be found on the Internet (http://www.ojp.usdoj.govlbjs).\nThe CPS is a nationally representative probability sample survey of households. A multistage stratified sampling scheme is used to select sample households. The survey is conducted in approximately 50,000 dwelling units monthly. Dwelling units are in sample for 4 successive months, out of sample for the next 8 months, and then returned to the sample for the following 4 months. An adult member of each household provides information for all members of the household.\nWithin IPEDS, postsecondary education is defined as \"the provision of a formal instructional program whose curriculum is designed primarily for students who are beyond the compulsory age for 56 high school. This includes programs whose purpose is academic, vocational, and continuing professional education, and excludes vocational and adult basic education programs.\" Organizations that provide instructional programs as described in the definition above are considered institutions within the IPEDS universe if their primary purpose is the provision of postsecondary education. The size of the institution, diversity of program offerings, levels of awards, degree or certification curricula, type of accreditation, or other distinguishing criteria are considered characteristics of particular institutions. These criteria are not used to determine which institutions are included in or excluded from the IPEDS universe. This universe of postsecondary education institutions is divided into the following three categories based on the highest degree awarded or the length of the longest program: baccalaureate or higher degree institutions; 2-year award institutions (that is, institutions must have at least a 2-year program, but less than a 4-year program); and less than 2-year institutions. Each of these three categories is further disaggregated by type of financial control: public, private not-for-profit, and private for-profit. The resulting nine institutional categories are called \"sectors\" within the IPEDS universe and are used, in conjunction with their eligibility status, to determine which data collection items institutions complete. Despite the diversity of institutions across these sectors, since institutions are the primary unit for data collection, institutional units must be defined as consistently as possible. IPEDS does not request separate reports from more than one component within an individual institution. However, separate branch campuses are asked to report as individual units; thus, each institution in a multiinstitutional system and each separate branch in a multicampus system report separately. IPEDS defines a branch institution as \"a campus or site that is not temporary, is located in a community beyond a reasonable commuting distance from its parent institution, and offers organized programs of study, not just courses.\" This last criterion is the most important. It means that at least one degree or award program can be completed entirely at the site, without requiring any attendance at the main campus or any other institution within the system. The IPEDS universe of postsecondary institutions includes only those institutions that are open to the general public. Therefore, training sites at prisons, military bases, and corporations are not considered as separate institutions or branches in IPEDS, regardless of how the institutional system classifies such training sites. Data on enrollment, finance, and completions from such locations or training sites are to be incorporated into the data reported by the main campus or any other institution or branch campus in the system that is most appropriate. With respect to postsecondary education provided in conjunction with hospitals, the intent of IPEDS is to include only those hospitals that contain one or more separate entities whose primary purpose is the provision of postsecondary education. A school of nursing or a school of radiology are two examples of such entities. Hospitals offering only internships or residency programs should not be included, nor should hospitals that only offer training as part of a medical school program. Training conducted as part of a medical school program should be included in the reports of the postsecondary institution offering the medical program. Hospitals operating more than one school are treated as a single postsecondary entity. This is consistent with the practice for other postsecondary institutions, where NCES only requests reports for the institution as a whole, not separate reports for each program within the institution. Since the definition of postsecondary education excludes noncredit continuing education programs and education units, organizational entities that provide only these educational services are not included as institutions. Schools whose only mission is to prepare students to take a particular test, such as the CPA examination or the Bar examination, are not included in IPEDS. These programs are not considered academic, vocational, or continuing professional. Organizations that offer training at many sites (such as H&R Block) may be consolidated into a single institutional unit when deemed appropriate by NCES. High schools with vocational programs are also excluded from IPEDS because their primary purpose is not postsecondary education.\nThe NHES is designed as a mechanism for collecting detailed information on educational issues from a relatively large and targeted sample of households in a timely fashion. Households are selected using random-digit-dialing methods and data are collected using CATI procedures. The sample for the NHES is drawn from the civilian population in households having a telephone in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In each NHES, between 44,000 and 64,000 households are screened, and individuals within each household who meet predetermined criteria are sampled for more detailed or extended interviews. The data are weighted to permit estimates of the entire population. The NHES survey for a given year typically consists of a screener questionnaire that collects household composition and demographic data and two to three substantive surveys addressing education-related topics. Generally, between 10,000 and 15,000 interviews are obtained for each survey. One of the goals of the NHES is to produce reliable estimates of the characteristics of children's and adults' educational experiences for that targeted population and for domains defined by race and ethnicity. Estimates by race and ethnicity are of great interest, especially for monitoring education trends over time. Therefore, the NRES design oversamples minorities in order to increase the reliability of estimates for these groups. Another goal of the NHES is to monitor educational activities over time. The NHES has collected data by repeating topical surveys on a rotating basis in order to provide comparative data across survey years (with the exception of NHES:93 School Safety and Discipline and NHES:96 Household Public Library Use surveys). Each administration of the NHES has benefited from experiences with previous cycles, resulting in enhancements to the survey procedures and content. Thus, while the survey affords the opportunity for tracking phenomena over time, it is dynamic in addressing new issues and including conceptual and methodological refinements. A design feature implemented in NHES:96 was the collection of demographic and educational information on members of all households rather than just those households that were potentially eligible for a topical survey. This expanded screening feature included a brief set of questions on the use of public libraries. The total household sample size was large enough to produce state estimates for these brief topical questions. In 1999, the NBES was designed as a special end-of-decade collection to measure key topics covered in previous NHES surveys. These topics included Early Childhood Education and School Readiness, Parent and Family Involvement in Education, Civic Involvement, and Adult Education and Lifelong Learning.  1991. Samples of 14,892, 19,722, and 6,679 adults were interviewed in 1991. Information on the following topics was collected for the Adult Education and Lifelong Learning 63 Surveys: participation in adult education activities in the previous 12 months and characteristics of participants; main reasons for participation; subject matter, duration, sponsorship, purpose, and cost of course; and in 1991 and 1995, barriers to participation of sampled nonparticipants. Adult Civic Involvement Survey (NHES:96)In 1996, 2,250 adults were interviewed for this survey. Information on the following topics was collected for the Adult Civic Involvement Survey: availability of reading materials in the home, sources of information on politics and national issues, participation in the community and civic activities, political attitudes, knowledge of the government, and opinions about improving public education.  1991National Household Education Surveys: CD-ROM (July 1997) 1991, 1996 \nWith the increased use of technology, the design for the NPSAS sample has changed over the years. The 1995-96 design no longer involves an initial sample of geographic areas and institutions within geographic areas. To be eligible for inclusion in the institutional sample, an institution must satisfy the following conditions: offer an education program designed for persons who have completed secondary education; offer an academic, occupational, or a vocational program; offer access to persons other than those employed by the institution; offer more than just correspondence courses; 65 offer at least one program lasting 3 months or longer; and be located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico. Additional information on the sample design for each NPSAS is described in the Methodology Report for each cycle. NPSAS data come from multiple sources, including institutional records and student and parent interviews. Detailed data concerning participation in student financial aid programs are extracted from the U.S. Department of Education's financial aid application system, the National Student Loan Data System, and institutional records. In 1986-87, family circumstances, demographic data, and plans and aspirations were collected using student and parent questionnaires. Beginning with the 1989-90 NPSAS, student and parent data were collected using CATIs. The 1986-87 NPSAS sampled students enrolled in the fall of 1986. Beginning with the 1989-90 NPSAS, students enrolled at any time during the year were eligible for the study. This design change provided the data necessary to estimate full-year financial aid awards. Beginning with the 1989-90 survey, the NPSAS included a longitudinal component and collected baseline data for a specified cohort of students. Students who began their postsecondary education during 1989-90 were interviewed in 1992, and again in 1994, to examine such issues as persistence and effects of financial aid on subsequent enrollment. Students who graduated with a baccalaureate degree during 1992-93 were surveyed in 1994, and again in 1997, to examine issues such as the transition from college to work and access to graduate school. Students who began in 1995-96 were followed in 1998 and 2001. These longitudinal surveys, known as the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, are described more thoroughly in chapter 6. The NPSAS covers a number of topics of interest to policymakers, educators, and researchers. For example, the NPSAS analyzes the participation of students in financial aid programs. The goal is to identify institutional, student, family, and other characteristics related to program participation. Special population enrollment in postsecondary education is also analyzed. These populations include students with disabilities, racial/ethnic minorities, students taking remedial-developmental courses, students from families with low incomes, and older students. Another component of the NPSAS is the study of the distribution of students by major field of study. Major fields of particular interest include mathematics, science, and engineering, as well as teacher preparation and health studies. The NPSAS generates data on factors associated with choice of postsecondary institution, participation in postsecondary vocational education, parental support for postsecondary education, and occupational and educational aspirations.\nThe first cycle of NSOPF was conducted by NCES with support from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in 1987-88 (NSOPF:88) with a sample of about 500 colleges and universities, over 3,000 department chairpersons, and over 11,000 instructional faculty. The second and third cycles of NSOPF were conducted by NCES with support from NEH and the National Science Foundation in 1992-93 (NSOPF:93) and 1998-99 (NSOPF:99), respectively. NSOPF:93 and NSOPF:99 were limited to surveys of institutions and faculty, but with substantially expanded samples of about 975 colleges and universities, and 30,000 faculty and instructional staff. NSOPF:88 was limited to faculty and staff who had some instructional responsibilities (e.g., teaching one or more courses for credit, supervising thesis or dissertation committees, individualized instruction), while NSOPF:93 and NSOPF:99 included these individuals, as well as faculty who had no instructional responsibilities (e.g., those engaged exclusively in research, administration, or public service). Faculty status was determined by each institution. A two-stage stratified random sample design was used for all three studies. The first-stage sampling frame consisted of a subset of postsecondary institutions drawn from the IPEDS universe. The subset of institutions included all public and private, not-for-profit U.S. postsecondary institutions that granted a 2-year or higher degree. A modified Carnegie classification was used to stratify institutions by type and control. The second-stage sampling frame consisted of a subset of faculty and instructional staff drawn from lists of faculty and instructional staff provided by the institutions selected in the first-stage sampling. This subset of faculty and instructional staff was surveyed by mail, with CATI nonresponse follow-up. In addition, Web versions of the questionnaires were made available for NSOPF:99. All three studies gathered information regarding the backgrounds, responsibilities, workloads, salaries, benefits, attitudes, and future plans of both full-and part-time faculties. In addition, information was gathered from institutional-and department-level respondents (department-level data collected in 1988 only) on such issues as faculty composition, turnover, recruitment, retention, and tenure policies. The NSOPF can be found on the Internet (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/nsopf). For more information on the NSOPF, contact: \nSurvey forms are mailed to graduate deans each May for distribution to individuals receiving their doctorates between July 1 and June 30 of the next year. The data are collected, edited, and published by the National Opinion Research Corporation (NORC). Each year, NORC publishes general survey results in a summary report. NORC also provides detailed tabulations to each sponsoring agency.\nPEQIS employs a standing sample (panel) of approximately 1,500 postsecondary education institutions and a panel of 51 state higher education agencies. PEQIS is designed to conduct brief surveys of postsecondary institutions or state higher education agencies on topics of national importance. Surveys are generally limited to two or three pages of questions, with a response burden of about 30 minutes per respondent. The sampling frame for the PEQIS panel recruited in 1992, was constructed from the 1990-91 IPEDS Institutional Characteristics file. The PEQIS frame included 2and 4-year (including graduate-level) institutions (both institutions of postsecondary education and other postsecondary institutions), and less-than-2-year institutions of higher education located in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The PEQIS sampling frame was stratified by instructional level (4-year, 2-year, less-than-2-year), control (public, private not-for-profit, and private for-profit), highest level of offering (doctor's/first professional, master's, bachelor's, and less than bachelor's), total enrollment, and status as either an institution of higher education or other postsecondary institution. Within each of the strata, institutions were sorted by region (Northeast, Southeast, Central, and West), whether the institution had a relatively high minority enrollment, and whether the institution had research expenditures exceeding $1 million.\nThree separate assessments are conducted: trend NAEP, main national NAEP, and main state NAEP. In the trend NAEP, students are periodically assessed in science, mathematics, reading, and writing. Nationally representative samples of students have been assessed in science, mathematics, and reading at ages 9, 13, and 17 since the early 1970s. Students have been assessed in writing at grades 4, 8, and 11 since 1984. To measure trends accurately, assessment items (mostly multiple choice) and procedures have remained unchanged since the first assessment in each subject. Recent trend assessments were conducted in 1994, 1996, and 1999. About 30,000 students took part in the 1999 trend assessment. Results are reported as average scores for the nation, regions, and various subgroups of the population such as racial and ethnic groups. Data from the trend assessments are available in the most recent report, NAEP 1999 Trends in Academic Progress, or in a brief summary report, Report in Brief: NAEP 1996 Trends in Academic Progress. Both reports are available on the World Wide Web at the NAEP Web Site (http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard). In the main national NAEP, a nationally representative sample of students is assessed at grades 4, 8, and 12 in various academic subjects. The assessments change periodically and are based on frameworks developed by the National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB). Items include both multiple-choice and \"constructed-response\" (requiring written answers) questions. Results are reported in two ways. Average scores are reported for the nation, participating states and jurisdictions, and subgroups of the population. In addition, the percentage of students at or above the basic, proficient, and advanced achievement levels are reported for these same groups. The achievement levels are developed by NAGB. Since 1990, the main NAEP has also been conducted for states and other jurisdictions that choose to participate (47 participated in 1996). State data are usually available at grades 4 and/or 8, and may not include all subjects assessed in the national-level assessment. In 1994, for example, NAEP assessed reading, geography, and history at the national level at grades 4, 8, and 12; however, only reading at grade 4 was assessed at the state level. In 1996, mathematics and science were assessed nationally at grades 4, 8, and 12. In the states, mathematics was assessed at grades 4 and 8, and science was assessed at grade 8 only. In 1997, the arts were assessed at the national level at grade 8. In 1998, reading and writing were assessed at the national level for grades 4, 8, and 12, and at the state level for grades 4 and 8. Civics was assessed at the national level as well. These assessments generally involve about 130,000 students at the national and state levels. In the trend, main national, and main state assessments, background information was collected from students, teachers, and school administrators. This information provides the context within which the academic performance of major student groups can be evaluated. Data are available on such student characteristics as gender, race and ethnicity, level of parents' education, eligibility for the free or reduced-price lunch program, participation in Title I to assist at-risk students, attendance at public or private schools, limited-English proficiency, and presence of a disability. Characteristics of teachers include academic preparation and classroom practices. NAEP also reports on school characteristics, such as courses offered, availability of computers, participation of parents, and the existence of problems such as tardiness or violence. To maintain its reputation as \"The Nation's Report Card\" and to enhance its serviceability to the nation, NAEP is undergoing a deliberately incremental redesign of its program. Beginning in 2000, the main NAEP will reflect the results of extensive redesign. For example, assessments will take place annually. Assessment of academic subjects will be on a more regular basis than in the past. Core academic subjectsreading, writing, mathematics, and sciencewill be assessed every 4 years (reading may be assessed every 2 years). Frameworks for these subjects will be developed to last through three assessments (i.e., 12 years). Other subjects, such as geography, history, the arts, and foreign languages, will be assessed in the intervening years. Streamlining NAEP's sampling scheme, data collections, and reporting schedule while increasing the information value of the various subject matter tests will enable NCES to provide the nation an enriched, technically rigorous, and authoritative basis for making decisions about education.\nFor the latest NAEP High School Transcript Study, about 25,000 transcripts were systematically transcribed to determine the course-taking patterns of 12th-grade high school students selected from the 2000 NAEP assessment sample. These data make it possible to link assessment results to coursetaking patterns. The following three summary tables were included in a report on the 2000 study: The percentage of high school graduates earning minimum credits in a core curriculum of courses recommended by the 1983 NCEE report. The 2000 percentages were compared with those from 1982, 1987, 1990, 1994, and 1998. The mean number of credits (Carnegie units) that graduates earned in each major subject field in 2000. The number of students who received credit in 2000 in secondary courses in the NCES Classification of Secondary School Courses. The 2000 coded data were compatible with the data collected in the 1982 HS&B and NELS:88 Transcript Studies and the NAEP 1987 High School Transcript Studies. This standardization and comparability will be useful in later analyses for comparing the results of the three studies.\nThe 1992 NALS defined literacy as \"using printed and written information to function in society, to achieve one's goals, and to develop one's knowledge and potential.\" Literacy was measured along three dimensions: prose literacythe ability to understand and use information from connected texts that include editorials, news stories, and poems; document literacythe ability to locate and use information contained in documents, such as job applications or payroll forms, bus schedules, maps, tables, and indexes; and quantitative literacythe ability to apply arithmetic operations to numbers embedded in printed materials, such as balancing a checkbook, figuring a tip, completing an order form, or determining the amount of interest from a loan advertisement. Because policymakers needed to assess a broad range of abilities in the population, but did not need to diagnose literacy problems of individuals, the 1992 assessment was designed to cover a broad range of skills. All questions underwent extensive review by subject area and measurement specialists, as well as scrutiny to eliminate any bias or lack of sensitivity to particular groups. It would take any one individual about 4 hours to complete the entire assessment. To keep the burden on any one individual to less than 1 hour, the assessment was cut into 13 blocks, with only 3 blocks given to each respondent. The responses to the items were pooled and reported by proficiency scales on the three dimensions of literacy. NALS was administered in the summer of 1992 in person by trained interviewers to a nationally representative probability sample of about 13,000 individuals aged 16 and older and to 1,100 adults incarcerated in federal and state prisons. In addition, 12 states funded sample supplements of 1,000 adults in order to obtain literacy estimates for their state populations. This is the first national study of literacy for all adults since the Adult Performance Level surveys, which were conducted in the early 1970s. The next national study of adult literacy is planned for the year 2002. \nThe design of the ECLS-B is based on the assumption that children's preparation for school begins at (or before) birth and continues until they enter school for the first time. It is guided by a framework of children's development, care, and schooling that emphasizes the interaction among the child, the family, health care, child care and education programs, and the community. The ECLS-B recognizes the importance and interrelatedness of factors that represent the child's health status and socioemotional and intellectual development. A nationally representative sample of approximately 15,000 children born during calendar year 2001 will be selected for participation in the study. The sample will consist of children from different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Asian and Pacific Islander children, Chinese children, American Indian children, moderately low birth weight children (1,500-2,500 grams), very low birth weight children (under 1,500 grams), and twins will be oversampled.\nThe design of the ECLS-K is guided by a framework of children's development and schooling that emphasizes the interaction between the child and family, the child and school, the family and school; and the family, school, and community. Thus, the ECLS-K recognizes the importance of factors that represent the child's health status and socioemotional and intellectual development, and incorporates factors from the child's family, community, and school and classroom environments. The study is particularly focused on the role that parents and families play in helping children adjust to formal school and in supporting their education through the primary and middle elementary grades. It also gathers information for understanding how schools prepare for and respond to the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the children and families they serve. A nationally representative sample of approximately 22,000 children enrolled in about 1,000 kindergarten programs during the 1998-99 school year was selected for participation in the ECLS-K. These children were selected from full-day and part-day programs in public and private schools. The sample consisted of children from different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. NCES oversampled private kindergartens and kindergartners, as well as Asian and Pacific Islander children. The ECLS-K sample will support separate analyses of public and private kindergartens, as well as white, black, Hispanic, and Asian and Pacific Islander children's school experiences and outcomes. To date, NCES has collected data on the sampled children and their environments in the fall and spring of the kindergarten year and in the spring of first grade. It also conducted child assessments and parent interviews in the fall of first grade for 25 percent of the sample. Current plans call for 3rdand 5th-grade data collections in the spring of those years.\nThe survey design provided for a highly stratified national probability sample of over 1,100 secondary schools as the first-stage units of selection. To make the study more useful for policy analyses, certain types of schools were oversampled: public schools with a high percentage of Hispanic students, Catholic schools with a high percentage of minority students, alternative public schools, and private schools with high-achieving students. The initial national sample for HS&B was considerably larger than that drawn in NLS-72. In this survey, 36 seniors and 36 sophomores were selected in each school. Parents of these students were also sampled. In schools with fewer than 36 students in either of these groups, all eligible students were selected. The base year of this survey, which was conducted early in 1980, collected data from over 28,000 sophomores and 30,000 seniors. The longitudinal design of the study called for follow-up surveys of substantial subsets of the two cohorts at 2-year intervals. Data collection for the first follow-up was in spring 1982. Subsequent follow-ups were also undertaken in 1984 and 1986, and another follow-up of the sophomores was conducted in 1992. The first follow-up survey, conducted in 1982, sampled almost 40,000 students (12,000 seniors and 27,000 sophomores); the second, in 1984, sampled approximately 27,000 students (12,000 seniors and 15,000 sophomores); and the third, in 1986, sampled almost 27,000 students (also 12,000 seniors and 15,000 sophomores). The 1992 follow-up collected data from almost 15,000 sophomores. In 1993, a Postsecondary Education Transcript Study was conducted for the sophomore cohort. Data collection instruments in the base-year survey included: sophomore and senior student questionnaires with a series of cognitive tests; school questionnaires filled out by an official in each participating school; teacher comment checklists filled out by a teacher of the sampled student; second-language questionnaires; and parent questionnaires filled out by a sample of parents from both cohorts. The student questionnaires focused on individual and family background, high school experiences, work experiences, and future plans. Cognitive tests administered to students measured both verbal and quantitative abilities. Sophomore tests included brief achievement measures in science, writing, and civics, while seniors were asked to respond to tests measuring abstract and nonverbal abilities. The parent questionnaire elicited information about family attitudes, financial planning, and educational goals. The school questionnaire gathered information about enrollment, staff, educational programs, facilities and services, dropout rates, and special programs for handicapped and disadvantaged students. The teacher comment checklist provided teacher observations on students participating in the survey. The first follow-up of sophomores provided insights into the school dropout problem and the influence of the last 2 years of high school on student attitudes and aspirations. The second follow-up in 1984 included a Postsecondary Education Transcript Study of the senior cohort. The later followups of the sophomore cohort made it possible to trace the consequences of dropping out, and the extent to which dropouts later return and complete high school. In brief, HS&B provides information on the educational, vocational, and personal development of young people as they move from high school into postsecondary education or the workforce and then into adult life. The initial study (NLS-72) laid the groundwork for comparison with HS&B. It recorded the economic and social conditions surrounding high school seniors in that year and, within that context, their hopes and plans. It has since measured the outcomes, while also observing the intervening processes. HS&B allows researchers to monitor changes by retaining the same goals, measuring the economic returns of postsecondary education for minorities, and delineating the need for financial aid. By comparing the results of the two studies, researchers can determine how plans and outcomes differ in response to changing conditions or remain the same despite such changes. Additional concerns of HS&B encompass issues that surfaced since NLS-72 began: How did the availability (or lack thereof) of student financial aid alter student plans for further education? Did middle-income families alter their attitude toward postsecondary education? These questions, as well HS&B can be found on the Internet (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/hsb).

Two-stage probability sampling was used to select schools and students. The first stage involved stratified sampling of some 1,000 public and private schools from a universe of approximately 40,000 schools containing 8th-grade students. The second stage included random samples of approximately 24 to 26 students per school. Some 25,000 8th-graders and their parents, teachers, and school principals were surveyed. When the student sample was selected, one parent and two teachers of each student were also selected as subsamples. Hispanic and Asian students were oversampled to permit analysis of the performance of language-minority students. NELS:88 is designed to provide trend data about critical transitions experienced by young people as they develop, attend school, and embark on their careers. It can complement and strengthen state and local efforts by furnishing new information on how school policies, teacher practices, and family involvement affect student educational outcomes (i.e., academic achievement, persistence in school, and participation in postsecondary education). In the base year, four cognitive tests (reading, science, history-government, and math) were administered in addition to the student questionnaire, a parent questionnaire, a teacher questionnaire, and a school administrator questionnaire. The design for the NELS:88 First Follow-up Survey included student, school administrator, teacher, and dropout questionnaires. Students took cognitive tests in reading, science, historygovernment, and math. The tests were designed to reflect 10th-grade coursework, but also had enough overlapping items with the 8th-and 12th-grade tests to permit measurement of academic growth. Selected teachers of each sampled student provided information about the student's study habits and performance, and about instructional practices in the student's classes. The NELS:88 First Follow-up was conducted between February and May of 1990. During the spring of 1992, NCES surveyed this 8th-grade cohort again as part of the second follow-up. This second follow-up survey included student, school administrator, parent, teacher, and dropout questionnaires. Students and dropouts also took cognitive tests in reading, science, social science, and math. High school transcripts were also collected from second follow-up participants. For those researchers interested in school-effects analyses, NCES also sponsored a School Effects Supplement. In 250 of the NELS:88 schools, additional students and teachers were added during the first and second follow-ups. During the spring of 1994, NCES surveyed this cohort again. The focus of the interviews was employment, education, and family formation experiences. The sampled population was interviewed using CATI in order to determine whether they completed high school, and, if so, by what means (e.g., regular completion, GED, or some other method). The interview also collected information about other activities since the last interview in 1992 (e.g., working, number of jobs, periods worked, description of work and education, postsecondary activities, field of study, and periods of time). This follow-up also asked questions about sexual activities (e.g., age at first sexual activity, frequency, if birth control is used, and method of birth control used). Another follow-up was conducted in 2000, by which time many in this cohort had finished their postsecondary education and completed a transition into the labor force. Others had been in the labor force for about 8 years.

The NPSAS is a large, nationally representative sample of institutions, students, and parents (see NPSAS description in chapter 4 for more information). As such, it provides a highly efficient and cost-effective way of identifying a nationally representative sample of beginning students attending postsecondary institutions. In addition, data from all components of the NPSAS (the Student Record Abstract, Student Interview, and Parent Survey) are available as base-year data for the BPS sample. For the second BPS cohort, annual matches with U.S. Department of Education financial aid records and SAT/ACT scores are also included The first BPS followed NPSAS:90 beginning students starting in 1992. About 8,000 students who began their postsecondary education career in the 1989-90 academic year responded to NPSAS:90 and were included in the first BPS (BPS:90/92) in the spring of 1992 and the second BPS (BPS:90/94) in 1994. NPSAS:90 collected data for over 6,000 parents of those students. The second BPS followed NPSAS:96 students beginning their postsecondary education in the 1995-96 academic year. Over 10,000 students responded to the first follow-up of the second cohort. A second follow-up for BPS:96 will take place in 2001. New BPS cohorts alternate with the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B) in using NPSAS as their base. Public-use data from BPS:90/92/94 and BPS:96/98 cohorts are available through the Internet and on CD-ROM.\nData are collected for nearly 9,000 public libraries identified by state library agencies in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Beginning in 1993, the following outlying areas joined FSCS: Guam, Northern Marianas, Palau, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. At the state level and in the outlying areas, FSCS is administered by State Data Coordinators, appointed by each state or outlying area's chief officer of the state library agency. The State Data Coordinator collects the requested data from local public libraries and submits these data to NCES. Data are available for individual public libraries and are also aggregated to state and national levels. NCES also developed the first comprehensive public library universe file. This automated file is updated annually. It includes identifying information on all known public libraries (including their service outlets). This resource is now available for use in drawing samples for special surveys on such topics as literacy, access for the disabled, library construction, and the like. An annual training conference sponsored by NCES is provided for State Data Coordinators. A steering committee representing State Data Coordinators and other public library constituents is active in the development of new data elements and software for the Public Libraries Survey. Technical assistance to states and outlying areas is provided by phone and in person by the FSCS Steering Committee and NCES staff and contractors."}, {"section_title": "Components", "text": "Public School Elementary/Secondary Universe SurveyInformation on all public elementary and secondary schools in operation during a school year, including school location and type; magnet, Title 1, and charter school indicators; grade span; address and telephone number; enrollment by grade and student characteristics; number of classroom teachers; and number of free lunch-eligible students and migrant students.

The 1990 Census Mapping Project was initiated in 1988. Under this initiative, sponsored by NCES and coordinated by the Council of Chief State School Officers, all states participated in a program to develop school district maps. In the 1990 Decennial Census, the Bureau of the Census developed the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER) System, in which 10,000,000 census block boundaries were digitally encoded (to 6 decimal places). The boundaries of approximately 15,274 local education agencies, special education districts, Indian reservations, and military installations that have education activities within their boundaries were similarly digitized and encoded in the TIGER system, thus making it possible to convert the data from census blocks to education entities and produce tabulations.\nInstitutional CharacteristicsAddress, telephone number, room and board charges, tuition, required fees, control or affiliation, calendar system, levels of awards offered, types of programs, and accreditation. Short form used in odd-numbered years collects minimal data for universe maintenance and student charges; full form used in even-numbered years. In addition, the survey collects price information: tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, and other expenses that a full-time, first-time degree-or certificate-seeking undergraduate student would expect to pay when entering the institution. This \"sticker price\" information is made available to prospective students, parents, counselors, and others on a user-friendly Web SiteCollege Opportunities On-Line (IPEDS COOL) (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cool). CompletionsDegree completions by level (associate's, bachelor's, master's, doctor's, and firstprofessional) and other formal awards by length of program, race/ethnicity and gender of recipient, and 6-digit Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code. Completion data by race/ethnicity at the 2-digit CIP level became an annual collection in 1990; beginning in 1995, race/ethnicity data were collected at the 6-digit CIP level. Fall EnrollmentFull-and part-time enrollment by level (undergraduate, first-professional, and graduate) and by race/ethnicity and gender of student. Beginning in 1990, racial/ethnic data were collected annually. (Prior to 1990, racial/ethnic data were collected in even-numbered years.) Age distributions are collected in odd-numbered years; data on state of residence of first-time freshmen (first-time, first-year students) are collected in even-numbered years. Four-year institutions are also required to complete enrollment data by level, race/ethnicity, and gender for nine selected fields of study in even-numbered years for OCR. In addition, the enrollment survey now collects the instructional activity and unduplicated headcount data, which are needed to compute a standardized, full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment statistic for the entire academic year. FTE is useful for gauging the size of the educational enterprise at the institution. Graduation Rate SurveyData on the number of students entering the institution as full-time, first-time, degree-or certificate-seeking students in a particular year (cohort), by race/ethnicity and gender; number completing their program within 150 percent of normal time to completion; number transferred to other institutions; and number of students receiving athletically related student aid in the cohort and number completing within 150 percent of normal time to completion. Worksheets automatically calculate rates, including average rates over 4 years. This survey was developed to help institutions comply with requirements of the Student Right-to-Know Act. Fall StaffNumber of full-time faculty by racial/ethnic category, gender, contract length, and salary class intervals; number of other persons employed full time by racial/ethnic category, primary occupational activity, and salary class intervals; number of part-time employees by primary occupational activity, racial/ethnic category, and gender; and tenure of full-time faculty by academic rank and new hires by primary occupational activity, both by racial/ethnic category and gender. Beginning with the 1993 survey year, Fall Staff replaced the EE0-6 survey conducted by the EEOC. Salaries, Tenure, and Fringe Benefits of Full-Time Instructional FacultyNumber of fulltime instructional faculty by rank, gender, tenure status, and length of contract; total salary outlay; and fringe benefits and number of full-time instructional faculty covered by these benefits. The survey became annual in 1990. Financial StatisticsRevenues by source (e.g., tuition and fees, government, private gifts); current fund expenditures by function (e.g., instruction, research, plant maintenance and operation); physical plant assets and indebtedness; and endowment investments. Survey forms differ substantially for public and private institutions because of different accounting standards. Student Financial AidNumbers used by the financial aid office to determine eligibility for student financial aid, including tuition and fees (in-district, in-state, and out-of-state); room and board (on-campus, off-campus, and off-campus with family); books and supplies; and other expenses. Also, number of entering students, number receiving financial aid, and average amount of aid received by type.\nStudent Records (from institutional records)Year in school, major field of study, type and control of institution, attendance status, tuition and fees, admission tests scores, financial aid received, price of attendance, student budget information and expected family contribution for aided students, grade point average, age, and date first enrolled. Student Telephone InterviewFinancial aid at other schools attended during year, other sources of financial support, reasons for selecting the school they are attending, current marital status, 66 7 8 age, race/ethnicity, sex, highest degree expected, employment and income, voting in recent elections, and community service. Parent Interview (limited sample of some students/parents for NPSAS:87 through NPSAS:93 only)Parents' marital status, age, highest level of education achieved, income, amount of financial support provided to children, types of financing used to pay children's educational expenses, occupation, and industry. \nElementary and Secondary School Students SurveyThe primary data collected by NAEP are about student performance and educational experience. Major current assessment areas include reading, writing, mathematics, science, civics, U.S. history, geography, foreign languages, and the arts. Data include overall performance, performance on specific content dimensions, demographic and family characteristics, classroom experiences, attitudes toward school, and aspirations for the future. School Characteristics and Policy SurveyIn conjunction with student performance surveys, NCES routinely collects important supplemental data about school characteristics and school 82 policies, which could be used analytically as contextual variables to enhance understanding of student performance issues. Specifically included in school data are enrollment, curriculum testing, and objective-setting practices; school administrative practices; school conditions and facilities; special services; and programs. School-level data also include some information about the characteristics of the school administrator, such as race/ethnicity, sex, undergraduate field of study, years as principal, administrative experience, and teaching experience. Teacher SurveySimilar to school contextual data, NAEP also collects important supplemental data from teachers whose students are respondents of the assessment surveys. Teacher data include classroom instructional practices, race/ethnicity, sex, age, undergraduate field of study, teaching certification, full-time teaching experience, and subject-matter specialization. \nThe emphasis that is being placed on the whole child and the different environments in which learning occurs is critically important for the design of the ECLS-B. While children's parents will be the primary reporters throughout the life of the study, at varying points it will be necessary to gather data from children's hospital birth records, their care and early education providers, their schools and teachers, and the children themselves. Children's Birth CertificatesA variety of useful data is captured in birth certificates. They provide information on the date of birth and children's gender. Information is also available on parents' education, parents' race and ethnicity (including Hispanic origin), and mother's marital status. Birth certificates provide information on the mother's pregnancy history, prenatal care, medical and other risk factors during this pregnancy, and complications during labor and birth. Health characteristics of children, such as congenital anomalies and abnormal conditions of the baby and the baby's APGAR score, are also provided. Parent-Guardian InterviewsParents and guardians are an important source of information about themselves, their child, and the home environment. A parent-guardian interview will be conducted in the child's home at each data collection point using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and a self-administered questionnaire. The parent-guardian interviews will capture information about children's early health and development and their experiences with family members and others. Parents will report on children's development in such areas as children's temperament and developmental milestones (e.g., crawling). The parent interview will also capture detailed information on children's health (e.g., developmental difficulties, illness, ear infections) and access to health care (e.g., health insurance). Parents-guardians will provide key information about themselves as caregivers, the home environment, and the neighborhood in which they live. Several aspects of the economic stability of the home environment will be tracked (e.g., welfare receipt, household food sufficiency, employment situation). The parentguardian interviewed will be the individual who is the primary caregiver and the most knowledgeable about the care and education of the child. In most cases, this will be the child's mother or female guardian. Father QuestionnairesThe ECLS-B will collect information from fathers as well. Resident fathers will complete a self-administered questionnaire when their children are 9 months old, 18 months old, and at future points during the study. Currently, NCES is considering the feasibility of collecting data from nonresident biological fathers. Nonresident fathers will be interviewed using a self-administered questionnaire or a telephone interview. The Father Questionnaire will capture information about children's well being and activities fathers engage in with their children. Fathers will also provide key information about themselves as caregivers.\nBecause numerous factors in schools, homes, and communities influence children's academic and social outcomes, data for the ECLS-K are collected not only from children, but also from their parents-guardians, teachers, and school administrators. Student AssessmentsSampled children participate in various activities that measure the extent to which they exhibit those abilities and skills deemed important to success in school. They are asked to participate in activities designed to measure important cognitive (e.g., general knowledge, literacy, and quantitative skills) and noncognitive (e.g., physical) outcomes. Measures of a child's cognitive skills are obtained through an untimed one-on-one assessment of the child. Measures of physical development include both height and weight measurements. Also, in the fall of kindergarten, a psychomotor assessment is administered to measure children's motor abilities, coordination, and visual motor skills. Parent-Guardian InterviewsParents and guardians are an important source of information about the families of the children selected for the study and about themselves. In telephone interviews (or in personal interviews for households without telephones), they provide key information about children's development and their experiences with family members, schools, and others. The family background, demographics, and home environment content covered in the parent-guardian interviews of the ECLS-K include family structure; immigration status; primary language(s) spoken; parents' involvement with the child's school; child care; child's health and well-being; parental values, beliefs, and expectations; home environment, activities, and cognitive stimulation; parental monitoring; neighborhood; parent education; parent employment; parent income and assets; welfare and other public transfers; discipline, warmth, and emotional supportiveness; parents' psychological well-being and health; and critical family processes. Parent-guardian interviews also include items asking parents-guardians to rate their child's social skills, problem behaviors, and approaches toward learning. Teacher QuestionnairesLike parents, teachers represent a valuable source of information on themselves and the children's learning environment (i.e., the classroom). In self-administered questionnaires, teachers are asked to provide information about their own backgrounds, teaching practices, and experiences, along with information on the classroom setting for the sampled children they teach. The content covered in the teacher questionnaires of the ECLS-K includes class type and composition, class organization, class activities, curricular focus and evaluation methods, parent involvement, views on readiness, professional development, and teacher's professional background. Teacher RatingsTeachers are also asked to evaluate sampled children on a number of critical cognitive and noncognitive dimensions. Teacher cognitive ratings measure teachers' perceptions of students' academic achievement and dispositions for learning in the three domains of languageliteracy, mathematics, and general knowledge. Ratings of children's socioemotional behaviors provide measures of children's prosocial and problem behaviors and their approaches toward learning. Teachers also complete checklists on the sampled children, reporting on such things as the children's language skills, special needs, program placements, attendance, and physical activity levels. Special Education Teacher QuestionnairesSpecial education teachers represent a valuable source of information on themselves and the children's experience with special education services. In a self-administered questionnaire, they are asked to provide information about their background and experience and the instructional approaches used for the sampled children who receive these services. They also provide information on sampled children's disabilities, Individual Education Plans (IEPs), and services. School QuestionnairesIn a self-administered questionnaire, school administrators, principals, and headmasters provide information on the physical and organizational characteristics of their schools, and on the schools' learning environments and programs. Special attention is paid to the instructional philosophy of the school and its expectations for students. The content covered in the school questionnaires of the ECLS-K includes school characteristics, student characteristics, teaching staff characteristics, school policies and programs, principal characteristics, and school governance and climate. Additionally, field staff conduct an independent survey of the schools' physical facilities, atmosphere (e.g., fighting in hallways), and learning environments (e.g., student work displayed). Salary and Benefits QuestionnaireIn order to trace resources directly available to children, school district business offices or headmasters complete a self-administered questionnaire capturing information on salary, merit pay (e.g., education stipends), and benefits (e.g., payroll taxes, medical insurance) for sampled children's teachers and school administrators. It represents one of the first times that specific teacher salary data can be linked to outcomes of specific children. Student Records Abstract FormFor each sampled ECLS-K child, information is gathered from his/her school records. This form, completed by the school from its records, provides data on the child's attendance, the child's home language, whether the child has an IEP on record, and whether the child attended Head Start.\nNPSAS (Base Year 1990 and1996)Major field of study, type and control of institution, financial aid, cost of attendance, age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, reasons for school selection, current marital status, employment and income, community service, background and preparation for college, college experience, future expectations, parents' level of education, income, and occupation. BPS Follow-up Surveys (1992)Year in school, persistence in enrollment, academic progress, degree attainment, change in field of study, institution transfer, education-complete the bachelor's degree and continue their education. B&B:93/97 provided a unique opportunity to gather information concerning delayed entry into graduate education, time to completion of graduate education, and the interaction between work and education beyond the bachelor's degree. B&B:93/2003 will expand this opportunity and begin to provide information concerning graduate study and long-term employment experiences after degree completion. B&B is an expansion of the former RCG Survey. The RCG focused on the immediate postdegree employment and education experiences of people who completed a bachelor's or master's degree, and also estimated the potential supply of newly qualified teachers at the elementary and secondary levels. B&B expands that effort to provide unique information on education and employment experiences at the undergraduate level as well as extensive information on financing the undergraduate education. In addition, B&B:93 provides that information over a longer period of time and addresses issues concerning delayed entry into graduate school, progress and completion of graduate-level education, and undergraduate and graduate debt and its impact on choices related to career and family. In addition, it provides new information on the career paths of new teachers and movement into and outside the education system. B&B covers a number of topics of interest to policymakers, educators, and researchers. For example, B&B allows analysis of the participation and progress of recent bachelor's degree completers in the workforce, the relationship of employment to degree, the income and ability to repay debt, and the willingness to enter public service-related fields. B&B also allows analysis of issues related to access to and choice in graduate education programs. Here, the emphasis is on ability, ease, and timing of entrance into graduate school, and attendance-employment patterns, progress, and completion timing once entered. The unique features of B&B allow it to be used to address issues related to undergraduate education as well as postbaccalaureate experiences. For instance, B&B allows the investigation of issues related to undergraduate course-taking patterns, progress, and time to degree. This can involve such things as course taking in the major area of study, as well as in areas other than the academic major; stopout and transfer behavior; credits and grades earned; financial aid and work experiences as an undergraduate and their relationship to postbaccalaureate education; and financial experiences. This information has been used to investigate the relationship between undergraduate debt burden and early labor force experiences, and between undergraduate academic experiences and entry into teaching. These and other relationships can be investigated both in the short term and over longer periods. Because B&B has a special emphasis on new teachers at the elementary and secondary levels, it can be used to address many issues related to teacher preparation, entry into the profession (e.g., timing and ease of entry), persistence in or defection from teaching, and career movement within the education system. Employment and enrollment patterns can also be examined for special baccalaureate degree populations. These populations include, but are not limited to, students with disabilities, racial and ethnic minorities, students from families with low incomes, and older students. B&B also allows investigation of the experiences of students by major field of study at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Major fields of particular interest include mathematics, science, engineering, teacher preparation, and health studies.  1972 1973 1974 1976 1979 1986 Base Year and Years of Follow-up Studies 1980198219841986 Base Year and Years of Follow-up Studies 1988 National Education There is a great deal of interest in the findings of international student assessment studies and in the development of education indicators that facilitate comparisons among national systems of education. This interest has been spurred by increased concern about global economic competition and the role education plays in the economy. International assessment studies provide answers to questions of how other countries educate their children and with what success. Such comparisons lead to reexamination of our own teaching practices and challenge the conventional wisdom underlying them. The assessments not only compare the performance of American students with those of their peers in other nations, but also provide insights into the factors that influence performance. The work that NCES conducts with other OECD and APEC countries is designed to provide comparable indicator data about the activities and outcomes of educational systems and institutions in member nations. Such data can lead to improvements in accountability and policymaking. These data are increasingly relevant to policy formulation as the political, economic, and cultural ties grow among countries.\nStudent QuestionnaireConsists of three parts and contains cognitive items related to knowledge across the three domains of civic education, questions intended to provide background data on students used to interpret the assessment results, and questions intended to determine students' understandings and perceptions of issues in the three domains. School QuestionnaireDesigned to gather information on the school's general environment, how civic education is integrated into the school curriculum, how it is structured, and how many staff members are involved in civic education. CivEd is designed to focus on students at the 9th-grade level. All participating nations were required to draw a nationally representative sample of students for the study.\nIdentifying Information about Individual Public Libraries and their OutletsIdentifying data are collected for each public library and public service outlet. These data include street address, city, county, zip code, and telephone number. Data about Public LibrariesIncludes service measures, such as reference transactions, public service hours, interlibrary loans, circulation, library visits, children's program attendance, and circulation of children's materials. The survey also includes information about the size of the collection, staffing, operating income and expenditures, type of legal basis, type of interlibrary relationship, type of geographic boundary, type of administrative structure, and the number and type of public library service outlets. Recently added electronic technology data items include operating expenditures for library materials in electronic format, operating expenditures for electronic access, number of library materials in electronic format, access to electronic services, access to the Internet, Internet use code, number of Internet terminals, and number of users of electronic resources in a typical week. A question\"Does this public library meet all the criteria of the FSCS public library definition?\"has also been added. Data about Public Library Service OutletsIncludes number and types of outlets, the location of public library service outlets relative to a metropolitan area, number of books-by-mail outlets, number of bookmobiles by bookmobile outlet, and Web addresses. The Public Library Locator tool was released on the Library Statistics Program Web Site in 2000. This tool enables users to locate data about a library or a public library service outlet in instances where they know some but not all the identifying information about the library. For example, if one knows the city the library is in, but not its name, one will still be able to locate the library and obtain most of the available FSCS data about it, including identifying information, organizational characteristics, services, staffing, size of collection, and income and expenditures. This tool can be accessed (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/libraries/liblocator). In 1998, NCES and the National Institute on Postsecondary Education, Libraries, and Lifelong Learning published How Does Your Library Compare? by Keri Bassman of the U.S. Department of Education. This Statistics in Brief categorized the nearly 9,000 public libraries in the fiscal year 1995 data set into peer groups (based on the population of the legal service area and total operating expenditures) to control for variability in library size. Once libraries were assigned to peer groups based on these two variables, comparisons of service performance were made. Service performance was defined in terms of five input variables (public library service hours per year, total librarians, total ALAMLS librarians, total number of subscriptions, and total number of books and serials) and seven output variables (library visits per capita, children's program attendance, circulation of children's materials, interlibrary loans received per 1,000 population, interlibrary loans provided, total per capita reference transactions, and total per capita circulation). Building on Keri Bassman's work, the Library Statistics Program has also released a Web-based peer comparison tool on the Library Statistics Program Web Site (http://nces.ed.gov/surveysilibraries/publicpeer). Using this tool, a customer can first select a data year and a library of interest. Next, the user can search for a peer group by selecting key characteristics to define the library, such as total operating expenditures, circulation per capita, etc. Finally, the user can view customized reports comparing the library of interest and its peers. These reports include bar charts, pie charts, rankings, data reports, and address/telephone reports. In addition, one can view reports on FSCS data for individual public libraries. This tool also features a tutorial, and a basic and advanced search feature. The American Institutes for Research has completed a project to develop two indices of inflation for public librariesa cost-input index and a cost-of-services index. NCES published a report of the project in 1999. The report presents and compares two approaches to measuring inflation for public libraries. One approach is based on a fixed-market-basket of the prices of library inputs, which yields a public library cost-input index. The other approach is based on an econometric model of library imputed for nonrespondinglibraries were released on the Library Statistics Program Web Site in spring 2000 (FY 1995-96 have already been imputed). A fast response survey on the topic of public library programming for adults, including adults at risk, is underway. The questionnaire covers programming for adult literacy instruction, family literacy, workplace literacy, adults with physical disabilities, limited-English-speaking adults, homeless adults, homebound adults, the elderly, adult prisoners, and parents. The survey also asks about programming for using and finding information on the Internet. An advisory group was convened in spring 1999 to make recommendations concerning the project. The questionnaire was fielded in spring 2000, with results now available.

SASS-licensed users can analyze data across various components of SASS. Using NCES restricted data, they can link teachers and principals to their schools and schools to their school districts. The most recent administration of SASS was in the 1999-2000 school year. Over 100,000 SASS questionnaires were mailed to collect information on teachers, principals and school heads, schools, school districts, and school library media centers. , SASS collected information on a number of new topics crucial to education reform. At the same time, SASS retained or expanded many of the topics covered in previous surveys, maintaining the comparability for trend analysis. SASS' large sample sizes (approximately 6,000 school districts, 10,000 public schools, 3,500 private schools, 60,000 public school teachers, and 12,000 private school teachers) allow extensive disaggregation of data by important characteristics of schools, such as the poverty level of the students, urbanicity, and minority enrollment, and of teachers; such as their demographic characteristics and teaching assignment field. SASS data were first collected in the 1987-88 school year, and again in the 1990-91, 1993-94, and 1999-2000 school years. One year after each collection, a follow-up survey of teachers is conducted to measure teacher attrition and mobility (see the \"Teacher Follow-up Survey\" description in this section). SASS will be administered every 4 years in the future, with the next collection occurring in school year 2003-04. Data from SASS are used by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education, and other federal agencies; State Education Agencies (SEAs); educational associations; business firms that market education services; and the education research community for the following purposes: To profile the teacher workforce, including demographic characteristics, academic background, qualifications to teach in fields of assignment, workload, professional development, career plans, compensation, and perceptions of the teaching profession and their workplace. To profile the principal workforce, including demographic characteristics, academic background, qualifications, and training for administration, and to assess school climate and decisionmaking.

These tabulations contain aggregate data describing attributes of groups of persons and households in school districts. With the exception of two data items (total population and total housing units), data were samplebased estimates. In many cases, the special tabulations were produced using a process of splitting census blocks to develop estimates for a school district. Files were used in combination with NCES data (i.e., CCD) and other Census Bureau data (i.e., School District Financial Survey) (F-33) to produce the School District Data Book. The School District Data Book is an electronic library containing social, economic, and administrative data for each of the 15,274 public school districts in the United States in 1990. The School District Data Book contains the most comprehensive demographic database ever developed for the nation's school system. The School District Data Book is contained on a set of 44 CD-ROMs. This large database of approximately 20 gigabytes of data (after reduction by data-compression techniques) provides up to 10,000 data items for each school district.

Some cling to dependency; others move into self-determination smoothly. The NLS-72 base year study and its five follow-up surveys provide data to allow researchers to study how these transitions evolve. NLS-72 can provide information about quality, equity, and diversity of educational opportunity, and the effect of those factors on cognitive growth, individual development, and educational outcomes. It can also provide information about changes in educational and career outcomes and other transitions over time. The NLS-72 data cover the sampled cohort from 1972 to 1986. Design NLS-72 was designed to produce representative data at the national level on the cohort of students who were in the 12th grade in 1972. The sample for the base year of NLS-72 was a stratified, two-stage probability sample of 12th-grade students from all schools (public and private) in the 50 states and the District of Columbia during the 1971-72 school year. A sample of schools was selected in the first stage. In the second stage, a random sample of 18 high school seniors was selected within each participating school. Data were collected by mail, telephone, and personal interviews. In addition, the survey obtained high school transcript data on high school curriculum, credit hours in major courses, grade point average, standardized test scores, and related information for each senior. To conduct intensive studies of disadvantaged students, NCES oversampled schools in low-income areas and schools with significant minority enrollments. The size of the student sample was increased during the first follow-up survey because base-year nonrespondents were recontacted at that time. Those who provided base-year information during the first follow-up were retained and included in later follow-up efforts. Consequently, in 1972 there were 16,683 respondents, but in the first follow-up in 1973, the number increased to 21,350. The numbers of respondents in subsequent follow-ups in 1974, 1976, 1979, and 1986 were 20,872, 20,092, 18,630, and 12,841, respectively (only a subsample of 14,489 of the original sample was contacted in 1986). for youths attentive to their futures. Anxiety over access to postsecondary and vocational education sharpened the focus on the educational experiences of Hispanic and other minority youths. To examine these and other issues, NCES initiated a second longitudinal study, HS&B, to complement the first. HS&B studied the high school students of 1980. It attempted to collect the same types of data gathered in the NLS-72. However, the second study differed from the first in two significant ways. First, it addressed many newer issues of the educational process. Second, it included a sophomore cohort as well as a senior cohort. Adding the sophomore cohort made it possible to study high school dropouts and analyze changes and processes during high school. The base-year survey of HS&B and the follow-up surveys have addressed the issues of educational attainment, employment, family formation, personal values, and community activities since 1980. For example, a major study on high school dropouts used HS&B data to demonstrate that a large number of dropouts return to school and earn a high school diploma or an equivalency certificate. Other examples of issues and questions that can be addressed with HS&B data are: How, when, and why do students enroll in postsecondary education institutions? Did those who (while in high school) expected to complete the baccalaureate (BA) degree actually do so? How has the percentage of recent graduates from a given cohort who enter the workforce in their field changed over the past years? What are the medium-term effects of not completing high school in the traditional way? How do employment and earnings event histories of traditional high school graduates differ from those who did not finish high school in the traditional manner? Do individuals who attend college earn more than those who do not attend college? What is the effect of student financial aid? What percentage of college graduates are eligible or qualified to enter a public service profession such as teaching? How many enter the workforce full time in the area for which they are qualified? In what ways do public and private schools differ?\nAmerica's High School Sophomores: A Ten Year Comparison, 1980(June 1993  11212 issues related to persistence, progress, and attainment, BPS also directly addresses issues concerning entry into the workforce. Its unique contribution is the inclusion of nontraditional (or older) students. This provides the ability to analyze the differences, if any, between traditional (recent high school graduates) and nontraditional (older) students in aspirations, progress, persistence, and attainment. Among the questions BPS addresses are: Do students who are part time or discontinuous attendees have the same educational goals as full-time, consistent attendees? Are they as likely to attain similar educational goals? Are students who change majors more or less likely to persist? The publication, Descriptive Summary of 1989-90 Beginning Postsecondary Students: 5 Years Later, presented rates of persistence and degree attainment. In addition, Nontraditional Undergraduates presented differences in persistence found for traditional and nontraditional students. The report Descriptive Summary of 1995-96 Beginning Postsecondary Students: Three Years Later, With an Essay on Students Who Started at Less-Than-4-Year Institutions provides information on the second BPS cohort.\nThe international report was released in mid-March 2001. The U.S. national in-depth report was released in late April 2001. In each assessment cycle, PISA focuses on one of the three subject areas, devoting approximately two-thirds of testing time to an in-depth assessment of the major domain and the remaining one-third of testing time to the other two minor domains. The subject areas of PISA are: reading literacyRequires students to perform a range of tasks with different kinds of texts. The tasks range from retrieving specific information to demonstrating a broad understanding, interpreting text, and reflecting on its content and features. Reading literacy is the major domain of focus in 2000. mathematical literacyEntails the use of mathematical competencies at several levels, ranging from performance of standard mathematical operations to mathematical thinking and reflection. Mathematical literacy is the major domain of focus in 2003. scientific literacyInvolves the use of key scientific concepts in order to understand and help make decisions about the natural world. It involves being able to recognize scientific questions, use evidence, draw scientific conclusions, and communicate these conclusions. Scientific literacy is the major domain of focus in 2006. On its regular 3-year cycle, PISA will provide trend data in a major subject area every 9 years. Questions that PISA helps address include the following: How do U.S. 15-year-olds perform in the subject areas covered by PISA in comparison to their international counterparts? What are the strengths and weaknesses of U.S. 15-year-olds in reading literacy, mathematical literacy, and scientific literacy? Are U.S. 15-year-olds more proficient in any of the three subject areas than their international peers? Are there significant differences across race, gender, or socioeconomic background in reading literacy, mathematical literacy, and scientific literacy as measured by PISA? Are U.S. 15-year-olds able to analyze, reason, and communicate their ideas effectively?\nThe Pocket Condition of Education, 1999(November 1999 The Condition of Education 2000 (June 2000) Recent editions of The Condition of Education can be found on the Internet (http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/majorpub.asp).

The forum's primary mission is to work with NCES to improve the overall quality, timeliness, and comparability of education statistics across the nation. It puts into practice the goals of the National Elementary/Secondary Cooperative Statistics System, which was mandated by the Hawkins-Stafford Education Improvement Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100-297) and continued in the 1994 Improving America's Schools Act. Under the direction of its Steering Committee, the forum maintains three standing committees: the National Education Statistics Agenda Committee; the Technology, Dissemination, and Communication Committee; and the Policies, Programs, and Implementation Committee. At present, the forum is addressing such important issues as facilitating uniform development in state education information systems; promoting the adoption of guidelines and common definitions that will foster best-practice procedures in many areas of data collection and reporting; and developing guidelines or handbooks for maintaining data about school finance, education facilities, education and administrative technology, and school crime, violence, and discipline. The group is an active partner with the Department in efforts to reduce redundancy across data collections and thereby lessen the burden of reporting. In addition to these efforts, the forum is available to respond to specific requests from the Commissioner of NCES and to raise issues and make recommendations of its own. By bringing federal and state representatives together to work cooperatively toward improving the quality of education statistics, the forum plays an important role in determining the future of our nation's education statistics system. In 1990, the National Forum issued its first publication, Guide to Improving the National Education Data System. This guide contains 36 recommendations for improving the nation's elementary and secondary education statistics system. Other forum products include the SPEEDE/ExPRESS format (see description on next page) for transmitting student records electronically, guidelines for protecting the privacy of student records (with an accompanying brochure on this topic for parents), and reports on data needs in the areas of early childhood education and equity. The forum produced a format for reporting incidents of school crime, violence, and discipline (under revision), and handbooks for nontechnical policymakers to use in selecting education hardware, software, and networking services and security procedures (Technology @ Your Fingertips and Safeguarding Your Technology). The forum is a means for providing technical assistance to states and encouraging the development of more efficient data systems.

Some topical supplements may be attached to these continuing surveys so that current data on key issues can be produced. The Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) collects additional topical data for policymakers within a short timeframe. Beginning with the 1998-99 school year, the CCD began collecting an expanded set of information intended to greatly enhance the survey's usefulness as a sampling frame and provide baseline statistics on several programs of interest. States were asked to identify charter and magnet schools, schools that participate in Title I programs, and the numbers of migrant and limited-Englishproficient students receiving special services. This additional information, coupled with the CCD's previous content and unique identifiers for every public school and agency, will make it possible to explore ways of merging information from different surveys and to reduce the chances that the same information will be requested on more than one federal survey, reducing response burden. NCES is also currently analyzing CCD data to determine whether it is possible to convert dropout reports that do not follow NCES convention into the standard CCD format. If this can be done, beginning with data for the 1998-99 school year, the CCD will be able to produce both dropout and high school graduation rates for at least 30 states. NCES expects to make changes to the finance surveys in response to the revised GASB standards. The final shape of these standards is not yet known. SASS was redesigned for its administration in 1999-2000. The sample design and data collection methodology remained the same, but a new conceptual framework shifted the focus of SASS from teacher supply and demand to measurement of teacher and school capacity (the objectives of recent school reform agendas). Teacher capacity is defined by measures of teacher quality, teacher career paths (including induction experience), professional development, and classroom instructional practices. School capacity is defined by measures of school organization and decisionmaking, curriculum and instruction, parental involvement, school safety and discipline, and school resources. Although the framework requires new item modules, important items from past surveys were retained for trend data. The Teacher Follow-up Survey will continue to be implemented 1 year after the SASS. The NHES has become a source of many key indicators of the educational status of children. NHES:2001, which will be conducted in the spring of 2001, includes questionnaires on Early Childhood Program Participation and Before and After School Programs and Activities. Topics for NHES:2003 are likely to include School Readiness and Parent and Family Involvement in Education. NCES will continue to support the collection of educational enrollment and attainment on'an annual basis in the October Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS). An additional topical component regarding select education characteristics, grade repetition, language and English proficiency, and disability will be collected on a periodic basis. NCES is also working with other agencies to develop a CPS supplement on computer use. This will likely occur on an annual basis beginning in September 2001. The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) is a new survey sponsored by NCES that will collect information from school principals on crime and safety in U.S. elementary and secondary public schools. SSOCS was first administered in the spring of 2000. However, in many ways it will cover the same topics addressed by the Principal/School Disciplinarian Survey on School Violence conducted by NCES in 1997. Thus, some information on changes over time will be available with the 2000 survey. After that initial survey, NCES plans to conduct SSOCS every 2 years to provide continued updates on crime and safety in U.S. schools. NCES is working on the Decennial Census School District 2000 Project. The project will use data from the 2000 census, 1999-2000 CCD, and the 2000 School District Financial Survey (F-33). The project will provide substantial social, economic, and demographic data on individual public school districts to data users, researchers, and policymakers. The FRSS will continue to identify and report on issues of current interest. Studies being prepared now include Adult Services in Public Libraries, Survey of Arts in Elementary and Secondary Public Schools, Prekindergarten Programs in Public Schools, Survey of Alternative Schools and Programs, and continuing surveys on access to technology and the Internet in elementary and secondary schools nationwide. The FRSS recently completed a second survey on Teacher Training and Professional Development. This survey, completed in the summer of 2000, is intended to provide information for the Secretary of Education's biennial reports on Teacher Quality. These reports monitor progress toward meeting the goal of having dedicated and outstanding teachers in every classroom. The National Cooperative Education Statistics System will continue to serve as the vehicle for improving the elementary and secondary data system across the nation. Under the National Forum on Education Statistics, it will sponsor projects in individual states to adopt common data standards and definitions, and to develop more efficient ways of collecting and reporting data electronically.

Among the most critical are questions regarding access to postsecondary education for various populations, the effects of shifting enrollment patterns, the cost of postsecondary education, student financing of postsecondary education, education outcomes, the long-range financial outlook for colleges and universities, demand for and supply of qualified faculty and staff, and job opportunities for graduates. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) program in postsecondary education provides statistical information used by planners, policymakers, and educators in addressing these issues. One major source of this information is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), an annual series of surveys conducted by NCES that provides a variety of data on the nation's 10,600 public and private postsecondary institutions. Special studies of students, financial aid, postsecondary faculty, bachelor's degree recipients, and doctoral degree recipients complement IPEDS, as do surveys of the participation of the adult population in educational activities through the National Household Education Survey. In addition, postsecondary education transcript studies have been conducted in conjunction with the National Longitudinal Study of 1972, the High School and Beyond Study, the Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (see \"National Longitudinal Studies\" in chapter 6), and the Recent College Graduates Study. Another postsecondary longitudinal survey system, Beginning Postsecondary Students, also collects institutional and student data from postsecondary students over a period of several years (see \"National Longitudinal Studies,\" chapter 6)."}, {"section_title": "Data Collection Principles", "text": "The collection of IPEDS data from this diverse universe of institutions is based upon several principles. First, data elements identify characteristics common to all providers of postsecondary education. Within these data elements, specific values define characteristics of different types of providers of postsecondary education. Second, the data elements and the component surveys in IPEDS, through which they are collected, are interrelated to avoid duplicative reporting and to enhance the analytic potential of the database. For example, enrollment data from one survey can be used in conjunction with data on degrees granted, faculty, or financial resources from the other surveys. To deal with the problems of data comparability involved in interstate and interinstitutional comparisons, IPEDS includes questions that help clarify what is or is not included in a reported count or total. Third, the surveys are compatible, but are adapted to meet the needs and characteristics of different sectors of postsecondary education providers. In general, the survey questionnaires for postsecondary institutions granting baccalaureate and higher degrees are the most extensive. Less data are requested from other institutions. This feature accommodates the varied operating characteristics, program offerings, and reporting capabilities of postsecondary institutions, while yielding comparable statistics for all institutions. Prior to 1993, NCES sampled the private less-than-2-year sectors. However, the Higher Education Act of 1992 mandated the completion of IPEDS surveys in a timely and accurate manner for all institutions that participate, or are applicants for participation, in any federal student financial assistance program authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1094(a)(17)). Thus, beginning in the 1993 survey year, NCES began to survey in detail all postsecondary institutions that met this mandate. Institutions that were not eligible to participate in federal student financial aid programs were asked to complete only the Institutional Characteristics survey. Between 1993 and 2000, NCES continually improved the IPEDS data collection instruments and the list of institutions (universe) surveyed. There was a concerted effort to match files with the Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) to ensure full coverage of all institutions having Program Participation Agreements (PPAs) with ED. Currently, IPEDS identifies and categorizes institutions according to whether or not they have a PPA with ED and their degree-granting status."}, {"section_title": "70", "text": "The IPEDS program was completely redesigned for the 2000-2001 academic year when the data collection converted from a paper-based data collection to a fully Web-based data collection system. The universe of postsecondary institutions was divided into two basic groups: those institutions with PPAs and all others. Institutions that do not have PPAs may complete the IPEDS online surveys, but there is no requirement to do so. In the near future, these institutions will be subject to a telephone survey to collect a minimum set of data items (Minimum Data Set (MDS)). Institutions with a PPA are required to complete IPEDS and are subjeCt to extensive follow-up for nonresponse. This new system tailors the forms and data items for each institution based on a series of screening questions. Thus, public institutions automatically receive a different finance form than private not-for-profit institutions; 4-year schools that have graduate programs are prompted for graduate-level enrollment; and institutions that do not enroll full-time first-time undergraduate level students are not asked to complete information on either the Student Financial Aid or. Graduation Rate Surveys. All survey data are now collected using a Web-based system. Institutions may submit data in two ways: manual data entry or file upload.

NPEC is a voluntary partnership of governmental and nongovernmental providers and users of education data. Its mission is \"to identify and communicate ongoing and emerging issues germane to postsecondary education; and to promote the quality, comparability, and utility of postsecondary data and information that support policy development, implementation, and evaluation.\" NPEC consists of a Council with approximately 135 members representing agencies, organizations, and associations from all sectors of the postsecondary community, including public, not-for-profit, and proprietary institutions; state postsecondary agencies; state and regional organizations; national postsecondary associations; and federal offices with an interest in postsecondary education. Members are nominated to the Council by state agencies and postsecondary associations. Members serve a 3-year term, with one-third of the membership rotating each year. Project activities include an annual meeting of the Council and meetings of working groups and subcommittees of the NPEC Steering Committee. These meetings help the Council reach its goals and manage its membership and communications activities. The Steering Committee generally approves three to five new projects per year. Since its first Council meeting in November 1995, NPEC activities have included a Delphi study to identify the future trends affecting postsecondary education and two invitational policy panels to discuss the data implications of definitions of access and technology-mediated instruction. More recent activities include participating in a collaborative effort with NCES on the IPEDS redesign activity (http://nces.ed.gov/npec/answers), a guide to information about national data sets at the postsecondary level, and the development of several longterm projects focused on NPEC's five strategic areas: student outcomes, access, cost, finance and productivity, and data infrastructure and relationships. NPEC has established a Web Site within the NCES site and has produced several publications, two videos, and an interactive \"Sourcebook\" on assessment information. Other products include the NPEC brochure; a quarterly newsletter, NPEC Notes; and a monthly e-mail note, \"NPEC In Touch,\" which is sent to members and alumni. Higher Education Executive Officers (SHEEO) Network representatives. This network issues a quarterly bulletin containing information about NCES and state activities. It also provides an advisory service summarizing developing postsecondary education issues and related data needs. Additionally, the network maintains a library service providing information about state and federal postsecondary education data collections. There is also a personnel exchange service that provides funds for staff of state higher education agencies to meet each other and share technical assistance information regarding their data collection and dissemination efforts. "}, {"section_title": "IPEDS Workshops", "text": "State Coordinator WorkshopsThese are conducted on an annual basis, usually in the spring. A full-day workshop provides IPEDS State Coordinators and other interested parties with up-todate information on IPEDS, plans for the future, anticipated changes, and other issues of interest. This forum allows for exchange of ideas and practices, and a general sharing of information among the various state coordinators, federal agencies, and education association representatives. Regional workshopsIPEDS staff conduct regional workshops on an as-needed basis. These are generally held when new surveys (such as the Graduation Rate Survey) are implemented or when significant changes are made to the survey forms that warrant training of institutional respondents. Workshops are held in various key cities across the nation to allow respondents to attend one close to their institution's location. Attendees are provided with materials such as new survey forms, Guidelines for Survey Respondents, and frequently asked questions and answers to help them understand the changes and the new requirements. Regional workshops were last held in 1993 (for all IPEDS surveys) and in 1997 (for the Graduation Rate Survey). Cooperative System Fellows ProgramIn 1990, NCES initiated the Cooperative System Fellows Program as part of its ongoing effort to increase cooperation among federal, state, and local education data collectors and to improve the overall quality and timeliness of education statistics. Twice each year, Fellows nominated by local, state, higher education, and library agencies across the country convene in Washington, DC, for 1 week. The purpose is to provide the participants with an overview of the many NCES activities and to foster professional ties between education professionals and members of the federal statistical community. During their stay, Fellows take part in a series of planned activities, including presentations by NCES staff on NCES major data collections, reports, and dissemination practices; projects to automate state and local data systems; and efforts to integrate existing data collections. In addition, Fellows explore their own professional interests and objectives. During the week, 74 mentors selected from NCES staff work with Fellows and lead discussions on various topics, answer questions, and offer guidance and advice. An effort is made to help Fellows achieve their individual program objectives. The Fellows Program is held in May and November of each year, and includes approximately 30 Fellows at each session.

This activity is an important part of NCES efforts to improve the quality and comparability of education data. Handbooks have been an integral part of the NCES postsecondary program since the late 1960s. In 1966, NCES established a common language that higher education institutions could use to record and report on major fields of study. This language, codes from the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS), evolved into the CIP that encompasses not only the academic programs included in the HEGIS program codes, but vocational and occupational program codes as well. The CIP was implemented in 1986 with the beginning of IPEDS and revised in 1990. It forms the basis for the IPEDS Completion report. A revision of the 1990 CIP is currently under way and should be completed in 2001. In 1973, NCES published the Higher Education Facilities Inventory and Classification Manual. This manual, initially developed by a group of facilities experts, evolved through several versions and was issued and used with the approval of professional groups, state agencies, and institutional associations. Last published in 1974, the manual was widely used and adapted. In recognition of the fact that planning for and use of facilities had changed significantly and many states and institutions were beginning to devise their own classification structures, SHEEO assembled a Working Group on College and University Facilities in 1989. The work of these groups resulted in the 1992 Postsecondary Education Facilities Inventory and Classification Manual (FICM). The 1992 FICM provides a common framework and coding structure for use in collecting and reporting inventory data on postsecondary institution buildings and on the space within those structures, primarily rooms. The manual also suggests to institutions a pattern for compiling essential data on their physical facilities, and provides a set of common building definitions and room codes so that reported data are reasonably consistent and comparable across institutions and states. NCES has published the first handbook on faculty and staff in postsecondary institutions. The 1998 Human Resources in Postsecondary Institutions Handbook provides postsecondary institutions with coding structures, data element definitions, analytic conventions, and recommendations for developing and maintaining a central data file on.the institution's faculty and staff that will be useful for resource and policy analysis and planning at the institutional level. This handbook, as with all other NCES handbooks and manuals, was developed in conjunction with a technical panel of experts in the field of faculty and human resource issues and problems. One objective in developing this handbook was to provide institutions with the necessary tools to report high-quality data to the IPEDS Staff and Salary surveys, and to facilitate their participation in the NSOPF. The development of the Postsecondary Student Handbook is a cooperative effort among NCES, SHEEO, and the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. The primary objective of this handbook is to promote commonality and consistency in the data elements and definitions that are used to define, track, measure, and report postsecondary student data. The handbook identifies a comprehensive and uniform set of data elements, definitions, and coding descriptors to use in postsecondary student record-keeping systems. The handbook also provides recommendations for standardizing the methods and practices by which data on students are collected, reported, and exchanged; suggests a framework for developing or upgrading student tracking systems; and identifies and promotes sound practices for institutional reporting to state and federal agencies. This handbook will be published in 2001.

Changes in collection procedures, data elements, timing, and processing will be phased in through 2001 IPEDS will continue to provide a sampling frame for other postsecondary surveys, such as the ongoing NPSAS and NSOPF. PEQIS will be used to collect data for addressing emerging and focused issues that the ongoing data collection systems are unable to provide. PEQIS surveys being planned or implemented include Distance Education, Students with Disabilities in Postsecondary Education, Faculty Workload, and Non-Credit Course Offerings. Some postsecondary institutions use an automated data system for a nationwide electronic records transfer system. The Standardization of Postsecondary Education Electronic Data Exchange developed a set of data elements and definitions in American National Standards Institute format to be used in the pilot electronic transfer of student records among postsecondary institutions. Data elements are included in five different areas: demographics, academic history, special programs and services, health, and test information. NCES is examining other applications for the electronic exchange of data among postsecondary institutions. In response to legislation, NCES has incorporated a graduation-completion rates component into IPEDS to assist with the implementation of the Student-Right-to-Know legislation in 1996. With the planning and design phases completed in the 1996-97 school year, institutional graduationcompletion rate data are being collected through IPEDS beginning in the 1997-98 school year from the universe of all postsecondary institutions in the United States eligible for Title IV financial aid. The NHES has become a source of many key indicators of the educational status of children and adults. The 2001 NHES will include the Adult Education and Lifelong Learning Survey. This survey will largely be a repeat of the Adult Education Surveys done in detail in 1991 and 1995, and in brief in 1999. The 2003 NHES will include a survey with more focus on work-related adult education. The last cycle of the NSOPF occurred in the 1998-99 academic year. NSOPF:99 was limited to surveys of institutions, faculty, and instructional staff. It allowed for comparisons to be made over time and expanded existing topics surrounding faculty and instructional staff that have developed as critical issues since the first two studies. Expansion topics included the increasing use of part-time instructional faculty and staff at higher education institutions and their credentials for teaching; the decline of full-time tenure-track appointments as institutions explore possible alternatives to tenure; faculty's allocation of time to teaching versus research; measures of faculty workload and productivity; the presence of women and minority faculty in higher education institutions; and the effects, if any, of the removal of mandatory retirement for faculty and instructional staff. NSOPF:99 was also collected on the Internet for the first time. Meeting the challenges of maintaining current data and possibly establishing new data collection activities will take a cooperative effort among institutions, states, and NCES. In order to support this effort, the NCES reauthorization of 1994 included the extension of the National Cooperative Education Statistics System to postsecondary education. NPEC will continue to strive to identify new trends in postsecondary education and emerging issues that have implications for data collection, reporting, and dissemination in order to facilitate the production of better data for better decisions."}, {"section_title": "Table 3.Data Collection Calendar for Postsecondary and Adult Education", "text": "Year of Data Collection (school year beginning) Surveys 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System Salaries, Tenure, and Fringe Benefits of  1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 National Study of "}, {"section_title": "EDUCATIONAL ASSESSMENT", "text": "The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) collects and reports information on the academic performance of the nation's students and assesses the literacy level of the adult population. NCES also participates in international assessments (see chapter 7, \"International Statistics\"). The congressionally mandated National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is NCES' primary assessment of what American elementary and secondary students know and can do in academic subjects. For more than 2 decades, NAEP has collected and reported information on the knowledge and skills of national and, since 1990, state samples of both age-and grade-representative populations in a variety of school subjects. NCES also collects data from students' high school transcripts. These data include courses students have taken as well as the grades they attained. These studies generally build on NAEP and other major survey studies to increase their analytical usefulness. Additionally, data are collected from postsecondary student transcripts as part of longitudinal or cross-sectional studies, such as the Recent College Graduates Study. Besides assessing student achievement, the educational assessment program at NCES also assesses the proficiency of adults in performing basic literacy and mathematical tasks through the National Assessment of Adult Literacy Survey. In 1992, NCES conducted a household-based literacy survey of adults aged 16 and over. This survey included the general adult population as well as adults in institutional settings such as prisons. High school transcript data have been used for a variety of assessment purposes. Most notably, such data have been used to monitor trends or patterns in curricular changes. The 1998 High School Transcript Study compared the course-taking patterns of students in 1998 with similar patterns in 1994, 1990, 1987, and 1982. Extensive analyses of high school vocational education enrollments and course-taking patterns of high school students with disabilities have been conducted thr6ugh the National Assessment of Vocational Education and in NCES reports. Together with performance results in subject areas, the basic descriptive information about students, teachers, administrators, and communities collected systematically by NAEP from its surveys has been used to address the following four educational policy issues that are of concern to educators, policymakers, and researchers: Instructional practices: What instructional methods are being used and how do these relate to achievement? Students at risk: How many students appear to be at risk, in terms of achievement, and what are their characteristics? Distribution of teacher qualities among different student populations: What are the characteristics of teachers of various subjects that students are exposed to?

The changes in coursetaking patterns across the next decade are reflected in the results of the various transcript studies. Since 1980, six high school transcript studies have been conducted. The first was part of the High School and Beyond's (HS&B) first follow-up survey in 1982 (see chapter 6 for more information on HS&B). Transcripts were collected for the HS&B sophomore cohort of students who were seniors in 1982. Another transcript study was conducted in conjunction with the 1992 second follow-up survey from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS:88) (see chapter 6 for more information). The remaining transcript studies were conducted in conjunction with NAEP. The NAEP 1987 High School Transcript Study collected transcripts for approximately 22,700 high school seniors who 85 had participated (as llth-graders) in the 1986 NAEP. An evaluation report by the U.S. Department of Education on school reform efforts, American Education: Making It Work, compared the NCEE recommended curriculum with the course-taking patterns of 12th-grade students in 1982 and 1987. In 1990, another NAEP High School Transcript Study was conducted to track further changes in the curricular patterns of high school students. Approximately 25,000 transcripts were collected from a sample of students that participated in the NAEP assessments that year. Subsequent NAEP High School Transcript Studies were conducted in 1994, 1998, and 2000 with similar numbers of student transcripts collected. High school transcript data inform researchers and policymakers about the course-taking patterns of students. Since the NCEE report, A Nation at Risk, there have been a number of critics advocating the strengthening of the high school core curriculum. Students have been encouragedthrough a reformed curriculumto increase the number of academic courses they take in English, mathematics, science, social studies, computer science, and foreign languages. As NCES conducts more transcript studies, overall trends in course-taking patterns can be traced. Transcript data are measures of exposure rather than measures of learning since they do not include information on course content. More research is needed to determine what effect course content has on student achievement. The data collected by the transcript studies described in this section allow investigation of the relationship between course-taking patterns and academic performance. To ensure maximum compatibility, the procedures and formats used in previous studies for editing, coding, error resolution, and documentation were used for each subsequent transcript study. This consistency enables users to compare cohorts of students with a minimum of effort."}, {"section_title": "98", "text": "Americans from exercising the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. The National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) survey provides an accurate benchmark for measuring the literacy capabilities of adults. The NAAL survey builds upon the previous 1992 National Adult Literacy Survey (NALS). There has been serious concern about the literacy level of the American workforce, as described in a number of national reports published since 1980, including A Nation At Risk, Toward a More Perfect Union, The Subtle Danger, Workforce 2000, The Bottom Line, and Literacy: Profiles of America's Young Adults. These reports have emphasized the need to increase our nation's standard of literacy in order to maintain our standard of living and to compete in the global market. This concern about literacy culminated in 1990, when the President andgovernors adopted six national education goals, including the following goal: \"By the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.\" The role of the NAAL survey is to provide the information needed to begin understanding our nation's literacy capabilities.\nSecond, a major goal of the ECLS-K is to describe student learning and academic progress during the early school years. It begins by focusing on children's characteristics and experiences as they enter school, and seeks to describe ways in which these are related to different aspects of children, their families, and the kindergarten programs they attend. Then by closely chronicling the relationship between children's kindergarten experience and their school performance in grades 1 through 5, the study provides useful information on achievement differences between boys and girls, among minority groups, and among members of different socioeconomic groups as children pass through school. The study also provides useful data on when children begin to experience problems with their schoolwork and the circumstances surrounding these difficulties. It provides data on the longevity of these problems and on the responses of the children's families, schools, and teachers. Third, numerous factors influence children's school and other life outcomes, including the school, family, and community. The ECLS-K examines how the educational system prepares for and responds to children. It gathers information on how schools and teachers respond to the diverse backgrounds and experiences that children bring with them as they enter school for the first time. The ECLS-K also looks outward to the family and community in which children live by focusing on the resources of the family, the home environment, and the community that have a profound impact on children's success in school and provide the context within which schools must operate. The ECLS-K provides critical information on the roles that parents and families play in preparing for and supporting their children's education, and how families, schools, and communities interact to support children's education."}, {"section_title": "Plans for Educational Assessment", "text": "For the 21st century, NAEP is undergoing a full-scale redesign. In the 1980s and 1990s, NAEP was administered every 2 years. Beginning in 2000, NAEP returns to annual assessments, which means that considerably more subjects will be tested. In 2000, NAEP mathematics and science assessments will be assessed in both grades 4 and 8 in the state assessment. Previously, state assessments never included both grades in two subjects. An innovative \"market-basket\" assessment will be developed in the 2000 assessment that might produce better reporting and also possibly permit linking to other tests. In addition, a number of typical \"standard assessments\" in a variety of subjects will be complemented by in-depth \"comprehensive assessments\" in mathematics, reading, the arts, science, U.S. history, and geography.

In this way, intervening processes can be studied. The program is comprised of three study areas: early childhood/elementary, secondary, and postsecondary education. Together these studies capture critical information across the lifespan of individuals' development and education. The early childhood longitudinal studies examine children's early home, child care, and education experiences prior to formal schoolingthat is, birth through age fiveas well as during the early elementary years. These studies describe the influence of early experiences on children's success in school. The secondary and postsecondary longitudinal studies look at transitions and education experiences and their influence on educational and occupational attainment. These surveys provide for periodic examination of such attainment, as well as students' aspirations, attitudes, and motivations during the pivotal years before, during, and after middle school or junior high school, high school, and college. With extensive questioning over succeeding years, the longitudinal studies make it possible to make long-range comparisons between early learning environments and children's preparation for school, between early school experiences and later school success, and between what individuals expect and what actually occurs. Consequently, such studies are critical to understanding the processes by which early experiences influence education and, in turn, the processes by which education leads individuals to develop their abilities and roles in society. The National Longitudinal Study of 1972 (NLS-72) began with that year's high school senior class and followed them through 1986. The High School and Beyond (HS&B) study began with both the sophomore and senior classes of 1980.

Additionally, HS&B data have been used to study the achievement of Hispanic students; discipline and order in high schools; economic issues, such as students working while in school; comparisons of public and private schools; the continuity of early employment of high school sophomores; and course-taking patterns of American high school students. Because similar items were used in HS&B, NELS:88, and NLS-72, it is possible to compare the high school seniors of 1980, 1982, and 1992, with those of 1972. The National Assessment of Vocational Education (NAVE) used the data from the HS&B study in several of their reports. For example, NAVE used HS&B data for studies that attempted to measure high school curricular experiences as they relate to vocational education and course enrollment patterns, and student financial aid as it relates to postsecondary vocational education. NELS:88 completed the fourth follow-up data collection in 2000. Data from this survey are being used to study transition patterns of 8th-grade students as they move through school (e.g., moving from public to private schools, dropping out of school, and moving into and out of high school and college).

The ECLS-B will follow a national sample of children, born in the year 2001, from birth through first grade. The three key areas to be addressed by the ECLS-B are children's growth and development in critical cognitive and noncognitive domains; children's transitions to child care and early childhood education programs, kindergarten, and beyond; and children's preparation for school. First, the ECLS-B will follow children's growth and development during the critical years before school. In these early years, children are quickly achieving developmental milestones that build upon one another. The ECLS-B seeks to accurately describe children's physical, social, emotional, cognitive, and language development in relation to important influences in their lives prior to school entry. It will then follow their progress during the first 2 years of schoolkindergarten and first grade. Second, children and adults are continually making transitions from one status to anotherfrom home to child care and to school. Most notably, is the transition that occurs as young children go from being cared for exclusively by their parents to being cared for by other persons. For some children, this transition may occur shortly after birth; for others, their first significant experience with adults other than their parents in a regular care and educational setting may be when they enter school for the first time. The ECLS-B is especially focused on looking at these transitions and their impact on different groups of children and families defined by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, birth weight, language minority status, plurality (i.e., twins), and family structure (i.e., single-parent families and teenage mothers). Third, the first of the National Education Goalsthat all children will start school ready to learnhas sparked renewed policy interest in children's school readiness. For most children, the first formal school experience is kindergarten. However, the nature of children's early experiences in and before kindergarten is quite variable, and the demands placed on children differ across programs. The ECLS-B will examine children's preparation for school by prospectively studying the different characteristics of children, their families, and their out-of-home care and educational experiences leading up to and at school entry."}, {"section_title": "96", "text": "Children will be selected at birth from birth certificates, the best and most affordable way of sampling newborns. The first data collection will occur when the children are approximately 9 months of age. Capturing data this soon after birth is important, because much of the data collected at this time will pertain to prenatal care and the health care of the mother and child during the first months of life. Data will be collected again when the children reach 18 months, 30 months, and 48 months of age. Data will also be collected when the children enter kindergarten and first grade."}, {"section_title": "97", "text": "Direct Child AssessmentsChildren' s participation in the study occurs with the full permission of their parents-guardians. Beginning at 9 months, children will participate in activities designed to directly measure important developmental skills in the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical domains. The ECLS-B will be using a modified version of the Bayley Scales for Infant Development (BSID-II) and the Bayley Behavior Rating Scale (BRS). These measures will assess children's gross and fine motor skills as well as their receptive and expressive language skills and emotion regulation. The Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS) from the Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training (NCAST) assesses the parent-child interaction for early precursors of cognitive and social skills. These interactions will be videotaped and coded along several dimensions (e.g., mother responsiveness, cognitive growth fostering), providing rich information on early parent-child interactions. At the 9-month home visit, height, weight, and middle upper arm circumference will be measured for all children. In addition, head circumference will be measured for very low birth weight infants. The same measures will be used at 18 months, with the addition of a measure of attachment. Early Care and Education ProvidersWith the permission of the child's parents, individuals and organizations who provide regular care and/or education for a child will be interviewed. Care providers and preschool teachers, like parents, represent a significant source of information on themselves (their backgrounds, teaching practices, and experiences), the children in their care, and children's learning environments. Much of the data needed to describe the structure of children's care arrangements and education programs, develop indicators of the quality of these arrangements and programs, and profile the background and experience of the persons caring for these children can only be reported accurately by the providers, teachers, and organizations themselves. Contacting children's care and education providers also opens up other data collection opportunities (e.g., collecting information about children's development from sources other than their parents). Children's child care providers will be interviewed using computerassisted telephone interviewing (CATI). This information will be collected when the children are 18 months of age and again at 48 months. Observations of children's child care settings will be conducted in a sample of the arrangements attended by ECLS-B children. Teacher QuestionnairesAs the ECLS-B cohort enters kindergarten and first grade, their school teachers will become valuable sources of information on one of children's most immediate learning environments, the classroom. Teachers also represent important sources of information about themselves (e.g., their backgrounds, teaching practices, and experiences) and children's development, both cognitive and social. The ECLS-B instruments will be a subset of the ECLS-K teacher questionnaires (see the ECLS-K Web Site). School QuestionnairesOnce the children enter formal schooling, school administrators will provide information on the physical, fiscal, and organizational characteristics of their schools and on the schools' learning environments, educational philosophies, and programs. The ECLS-B instruments will be a subset of the ECLS-K school questionnaires (see the ECLS-K Web Site)."}, {"section_title": "Verification of Head Start Program ParticipationHead Start participation data have proven to", "text": "be somewhat unreliable, as reported by either parents or schools. The ECLS-K contacted each Head Start site that a sampled child was reported to have attended. This report of participation came from either the parent-guardian interview or the student record.

The two studies that preceded NELS:88, NLS-72 and HS&B, surveyed high school seniors (and sophomores in HS&B) through high school, postsecondary education, and work and family formation experiences. Taken together, the longitudinal studies provide not only measures of educational attainment, but also rich resources in determining the reasons for and consequences of academic'success and failure. NELS:88 sought to expand on this base of knowledge by following young adolescents from an earlier age (eighth grade) and updating information throughout the 1990s. The longitudinal design of this study permits the examination of change in young people's lives and the role of schools in promoting growth and positive life outcomes. For example, NELS:88 data can be used to investigate the following: The transition from elementary to secondary schoolThe survey permits the investigation of ways students are assigned to curricular programs and courses, and how such assignments affect their academic performance as well as future career and postsecondary education choices. The students' academic growth over timeFamily, community, school, and classroom factors that promote such growth can be studied. The goal is to identify school and classroom characteristics and practices that promote student learning. The effects of changing composition of the family, which is evidenced by increasing numbers of working mothers and families headed by single parents, can also be studied. The features of effective schoolsBy surveying students, teachers, and school administrators, NELS:88 enables an assessment of student educational outcomes. It is possible to identify school attributes that are associated with student academic achievement and other selected student behavior. For those researchers interested in school-effects analyses, NCES also sponsored a School Effects Supplement. In 250 of the NELS:88 schools, additional students and teachers were added in the first follow-up. The process of dropping out of school, as it occurs from eighth grade onNELS:88 provides the unprecedented opportunity to study young dropouts on a national scale, examine the contextual factors associated with dropping out (especially those related to the school), and profile the movement of students in and out of school, including alternative high school programs. The role of the school in helping the disadvantagedGiven the factors of increasing teenage piegnancy rates, increasing poverty among children, and the growing proportion of language minority students, there is a need for research on the school experiences of the disadvantaged and the approaches that hold the greatest potential for assisting them. By design, the NELS:88 sample contains an ample number of disadvantaged students to study this issue. The school experiences and academic performance of language minority studentsNELS: 88 oversampled Hispanics, Asians, and Pacific Islanders to allow meaningful analyses of these subpopulations. Specifically, the data provide information on variation in achievement levels and bilingual education needs and experiences. Attracting students to the study of mathematics and scienceThe data show the math and science preparation students receive nationwide and the degree to which their interest in these subjects is captured. Information is also available on whether they were encouraged by their teachers and school to study advanced mathematics and science. The transition from high school to college (postsecondary access and choice)NELS:88 included the planning and postsecondary education application behaviors of the high school class of 1992, as well as their subsequent enrollments in postsecondary institutions."}, {"section_title": "SECOND FOLLOW-UP (1992)", "text": "Student QuestionnaireSchool experiences and activities, age, social development, opinions about self, attitudes, occupational expectations and aspirations, money and work, language use, early graduate supplement, and school structure.

It is a successor to the earlier Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), conducted in 1995, and is part of a series of regular international assessments planned on a 4-year cycle. However, unlike TIMSS, the 1999 TIMSSR study focused on 8th-grade students only. TIMSSR allows the United States to compare the achievement of its 8th-graders in the original TIMSS to the scores of its 8th-graders 4 years later in TIMSSR. It also provides an opportunity for the United States to compare the relative performance of its 4th-graders in 1995 to the relative performance of its 8th-graders 4 years later in 1999. In addition, TIMSSR allows for comparisons among nations on education-related contextual factors collected from schools, teachers, and students. Moreover, the United States sponsored three additional components of TIMSSR that will enrich our knowledge of education in an international context. TIMSSR Benchmarking ProjectTwenty-seven states, districts, or consortia of districts throughout the United States participated as their own \"nations\" in this project, following the same guidelines as the participating nations. Participants are able to assess their comparative international standing and evaluate their mathematics and science programs in an international context. TIMSSR Videotape Classroom StudyBuilding on the work of the first TIMSS videotape study of mathematics, the TIMSSR Videotape Classroom Study examines national samples of 8th-grade mathematics and science instructional practices in seven nations. The study is designed to reveal national-level portraits of mathematics and science teaching practices that can provide a more detailed context for understanding mathematics and science teaching and learning in the classroom.

In the United States, these are defined as 9thand 10th-graders. A nationally representative sample of students at the grade levels where the model age is 15 is asked to complete the PISA assessment and background questionnaires. To assess the performance of students and to provide education-related contextual information to understand their performance, PISA includes the following three components: Assessment ItemsIn PISA 2000, students are required to read a number of written passages (sometimes combined with diagrams) and answer questions related to them. Question types range from multiple-choice to extended-response. The objective of the assessment items is to determine whether students can reflect and think about the domain being assessed, rather than simply repeat knowledge they have learned. The focus of the assessment items will change with each cycle of PISA. PIRLS helps measure progress toward the national goal of promoting reading literacy for all students and allows for comparisons among nations on important educational policy issues. PIRLS addresses the following questions about reading literacy: How well do U.S. 4th-grade students read literary texts compared to students in other countries? How well do U.S. 4th-grade students read informational texts compared to students in other countries? What are students' reading habits and attitudes, and how do they relate to reading achievement? What home and school factors relate to students' reading literacy achievement? Design/Components PIRLS is designed to focus on 9-year-old students. In the United States, these are defined as 3rdand 4th-graders. A nationally representative sample of studentsin intact classes at the grade levels where the model age is 9is asked to demonstrate how well they read and how well they understand what they read. To assess the reading performance of students and to provide education-related contextual information to understand their performance, PIRLS includes the following two components: Reading AssessmentDeveloped for 9-year-olds, this assessment represents a range of text types that students would have likely encountered by this age. The assessment items that accompany the texts require students to demonstrate a range of skills related to reading literacy. Student, Teacher, and School QuestionnairesThese questionnaires were developed to collect information on the home and schoolreading experiences of students, teacher expectations and beliefs, reading instruction practices, school reading programs, and students' reading habits and experiences both in and out of school. The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Data on Vocational Education (DOVE) system derives data about vocational education primarily from existing NCES surveys. Some of the most informative data in the DOVE system are high school student transcript data. In comparison to reports from states that categorize students as vocational using different definitions, high school transcripts indicate how many vocational education credits students earn. These data allow researchers to identify students who take different amounts and types of vocational education courses, and to examine the relationship between academic and vocational course taking. This method of obtaining data provides a more accurate and complete picture of participation in vocational education than can be obtained by any other means. The DOVE system also uses data from NCES longitudinal studies to examine the economic outcomes associated with participation in vocational education. DOVE is supplemented with data from other federal sources, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth) and the Census Bureau (Survey of Income and Program Participation and Current Population Survey)."}, {"section_title": "LIBRARIES", "text": "Libraries represent an educational resource that is available to individuals regardless of age, social status, or educational background. In an effort to provide more complete information on this aspect of the education spectrum, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) initiated a formal Library Statistics Program in 1989. The first library survey was begun, however, in 1966 with the fielding of the Academic Libraries Survey as part of the Higher Education General Infonnation Survey. This survey was fielded because an academic library was considered an essential component of a higher education institution, and the resource that an institution's library represented helped in some ways to define the quality of that institution. The first survey under the auspices of the Library Statistics Program (1989) focused on public libraries. The initiation of the survey responded to a congressional mandate for NCES to establish a cooperative system for public library data. In fact, the Public Libraries Survey is the product of a cooperative effort among state library agencies, NCES, and the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. In addition to the Academic Libraries Survey and the Public Libraries Survey, the Library Statistics Program has developed and implemented two additional library surveys: the School Library Media Centers Survey and State Library Agencies Survey."}, {"section_title": "Public Libraries Survey", "text": "Nationwide public library statistics are collected and disseminated annually through the Federal-State Cooperative System (FSCS) for public library data.

In 2001, NCES is continuing to enhance its Web Site. Additional publications are being made available in PDF format for ease in downloading. In addition, a library locator has been developed for the Academic Libraries Survey. NCES is also developing Web-based peer analysis tools for the Academic Libraries Survey and the State Library Agencies Survey. Customer feedback mechanisms will be essential to improving the quality of these products over time and will be built into the tools. In the future, NCES also hopes to work with constituent groups from all the surveys in planning an expanded library statistics cooperative. The goal is to facilitate work on crosscutting issues, without interfering with the ability of existing constituent groups to continue their work on individual surveys. Ideas include expanding participation to add local practitioners, experts from allied professions such as publishing and technology, more data users, and possibly the media. One advantage of an expanded cooperative will be the opportunity to address crosscutting policy issues, identify and address data gaps, and encourage participation by diverse groups and all levels of government."}, {"section_title": "GENERAL PUBLICATIONS OF NCES", "text": "The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) annually produces three major publications designed for general audiences: The Condition of Education, Digest of Education Statistics, and Projections of Education Statistics.

They are used in diverse ways by policymakers, researchers, and the general public. NCES produces other publications that draw upon a variety of data sources, such as Trends in Educational Equity of Girls and Women."}, {"section_title": "The Condition of Education", "text": "NCES gathers and publishes information on the status and progress of education in the United States. The congressional authorization for these activities (with antecedents to 1867) states that the purpose of NCES is to collect collate, and report \"...statistics and information showing the condition and progress of education in the United States and other nations in order to promote and accelerate the improvement of American education\" Section 402 (b) of the National Education Statistics Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 9001). In 1975, The Condition of Education was created in response to a similar earlier mandate. The publication presents in a single volume an overview of the condition of education in the United States. The format of The Condition of Education is designed to present statistical information in an accessible manner for a general audience. By analyzing statistical studies and data, this publication investigates the context, resources, and performance of education in this country. In the late 1980s, The Condition of Education became an indicators publication that synthesizes data on a select number of education topics of current interest and concern. Although not all possible indicators are published in a given edition, 60 indicators are presented in each year's report. They are divided into five sections: learner outcomes; quality of education environments (elementary/secondary); quality of education environments (postsecondary); social support for learning; and educational participation and progress. Supplemental tables and notes are also included. The indicators include a basic core that can be repeated with updated information every year, supplemented by a more limited set of indicators based on periodic or onetime studies. The indicators represent a consensus of professional judgment on the most significant national measures of the condition and progress of education at the time, but tempered by the availability of current and valid information. The concept of education indicators has gained the attention of the U.S. Congress, national organizations, states, and localities. To assist NCES in conceptualizing and developing a set of education indicators useful to policymakers and researchers, Congress mandated that NCES convene a special study panel of experts to \"make recommendations concerning the determination of education indicators for study.\" The report of this panel, titled Education Counts: An Indicator System to Monitor the Nation's Educational Health, was submitted to Congress in September 1991. In line with the recommendations of that panel, NCES has published overviews of the available data for indicator reporting in two publications: Education and the Economy: An Indicators Report (April 1997) and Monitoring School Quality: An Indicators Report (December 2000). The utility of The Condition of Education should continue to increase as more high-quality data become available, especially as new time series can be constructed. Elementary and secondary education data will be enhanced by revisions in the basic data collected about public schools in the Common Core of Data and about private schools from the Private School Survey. The Schools and Staffing Survey and the National Household Education Survey contribute substantially to elementary and secondary education indicators. Assessment data have been enhanced by the National Assessment of Adult Literacy, the Third International Math and Science Study, and expansion of the National Assessment of Educational Progress Trial State Assessment Program to include science and reading in addition to mathematics, and grade four in addition to grade eight (see chapter 5). An electronic version of The Condition of Education is available on the NCES Web Site (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/AnnualReports/reports.asp?type=condition).

The principal publication dealing with projections, Projections of Education Statistics, provides national statistics about elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education. Included are data on enrollments, graduates, degrees, classroom teachers, and expenditures for the past 15 years, and projections for the next 12 years. The report also features state-level projections of public school enrollment and high school graduates. In addition, the report also contains a methodology section that describes models and assumptions used to develop these projections. Most of the projections are based on three alternative sets of assumptions. Although the middle alternative is the preferred set of projections, the other (high and low) alternatives provide a range of possible outcomes. A summary of these projections is available in a pocket-sized folder called Pocket Projections. This brochure is a quick reference for projections of key education statistics. The information provided in the report is used by researchers and policy planners in education and related areas. Projections are targeted for individuals in business, industry, government, the media, and education whose work requires information on future developments and trends affecting American education. Objective, high-quality statistics are crucial for informed decisionmaking about education whether at the national, state, local, institutional, or family level. NCES developed the Education Statistics Quarterly as part of an overall effort to make reliable data on education more accessible to a variety of audiences. The first issue was published in April 1999. Each issue provides a comprehensive overview of all NCES publications and data products released each quarter.
