However, only recently STEM fields were widely recognized as a crucial driver for modern economies and supported by political leaders, e.g., George W. Bush and Barack Obama (Carnevale, Rose, & Cheah, 2011). The Obama administration committed to produce an additional one million STEM undergraduate students by 2020 (O'Brien, 2014). North Carolina Governor Patrick McCrory and Florida Governor Rick Scott even questioned the value of liberal arts and social science degrees and called for more colleges to offer majors in transportation, agriculture, technology, sciences and finance in their respective states (Anderson, 2011;Arcieri, 2014). Such heightened interests in STEM aroused from numerous studies that argue that technological innovation is a modern driver of economic progress, which requires an abundance of specialized talent and expertise. Over the several past decades, the decline of manufacturing has been accompanied by the rise of modern technology -biomedical engineering, space exploration, information technology and clean energy sectors. At the same time, while manufacturing relies heavily on the low-and middle-skilled labor, technology firms are largely dependent on college and advanced degree holders (Berman, Bound, & Griliches, 1994;Smith, Collins, & Clark, 2005). Langdon, McKittrick, Beede, Khan, & Doms (2011) predict that most of the fastest growing occupation sectors, which require knowledge and skills in STEM, are expected to grow 1.7 times faster than non-STEM employment in the coming decade. Among these fastest growing sectors are computer, mathematical science, and life sciences; and the largest industries that employ STEM workers are professional and business, manufacturing, information, government, and public education services. It is estimated that 65 percent of new jobs will require either Bachelor or Graduate degrees (Carnevale et al., 2011). Indeed, employers, such as Lockheed Martin, IBM Corporation, Facebook, Boing, and many others, emphasize on the increasing need for new STEM talent and fund various programs that target popularization and advancement of science and technology disciplines (Golod, 2014). In addition to fulfilling the demand for highly skilled labor, STEM education was also viewed as essential for innovation and scientific advancement. For instance, individuals trained in STEM are most likely to hold a patent (Wai, Lubinski, Benbow, & Steiger, 2010) and produce ideas materialized in innovative entrepreneurial ventures (Moretti, 2012). Innovation is widely recognized as the engine of modern economies, increasing economic competitiveness through growth in productivity and high value-added products and services. Further, the growth generated by innovation creates more jobs and increase wage rates (Cantwell, 2006;Rothwell, 2013). For these reasons, many countries have undertaken major steps in support of STEM education and skill development. For example, in addition to the advanced economies mentioned earlier, both Western and East Asian governments have invested substantially to increase STEM enrollments in higher education and engagement in innovation industrial sectors, in order to improve the technological competence of their economies (Cantwell, 2006). Remarkably, economic competitive advantage is strongly tied to local and regional clusters of innovation industry and human capital (Moretti, 2012). Economic geographers have long demonstrated that high technology industries are disproportionately concentrated in certain areas due to advantages that companies gain from agglomeration effects, such as knowledge spillovers, venture capital and specialized workforce availability (Acs, Braunerhjelm, Audretsch, & Carlsson, 2008;Audretsch, 1998). The software cluster in Silicon Valley and the biomedical cluster in Boston are well-cited examples of innovative technology agglomerations (Bathelt, 2010). The fight for innovation sectors also happen on sub-national levels, as state governments try to attract industries that facilitate sustained economic growth. In addition to programs in fostering local innovation businesses and subsidizing relocation of existing technology companies (Oh & Masser, 1995), they have also provided STEM research and educational incentives, in forms of grants and scholarships, to universities, research centers, and students to develop innovative infrastructure and human resources locally (Moretti, 2012). Despite accumulated research on labor market outcomes of college graduates with a focus on individual and institutional characteristics (Abel, Deitz, & Su, 2014;Richards, 1984;Rumberger & Thomas, 1993;Vedder, Denhart, & Robe, 2013), limited research focused on the labor market experiences of STEM graduates. Even less has examined how STEM graduates' labor market outcomes vary across place. Due to the increasing interests in STEM industry and education and their potential contributions to national and regional economies, as discussed earlier, it is urgent to understand the spatial dimension of STEM education and its labor market outcomes. Therefore, the objective of this dissertation project is to explore the relationship between place and the career experiences of STEM-educated college graduates in the U.S. over the past decade, 2000-2010. Specifically, it seeks to understand how STEM-educated college graduates' early career outcomes are contingent on their location where they received their degrees, after controlling for personal level and university level characteristics. The following sets of questions will be addressed: 1) How do STEM graduates perform in labor markets over time and space? a. How do their early career experiences vary by race, ethnicity and gender? b. How do their early career experiences vary by STEM sub-discipline? 2) How are the STEM graduates' labor market outcomes shaped by individual, institutional, and geographic location characteristics? a. What are the factors associated with their early career labor market outcomes? b. How do the relationships differ by gender, ethnicity, and STEM subdisciplines? Labor market performance and outcomes in this study are measured as job earnings, employment opportunities (employed vs. unemployed) and underemployment (employed full-time vs. involuntary part-time). Underemployment refers to working part time due to full time job unavailability. The first question addresses heterogeneity in job earnings, unemployment rate, probability of underemployment across US metropolitan areas in four distinct STEM graduates cohorts from 2000 to 2010, by gender, race/ethnicity, and sub-disciplines. The second question examines the relationship between the labor market outcomes measured in the above three dimensions across different levels, i.e., individual, institutional, and regional (metropolitan area and (non-)metropolitan area). Based on the existing literature, it is expected that the early career experiences of STEM college graduates will differ significantly across place. Race, gender, nativity and other socio-economic status are important factors that are associated with their labor market outcomes, in addition to human capital. Further, while everyone holds a college degree in similar disciplines in this study, i.e., STEM, higher education institutional characteristics, such as college prestige, selectivity, and private vs. public institutional control, are expected to play a critical role in labor market experiences and outcomes of college graduates (Black & Smith, 2004;Brand & Halaby, 2006;Brewer, Eide, & Ehrenberg, 1999;Monks, 2000;Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). I am particularly interested in testing the relationship between college attributes, college location, and the early career outcomes of recent STEM college graduates. I hypothesize that STEM degree holders vary in early labor market outcomes depending on the local labor market conditions of the location where they attended their college. For instance, graduates from colleges located in high-tech economic activity areas may benefit from proximity to jobs, contingent on their individual or academic background; in contrast, those who attend schools in less economically viable areas, may have more limited labor market information and fewer opportunities to access employment. Using the National Survey of Recent College Graduates database provided by the National Science Foundation, in combination with data from US Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics, this study is designed to fill the gaps in the scholarship on the geographic understanding of college location and its effects on STEM graduates' career. Examining several distinctive dimensions of labor market outcomes across STEM subdisciplines, this study provides significant insights on what makes difference in postgraduation success of STEM graduates. It also confirms that individual characteristics are the most important factors determining all three outcomes. Women and Blacks are considerably more disadvantaged (than male and White counterparts), while higher grades, more experience and spatial mobility are overwhelmingly positively related to higher earnings and lower probability of unemployment and underemployment. Per institutional factors, selectivity and college specialization in STEM are strong predictors of higher earnings, but not other outcomes. Geographic controls explain more than 25 percent in between college variance. Contingent on all other factors, including controls for cost of living at current place of residence, both college area STEM employment concentration and proximity to STEM clusters significantly increases graduates' earnings, while unemployment rate and share of manufacturing has an opposite effect. The rest of this dissertation is structured as following: Chapter II provides a review of the current knowledge relevant to this study. Chapter III describes data and methods used in this research. Chapters IV to VI describe the findings from descriptive analysis of individual, institutional and geographical factors. Then, the regression analyses base on the total STEM sample are presented in Chapter VII, and the regression results by subdisciplines in Chapter VIII. Finally, Chapter IX summarizes the findings, implications, limitation, and future research agenda. CHAPTER II: LITERATURE REVIEW 1. Human capital, social capital, cultural capital, and occupational attainment The neoclassic economic perspective argues that labor market outcomes are a function of human capital, which consists of ability, education, training, and skills of an individual (Becker, 1964(Becker, , 1985Mincer & Polachek, 1974). According to this perspective, individuals, through investments in education and training, accumulate human capital in form of skills and knowledge that are usually associated with better job attainment and career success. Thus, holding other conditions constant, a higher level of human capital should result in increased level of personal gains. Accordingly, providing equal access to investment in human capital would achieve greater income equality and equity in other labor market outcomes among different racial, ethnic, social and gender groups (Schultz, 1997). Paglin and Rufolo (1990) extend this theory to account for variability of demand for certain skills and knowledge which referred as heterogeneous human capital theory. They argue that human capital changes with the choices that a person makes during life, resulting in heterogeneous set of skills, knowledge, and experience that influence options that are available for further investment. Therefore, individual's innate ability dictates her choice of college major, which in turn is an important determinant of occupational choices. They state that math ability is one of the scarce abilities that differentiate college major wages. Those majors that require high-levels of math ability tend to lead to highpaying jobs. In other words, graduates who work in areas requiring a greater degree of mathematical ability achieve a higher rate of return to their investment in human capital than students who generate a type of human capital that makes less use of mathematical ability. Similar to human capital, social and cultural capital also are resources to enhance individual productivity (Putnam, 1995) and profitability (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1977), foster social network for job placement (Putnam, 1995), increase productivity (Coleman, 1988), and facilitate socioeconomic upward mobility (DiMaggio & Mohr, 1984;Lamont & Lareau, 1988). Social capital takes the form of instrumental, productive relationships or information-sharing networks (Coleman, 1988;Stanton-Salazar, 1997). Granovetter (1973) and Burt (1997) claimed that individuals, who are able to connect and communicate with potential employers and have the opportunity to speak directly with decision makers, have better career prospects. Indeed, extensive evidence suggests that personal contacts provides an indisputable advantage in securing employment. For example, through interpersonal networks, individuals gain exposure to a wider set of opportunities when they maintain contacts with others (Mau & Kopischke, 2001). Cultural capital, on the other hand, is the system of linguistic and cultural competencies that includes beliefs, tastes, and preferences obtained from family, peers and other authorities. These attributes ultimately define an individual's class status (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1977;McDonough, 1997;Stanton-Salazar, 1997). One way cultural capital may influence one's economic and labor market outcomes is through the provision of knowledge and information about college, jobs, and career options (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1977;McDonough, 1997). Cultural capital may also refer to one's values and preferences for education, such as values about obtaining a college degree (DiMaggio & Mohr, 1984;McDonough, 1997). While all these concepts may be true in perfect labor markets, many other theories challenge this view. These perspectives indicate other forces that cannot be completely eliminated by market processes outlined by human capital theory. For instance, persisting income gaps between different demographic groups, even when education is accounted for, cannot be explained by productivity differentials. Thus, job competition theorists argue that labor productivity is determined by job attributes and not necessarily by worker characteristics (Thurow, 1975). In other words, higher education credentials serve as a signal to employers, helping them to sort out individuals with the highest potential productivity. In a sense, a degree works as proxy for immeasurable attributes, such as ability, adaptiveness or motivation, for which an employer was willing to pay more (Sobel, 1982;Spence, 1973). Sorting of individuals into internal (primary) and external (secondary) markets is often not based on differences in human capital attainment, but rather on employer characteristics and preferences (Doeringer & Piore, 1971). In Thurow's (1975) view, potential workers are assigned to queues based on social and institutional factors, while employers determine whom to hire based on perceived ability of an individual. Therefore, workers are paid in accordance to the job they hold, while the jobs are assigned to wages defined by normative regulations. These approaches are drastically different from human capital theory as they consider that individual characteristics, such as level of education, have no effect on career beyond entry level job assignment (Rosenbaum, 1984). Gender, race, ethnicity, nativity, immigration status as well as intersections of such factors often determine the likelihood of finding adequate employment, occupational status, salary and benefits, as well as job satisfaction (Borjas, 1987;Browne & Misra, 2003;Raijman & Semyonov, 1997;Reich, Gordon, & Edwards, 1973). For instance, gaps in earnings between males and females, and between whites and minorities on average have decreased during the past 50 years (Farley, 1984;Goldin & Katz, 2007), however, the gaps are considerably wider in certain professional occupations and industries (Grodsky & Pager, 2001;Petersen & Morgan, 1995). According to Corbett and Hill (2012), one year after graduation from college, women who work in the same occupation, hours, and industry earn 7% less than their male counterpart in the identical situation. Although many disadvantages in labor market among females and minorities are attributed to differences in access to human and social capital (Autor, 2011;Bobbitt-Zeher, 2007), numerous studies suggest that prejudice and discrimination on the job market play a crucial role in labor market experiences (Arrow, 1973;Cain, 1987;Carneiro & Heckman, 2003). For instance, Reskin & Roos (2009) theorize that employers have preferences for individuals with certain background which put them in the front of the so called hiring queue. Hence, the less desired candidates only get hired after the preferable prospective employees leave such queues. Another perspective suggested by Bielby and Baron (1986) and extended by Altonji & Pierret (2001) states that employers \"rationally\" discriminate against certain socio-demographic groups based on the stereotypes about such individuals. Due to limited information availability about prospective workers, employers assess their fit and productivity based on previous interactions with, or simply a perception of, members of given gender, race or ethnicity groups (Bertrand, Chugh, & Mullainathan, 2005)."}, {"section_title": "The role of higher education institutions in labor market outcomes", "text": "There are more than 4000 colleges and universities in the United States that constitute a diverse network of higher education providers. They vary in type, quality, prestige, size, and numerous other indicators, such as institutional mission, reputational rating, academic expenditures per student, average SAT score of freshman class, faculty-student ratio, and level of tuition (Fitzgerald, 2000;Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). The effects of individual characteristics (such as human capital and social capital) and field of discipline on career outcomes may vary depending on school quality, usually measured by student body selectivity. The overwhelming evidence suggests that attending a highly prestigious college leads to increased rewards in the labor market. Graduates of elite institutions are more likely to have higher occupational status, salary and career mobility (Black & Smith, 2004;Brand & Halaby, 2006). Indeed, most research finds that attending a highly selective college is positively related to individual's earnings and job security (Fitzgerald, 2000;Loury & Garman, 1995). One explanation is that elite institutions tend to enroll students with higher occupational aspirations, which in turn results in better chances for career success (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Additionally, students enhance their future earnings by surrounding themselves with high-quality fellow students. Such student quality is usually measured by average SAT score of freshman class, which was found to have a significant positive effect on graduate earnings (Solomon, 1973). Further, institutional impact may come from peer group effect as career choice of graduates is largely impacted by most common major at their college (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005;Rosenbaum, 1984). At the same time, researchers find that elite institutions may help students to develop better social capital. According to Cornwell and Cornwell (2008), social contacts with experts provide access to scarce knowledge and opportunities not available to general public. Similarly, elite campuses provide frequent and easier access to experts and resources that may not be available elsewhere, which impacts students' career aspirations and further employment opportunities. For example, Waters and Leung (2013) state that efficient alumni networks affect graduates' employment opportunities and social mobility. Lee and Brinton (1996) argue that graduates from South Korean prestige universities are significantly more likely to find a job in large firms due to a higher quality of social capital attained in elite institution in comparison to lower-ranked colleges. Furthermore, Waters (2005Waters ( , 2006Waters ( , 2007 demonstrates that middle-class families in Hong Kong send their children to Canada for the 'overseas education' which was subsequently rewarded in the labor market. (Hall, 2011) demonstrates that the MBA graduates from leading business schools in the USA and the UK actively utilize their alumni networks and educational ties in London's financial services district as effective social and cultural capital for their career advancement. As for different types of higher education institutions, researchers compared the graduates from public and private universities. Some argue that graduates who attended private colleges have only marginal increase in earnings over people who attended public universities (Brewer et al., 1999;James, Alsalam, Conaty, & To, 1989). Fitzgerald (2000) demonstrates that male graduates who attended private research universities tend to earn less than those who study elsewhere. On the other hand, females who went to private liberal arts colleges earn \u2153 more than those who attended other types of schools. To understand the differences between public and private institution effects, Astin (1992) finds that graduates of private colleges tend to choose more lucrative careers than those of public schools. However, there is substantial variability within public universities. For instance, Hoekstra (2009) compares earnings of graduates who attended flagship state universities to those who were barely rejected the admission. The study finds that white male who attended selective public college graduates earn on average 20 percent more than those who were almost admitted there. Other factors such as Carnegie classification shows little impact on graduates' labor market outcomes, while a larger size of college appears to have a positive effect on both occupational status and income (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Both higher faculty salary (Behrman, Rosenzweig, & Taubman, 1996;Solomon, 1973) and lower student/faculty ratio (Liang Zhang, 2008) is associated with increased earnings. Expenditures per student as a separate measure of quality has a modest influence on graduates' earnings (Dale & Krueger, 2014;Solomon, 1973). Further, some of the institutional effects vary for different demographic groups. For example, women tend to benefit from going to larger schools more than men did; and further, the amount of college expenditures per student had a slight effect on male, but not female earnings (Fitzgerald, 2000). Researchers have also looked at the effects of attending historically black college or university (HBCU) or a single-sex schools on career outcomes, especially of African Americans and women. Fitzgerald (2000) and Strayhorn (2008) find a significant negative effect of graduating from HBCU on post-graduation earnings. On the other hand, Brown and Davis (2001) discuss the importance of social capital gained by African Americans at HBCUs which provide significant advantages in the post-graduation labor market. Furthermore, graduates of women's colleges are more likely to be overrepresented in high-status male-dominated occupations, such as medicine, research, and engineering. However, this finding is attributed to college student recruitment practices, rather than socialization that occurred on campus (Stoecker & Pascarella, 1991). Overall, the existing literature suggests that the specific environment and conditions at the HEI institutional level could interact with individual characteristics, such as class, race, and gender, to shape college graduates' major choice, human, social and cultural capital formation, and, further, labor market experiences and outcomes. More importantly relevant to the current study, institutional effects may highly depend on disciplines. For example, James et al. (1989) and Black, Kolesnikova, and Taylor (2009) argue that college major has a greater effect on both earnings and employability when college selectivity and major are considered simultaneously. In a study of MBA graduates' earnings, Grove and Hussey (2011) suggest that graduating from elite institutions increases earnings, but, not as much as majoring in finance and information systems. In other words, lucrative majors have a more prominent positive effect on earnings than institution elite status. When focusing only on STEM graduates, research suggests that starting salaries of engineering majors are relatively uniform across institutions, while heterogeneous for other non-science majors (Fitzgerald, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "College location, regional labor market, and college graduate occupational attainment", "text": "Although the geographic location of college is a crucial factor in college choice for prospective students, the effects of college location on graduates' post-graduation experiences have been largely overlooked (Chapman, 1981). Hanson and Pratt (1991) reflected on a role of place in knowledge production, in terms of relationships between employees and employers within metropolitan areas. They argue that economic and social dimensions of labor force act unitedly and varied depending on spatial context. For instance, access to job opportunities may be spatially constrained for many groups of workers, due to economic and social constructs, such as journey to work, place-based social networking, and strong ties to a particular area for both employers and employees. Along the same lines, others have argued that place, particularly the socioeconomic local labor market contexts, have a significant impact on individual labor market experiences and outcomes (Fernandez & Su, 2004;Hanson & Pratt, 1991;Sorenson, 2003). Although these studies are not focused on college students in particular, the theoretical framework is useful for the current study. Specifically, human capital, social capital, and other individual characteristics and the institutional level features at the university level are all embedded within their local and regional contexts. Their geographic location does not only provide a spatial container, but more importantly, they interact with individual and the higher education institution to shape college graduates' labor market outcomes. Purcell, Elias, Ellison, and Atfield (2008) argue that when choosing college, future students are guided either by a strong preference for certain institution characteristics or the location where they want to study. The preference for certain locations is often a function of proximity to home, job availability, local amenities, and attractiveness of an area (Kinzie et al., 2004;Paulsen & St. John, 2002;Perez & McDonough, 2008;Wajeeh & Micceri, 1997). According to Mattern and Wyatt (2008), more than 50 percent of all undergraduate college students in the US attend colleges less than 100 miles from home. One line of explanation stems from economic factors, such as cost reduction through attending college in-state or/and living at or close to home (Patiniotis & Holdsworth, 2005). Others may want to maintain close social ties with friends and family 1 . Wajeeh and Micceri (1997) find that students who decide to attend an urban university put a greater emphasis on the ability to combine study and work. Indeed, Price, Matzdorf, Smith, and Agahi (2003) finds that students who attended colleges in large cities were more likely to enjoy part-time job opportunities. Further, internships and career-related work experience, especially in specialized fields, like business, engineering and computer science, significantly increased their chances of post-graduation employment (Callanan & Benzing, 2004;Knouse, Tanner, & Harris, 1999;Sagen, Dallam, & Laverty, 2000). Therefore, for the students who go to colleges in the metropolitan areas with thick, abundant job opportunities, labor markets may have a positive earning premium due to relevant work experiences they received during their studies (Suhonen, Pehkonen, & Tervo, 2010). The structure of local labor markets are largely defined by industrial composition. According to Jacobs (1969), the local diversity of industries creates a competitive environment, which facilitates economic growth and innovative activity. Jacobs argues that knowledge spillovers happen between different industries and diverse businesses, transferring inventions from one sector to another. Another view on economic performance of regions is argued by Glaeser, Kallal, Scheinkman, & Shleifer (1992). They state that geographic specialization of industries is crucial for knowledge diffusion. Businesses within same industry benefit from proximity to each other, which reduces costs of transportation and information exchange. Additionally, industry specialization creates more efficient labor markets. For instance, in areas with high concentration of businesses within the same industry workers can find new employment more easily. Such flows of labor between firms also contributes to information exchange. Indeed, Freedman (2008) finds that workers in software publishing clusters are more likely to switch jobs that those who work in isolated firms. Moreover, they tend to earn more and receive salary increases more often than workers outside of the industry clusters. In an international study of higher education effects on graduates' performance in labor market, Garc\u00eda-Aracil (2014) reports that close interaction with employers and availability of proper internships increase graduates' career success. Such close interaction between college and employers is defined as social proximity (Rosenbaum, 1984). It may be comprised of college activities in the local community, information exchange and consulting relationship they have with companies. Therefore, graduates from universities that are socially close to local employers, may benefit from employer's enhanced recruiting efforts at these colleges (Rosenbaum, 1984). The author also notes that college's geographical proximity to employers, although not a perfect substitute for social proximity, showed a significant impact on earnings and promotions of college graduates, even when controlling for selectivity. In other words, having such connections to communities outside of campus provided more rounded learning experiences to college students and their post-graduation outcomes (Dugdale, 2008). On the employer side, proximity to universities provides firms with a better access to human capital resources. Studies suggest that for high-tech industries, proximity to universities is crucial due to their reliance on knowledge exchange through personal interaction, which may be possible only within relatively short distances (Fallah, Partridge, & Rickman, 2013). Consequently, many universities across the US, that are located in rural and suburban settings, have recently invested in development of college branches in cities or larger localities. College administrators argue that such moves were crucial, due to increased importance of securing links between industry and university (Selingo, 2014). Historically, college career services establish such links with employers and assisted students with job placement services. Recently, such services became even more important due to increasing popularity of internship programs as means to attaining full-time employment. For instance, large companies like Facebook, Enterprise Rent-a-Car and Ebay hired 70-80% of new employees through such programs, while other employers' interest in intern hires is also on a rise (Selingo, 2014). According to McGrath (2002), colleges that partner with multiple employers may even experience competition for its students and graduates, especially at times of high demand in engineering and computer science specialists. Even though the college-educated are the most mobile socioeconomically, only 30 percent of graduates work outside their home state (Moretti, 2012). In the study of college-to-work migration, Gottlieb and Joseph (2006) find that a large number of STEM graduates prefer staying in the place where they went to college. This effect is especially strong for those who went to college in their home state. According to Schwartz (1973), there are certain psychological and informational barriers that may prevent an individual from moving, even though migration may lead to economic gains. Environmental psychologists argue that among the anchors that were preventing people from moving are social and community factors that form place attachment Regan & Dillon, 2015). This limited labor mobility may benefit graduates who went to college in an area with higher economic activity, as they are more likely to reside in the same or nearby area after graduation. On the other hand, graduates who stay in cities with lower economic activity, may be willing to accept lower wages with higher risk of unemployment or underemployment (Suhonen et al., 2010). For instance, B\u00fcchel (2002) finds that over-education rates are lower in areas with plenty of jobs and higher spatial mobility. In other words, people who have a car are less likely to be overeducated, while individuals who need to travel longer to a large agglomeration of employment opportunities are more likely to be occupationally mismatched. On the labor market demand side, increasing evidence suggests that employment growth is stronger near the regions in a close proximity to urban areas, and the remote areas are likely to be economically disadvantaged (Partridge, Rickman, Kamar, & Rose, 2008). To add to that, Glendon and Vigdor (2003) argue that areas that experience local labor demand shocks in export-sector employment tend to negatively affect neighboring local labor markets up to 600 miles in diameter. From the economist's perspective, such local market conditions will result in out-migration of workforce (Borjas, Freeman, & Katz, 1997). In other words, job seekers need to be more spatially mobile and willing to search for a job at a greater distance. However, Bound, Groen, K\u00e9zdi, & Turner (2004) find that in the states with a large number of college graduates per capita, bachelor degree holders earn only slightly more than high school graduates, which indicates that the college-educated were imperfectly mobile across states. Moreover, unemployment, underemployment and over-education rates are also uneven across places, which is commonly explained by either skill or spatial mismatch (B\u00fcchel, 2002;Moretti, 2012;Wang & Lysenko, 2013). Phelps (1970) argues that migration from one labor market to another is costly and this cost increases with distance, which in turn inhibits workers from moving, especially to remote areas. Van Ham, Mulder, & Hooimeijer (2001) also state that individuals who attained sector-specific human capital may have to be more spatially flexible, as jobs in that sector may be available only in few locations. Therefore, place attachment and spatial inflexibility potentially restrict graduates' job opportunities, while better access to such opportunities may increase their wages and employment probabilities (Fallah et al., 2013;Regan & Dillon, 2015). College location does not only influence students, it also affects university faculty hiring. For instance, Solomon (1973) argues that some institutional factors, like faculty salary, is not a perfect indicator of quality, as colleges located in undesirable areas have to pay higher salaries only to compensate for their spatial \"unattractiveness.\" He claims that high quality faculty is willing to accept lower wages at colleges with attractive surroundings and better labor market opportunities. Indeed, in the study of community college faculty hiring, Cejda (2010) finds that rural campuses are struggling to find and retain qualified faculty. As size and quality of faculty has a direct impact on higher institution and its students, college location can then indirectly affect students' attainment of knowledge, abilities, skills, and social/cultural capital formation which further impacts their labor market experiences. In sum, college location and the regional labor market can have significant impacts on college students through human and social capital formation, intern and employment opportunity provision, local community engagement, and other mechanisms. In addition to the influences on students and faculty, the location is crucial to students also because of the spatial and institutional relationship between university and employers, near or far. Furthermore, as a majority of graduates stay close to where their colleges are, the regional labor market conditions, economic structure, robustness of local economy, and institutional environment at the college location can shape these graduates' labor market experiences and outcomes."}, {"section_title": "STEM disciplines and college graduates' labor market experiences", "text": "It is widely perceived that college major is an important determinant of future earnings and overall occupational experiences. In some studies, college major is found to be a better predictor of person's earning than demographic variables. For instance, (Gerhart, 1990) finds that choice of major explains differences in earnings better than gender. Selection of majors depends upon many different facts, such as perceived or observed monetary returns to various abilities, preferences in the workplace, and personal interests. STEM has been marketed to individuals as a lucrative field of study in college, as graduates who major in disciplines such as engineering and computer science, on average earned more annually and over a lifetime than those who specialize in any other fields (Arcidiacono, 2004). Moreover, STEM degree holders earn 11 percent more than their non-STEM counterparts, even if they are employed in a non-STEM job (Carnevale et al., 2011;Langdon et al., 2011). In fact, more than 50 percent of STEM graduates diverge to non-STEM occupations at their midcareer (Xu, 2012), which is explained by widespread need for science, math and technology skills and the broader reach of innovation in other professional sectors. Given the current demand for technological skills, STEM graduates also experience lower levels of unemployment and underemployment, as well as higher wage growth opportunities (Carnevale et al., 2011). For example, even during the recent economic downturn the unemployment rate for STEM workers (5.3 percent) was half that of their non-STEM counterparts (10 percent) (Langdon et al., 2011). Researchers argue that higher than average pay and lower unemployment indicate a relative shortage of STEM workforce. Apart from better career outcomes, some STEM workers also enjoy greater nonmonetary benefits, such as job satisfaction. Research shows that STEM workers are more satisfied with job security and have better work conditions (Carnevale et al., 2011;Xu, 2012). Whereas STEM education is commonly viewed as economically beneficial to individuals and a society, others maintain that returns on STEM education may vary when additional factors are taken to account such as age, gender and ethnicity, which may have an effect on STEM graduates' career (Beede et al., 2011;Chen, 2009;Graham & Smith, 2005). For instance, women in STEM tend to earn significantly less than men. Moreover, the gender gap in STEM surpasses the income disparity in non-STEM occupational sectors by the time workers reach 50 years old. According to Hunt (2015), around 24 percent of both men and women work outside of their field of training and there is no significant difference between gender in science and engineering. However, women are 3.2 percent more likely than men to exit engineering fields. Although the exit rate is relatively small compared to the female shortfall in entry to engineering, it may negatively affect women's perception of STEM employment. Similar to the gender disparities, the earnings of African-Americans and Latinos are also relatively lower than that of white non-Hispanic and Asian STEM workers, although the gap between these groups is narrower than in the non-STEM occupations (Broyles & Fenner, 2010). There are also differences within STEM occupations, with engineers earning the most and life and physical science workers the least. For STEM graduates working outside of traditional STEM occupations, they are paid the highest wages in managerial and professional sectors (Carnevale et al., 2011). In addition, men with majors in engineering, architecture and engineering technology earn about 12 percent more than those in business majors, while mathematics, computer and physical science majors earn as much as those with business majors. For women, majoring in engineering does not translate into higher earnings; however, mathematics and computer science graduates are on average paid more (Fitzgerald, 2000). Same demographic factors also affect graduates' unemployment and underemployment rates disproportionately. Geographically, STEM employment is unevenly distributed across the US. It is well documented that high-tech, innovative industries tended to agglomerate in localized clusters (Cortright & Mayer, 2001;Moretti, 2012 (Pearlstein, 2014). Similarly, Microsoft which is headquartered in Seattle, Washington hired its workers mostly from the local universities, such as the University of Washington and Washington State. This may indicate both employers' preference to hire locally, as well as individuals' intent to find local employment. Therefore, we can expect that colleges in areas with high concentration of STEM employment would produce similar early labor market outcomes, while controlling for other college characteristics. As discussed in earlier sections, there are significant gender and race effects on occupational attainment at both individual, institution, and regional level, respectively. However, the intersection of STEM, gender, location, and labor market outcomes have not been very well understood. In one of the studies that looks at spatial distribution of gender wage disparities, McCall (2001) finds that although wages are higher in labor markets with clustering of high-technology and service industries, such premiums are much higher for college educated men, compared to their female counterparts. Moreover, wage gap among college graduates is the widest in such regions. Olitsky (2013) also finds that, although STEM majors earn on average 25 percent more than their non-STEM counterparts, STEM wage premium constituted 18 percent for women and 28 percent for men. As for race effects, Cohen (1998) finds that higher concentration of African-American population in a metropolitan area is associated with increased earnings of Whites and depressed earnings of Blacks. Another study on spatial inequality confirms that concentration of single racial or ethnic population in a metropolitan area brings wages down for a given group. Conversely, in labor markets with considerable racial and ethnic mix, all demographic groups tend to benefit from higher earnings (Wang & Pandit, 2007). However, again, we still do not know much about the particular experiences of STEM college graduates. Overall, with the persistent underrepresentation of women and ethnic or racial minorities in the STEM disciplines and STEM occupations, I expect that the labor market experiences and outcomes for STEM college graduates are highly contingent on their individual characteristics, institutional environment, and the interaction with local and regional labor market; furthermore, such contingency may differ by their social identity such as gender and race. Therefore, this study will answer these questions: 1) How do STEM graduates perform in the labor market over time and space? 2) How are college   (Stone, Van Horn, & Zukin, 2012;Weinberger, 1998). The NSRCG dataset includes an abundant set of measures regarding the respondent's academic history, family background, and recent educational involvement. In particular, the NSRCG reports undergraduate school, major, year of graduation, salary, occupation, current labor market status, as well as age, gender, race and other demographic variables. When linked with institutional and geographical variables over time, these datasets are particularly valuable for assessing individuals' local labor market outcomes. In order to increase sample size, this study uses four of the latest NSRCG samples that include individuals who received a bachelor's degree during the period between 2000 and 2010. Thus, the data will be comprised of the following samples : NSRCG 2003(classes of 2000, 2001), NSRCG 2006(classes of 2002), NSRCG 2008(classes of 2005) and NSRCG 2010(classes of 2007. NSRCG data files were obtained to merge the variables relevant to the study with IPEDS. In order to fully merge individual-level data with the IPEDS datasets, the cases that have missing institutional codes were omitted from the NSRCG data. The third dataset, The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) contains nationally representative microdata from American Community Surveys for all the years since 2000 (Ruggles et al., 2010). This dataset provided a variety of individual and household characteristics, including race, ethnicity, gender, age, occupation, industry and many others. Most important is that IPUMS provides geographical location indicator, which allows one to aggregate data to different geographic scales (e.g., (non)metropolitan areas). In addition, the Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program from the Bureau of Labor statistics provides employment and wage estimates for more than 800 occupations by metropolitan and nonmetropolitan area on an annual basis. The IPUMS data and Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) are merged together and further matched to each respondent from the NSRCG by their university geolocation. In this way, the final dataset has variables at three different levels: Individual graduate respondent (from NSRCG), university (from IPEDS), and geographic location (from IPUMS and OES)."}, {"section_title": "Dependent Variables", "text": "For the dependent variables, I examined three dimensions of labor market outcomes: unemployment, underemployment, and job earnings."}, {"section_title": "a.

In the first two cohorts, underemployment is more evenly distributed across the country. During the economic downturn, graduates from certain college regions are disproportionally more likely to work part-time involuntarily than graduates from other areas. The areas with highest rate of STEM underemployment are mainly in the Pacific Northwest, Mideast and certain areas in the South. Underemployment is more common among women than men, especially in female dominated fields. Underemployment is more prevalent for men than for women in health fields. Conversely, female graduates are more likely than men to be underemployed in physical science fields. Social and life sciences are the fields with higher-than-average underemployment rate for both genders. Engineering graduates of both genders were the least likely to work part-time. Recession affected underemployment of men and women differently. While more women, in all fields but computer science, work part time during recession than previously, men have a sharp increase in underemployment only in few fields, social and physical sciences. Average rates of underemployment also differ by race/ethnicity. All racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to be underemployed than Whites in all fields. Again, engineering field is the most immune to underemployment, while social and life sciences have the largest number of the underemployed across all groups. Underemployment has grown in almost all fields for all the groups during recession, with math and physical science majors being hurt the most."}, {"section_title": "c.

The demographic attributes include age, gender, race/ethnicity, nativity, marital status and having children or not. Prior research has shown that expanded econometric models that include measures of human, social, and cultural capital are improved over traditional economic models when explaining college student decisions and outcomes (Mullen, Goyette, & Soares, 2003;Perna, 2007). In this study, human capital includes GPA, field of study, and work experiences. The NSRCG dataset includes limited information on individual's social capital. However, recent studies have shown that, recent graduates whose parents have higher level of education have higher career aspirations and tend to rely heavily on parents' professional networks when looking for a job (Gardner, 2010;Try, 2005). Therefore, parental educational attainment serves as a control for both social and cultural capital. In addition, graduation cohort, cost of living, and history of migration are included as control variables. The detailed measurement for each variable is provided in Table 1. As discussed earlier, labor market outcomes significantly differ by race and ethnicity (Melguizo & Wolniak, 2011;Lei Zhang, 2008). To add to that, foreign born indicator was added to control for immigrant status. Marital status 1=Married; 0=otherwise. Structural theorists suggest that marriage may be a signal to hiring departments of responsibility and stability for men, and of lack of work commitment for women. Hence, married men are expected to have better labor market outcomes than single men, whereas the relationship is expected to be reversed for women (Glauber, 2008;Pollmann-Schult, 2011).

Many researches argue that higher grades tend to lead to better career experiences, because they are likely to signal about greater human capital or used as a screening tool (Gemus, 2010;Jones & Jackson, 1990).

Institutional level factors", "text": "The sample size of colleges and universities used in the study is 303. The institutional-level variables extracted from the IPEDS include the following (Table 2 provides the specific measurement for each variable): Quality. The institutional reputation, usually measured by college ranking or selectivity, is found to affect graduates' labor market outcomes (Loury & Garman, 1995;Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). In addition to these, researchers often use average standardized test scores of freshmen class (SAT or ACT), as measure of institutional quality. Average test scores are not available for all colleges in my sample; plus, common college rankings do not cover all universities in the US. Therefore, this study uses applicants' acceptance rate to control for college quality. At the same time, it controls for institution types to differentiate institutions with doctoral degree granting. Diversity. As discussed earlier, racial diversity of intuitions is associated with positive learning outcomes (Antonio et al., 2004;Chang, 1999) and higher wages for certain groups (Daniel, Black, & Smith, 2001). This study includes the diversity index of student population to reflect the probability of students' interactions across race and ethnicity. Additionally, shares of Black and Hispanic student population variables were added to the model to control for minority concentration. STEM specialization. Prior research suggests that college graduates tend to follow major and career choices that correspond to the most dominant major at institution that they attended (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Astin (1970) theorize that it is due \"progressive conformity\", which is a student's tendency to strive for challenging and demanding majors and careers in competitive environments. This is especially relevant for minorities. For example, Tusin and Pascarella (1985) argue that women are less likely to major in education in colleges with abundance of programs that lead to higher professional status careers than school teaching. This is likely because in highly intellectual and competitive environments there is a larger presence of female role models who aspire to more lucrative and traditionally male-dominated professions. It is possible that college specialization in STEM disciplines may influence career outcomes of its disciplines. Thus, the location quotient of institution specialization in STEM disciplines is included at the institutional level. Institution control has mixed influence on graduates. Researchers find that it affects different groups disproportionately (Astin, 1992;Brewer et al., 1999;Fitzgerald, 2000)."}, {"section_title": "Quality", "text": "Acceptance rate, calculated as a ratio of accepted applicants to a total number of applications.

In addition, in order to capture economic effects of remoteness in the urban hierarchy, this study includes a measure of geographic proximity to other metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas with high-STEM employment. For example, opportunities are fewer for more remote places (Lindsay, McCracken, & McQuaid, 2003). They argues that unemployed workers in remote areas are being cut-off from professional social networks that are invaluable for securing employment. On the other hand, many non-urban areas have a high demand for certain professionals, such as health workers (Lehmann, Dieleman, & Martineau, 2008).

This approach was widely used since the 1960s in multi-campus studies (Astin & Denson, 2009). The hierarchical nature of multi-level data raises concerns when estimating the effects of aggregated variables. For instance, disaggregation of institutional and location variables to the individual graduate level violates the OLS assumption of independence. Therefore, a multi-level regression modeling (MLM) technique is employed to resolve the aggregation bias that occurs in OLS models when analyzing hierarchal data. Specifically, in HLM models, the variancecovariance components are separated into separate within-and betweeninstitution/location components (Astin & Denson, 2009;Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). For the current study, the decision to use MLM is driven by a few factors. Firstly, the NSRCG data has a nested structure. The NSF used two-step sampling framework -in the first step they sampled colleges and universities, and then sampled graduates within those institutions. Therefore, MLM analysis has a good fit for the sampling framework used to collect this data, because it accounts for interdependence of observations within An unconditional model is first estimated to explore whether there was a significant variance of intercepts between institutions. Then, grand-centered independent variables are added to the model in the stepwise manner. This way, the gradual addition of variables helps to explore how aggregated controls mediate the effects of individual predictors. In other words, the addition of location variables to the model presents not only their relative predicting power of graduate's earnings, but also showed how they are mediated by the effects of individual and institutional variables. Stepwise regression modeling helps to examine how addition of new sets of variables changes the effects of predictors on selected career outcomes (Table 4).

Overall, the most substantial differences in unemployment in all majors and cohorts is between Whites and the rest, which is evident in Figure 6. Furthermore, recession negatively affects all groups, but to a different extent, with Blacks being the only group for whom unemployment decreased in most disciplines in the last cohort."}, {"section_title": "Underemployment by gender and major over time", "text": "Gender differences in unemployment rates by major are illustrated in Figure 7. Like unemployment, underemployment rate also increases for almost all majors in the recession cohort. The only exception is computer sciences for women (3.6 percent decrease) and life sciences for men (4.3 percent decrease). Specifically, the underemployment rates among computer science graduates differs by gender, where females (1.7 percent) have a rate only a half of males (3.4 percent). Women also fare much better in the last cohort with almost no underemployment, compared to 4.7 percent for males. Engineering majors have the lowest underemployment compared to other majors (under 2 percent). However, it increases dramatically for female engineers during recession years (from 0.5 to 4.6 percent), while it only marginally rises for men (from 1.4 to 1.7 percent). Similarly, underemployment rate for health majors is also low (under 5 percent), however it significantly increases by the end of decade, especially among men (8.1 percent). Overall, like unemployment, female (4.3 percent) graduates are more likely to be underemployed than their male (3.3 percent) counterparts. Moreover, underemployment is considerably higher among female-dominated majors, such as social and life sciences. When both male and female STEM majors are hit by economic recession, female suffer more as indicated by the rate of underemployment. 8. Underemployment by race/ethnicity and major over time    Figure 9). Graduates from colleges that enroll less than 2500 students, on average, earn $4,390 less than those who have attended colleges with more than 50,000 enrolled students. Similarly, underemployed graduates are significantly more likely to have attended smaller sized institutions (M = 18483, SD = 600.17), than those who are  Graduates from colleges with higher racial diversity are likely to earn more as well, r(17613)=0.12, p<0.01 ( Figure 10). However, college racial diversity appears to have slightly negative, but statistically significant, relation with underemployment, t(17547) = -1.83, p = .033. The relationship between unemployment and college diversity is not significant, t(17536) = -1.32, p = .188. Figure 10 illustrates the distribution between racial diversity and the three labor market outcome indicators.   College control (i.e., public versus private) is only marginally related to career outcomes (Tables 6-7). While graduates from public colleges receive a slightly, though not significantly, higher salary, private colleges tend to have slightly lower numbers of unemployed and underemployed graduates. College type, on the other hand, is a significant factor in graduates' salary. On average, graduates from research and doctoral degree granting institutions earn $7,311 more than their counterparts with degrees from other colleges. However, relationship between college type and employment status is mixed. Students from the research and doctoral granting institutions are less likely to be underemployed but more likely to be unemployed. Generally, these results align with existing literature on between-college differences in labor market experiences. For instance, attending a highly selective institution is predominantly associated with better post-graduation outcomes (Black, Haviland, Sanders, & Taylor, 2006;Eide et al., 2015;Fitzgerald, 2000;Loury & Garman, 1995), so as graduation from larger colleges (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). However, the effects of college racial diversity on career outcomes are mixed, with results suggesting no effect (Hinrichs, 2011), positive (Daniel et al., 2001) and negative (Arcidiacono & Vigdor, 2010) influence on labor market experiences. Unlike prior research (Brewer et al., 1999), in this study sample there are no significant correlation between attending private universities and higher salaries. The descriptive statistics also suggest a relationship between research and doctoral degree granting and higher unemployment rate which is not clear in previous research (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Pascarella and Terenzini (2005) suggest that graduates tend to pursue careers that correspond to the most dominant major in the college they attend. However, there are no specific studies that have explored the STEM concentration effects. The descriptive analyses from the national data in this study suggest that attending colleges that produce higher number of STEM graduates is related to better opportunities for higher earnings. While these patterns are interesting, they are only based on a bivariate relationship between selected college characteristics and the outcomes of interest. Further regression analyses are provided in Chapters VII and VIII. CHAPTER VI: FINDINGS FROM DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES OF GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS"}, {"section_title": "Characteristics of college locations", "text": "Almost 90 percent of respondents went to college in areas with less than 10 million population. Generally, those who graduated from colleges in large urban areas are more likely to earn more r(17169)= 0.03, p<0.01) than graduates from smaller college towns. However, attending college in regions with higher population is negatively associated with graduates' employment prospects, i.e., higher unemployment and underemployment ( Figure 13). FIGURE 13: Population size and labor market outcomes (constant 2010 US dollars). Most colleges and universities in this sample (55.9 percent) are in moderately racially diverse areas, 33.1 percent in relatively homogeneous, and 10.9 percent in very diverse regions. Generally, more diverse areas are slightly more correlated with higher earnings than the racially homogeneous areas, r(17169)= -0.05, p<0.01 ( Figure 14). Other outcomes have the opposite relationship with racial diversity, however. Underemployment (M = 0.44, SD = 0.007), t(17106) = -2.51, p=0.01 and unemployment (M = 0.45, SD = 0.006), t(18051) = -3.65, p<0.001 are more prevalent among those graduates who received their schooling in more diverse areas. Therefore, the relationship between region's racial diversity and labor market experiences is not straightforward which has not been examined in previous studies.  Similarly, college proximity to regions with higher STEM employment have a slightly positive relationship to the post-graduation pay, r(17615)= 0.06, p<0.01. However, closeness to potential job markets is not significantly correlated with either unemployment or underemployment (Figure 16). In sum, STEM college graduate labor market experiences vary drastically by college location. On average, areas with larger population size, higher racial diversity, lower unemployment rate, higher STEM employment and closer to STEM clusters, are related to higher job earnings after graduation. But, higher shares of manufacturing in the college area were negatively associated with salary. College graduates from these areas earn a median yearly wage lower than $30,000. The spatial differences in STEM earnings vary by major ( Figure 21). Computer science graduates from majority of college locations earn more than the STEM average.     The average unemployment rate for all majors across four cohorts is 5.2 percent. However, unemployment rate of college graduates is highly uneven across the college geographic areas (Figure 25)    Then, three models are conducted (refer to Table 10)  1497.67*** a. Individual level characteristics Table 10 provides the regression results from the three models. In model 1, most of demographic factors have a significant effect on individuals' post-graduation earnings. Specifically, being married is significantly associated with higher individuals' salary (\u03b2 =0.045, p<0.01). It is consistent with previous studies where marriage has been found to be economically beneficial by many researchers (Ahituv & Lerman, 2007;Chun & Lee, 2001;Ribar, 2004). Even though the sample is restricted to individuals under 30 years old, age positively and significantly affects person's earnings (\u03b2 =-0.013, p<0.01). This is also consistent with previous research that finds older labor force members generally have more experience leading to higher wages (Card & DiNardo, 2002;Heywood & Siebert, 2009). Researchers also find that having children has a positive effect on wages (de Linde Leonard & Stanley, 2015;Dew & Eggebeen, 2010). However, our study does not find having children to be a significant factor (\u03b2 =-0.023, p=0.149). As one important form of human capital, higher GPA is significantly related to higher salaries when controlling for other factors (p<0.01). Those with more work experience also have a significantly higher salary (\u03b2 =-0.009, p<0.01), than those who have just graduated. These findings are consistent with previous literature (Jones & Jackson, 1990), as well as human capital theory (Becker, 1994). This study uses parent educational attainment as a form of social capital. It finds that parental education has a mixed influence on earnings: While a father's higher education has a positive impact on the outcome (\u03b2 =-0.023, p<0.01), a mother's education is insignificant (\u03b2 =-0.012, p=0.203). This finding is surprising, considering that mother's low-educational attainment level has been previously found to have negative effects on children's wages (Budig, 2002;Krein, 1986). Interestingly, graduates who move to another state after graduation tend to have 5.6 percent higher salary than those who remain in a state where they went to college (p<0.01). Using the same dataset, Kazaqi (2016) finds that repeated migration among highly-educated labor force is associated with higher average salary. As expected, in this study, graduates who work in states with higher cost of living, indicated by regional price parities indicator, are more likely to have a higher salary (\u03b2 =0.007, p<0.01). This study cannot examine the causality between migration and higher salary; however, the finding indicates that a higher spatial mobility was associated with higher economic (probably as well as social) mobility for college graduates. College major is one of the most important factors for salary, as significant variation in labor market outcomes exist among different STEM majors. Graduates with engineering degrees are the only group that earn more than health majors (\u03b2 =-0.007, After controlling for all other personal level characteristics, gender and race are still significant parameters for job earnings. Specifically, women earn 8 percent less than men annually (p<0.01). This is unsurprising, considering the overwhelming evidence of persisting gender pay gap (Hill, 2017). Moreover, women dominate two majorslife and social sciencesthat pay the lowest wages in this sample. Nevertheless, the gender gap is smaller by 12 percent in this sample than it is reported elsewhere (Hill, 2017). Among the racial groups, Blacks are the only group that earn significantly less than    "}, {"section_title": "b. College characteristics", "text": "By controlling for personal characteristics (Model 2), graduates' salary is positively related to larger colleges (\u03b2 =0.0006, p<0.01). This was consistent with both the descriptive statistics and some prior studies (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). However, college ethnic diversity is not a significant factor (\u03b2 =-0.013, p=0.487) any more after controlling for other characteristics, contradicting the findings from descriptive analysis. That said, in one of the most recent studies on college diversity, Hinrichs (2011) does not find any significant relationship between college diversity and future wages either. Nevertheless, the results still indicate that graduates from colleges that serve larger Hispanic population are likely to earn 14 percent less than those from the institutions with smaller share of Hispanic students (p<0.01). The academic standards, quality and specific curriculum offers are significant factors. As shown in Model 2, graduates from colleges with STEM concentration are more likely to earn higher salaries (\u03b2 =-0.039, p<0.01). Individuals who graduate from more selective colleges are more likely to earn significantly higher wages (\u03b2 =-0.129, p<0.01), as well. This is consistent with most of the prior literature (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Both labor market signaling and better social capital are likely to lead to increase earnings for graduates of selective colleges. Employers may pay graduates from higher status colleges more, due to brand recognizability. At the same time, elite colleges are likely to provide enhanced social capital to its graduates, which may also contribute to increased earnings (Waters, 2005(Waters, , 2007. Inconsistently with previous research, attending a private institution, as opposite to a public college, is not associated with increased earnings for STEM graduates (\u03b2 =-0.039, p<0.01). However, graduating from a research and doctoral institutions, as opposite to non-research four-year institutions, does not have a significant influence on one's earnings at the alpha level of 0.5 (\u03b2 =-0.026, p=0.09). In Model 3, where personal characteristics and location factors are controlled for, university size (\u03b2 =0.0004, p<0.01), STEM concentration (\u03b2 =0.027, p<0.01) and college acceptance rate are still significant parameters (\u03b2 =0.027, p<0.01). Interestingly, share of Blacks (\u03b2 =-0.949, p<0.01) in a college becomes a significant predictor of earnings, while the share of Hispanics (\u03b2 =-0.087, p=0.09) is not. These relationships are also predicted by the earlier descriptive analysis."}, {"section_title": "c. Location characteristics", "text": "Model 3 provides the results of location characteristics after controlling for personal and college factors. Unlike college diversity, the ethnic diversity of the place where the college is located presents a significant negative relationship to post-graduation earnings (\u03b2 =-0.154, p<0.01), which is consistent with the descriptive analysis. This finding is surprising, considering that many researchers find that cultural diversity leads to increase in wages in the region (Ottaviano & Peri, 2005. Moreover, other results suggest that such diversity leads to increase in research and development activity (Niebuhr, 2010), which in turn may lead to economic gains. One of the possible explanations to this discrepancy is the level of analysis. The existing studies on ethnic diversity and wagelevel are conducted at the aggregated level, estimating the effect of diversity factors on average regional earnings. The current study is conducted at the individual level. Moreover, the sample of this study is limited to a specific and relatively homogeneous population sample, which is not representative of the total labor force of a given area. The population size is not a significant factor for graduate's salary (\u03b2 =-0.0009, p=0.843). This is consistent with Black et al.'s study (2009) that find that MSA population has a marginal and insignificant influence on salaries. However, the local labor market conditions are significantly related to college graduates' job earnings. For instance, a one percent of increase in share of STEM workers in the area where a college is located increases one's salary by 164 percent (p<0.01). Regarding STEM employment, areas with concentration of high-technology employment tend to have higher average wages (Freedman, 2008), which may explain such a substantial wage premiums for graduates in those areas. As shown in Figure 28, the predicted job earnings for genders differ when the percentage of STEM increases in a college area. As STEM concentration increases in a metropolitan area, the salary disparities between men and women decrease. Similarly, proximity to labor markets that hire a considerable number of STEM workers is slightly associated with higher post-graduation salary (\u03b2 =0.0005, p=0.08). Considering that more than 70 percent of graduates stay in the state where they went to college, closeness to places with higher share of STEM employment may constitute a better job market for these graduates. Overall, the results indicate that a significant portion of the between-college differences in salary can be attributed to college geographical factors. Indeed, the addition of location variables explained 26.2 percent more of level-2 residual variance, compared to controlling only for institutional variables. Graduates from locations that specialize in STEM have a higher salary, while those from the areas with higher unemployment rate and racial diversity tend to earn significantly less. This geographic dimension has never been explored in previous studies."}, {"section_title": "Underemployment", "text": "This section presents the MLM results on underemployment and unemployment analyses. The regressions results are provided in are more likely to work part-time involuntarily, while individuals whose father has a bachelor degree (\u03b2 =-0.184, p=0.049), have higher GPA (\u03b2 =-0.184, p=0.020), has more experience (\u03b2 =-0.170, p<0.01) and moved out-of-state post-graduation (\u03b2 =-0.353, p<0.01) are less likely to be underemployed. The gender effect is consistent with previous research that women are more likely to work part-time (Kalleberg, 2000) and reluctance to move for another job (Bielby & Bielby, 1992 Unlike the results from the salary models, none of the higher education institutional factors are significant predictors for underemployment. In contrast, the macro economic conditions at the places where the colleges are located make the differences. For example, a STEM specialization in the college location is negatively related to underemployment (\u03b2 =-15.205, p<0.01). That is, in a regional labor market that is specialized in STEM industries, it is easier for graduates to find full-time employment. On the contrary, a larger workforce employed in manufacturing is significantly related to a higher probability of underemployment (\u03b2 =-6.700, p=0.05). It reflects that concentration of manufacturing sectors may present an unfavorable job market for STEM graduates whose specialization does not align with jobs in these industries. where a college was located. As shown here, both men and women benefit significantly from STEM employment concentration, however even though women are affected the most by this factor, the underemployment gap persists even in areas with very high STEM concentration. As for racial differences, areas with low STEM employment on average have more part-time workers across all groups, with Blacks being the most likely to be underemployed and Asians the least. However, when looking at areas specialized in STEM industries, underemployment decreases for everybody, but, it especially benefits Black graduates. \nAt the individual level, female life (\u03b2 =0.485, p<0.02) and social (\u03b2 =0.248, p<0.03) science graduates are more likely to be underemployed than their male counterparts. Again, these are the STEM disciplines that are dominated by women. Among the racial groups, only Black (\u03b2 =0.507,p<0.01)  Overall, underemployment is more common among women with degrees in already lower paid fieldssocial and life sciences. As indicated earlier, women are more likely to concentrate in social and life sciences. In particular, higher GPA and college specialization in STEM are significantly associated with getting a full-time job in higher paid fields (such as health, engineering and computer sciences). For all other majors, however, these factors do not matter. Geographical factors affect only engineering and physical science graduates' employment situation. STEM specialization decreases underemployment for physical science graduates by two times. Graduating in areas with higher concentration of manufacturing is likely to increase the chances of part-time employment for engineering majors. Results from these models are provided in Table 13 3. Unemployment After controlling for other characteristics, no significant gender disparities in the probability of unemployment are identified in sub-disciplines. Among the racial groups, Asian graduates with degrees in life (\u03b2 =1.065, p<0.01), physical sciences (\u03b2 =0.742, p=0.03) and health (\u03b2 =-1.479, p=0.04) are more likely to be unemployed than their White counterparts. Similarly,Blacks (\u03b2 =0.561,p=0.04)  At the institutional level, engineering graduates (\u03b2 =-0.005, p<0.01) from larger colleges are more likely to be employed than those from smaller schools. Racial diversity has little effect on graduates' employment prospects, with exception of engineering graduates who are more likely to be unemployed if they attend a racially diverse college (\u03b2 =0.405, p=0.02) or institutions with higher shares of Hispanics (\u03b2 =1.183, p=0.03). Similarly, graduates with life science degrees (\u03b2 =0.405, p=0.02) from colleges with a higher proportion of Black students (\u03b2 =2.759,p<0.01) are more likely to be jobless. Surprisingly,engineering (\u03b2 =0.538,p=0.03) and health (\u03b2 =1.183, p=0.04) graduates who attend research and doctoral granting institutions are more likely to be unemployed than their counterparts who attend other types of colleges. In prior studies, the effects of Carnegie classification were inconsistent, including all positive, negative and insignificant influence of schools with higher classification on various learning and labor market outcomes (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Among the location factors, a larger population size is significantly associated with higher rate of unemployment for computer science graduates (\u03b2 =0.325, p=0.04). When unemployment in the college area is higher, the likelihood of unemployment increases for physical science graduates as well (\u03b2 =0.222, p=0.03). In addition, racial diversity has a negative relationship with computer (\u03b2 =4.006, p<0.01) and engineering (\u03b2 =1.507, p=0.03) graduates. Furthermore, engineering graduates from areas with a larger manufacturing industry are considerably more likely to be unemployed (\u03b2 =12.347, p=0.05). In contrast, the proportion of STEM workforce in the college area significantly decrease the odd of joblessness for social science graduates (\u03b2 =-19.002, p=0.02). In sum, unemployment is the only outcome examined in this study that is not affected by gender in the disaggregated models. That said, Asians are significantly disadvantaged in fields where they are underrepresented. Moreover, the model appears to fit the best with engineering graduates, as factors at all levels are significantly related to their employment status. Similar to the underemployment model, engineers are more likely to be jobless if graduated in areas that specialize in manufacturing and are more racially diverse. Social scientists are the only group that benefited from STEM employment concentration in a college area. Results from these models are provided in Table 14.         post-graduation success in the labor markets (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). For example, at the individual level, research finds that gender (Beede et al., 2011;Buffington, Cerf, Jones, & Weinberg, 2016;Chen, 2009), race (Beede et al., 2011;Broyles & Fenner, 2010), parental level of education (Roksa & Arum, 2012), GPA (Jones & Jackson, 1990;Xu, 2013) and major (J. Altonji, Blom, & Meghir, 2012;Gerhart, 1990;Melguizo & Wolniak, 2011) is associated with graduates' labor market outcomes. At the institutional level, research finds that graduates from large colleges (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005) and selective colleges (Thomas, 2000) have better outcomes than students who attend smaller and less selective colleges. However, previous research has not taken into account of the local or regional labor market conditions in the college area. This project examines recent graduates' early career experiences through the analysis of four cohorts of STEM Bachelor's degree recipients with a special attention to geographical factors that contribute to such experiences. Salary, underemployment and unemployment are the outcomes of interest. The individual level factors examined in this study are a set of demographic characteristics, family background, major, performance in college (GPA), work experience and cohort. The institutional level factors in examination include higher education institution type, size, selectivity, racial diversity, and level of STEM specialization. Among the geographical predictors, there are macro-economic strength, racial diversity, population size, STEM workforce concentration, proximity to areas with larger STEM labor markets, and share of workers in manufacturing industries. 1. How do STEM graduates perform in the labor market over time and space? a. Job earnings When comparing the salary/earning outcome between cohorts, it is evident that STEM graduates in the second half of 2000s experience a considerable decrease in earnings, especially in the last cohort. This is consistent with prior research on temporal trends in STEM salaries (Langdon et al., 2011), which states that STEM employees experience salary reduction during recessions. However, the geographical distribution of salary decline varies substantially across college locations. For instance, in the early 2000s, STEM graduate's salary in the vast majority of college locations only slightly deviates from the national mean; at the same time, the job earnings of last two cohorts vary significantly depending on where the graduates attend college. During the last recession, graduates from colleges in the South, Western New England and Rocky Mount areas are affected the most. Men have a considerable advantage in job earnings compared to women. Additionally, male and female graduates are largely segregated by college major, which may have affected the average salaries and gender pay differences. For example, women dominate social and life sciences -the lowest paid fields. However, even within these majors, men have a wage premium. On the other hand, average salaries are higher for women in health and engineering compared to men with similar degrees. Unlike life and social sciences, these fields are drastically different in gender composition, with health being dominated by women and engineering by men; nevertheless, they both still are the highest paid fields for women. Averages salaries decrease for both women and men in the late 2000s; but, for women this drop is much smaller than for men, as the gender pay gap decreases from 7.7 percent in the 2006 cohort to 2.6 percent in the 2010 cohort. There were also pay differences between racial and ethnic groups. Asian graduates had higher average earnings across all STEM disciplines, followed by Whites, Hispanics and Blacks. Computer and math sciences were the fields where the pay gaps across racial groups were the largest. Additionally, engineering, computer science and health were the highest paid fields for all races, except Asian who earned more in math related fields than in health. On average, earnings decreased for all groups during recession, with health and engineering graduates having the smallest reduction in pay. Overall, the pay gap between minorities (except Black graduates) and Whites increased during recession, while the salary difference between Asians and Whites reached 26 percent, in favor of the former."}, {"section_title": "Unemployment", "text": "The unemployment model (Table 11)  This is consistent with previous studies on effects of marriage and parenthood on employment status (Livanos, Yalkin, & Nu\u00f1ez, 2009;Stj\u00e4rnf\u00e4ldt, 2016;Waite, Haggstrom, & Kanouse, 1986 Similar to the salary and underemployment models, at the college location, share of STEM workers has a negative impact on the odds of unemployment (\u03b2 =-13.445, p<0.01). This is consistent with localization theory and Freedman's (2008) "}, {"section_title": "Summary", "text": "Among individual factors, both race and gender play major roles in all three dimensions of labor market outcomes. Female and Black graduates appear to be the most disadvantaged groups. Women are more likely to be unemployed and earn on average approximately 8 percent less than men, while Blacks earn 4 percent less than Whites and are 1.3 times more likely to be unemployed and 1.4 times underemployed. Asians had a significant disadvantage in employment as well, being 1.5 times more likely to be unemployed. For salary, many institutional factors are significant predictors of graduate's earnings. For instance, college size, selectivity and specialization in STEM have an overwhelmingly positive relationship with job earnings, while larger Black student enrollment have an opposite effect. Institutional level characteristics are not significant factors with only larger Black student enrollment having a negative impact. The insignificance of institutional characteristics is similar to that for the underemployment model. Location makes a lot of difference, especially for unemployment and underemployment outcomes. College area economic health and STEM specialization are the most influential determinants of graduates' early careers on geographic level. This raises a question of how higher education is involved in local and regional economic development. There is an older debate of \"town and gown\" which questions a HEI's role in local and regional economy. The current research indicated that college STEM graduates' labor market turnover is closely related to the regional economy."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER VIII: ANALYSIS BY MAJOR WITHIN STEM", "text": "This chapter provides the results of analysis disaggregated by STEM sub-disciplines. Considering the heterogeneity of STEM majors included in this sample, as well as considerable variability in average earnings, unemployment and underemployment rates reported by descriptive analysis, significant differences in the outcomes between these major groups are expected. 1. Salary a. Computer science GPA (\u03b2 =-0.083, p<0.01), work experience (\u03b2 =-0.007, p<0.01), and working fullyear (\u03b2 =-0.325, p<0.01) or full-week (\u03b2 =-0.897, p<0.01) has a positive association with salary. After controlling for these characteristics, gender and racial differences are still significant. Women not only are underrepresented in computer science occupations, they earn significantly less than men. Specifically, after controlling for other characteristics, women earn almost 9 percent less than men. This is consistent with Beede et al. (2011). Using 2009 American Community Survey data, they find that women in computer science occupations earn 12 percent less than men when controlling for age, education and region of residence. As for racial differences, although Black (\u03b2 =-0.204, p<0.01), Hispanic (\u03b2 =-0.148, p=0.01) and White graduates are statistically equally represented in computer science disciplines, their salaries differ significantly, with Blacks earning 20 percent and Hispanics 14 percent less than their White counterparts. At the institutional level, the patterns are similar to the general model. Both higher racial diversity (\u03b2 =-0.189, p=0.03) and higher share of Hispanic students (\u03b2 =-0.512, p=0.01) are associated with lower pay, while STEM specialization (\u03b2 =-0.101, p=0.05) and college size (\u03b2 =-0.002, p<0.01) are associated with higher post-graduation earnings. Among geographical factors, only the unemployment rate is significantly associated with the salary for computer scientists. That is, as the unemployment rate increased by 1 percent, the job earnings for computer science graduates decrease by 4 percent (\u03b2 =-0.040, p=0.02)."}, {"section_title": "b. Life science", "text": "At the individual level, those with more experience (\u03b2 =0.013, p<0.01), who move out-of-state post-graduation (\u03b2 =0.082, p=0.02), work full-year (\u03b2 =-0.418, p<0.01) and full-week (\u03b2 =-0.683, p<0.01) are likely to earn more.

(2011) find that women with life science degrees earn only 8 percent less than men. The current study finds a much bigger gap as female life scientists earn almost 15 percent less than men. There are no significant racial difference of job earnings in life science discipline. At the institution level, life science graduates from larger (\u03b2 =0.001, p<0.01) and private (\u03b2 =0.102, p=0.05) universities tend to earn more, while those who attend colleges with higher concentration of Hispanics (\u03b2 =-0.016, p=0.01) are likely to earn significantly less.

These negative effects are consistent with findings for all STEM graduates."}, {"section_title": "c.

Older physical science graduates also have a pay advantage (\u03b2 =0.039, p=0.03), so as those with more experience (\u03b2 =-0.394, p=0.03). Full-year workers (\u03b2 =0.032, p<0.01) earn 32 percent more than those who work part-year, while those employed full-week (\u03b2 =0.998, p<0.01) earn almost twice as much as than those who work part-time. After controlling for these characteristics, racial differences are not found for physical science. None of the variables at the level-2 had a significant relationship with physical science graduates' earnings."}, {"section_title": "d.

Both being married (\u03b2 =0.084, p<0.01) and older age (\u03b2 =0.018, p<0.01) are likely to earn more, compared to single and younger graduates, respectively. After controlling for other conditions, gender is still a significant predictor. Specifically, female social science graduates earn 14 percent less than their male counterparts. (\u03b2 =-0.141, p<0.01). It is worth noting that even within social sciences, women are highly concentrated in lower paying sub-disciplines as men are more likely to major in economics and related sciences that usually lead to higher paid jobs (Weinberger, 1999). Again, no significant racial differences in job earnings are identified. Graduates in the first cohort earned 10 percent more than 2006 cohort (\u03b2 =-0.102, p<0.01), 12 percent more than the 2008 cohort (\u03b2 =-0.124, p<0.01) and 27 percent more than the last cohort (\u03b2 =-0.273, p<0.01). This indicates that there was a downward trend in the salaries of social science graduates. At the institutional level, only the acceptance rate was significantly related to earnings (\u03b2 =-0.269, p<0.01). Among the location factors, graduates who went to college in areas with higher unemployment tended to earn less (\u03b2 =-0.02, p=0.02). Furthermore, those who attended colleges in locations close to other areas with high STEM concentration (\u03b2 =0.016, p<0.01) were likely to earn 16 percent more than those from more isolated areas."}, {"section_title": "e. Engineering", "text": "At the individual level, graduates who move to other state (\u03b2 =0.072, p<0.01), have higher GPAs (\u03b2 =0.053, p<0.01) and more experience (\u03b2 =0.007, p<0.01), being married (\u03b2 =0.033, p<0.01), employed in in private business (\u03b2 =0.120, p<0.01), work full-year (\u03b2 =0.284, p<0.01) and full-week (\u03b2 =0.901, p<0.01) have a significantly higher salary than those who do not have these features. On average, 2006 (\u03b2 =-0.039, p<0.01) and 2010 (\u03b2 =-0.091, p<0.01) cohorts of engineering graduates have the lowest pay. After controlling for other characteristics, female engineering graduates earn slightly less than men (\u03b2 =-0.026, p=0.02), which is the smallest difference in salaries between male and female STEM graduates, even though women are largely underrepresented in this field. Again, no significant racial differences are identified. At the institutional level, college size is positively related to engineering graduates' salary (\u03b2 =0.001, p=0.02). Higher percentage of Hispanic student population has a negative relationship with job earnings (\u03b2 =-0.162, p<0.01). The salary outcome of engineering graduates is impacted by many geographical factors. Specifically, racial or ethnic diversity (\u03b2 =-0.206, p<0.01), proximity to STEM clusters (\u03b2 =-0.011, p<0.01) and unemployment (\u03b2 =-0.017, p<0.01) in the regional labor market are negatively related to engineering graduates' earnings. Share of STEM workers, on the contrary, has a positive impact (\u03b2 =2.181, p<0.01). These results are similar to the general model with exception of proximity index, which has a positive effect on earning for all graduates. However, it is unsurprising, since highly specialized labor, like certain engineers, often enjoy a wage premium in more remote areas. f. Health science At the individual level, higher GPA (\u03b2 =0.057, p<0.01), more working experience (\u03b2 =0.006, p<0.01), older age (\u03b2 =0.028, p<0.01), working full-year (\u03b2 =0.282, p<0.01) and full-week (\u03b2 =0.478, p<0.01) are positively associated with higher salary. Different from all other majors, after controlling for other characteristics, gender is not a significant factor in predicting job earnings. In fact, health science is the only major where women earn statistically equal salary with men (\u03b2 =-0.050, p=0.146). This was possibly due to high concentration of women in this particular discipline, as well as a robust demand for health professionals. As shown earlier, health science is one of the most common majors among women (the other common majors are social and life sciences). Nursing and other health related professions are commonly perceived as more feminine and there was some evidence that men experienced discrimination in such occupations (Kouta and Kaite, 2011). There are significant racial differences. Despite that Blacks are the most likely to major in health sciences than any other group, they are more likely to earn less than their White counterparts (\u03b2 =-0.156, p=0.02). The literature suggested that Black nurses are being discriminated against when considered for promotion (Barbee, 1993), which may contribute to such discrepancy in earnings. At the institutional level, college size (\u03b2 =0.001, p=0.05) and acceptance rate (\u03b2 =0.311, p=0.05) are positively associated with engineering graduates' pay. As for location, there is positive association with STEM specialization (\u03b2 =2.863, p=0.05) and area population (\u03b2 =0.041, p=0.05), at alpha level 0.10. This finding contradicts the established notion about nurses having higher salaries in remote areas."}, {"section_title": "g.

As expected, math graduates with higher GPA (\u03b2 =0.062, p<0.01), more experience (\u03b2 =0.011, p<0.01), working full-year (\u03b2 =0.216, p<0.01) and full-time (\u03b2 =0.992, p<0.01) are more likely to earn more.

But, a higher rate of unemployment has a negative impact (\u03b2 =-0.06, p<0.01)."}, {"section_title": "h. Summary", "text": "Women are more likely to earn less across all STEM majors, except health sciences. Moreover, the gender pay gap is the widest for within women-dominated and lowest-paid majorslife and social sciences. Generally, race has little effect on salary. However, Black graduates in computer, health and mathematical science majors tend to earn less than their White counterparts. Family factors impact salaries for only a few majors. Married graduates with degrees in physical, social sciences and engineering sciences earn more than their single counterparts, while having children negatively affects salaries for physical major graduates. In most cases, age does not matter, with exception of social and physical sciences. Family educational background does not have any effect on graduates' pay. Across all the majors except for life sciences, higher GPA is positively associated with post-graduation earnings. Similarly, more working experience is a significant predictor for higher salaries, regardless of specific STEM majors. Only life, math and engineering sciences tend to have a greater pay if they moved to another state after graduation. All STEM majors are more likely to have a greater pay in states with higher cost of living. Computer and engineering science majors earn more if employed in private businesses, as opposite to government institutions. All majors except computer, health and math sciences, experience pay cut during recession in the end of the decade. In general, graduates from larger universities fare better in terms of salary, except physical, social and mathematical science majors for whom size of the institution does not make significant differences. College racial diversity is only negatively associated with computer science graduates' pay. Interestingly, school specialization in STEM positively affects only computer scientists, while other majors are not likely to benefit from this factor. Graduates with degrees in social and health sciences who graduate from more selective colleges are more likely to have higher pay. However, for other majors, college prestige does not have any significant influence. Overall, compared to individual personal characteristics and location factors, higher education institutional features are relatively not significant factors to predict STEM graduate job earnings when disaggregated results are examined. At the college location, the population size has no significant relationship with earning of every STEM major after controlling for other characteristics. Higher unemployment has a negative relationship with computer, social, engineering and math science graduates' pay. Similarly, racial diversity is negatively associated with salaries for life and engineering science graduates. Engineering and health science graduates benefit from the concentration of STEM workforce at places where the universities are located. Proximity to areas with STEM workforce concentration benefits the salaries of social, health and mathematical science graduates. However, this factor affected engineering graduates in the opposite way. Furthermore, share of manufacturing industry has little effect on graduates' pay, with exception of math majors. The results of these models are presented in Table 12.    "}, {"section_title": "c. Unemployment", "text": "Unlike salary and underemployment outcomes, unemployment is higher for STEM graduates in the first and last cohorts. In both cohorts, the unemployed disproportionally graduate from colleges in the Midwest, Louisiana and Mississippi regions; however, during the recession, many college areas on the East Coast are also among those with a higher number of unemployed graduates. Although unemployment varies by major and cohort, more men than women are unemployed during the study period. The distribution of unemployed graduates across majors and cohorts follows the distribution patterns of the lower-paid individuals. For example, unemployment is the most prevalent among social and life science graduates, with women being more likely to be unemployed in life sciences and men being more likely to be jobless in social sciences. Both men and women with health degrees are the least likely to be unemployed, which again mirrors the distribution of salaries. Overall, graduates in highly-paid fields (e.g., heath and engineering) that often have shortage of workers are the most immune to unemployment, regardless of gender. Expectedly, there are more unemployed of both genders in the last cohort, than in the previous three cohorts. For racial differences, unemployment is much less prevalent among Whites than any other group. Moreover, for Whites, differences in unemployment among sub-disciplines and cohorts are considerably smaller than for other groups. In addition, Asian graduates, although the highest paid group, have the highest unemployment rate among all the racial groups. Hispanic graduates are the second least likely to be unemployed and have exceptionally low unemployment in health sector. Cohort-wise, unemployment has grown almost in every field for all groups but for Blacks who enjoyed lower unemployment rates in the majority of the fields.  (Jones & Jackson, 1990). Graduates with health and engineering degrees have the highest pay in this sample. On average, the last three cohorts of STEM graduates earn significantly less than the first one. At the university level, in line with previous research, college size, STEM specialization and selectivity are all positively related to salary (Pascarella & Terenzini, 2005). Concentration of Black students, on the other hand, has the opposite effect, which also supports the prior findings on labor market experiences among HBCU graduates (Fitzgerald, 2000). Among the college locations, racial diversity and unemployment rate at the college area are negatively related to earnings. In contrast, the share of STEM workforce and proximity to other areas that employ larger numbers of STEM employees has an overwhelmingly positive impact on salary. The gender and racial disparities in job earnings significantly vary across STEM subdisciplines. For instance, female graduates have a significant earnings disadvantage compared to males with any STEM degree, except health sciences. Such results are not surprising, considering the well documented gender inequalities in STEM labor market. Blacks earn less only in computer, physical and mathematical science fields. Hispanics have a disadvantage only in computer science. Demographic factors (e.g., age and marital status) are positively associated with salaries of only physical, social and engineering graduates. However, months that passed since graduation have a positive effect on pay regardless of major. This suggests that time spent in labor force either working or looking for job, increases one's chances of having higher salary. Another factor that positively affects earnings of all STEM graduates, but for life science majors, is college GPA. Women are more likely to be underemployed than men. Black graduates generally have a higher chance of being underemployed than white. Foreign born status is also associated with higher likelihood of working part-time. Family factors have little influence on underemployment, except for father's education. That is, the graduates whose father has a college degree are significantly less likely to be underemployed. Overwhelmingly, higher grades are likely to lead to a full-time job. Graduates with more experience, as measured by time since graduation, are predominantly employed full-time. When contr3olled for all other variables, graduates in the two last cohorts are significantly more likely to work part-time. "}, {"section_title": "How does geography matter?", "text": "In the literature of college choice, where the location of college is concerned, studies have mainly focused on the college's proximity to home, preference for certain landscape and lifestyle, in-state or out-of-state location, in addition to institutional factors such as college rankings, prestige, tuition etc. At the same time, prior research on post-graduation labor market outcomes has solely focused on human capital and higher education institutional characteristics, with little attention to the role of college location and its characteristics. Results from this study suggests that the location of colleges does not only matter when choosing college, but also has profound impacts when they go to the job markets after graduation. Labor force mobility has declined considerably over the past decades. This is largely attributed to various factors that prevent people from moving. For example, low housing supply in areas with many job opportunities is likely to drive prices up and increase the entry barrier (Schleicher, 2016). Therefore, for graduates who are just starting their careers and often have limited professional networks and spatial mobility, and fewer resources including both financial and social capital, which institution and which location that they graduated from can directly interfere their experiences of seeking and starting full time work. The results of this study indicate that location and its characteristics have a substantial effect on all the three dimensions of career outcomes explored in this study. Location attributes help to explain 26 percent of variance between colleges for salary outcome. Moreover, for underemployment and unemployment outcomes, geographical factors exceed the predicting power of institutional level variables. This suggests that the large part of between-college differences in graduate's labor market outcomes is attributed not just to academic settings, but to higher education institutions' location and associated conditions. Among geographic factors, local economic characteristics have the most significant influences on graduates' early careers. Colleges located in the areas that employ large numbers of STEM workers produce higher paid and fully-employed graduates, so as colleges located closer to STEM employment clusters. On the other hand, higher unemployment rate in places where colleges are located have a damaging effect on the employment opportunities and job earnings. These impacts from the college geographic locations are consistent with Glaeser et al. (1992) concept of localization effect. According to their perspective, concentration of one industry in an area creates a favorable environment for knowledge creation and diffusion. They argue that such industry clustering leads to increased competition that aids economic and innovative progress. Additionally, Freedman (2008), who studied localization of software publishing industry, also finds that salaries are higher in clusters, so as the likelihood of finding a job. There are also other possible explanations for the impacts of STEM employment concentration on graduates' early careers. First, colleges located in smaller towns produce more specialized labor than the local economy can absorb. Manning and Petrongolo (2011) find that interest in jobs decays with distance. Therefore, the excess supply of STEM graduates may drive unemployment and underemployment up and consequently decrease salaries. Second, graduates who attended colleges in places that specialize in STEM industries and the places with healthier local economies have more opportunities to get an internship or other professional training during college. These experiences add values to their competitiveness in the labor market after graduation. Indeed, prior literature suggests that students of urban colleges are most likely to have a professional part-time job (Price et al., 2003) and having this experience on a resume favorably impacts their employment after college (Sagen et al., 2000). Third, the relationships between institutions and communities surrounding them are found to be very important for both student and employers. For instance, Rosenbaum (1984) argues that close partnership between colleges and employers lead to better job placement of graduates of such colleges, as well as more streamlined recruitment for companies. He also notes that such relationships usually occur locally. Graduates from institutions that are connected to local employers are preferred not just during recruitment efforts, but also in the future when these employees are being considered for promotion. A lot has changed in job search and recruitment strategies since Rosenbaum wrote his study. The Internet and other technologies have widened the access to job opportunities for graduates and, at the same time, given the companies new ways to look for talent across the world. Nevertheless, data from company profiles on a job networking site, e.g., LinkedIn, confirm Rosenbaum's arguments. For example, many large technology corporations (i.e. Apple, Microsoft, Oracle etc.) that hire a lot of STEM talent, did most of their recruitment locally, from institutions with various selectivity and prestige (Pearlstein, 2014). Fourth, there may be an indirect influence of college location on graduate's careers. For instance, some studies suggest that colleges in remote locations have staffing difficulties and high turnover of instructional and academic support staff (citations). This can negatively impact students' learning process, social network building, and, in turn, post-graduation outcomes. Finally, labor force mobility is at the historically low level right now, as only 30 percent of graduates in the national sample crossed the state-line after graduation (Moretti, 2012). It is safe to assume that many graduates stay at or near areas where they attended college after graduation, where they attempt to secure employment. Therefore, the spatial inflexibility is likely to hinder graduates' early career in areas with weak economy and scarce opportunities in STEM employment."}, {"section_title": "Significance and Implications", "text": "This study offers several contributions to the literature on labor force development, higher education, and regional development in the United States. This study integrates a spatial component into an intersectional framework to better understand the spatial dimensions of labor market outcomes for the recent college graduates. This spatial approach to study post-graduation early employment is largely overlooked, as place is rarely being accounted as a separate factor in higher education's impacts on students."}, {"section_title": "a. Significance", "text": "Research on higher education. Various resources provide extensive information on colleges for prospective students and their parents. It covers almost every aspect of what different institutions have to offer; however, data on job placements and other postgraduation indicators are often absent. Recently, the federal government started a program that ranks universities by early labor market outcomes of its graduates (Bidwell, 2015, June 24). This study contributes to existing body of research on higher education through examination of the labor market experiences of recent college graduates, with a focus on location where they obtained higher education degrees. To my knowledge, this is the first study that factors in socio-economic characteristics of college location to explain the post-graduation career-experiences. The results of this study suggest that previous models without considering the role of college location have overestimated the role of individual and institutional predictors by more than 20 percent. For instance, most of prior studies agreed on the importance of student's GPA and college selectivity for future earnings. These results indicate that their explanatory power decreases significantly when geographical predictors are introduced. These factors are still significant in the current study; however, their explanatory power reduces when geographical predictors are included. Along the same lines, the negative impacts of recent recession are overestimated by almost 36 percent in models without controlling for college location. This confirms prior findings on importance of geographic controls when estimating returns to education. (Black et al., 2009). Labor market studies. Previous studies have highlighted human capital and social capital at the individual level and multiple factors at the higher education institutional level; however, they have not sufficiently examined the college location factors. For STEM in particular, previous research has highlighted the importance of STEM education in labor market outcomes, it has not simultaneously assessed the multiscalar factors, nor has it examined the sub-disciplines within the STEM from a comparative perspective. The current study provides a detailed, timely, comparative study to simultaneously examine the multi-dimensional and multi-scaled factors that impact STEM graduate early career experiences and particularly highlighted the geographic location of their colleges that is seldom examined in existing literature. In addition to salary, two other dimensions of labor market experiences are explored in this study, underemployment and unemployment. Both unemployment (Abel et al., 2014) and underemployment (Scurry & Blenkinsopp, 2011) among recent college graduates received a popular attention, both in public media and academia, during last economic recession. In both cases, general economic conditions are blamed for worsening graduates' career outcomes. Both the current study and prior research identified many factors that contribute to inadequate employment, most notably is the college major (Carnevale, Cheah, & Strohl, 2013). Different from earlier studies, however, results from the current research suggest that, location-wise, unemployment and underemployment are the most prevalent among graduates from areas with higher presence of manufacturing industries, predominantly located in the rust belt. On the other hand, higher concentration of STEM employment, focused mainly in the coastal areas, leads to decreased underemployment. This study also contributes to the scholarship on racial and gender disparities in the labor markets. For instance, the results show that gender pay gap is contingent on local industry specialization. Similarly, pay gaps between underrepresented minorities and Whites are reduced in places with higher STEM employment presence. Considering that such pay gaps are not uniform across the country, these findings are important for further understanding the spatial differences in earnings and other career outcomes. Additionally, the results of this study confirm prior findings on gender differences in unemployment during the latest recession. For example, similar to Sahin, Song, and Hobijn (2010), the current study finds that women have a much lesser disadvantage in terms of employment during and after the 2007 recession. However, after recession, women's earnings were negatively affected to the lesser extent than men's. Sahin et al. (2010) argue that this disparity is likely due to the more profound adverse influence of the recession on maledominated fields. Results from this study do not support this conclusion, as women fared better in terms of earnings reduction, in every field including those dominated by men. Methodology. Another novelty of this project lies in its methodology and usage of the privileged restrictive data. The restrictive dataset is largely underutilized and probably this is the first time to be used for this type of analysis. First, the NSRCG datasets have the largest number of cases (suitable for this study) compared to similar programs, like Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which is very important when conducting spatial analysis. Second, it provides an extensive variety of parameters pertaining to both graduates and their educational history. Finally, microdata with geographic identification are extremely rare, not to mention a temporal dimension. Besides NSRCG, this study integrates other datasets, such as IPEDS, OES and US Census data, to supplement the analysis with relevant variables. Further, a two-level hierarchical modeling is employed in this study to incorporate individual, institutional, and locational (and regional) factors. This approach perfectly suits the nested nature of the data and allows the comparison of within and between college-location effects. The current study provides a unique and multidimensional analyses of early career experiences of college graduates. Such an innovative methodological design provides a useful example for labor market research, higher education studies, and regional sciences."}, {"section_title": "b. Policy implications", "text": "Higher education. The results of the research have significant policy implications. Science and technology are the main drivers of modern economies across the world. A highly skilled and educated labor force is a key for development in these fields. Omnipresent shortages of such workers results in competition for talent at every levelregional, national and international. Therefore, it is critical to keep the investment in programs promoting the underrepresented populations in STEM education and careers. It not only benefits the society as a whole, but also reduces pay disparities across gender and race to achieve equitable growth. As shown by this study, women and racial minorities have already achieved pay parities in certain STEM fields. Collaborating on STEM initiatives with local communities and pre-K-12 schools could help to increase participation and reduce barriers related to educational preparation for the underrepresented groups. Because significant differences in graduates' outcomes between higher education institutions are attributed to their locations, organizations that attempt to rank schools based on such outcomes have to account for differences in labor market conditions among various college locations. This is especially important when comparing the early career outcomes, as recent graduates are likely to stay in a college area for some time after graduation. Additionally, early career premiums related to area STEM concentration may not necessarily lead to mid-career advantages 10 or 20 years after graduation. Therefore, using early labor market outcomes as a main indicator of college quality, disregarding location and graduates' mid-career experiences, may be unfair to wellperforming colleges in disadvantaged geographic locations and vice versa. Labor market and regional development. As much as technology is a very global phenomenon, it is also localized and concentrated in a few major hubs across the US and the rest of the world. These technology hubs generally also have stronger economies, higher average wages, and better standard of living. Moreover, these benefits can be transferred to workers in other industries and occupations in the same locations (Moretti, 2012). Prior studies (Anselin, Varga, & Acs, 1997;Youtie & Shapira, 2008) find that universities play crucial part in regional development of research and innovative sectors. Knowledge spillovers created by higher education institutions facilitate growth in high-technology industries. Indeed, universities have played major roles in the early establishment of many technology companies. The famous example is Alphabet (aka Google) that was born out of Stanford and Facebook was launched in Harvard. It suggests that local STEM talent development helps to ignite regional technology sector; however, Fallah et al. (2013) find no evidence of such effects, arguing that universities only help to create human capital, rather than knowledge spillovers. The results of this study indicate a highly unequal success in landing a job, having full-time employment or competitive salary between areas with practically no STEM presence and major STEM hubs. It confirms that simply producing locally un-demanded STEM talent causes diminished early labor market advanteges for such graduates. Therefore, the integration between higher education and regional development is crucial to fully utilize human capital and promote high-tech, high-growth industry as well. Technology startups may provide training and employment opportunities for recent STEM graduates. Therefore, college administrators, local authorities and higher education policy makers are recommended to invest in college-affiliated innovation parks and incubators to enable more efficient integration of research into industry, facilitate economic growth and create jobs for graduates and local community at large. Diversity initiatives targeted at STEM education should account for specifics of local labor markets that graduates enter after they finish college. For example, Figure 31 illustrates how much the predicted salary of a hypothetical STEM college graduate changes depending on college selectivity and employment concentration in a college location. This hypothetical graduate is assumed to be Black female with other conditions set at the mean of the national sample across cohorts. As shown here, the earnings vary dramatically depending on college quality and location. Although graduates from more selective colleges receive a salary premium regardless of area STEM concentration, the magnitude of pay gap between graduates from very selective to non-selective colleges increases significantly in STEM employment clusters. The prediction suggests that, for underrepresented minorities, college area economy structure is extremely important in determining their early career outcomes. This information could be useful for prospective STEM students and their parents in deciding where to go to college. Though attending a prestige college provides earning benefits after graduation, in many cases graduating from a less selective (and often more affordable) school located in a STEM hub may lead to similar or even better early labor market experiences. This study has a few limitations. (1) There is no available control for graduates' residence at the time the survey was taken. The omitted factors that pertain to location of residence may help to further differentiate the effects of where individuals go to college and where they are being employed. Moreover, exclusion of such controls may have inflated the importance of college area controls included in this study. Thus, further research needs to employ other datasets that have indicators pertaining to the current area of residence (on a smaller scale) and characteristics related to them. In addition, as this study finds post-graduation migration has a positive influence on graduate's early careers, it is still unknown how this happens. Especially, the current data do not allow examining whether it is people seek good jobs and, then, migrate; or people migrate first and then find good jobs; or simultaneously. This simultaneity suggests that more research on labor-force migration is required to understand the relationship between college location economic conditions and out-migration of graduates. Overall, there is no information at what point and how local STEM specialization factors into graduates' academic or postgraduate career. Future research with qualitative case studies could be useful in this aspect. (2) When analyzing the disaggregated outcomes by major, disciplines are aggregated into larg common groups. Such aggregation may absorb differences within these major groups. For instance, civil engineers may have higher unemployment rate than any other engineers during the recent recession. Similarly, prior research suggests that economists earn significantly more than any other social science graduates. Future studies need to concentrate on differences within these larger groups of disciplines, to see whether there are significant differences in outcomes between sub-disciplines. (3) The data does not indicate whether graduates ever transferred between schools. This uncertainty may complicate the assessment of both institutional and geographical effects in cases when a graduate attended more than one college in different locations. Unfortunately, such distinctions are out of scope of this study. (4) There are some limitations concerning methodology used in this study. Considering that this study is focused on three distinct blocks of predictorsindividual, institutional and locationa three-level HLM would be a better fit for this study. In the current study, there are only a few areas that include more than one university and the sample size is insufficient to set up a three-level framework. Future research could be possible to explore the geographical impacts on labor market experiences with a larger sample size of universities across locations. Additionally, utilizing ordinal regression may be useful in research of employment status of graduates, where unemployment, underemployment and full-time employment indicators exist on an ordinal scale. In addition to estimating the strength of the effect that predictors have on the employment status, ordinal regression helps to predict how much change in independent variable leads to change in employment situation (i.e. underemployed to fully employed). Many STEM graduates work in occupations outside their fields of study (Hyer, 2014). Controlling for occupational mismatch may be useful in assessing to what extent working in a job unrelated to college major influences earnings and employment opportunities. As online education is becoming more common, taking into account the mode of education (online vs. face-to-face) is crucial for accessing geographic effects. This is important especially because graduate of online colleges may have never been to a place where school (headquarter) is located. Finally, this study used four cohorts to explore temporal trends. Since each cohort combined graduates from multiple years, variation in outcomes from year to year may be more accurate than differences between cohorts. "}]
