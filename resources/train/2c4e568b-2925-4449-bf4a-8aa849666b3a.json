The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, [1] ), Human Connectome Project (HCP, [2] ), NKI-Rockland Sample [3] , and others provide researchers with unprecedented access to massive amounts of shared neuroimaging data. While tools and methods are available to support the visualization [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , data management [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] and analysis [14] [15] [16] [17] of shared or privately collected neuroimaging data, these tools use different approaches to define, segment, and label neuroanatomical structures.\nOne important component of research in this domain involves the development of digital brain atlases, which provide both a template brain and neuroanatomical labels in a standard coordinate system. Imaging data from individual participants are aligned to the template and brain region labels are propagated over to provide context to observed features in the data (e.g., location of activation foci). Atlases (i.e., the brain template and anatomical label pair) can be based on manual or automatically labeled brain regions that are derived using volume-based or surface-based methods. Each brain atlas develops, adopts, or refines an anatomical labeling protocol [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . As a result, the labeling protocols used to define the boundaries of neuroanatomical regions can vary widely across brain atlases, so collections of anatomical entities from different labeling schemes do not always stand in a relation that allows a one-to-one mapping. Thus, data annotated with labels from different atlases are difficult to compare based on labels alone.\nPrevious efforts to reconcile terminologies in neuroimaging, referred to as the brain atlas concordance problem, have taken both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Taking a quantitative, bipartite graph approach, Bohland et al. demonstrated that different brain atlas labeling schemes lack a high degree of spatial concordance when comparing labels that seemingly refer to the same anatomical structure [25] . Qualitative approaches, such as our own, organize anatomical labels through synonymy, relations, and class hierarchies that provide practical utility (e.g., information retrieval and data integration) without resolving fine-grained spatial discrepancies. These approaches are complementary and both will be necessary in identifying a satisfactory solution to the brain atlas concordance problem.\nTo improve our symbolic model of the brain atlas concordance problem the labeling protocols from each brain atlas need to be made explicit. However, the labeling protocols that define anatomical structure boundaries in brain atlases are generally published in natural language (i.e., as a manuscript) and lack the term definitions and relationships provided by a machine-readable ontology framework. Neuroimaging data and information encoded by these terms cannot be accurately interpreted, compared, correlated and applied across different studies. A similar standardization issue faces the development of white matter connectivity atlases [26, 27] , in which our understanding of human brain connectivity is rapidly evolving. As new white matter analysis methods and labeling protocols are developed, a proliferation of terms to label newly identified structures in white matter atlases will likely occur.\nA robust semantic framework is needed to explicitly represent the anatomical labels from different atlases using relationships that describe anatomical structure. Our goal is to provide such a framework for human neuroimaging that will facilitate the integration and harmonization of data registered to standard coordinate systems with labels for structures in human brain atlases."}, {"section_title": "Approaches to labeling brain structures", "text": "We selected brain atlases that are widely used in the human brain mapping community and harmonized the terms used in each atlas' labeling scheme with the anatomical structures modeled in the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) Ontology.

NIFSTD is not a brain labeling protocol nor is it tied to a particular spatial arrangement of brain regions, but is a collection of brain region labels and inter-relationships. Neurolex also represents a general mammalian hierarchy of brain parts, with each structure assigned a taxon rank at which it is generally considered to hold, whereas other ontologies, like the FMA, are more species specific. NIFSTD is a formal ontology constructed through the import of community ontologies with specific extensions for neuroscience, covering the major domains of neuroscience [32, 33] . For community contributions, NIF maintains the Neurolex lexicon, where each entity within the ontology is exposed as a wiki page (http://neurolex.org), built using the Semantic Media Wiki Platform. Entities migrate from Neurolex into the more formal NIFSTD ontologies [33] .\nAn important feature of the project is to clearly and explicitly define all of the terms that are used to describe data (e.g., anatomical terms, techniques, organism names). The NIF gross anatomy module was largely based on the NeuroNames hierarchy [34] [35] [36] , re-coded in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), but has been extensively modified through contributions to Neurolex.

It is based on a unifying theory that explicitly defines anatomy and its content from the structural point of view. In particular, it provides a framework that can incorporate and accommodate all entities under the purview of the anatomy domain.\nThe FMA is implemented as a computable information artifact and is primarily intended for developers of terminologies and application ontologies [38] in clinical medicine and biomedical research that require anatomical knowledge. Ontologists primarily value its merits because it is both broader and more fine-grained than extant anatomy texts or terminologies. For example, the FMA models both abstract, high-level concepts and leaflevel, fine grained concepts such as \"Material anatomical entity\" and \"Brodmann area 1 of left postcentral gyrus\", respectively. This approach is not entirely consistent with the tradition-based representation of anatomy that clinical practitioners and biomedical researchers are taught in their training. Therefore, the benefits the FMA offers to end users are best realized through derived application ontologies [38, 39] and biomedical software that utilize anatomical knowledge.\nThe principled framework provided by the FMA is flexible enough to capture the intended semantics of terminologies developed for more specific purposes. For example, application ontologies derived from the FMA (e.g., RadLex [40, 41] ) can be used to reconcile prevalent views of anatomy (e.g., radiologists or anatomy teachers) with an ontological representation of biological structure. Thus, knowledge extracted from the FMA can be abstracted to a level that is familiar to individuals in a given domain. The FMA can also incorporate annotations on anatomical entities that provide a mapping to external knowledge sources (e.g., ontologies or brain atlas terms), as well as a means to correlate between mapped terms. A central goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the FMA can be used to harmonize the growing number of neuroscience terminologies and provide a framework and use cases for developing useful biomedical applications."}, {"section_title": "Construction and content", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Authoring environment", "text": "The FMA information artifact is implemented in Frames using Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, an authoring and editing environment created by members of the Stanford Biomedical Informatics Group [42] .

OWL is now the standard language for describing ontologies on the Web, and there are ongoing efforts to translate the FMA into OWL. Previous attempts succeeded in creating a version of the FMA in OWL Full [44] , and more recently a subset of the FMA was converted into OWL 2 [45] . The migration of the entire FMA into OWL 2 would greatly facilitate integration and interoperability with external ontologies and Semantic Web-related technologies.

Our goal was to augment the FMA with the spatio-structural properties needed to represent different brain labeling schemes, while maintaining a single coherent framework. By accommodating different views within the same framework, we can use the enhanced FMA properties to correlate disparate brain labeling schemes.

This means that there may not be a direct or one-to-one correspondence between the terms from different atlases or terminologies.\nHowever, by mapping these terms to the FMA, the ontological structure of the FMA explicitly defines what entities are represented by the terms and how they correlate with one another according to the properties and spatiostructural relationships established for them in the FMA. In this section we provide a technical overview of how the FMA was enhanced to accommodate and correlate different brain labeling protocols.\nTo provide a mapping between different terminologies we used Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to introduce property slots (e.g., source names and unique identifiers) that link FMA classes to corresponding annotation terms (Figure 1 ). The labels used in each labeling scheme were manually correlated with a corresponding FMA term.

The mappings were then manually incorporated into the FMA by adding specific NeuroLex identifiers to the newly defined NeuroLex_ID property. "}, {"section_title": "Mapping Talairach", "text": "Talairach Daemon annotations explicitly represent five levels of partonomy where the level of granularity for each neuroanatomical entity is denoted by a period. For example, the Talairach label Right Cerebrum. Frontal Lobe.Superior Frontal Gyrus.Gray Matter.Brodmann area 6 indicates a set of coordinates located on Right Brodmann area 6, on the Right superior frontal gyrus of the Right frontal lobe in the Right cerebral hemisphere. The actual neuroanatomical entity being represented here is \"Brodmann area 6 of right superior frontal gyrus\", which exists in the FMA and is therefore directly mapped to the corresponding Talairach term.\nWhere appropriate and necessary in the ontology, we added new classes, properties and relations to complete the mappings between FMA classes and the different annotation terms [46, 47] . This is particularly true for accommodating and reconciling different labeling schemes for the cerebral cortex. For example, the Talairach term Right Cerebrum.Frontal Lobe.Superior Frontal Gyrus.Gray Matter.Brodmann area 6 refers to an area in the gray matter of the right superior frontal gyrus that overlaps with Brodmann area 6. Whereas the gyrus is subdivided into regions based on topographical surface landmarks, Brodmann areas are regions defined on the basis of the underlying cytoarchitecture or cellular and laminar organization.\nAlthough both types of regional partitions are in the FMA, neither Brodmann area 6 nor the gray matter of the right superior frontal gyrus had been partitioned to account for the overlap. We therefore reconciled both morphological and cytoarchitectural schemes into the FMA ontology with the following modeling pattern.\nFirst, we created a class for the Gray matter of the superior frontal gyrus, which overlaps with (i.e., has_regional_part) Brodmann areas 6, 8, 9, 10 and 11 ( Figure 2) . Second, we created a class for Brodmann area 6 and model overlaps with the gray matter of the precentral, the superior frontal, the middle frontal, the inferior frontal and the medial frontal using has_regional_part relations (Figure 3) .\nGoing back to our Talairach example above, we mapped it to the new FMA class called Brodmann area 6 of right superior frontal gyrus which is_a Segment of Brodmann area 6 and a regional_-part_of both Right Brodmann area 6 and Gray matter of right superior frontal gyrus (Figure 4) . And following the transitive part_of relation of Brodmann area 6 of right superior frontal gyrus up the FMA part hierarchy reveals that all the granularity levels implicitly encoded in the Talairach label are explicitly represented in the part hierarchy of the FMA (Figure 5 ).

Many of the terms used in DK (e.g. ctx-rh-inferiortemporal) and AAL (e.g. Temporal_Inferior_Right) are customized and specific only to their respective projects. Therefore, some semantic interpretation is required to parse the meaning and interoperate with other atlas terminologies. In the FMA we provide a semantic framework that explicitly declares the intended meanings of the terms used.\nWe identified anatomical entities (i.e., classes) in the FMA that most closely correspond to a given brain atlas label. We then elaborated on the properties associated with each FMA class to provide additional relationships that capture information necessary to correlate with the labels from other brain atlases and NeuroLex (e.g., identifiers, preferred names, etc.). From the above examples, ctx-rh-superiorfrontal from DK is mapped to the FMA class Gray matter of right superior frontal gyrus and Frontal_superior_right from AAL to FMA class Right superior frontal gyrus.\nNote that the structural entities represented by the different terms are at various levels of granularity, with Talairach, FreeSurfer and AAL at the levels of Brodmann area, gray matter of cortex, and gyrus, respectively. Furthermore a laterality attribute is specified for all three representations as opposed to NeuroLex, which does not require left/right attributes. However the FMA has the framework to correlate all the entities based on their ontological definitions and relationships as shown in Figure 6 . In this example, the Talairach term is mapped to the FMA class Brodmann area 6 of right superior frontal gyrus, a part_of Gray matter of right superior frontal gyrus, the FMA class referenced by DK, which in turn is a part_of the AAL mapped entity Right superior frontal gyrus.

A good example addressed by this approach relates to the common practice of using the same term to represent both the entire tract and its segments, as in the case of the Corticospinal tract. In cases where only a very specific segment of the tract is to be identified, the indiscriminate use of a nonexclusive term for its annotation can lead to errors and inconsistencies, especially when machine-processing is involved. This can be avoided by properly declaring the parts of a structure with unique terms assigned to each part and only using the structure specific term for annotation.

Connectivity is at the subcellular level between the pre-synaptic membrane of a neurite of a neuron with a post-synaptic membrane of a neurite or soma of another neuron or with a region of a muscle fiber or a gland cell. White matter structures at the nerve or tract-level (i.e., collection of axons) projects_to and projects_from any region of the neuraxis (i.e., a term referring to both brain and spinal cord). For example, the Dorsal segment of superior longitudinal fasciculus (i.e., SLF I) projects_from Brodmann area 6 of superior frontal gyrus and projects_to Brodmann area 5 of superior parietal lobule. Finally, we created ternary relationship types that model neural connectivity between any two regions of the neuroaxis connected by white matter. Gray matter structures receives_input_from and sends_output_to other gray matter structures, as shown in Figure 8 for Putamen.\nThe connectivity relationships we propose capture the essential levels needed to express how information is communicated throughout the brain. However, several other efforts are working on the issue of neural connectivity relations.
