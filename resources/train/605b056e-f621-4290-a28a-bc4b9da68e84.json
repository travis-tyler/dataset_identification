[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Repeated failures in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have raised a strong interest for the prodromal phase of the disease. A better understanding of the brain alterations during this early phase is crucial to diagnose patients sooner, to estimate an accurate disease stage, and to give a reliable prognosis. According to recent evidence, structural alterations in the brain are likely to be sensitive markers of the disease progression. Neuronal loss translates in specific spatiotemporal patterns of cortical atrophy, starting in the enthorinal cortex and spreading over other cortical regions according to specific propagation pathways. We developed a digital model of the cortical atrophy in the left hemisphere from prodromal to diseased phases, which is built on the temporal alignment and combination of several short-term observation data to reconstruct the long-term history of the disease. The model not only provides a description of the spatiotemporal patterns of cortical atrophy at the group level but also shows the variability of these patterns at the individual level in terms of difference in propagation pathways, speed of propagation, and age at propagation onset. Longitudinal MRI datasets of patients with mild cognitive impairments who converted to AD are used to reconstruct the cortical atrophy propagation across all disease stages. Each observation is considered as a signal spatially distributed on a network, such as the cortical mesh, each cortex location being associated to a node. We consider how the temporal profile of the signal varies across the network nodes. We introduce a statistical mixed-effect model to describe the evolution of the cortex alterations. To ensure a spatiotemporal smooth propagation of the alterations, we introduce a constrain on the propagation signal in the model such that neighboring nodes have similar profiles of the signal changes. Our generative model enables the reconstruction of personalized patterns of the neurodegenerative spread, providing a way to estimate disease progression stages and predict the age at which the disease will be diagnosed. The model shows that, for instance, APOE carriers have a significantly higher pace of cortical atrophy but not earlier atrophy onset."}, {"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Neuroimaging studies have shown an alteration of the brain structure during the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (1, 2) . These lesions appear during the prodromal phase of the disease (3) (4) (5) whose observation have been limited due to the absence of clinical symptoms and diagnosis. The importance of the structural changes before the clinical symptoms led to hypothetical models (6) , which have been later refined thanks to the gathering of multiple scientific evidences. These modifications took the form of a structural change of the brain in particular an important neuronal loss and an atrophy of the brain cortex (7, 8) . The study of the temporal evolution of the cerebral cortex reveals an atrophy of the gray matter (9) . This cortical atrophy presumably relates the traces of the progression of the lesions over the brain surface. A fine-scale modeling of the atrophy propagation is likely to give a wider understanding of the disease evolution, as the structural markers seems reliable to assess the conversion to the AD stage, potentially carrying subtle indicators of the disease progression in early phases.\nThe spatiotemporal propagation of these alterations encloses two entangled components. On the one hand, the spatial characterization of the lesions over the brain surface at each time, and, on the other hand, a temporal dynamic of these alterations that may differ from one region to another. Characterizing the proper dynamics of these lesions relies on the possibility to reconstruct the whole time-line of AD, at both a spatial and temporal level, out of short-term observations that are not temporally aligned. Another challenging aspect consists in the variability inherent to the individual patterns of atrophy that requires to consistently compare the subject-specific spreads of alterations. Accounting for the interindividual variability in term of lesion propagation should allow to reconstruct individual patterns of propagation, paving the way to possible personalized model of atrophy, that potentially informs on subject-specific age of conversion or disease stage.\nRecently, large datasets have opened the opportunity to investigate data-driven models that have refined and validated these hypotheses to some extend, in particular event-based models (10) (11) (12) that considers the propagation as a series of events, allowing to define a sequence of disease stages. They characterize the overall variability of the events ordering at a population level. However, these models are not well suited to relate for the temporal delays of the alterations at a population level, neither to determine individual cortical atrophy. Multimodal observations, including positron emission tomography (PET) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biomarkers, have been gathered within longitudinal databases, i.e., repeated observations of patients during significant periods of time. The underlying intention is to provide multiple individual snapshots of the disease-patients examined during short-term periods-in order to reconstruct the long-term history of the pathology (13, 14) at a group and individual level. Moreover, it offers the possibility to describe and interpret the observed data contrary to quantiles or percentiles that require arbitrary reference distributions. A challenging aspect of AD patient comparison is the fact that, even though AD is related to age, the latter is not a good proxy of the disease stage (15) (16) (17) leaving us without any easy way to align all the individual on the same time-line. In Ref. (18) , the authors introduced mixed-effect model that consider each individual trajectory as a variation of a mean scenario of evolution, with a time-warp function that is able to realign the subjects on the same time-line (19) . It allows to characterize a spatial and temporal variability of propagation in the sense that it defines a group-average trajectory of propagation with the possibility to reconstruct individual observations thanks to personalized parameters. Nevertheless (18) , constrain the model to parallel profiles of progression which does not hold when looking at signals that have various dynamics. Moreover, the model does not take into account the spatial correlations between the data whereas (17), which focus on spatiotemporal patterns of progression for images, exhibited that this led, in the case of a non-linear mixed-effects model, to poor estimations of the subject-specific parameters and individual trajectories.\nTo account for the spatial structure of the signal, networks have been introduced (20, 21) , representing the brain areas as the graph nodes. In this paper, the networks correspond to a graph representation of a signal spatially distributed, namely, the cortical thickness mapped on a mesh representation of the cortex.\nThe node values are the cortical thickness values over time on the related brain area. Extracting and projecting patients cortical thickness on the common mesh allows to compare their atrophy on the same atlas to exhibit similar patterns. As we expect the signal propagation to be spatially smooth with a similar temporal profile of change for neighbor nodes, we consider that a subset of the graph nodes act as control nodes. They define an evaluation function such that the signal at each node is an interpolation of the signal at the control nodes, enabling to smooth the high frequencies (22) . The proximity between nodes is defined by the distance matrix which informs on the distance between any pair. Moreover, the number of nodes of this vertex-based graph can be tuned based on the desired application, potentially the same as the resolution of the input data, e.g., a voxel for MRI or PET data.\nThe aim of this paper is to introduce a model of the cortical atrophy propagation during the long-term course of AD thanks to a graph representation of the neuroimaging data. This model is able to personalize the reconstruction of the propagation to individual longitudinal measurements, allowing to describe the stages of the disease, potentially in the future. The model is described as a general framework for any longitudinal data spatially distributed on a common graph and it is instantiated to exhibit the propagation of the cortical atrophy on the left hemisphere of the brain, across nearly 2000 regions, thanks to longitudinal observations of 154 mild cognitive impaired (MCI) patients that were later diagnosed with AD. While exhibiting an average pattern of propagation, this mixed-effects model allows to reconstruct individual observations through time."}, {"section_title": "MATERIALS AND METHODS", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Sketch of the Method", "text": "Prior to detail our method, we would like to sketch the key ideas and notations of our work to ease and guide the reading. First, we consider I patients; each patient i is observed J i times, his jth visit being at age t ij , and each observation led to an MRI scan as shown on the left hand side of Figure 1 . Segmentation of the cortical thickness, out of the neuroimaging observations, are mapped onto a mesh, as presented on the middle part of Figure 1 . The last step corresponds to a subsampling process that led to a graph G of K nodes, characterized by a distance matrix D. At each node, the individual observations define a time-series describing the evolution of the signal through time.\nIn a second time, we assume that, at each node k of the graph G, there exists a function t \u2192 \u03b3 k (t) that describes a characteristic evolution of the signal at this node, as shown on Figure 2 . The timeseries of individual i at node k derives from a continuous function \u03b7 ik (t), which is assumed to be a spatial and temporal variations of the representative trajectory \u03b3 k (t), illustrated on Figure 3 . The temporal variation corresponds to the time realignment of individual i on the common time-line. It adjusts the individual dynamics to a mean pace of evolution, thanks to personalized parameters \u03c4 i and \u03b1 i . \u03c4 i stands for the individual time-shift to the mean disease onset, allowing an early (\u03c4 i < 0) or delayed (\u03c4 i < 0) age at diagnosis. The parameter \u03b1 i integrates the patient-specific possibility to have a faster (\u03b1 i > 1) or slower (\u03b1 I < 1) pace of atrophy compared to the mean scenario of changes. On the other side, the spatial variation corresponds to the adjustment from the mean cortical thickness to individual data. It accounts, for instance, for the difference in size or in spatial thickness distribution at the same disease stage.\nWe consider that the characteristic signal \u03b3 k (t) at node k belongs to a family of curve, here the straight line curves, parametrized by the cortical thickness p k and the rate of atrophy v k . To account for the spatial structure of the signal and the large number of nodes, a subset of nodes, referred to as control nodes, is selected to control the interpolation of the cortical and atrophy values over all the nodes. The distribution of the control nodes depends on the size of the kernel bandwidth such that the kernels densities map almost uniformly the feature space. The model introduces population parameters, that allow to define a characteristic spatiotemporal trajectory of the atrophy, and individual parameters, that not only enable to reconstruct individual trajectories but also permit the statistical study of the distribution of spatiotemporal atrophy patterns. These parameters are estimated thanks to the Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain Stochastic Approximation Expectation-Maximization (MCMC-SAEM) algorithm, which handles non-linear mixed-effects models, with theoretical guarantees and consistent results in practice."}, {"section_title": "Subjects and Data Preprocessing", "text": "Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD). For up-to-date information, see www. adni-info.org.\nThe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset contains longitudinal MRI data for patients that are, at each visit, either cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impaired (MCI) patients, or, AD subjects. We selected all the subjects that presented a monotonous decline from MCI to AD, called the MCI converters, removing those that may convert from AD back to MCI or CN. Although AD patients get through an MCI phase, we could not keep CN to MCI patients as they might just as well convert to another dementia. Also, the patients that underwent from CN to MCI and then to AD are not numerous enough to give robust estimation of early stages (CN to MCI). Thus, we kept only the MCI to AD visits of such patients. Altogether, the paper focuses on 154 MCI patients that represents 787 visits, each individual being examined 5 times on average, from 2 to 7 times.\nEach visit led to a T1-weighted MRI acquisition, as shown on the left side of Figure 1 . The longitudinal pipeline of FreeSurfer (23) was used to extract the cortical thickness of the left hemisphere of the brain which was then projected on a common atlas, namely, FSAverage (24) , which is a three-dimensional mesh composed of 163,842 nodes for each hemisphere represented on the central part of Figure 1 . This common fixed-graph allows to compare the cortical thickness between visits or patients, node to node. FIGURE 2 | Mesh of the cortical surface where each node embeds a time-series of observations (red points). At node k, the function \u03b3 k (t), which can be parametrized by a velocity and two different sets (p 1 , t 1 ) or (p 2 , t 2 ), estimates the cortical thickness over time. The data acquisition and interindividual alignment led to a considerable noise, especially in terms of variability in the measures for close nodes. To smooth this noise and to reduce the computational time, we subsampled the initial graph into a new graph of 1,827 nodes. To do so, we selected 1,827 nodes uniformly distributed over the whole FSAverage graph; the other nodes were then associated to one of the 1,827 nodes thanks to a geodesic distance d on the graph (i.e., the length of the shortest path on the surface mesh between the nodes) using the Fast Marching Algorithm on the mesh (25) . Therefore, it constitutes collection of nodes referred to as patches. The value of each node of the subsampled graph is the average value over the corresponding patch, each being constituted of approximately 89 initial nodes of the FSAverage graph. The resolution of this vertex-based approach is lower than the initial one, shown on the right hand side of Figure 1 , but still holds the brain topology while smoothing part of the acquisition noise. In our case, each observation can be considered as a vector of size 1,827 where the kth coordinate is related to the kth node of the common fixed-graph G. The latter is also described by the distance matrix D between the 1,827 nodes. It was obtained using the geodesic distance d between the 1,827 nodes on the initial graph FSAverage, whose edges are weighted by a physical length. Finally, for all i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , 1,827}, we set D ij = d(x i , x j ) where x i and x j are two nodes of the graph.\nIn the following, we will present a data-driven model which allow to track the propagation of any signal spatially distributed, supposedly the cortical thickness. We consider a longitudinal dataset y = (y i,j ) 1 \u2264 i \u2264 I, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Ji of I individuals, each patient i being observed J i times during the study at ages (t ij ) 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Ji . We suppose that there exist a common fixed-graph G defined by a set V = (x 1 , . . . , x K ) of K nodes and a distance matrix D which accounts for the distance between the nodes. Any node x k \u2208 R 3 corresponds to a coordinate of a point in space. Each observation y ij = = (y ij1 , . . . , y ijK ) \u2208 R k corresponds to the measured signal spatially distributed over the N nodes of G, represented by a point in the multivariate space R k , schematically represented on Figure 3A for K = 3, as if there were only 3 vertices in the mesh. Therefore, it defines a network whose nodes are valued with the signal of interest. It follows that the collection (y ij ) 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Ji of the observations of a particular subject defines a network that embeds a time-series on each node of G, indexed by the patient age at each observation (t ij ) 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Ji ."}, {"section_title": "Model", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "From Short-Term Data to Long-Term History", "text": "We assume there that the repeated observations of a subject are sampled from a continuous function t\n, where \u03b7 ik (t) describes the decrease of cortical thickness of this ith individual at vertex k, such that\nwhere \u03f5 ijk \u223c N(0, \u03c3 2 ) corresponds to the model noise, whose variance is \u03c3 2 . The function t \u2192 \u03b7 ik (t) describes the evolution of the timeseries at node k for the individual i. Thus, the vector function t \u2192 \u03b7 i (t) = (\u03b7 i1 (t), . . . , \u03b7 iN (t)) describes the continuous evolution on the graph for a particular individual, i.e., the spatiotemporal propagation of the signal over the whole brain. It corresponds to a spatiotemporal trajectory in the space of measurements. The trajectory t \u2192 \u03b7 i (t) is therefore able to reconstruct the existing observations (y ij ) 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Ji , defined at the related time-points (t ij ) 1 \u2264 j \u2264 Ji , as shown on Figure 3B , but also generate an observation at any time t, potentially in the future.\nThe repeated data of each individual is a particular window in the long-term course of the disease that potentially overlaps with other patients. We aim to realign along a common time-line these short-term sequences by carefully analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns within each short-term snapshot. Nevertheless, to do so, we also need to account for the interindividual variability in cortical thickness measurements and trajectories of propagation across the network. The interindividual variability prevents us from considering any individual propagation as a good representation of the disease evolution.\nConsequently, we assume that there exists a mean scenario of propagation, defined by a group-average spatiotemporal trajectory t \u2192 \u03b3 0 (t), represented on Figure 3C , such that each individual trajectory t \u2192 \u03b7 i (t) is a temporal and spatial variation of this mean scenario of changes, detailed in section 2.3.2. This typical scenario of change describes the mean pattern of spatiotemporal propagation of the signal and writes \u03b3 0 (t) = (\u03b3 1 (t), . . .,\u03b3 K (t)) where for all k \u2208 {1,. . ., K}, t \u2192 \u03b3 k (t) characterize the typical temporal evolution of the cortical thickness on the brain region related to the node k.

As such, if the acceleration factor \u03b1 i is greater than 1, it corresponds to a faster pace of cortical atrophy whereas \u03b1 i < 1 indicates a slower pace of atrophy. In the same way, the larger the value of the timeshift \u03c4 i is, the later the disease occurs. Therefore, it leads to write \u03b7 i (t) = \u03b3 0 (\u03c8 i (t)) + \u03b5 ij .

For any point on \u03b3 0 (t), \u03b3 0 (t) + w i is assumed to be on the individual trajectory. Therefore, it is possible to translate all the points (\u03b3 0 (t)) t \u03f5 R to (\u03b3 0 + w i ) t \u03f5 R as shown in Figure 3C . This collection defines the individual trajectory \u03b7 i (t). This space shift must be orthogonal to the trajectory as it ensures the identifiability of the model. In fact, if the direction w i was not orthogonal to the trajectory, then the projection of w i on the geodesic \u03b3 0 would interfere with the individual time realignment induced by the dynamic parameters (\u03b1 i ,\u03c4 i ).\nUsing mathematical tools from the Riemannian geometry beyond the scope of this study (26) shows that the kth coordinate of the individual spatiotemporal trajectory writes \u03b7 ik (t) = \u03b3 k ( w ik \u03b3 k (t 0 ) + \u03c8 i (t)).

On the other side, the spatial noise corresponds to high variation of the signal for neighbor nodes. Given this important noise, the goal of the reconstruction is not to reconstruct perfectly the data but rather to smooth the propagation over the brain and to capture individual tendencies of atrophy propagation.

It confirms that the reconstruction error does not have a spatial component as it is uniformly distributed over the brain surface. The color-bar was chosen according to the extreme values: it is important to mention that the larger error of reconstruction corresponds to areas that are close to the corpus callosum where the interpolation relies on a fewer number of control points. Figure 9 presents the reconstruction of two different individuals who present various individual spatiotemporal trajectory, especially space shift norms that are either in the 10% bigger on the left hand side, or in the 10% smaller on the right hand side. The left part of each individual part corresponds to the input data whereas the right part is the corresponding reconstruction done by the model. It shows that the reconstruction is likely to represent the real data. The same color-bar was used as for Figure 6 to compare FIGURE 9 | Real data and data reconstruction for subjects with a small space shift (right) and large space shift (left). The model is able to reconstruct the observed data, with a smoothing component, for subjects that present different characteristics.\nthe individual data with the characteristic pattern of atrophy. Moreover, the spatiotemporal trajectory \u03b7 i of individual i is not estimated only at the observed time-points but it is a continuous function of the time, as shown on Figure 3C . Therefore, it is possible to reconstruct the observation at any point, potentially in the future.\nOne of the properties of the model is to exhibit individual temporal parameters, namely the acceleration factor \u03b1 i and the time-shit \u03c4 i , which allow to reparametrize the individual dynamics on a common time-line. As the data used here correspond to the cortical thickness, the realignment is estimated thanks to structural biomarker dynamics. On the other side, the MCI converters have an age at disease onset, t diag , which corresponds to a clinical status. The latter is not straightforwardly related to the structural dynamics of the individual. In that sense, we decided to realign the age at onset t diag , a clinical biomarker, on the same time-line, assessed with the FIGURE 10 | In red, the histogram of the observed age at diagnosis t diag,i for the 154 MCI converters. In blue, the histogram of the repatametrized age at diagnosis \u03c8 i (t diag,i ) once aligned on the common time-line. This shows that the age at diagnosis is mapped to a smaller range of time-points, in the model of cortical atrophy, suggesting that conversion to AD occurs at a specific stage of cortical atrophy. structural biomarkers. The observed age at diagnosis t diag,i are represented by the red histogram on Figure 10 , which is not unimodal and present an important variance. The realignment of the clinical status is represented thanks to the distribution of (\u03c8 i (t diag,i )) 1 \u2264 i \u2264 I , which is centered with a reduced variance. It suggests that the clinical conversion to AD, determined with t diag corresponds to a specific stage of the cortical atrophy.\nAs the model estimates individual spatiotemporal trajectories, it allows to describe the variability within the population. The distributions of (\u03b1 i ) 1 \u2264 i \u2264 I , (\u03c4 ) 1 \u2264 i \u2264 I and (w i ) 1 \u2264 i \u2264 I account for the distribution of the individual patterns of atrophy. Furthermore, the ADNI dataset provides, for each patient, multiple features, such as the number of alleles of the APOE-\u03f54 gene, the gender, the marital status, and the educational level. In the case of the APOE-\u03f54 gene, which is known as a genetic risk factor regarding AD (35, 36) , we exhibited the distribution of (\u03b1 i ) 1 \u2264 i \u2264 I and (\u03c4 i ) 1 \u2264 i \u2264 I for the subpopulations defined by the number of alleles of the gene as shown on Figure 11 . The more alleles, the more likely to have AD (35, 37) .\nAs shown on the left hand side of Figure 11 , the patients with two alleles (resp. one allele) present a mean time-shift of \u22122.98 years (resp. \u22120.20 years) after the mean scenario, contrary to patient without APOE-\u03f54 alleles that present an average timeshift of 1.89 years, meaning that the more alleles, the earlier the atrophy onset occurs. However, we applied Mann-Whitney two-sided statistical tests that lead to insignificantly differences between the subpopulation. On the other side, same tests were conducted for the same subpopulation with the mean acceleration factor whose distributions are presented on the right hand side of Figure 11 . In this case, the group of individual with no alleles presented an average acceleration factor of 0.780, statistically different from the group of individual with one alleles (resp. two alleles) that presented an average acceleration factor of 1.415 (resp. 1.236) with a p-value equal to 0.00104 (resp.0.00511). However, this acceleration factor is not statistically different between the population with one or two alleles (p-value = 0.51518), meaning that these subpopulation have similar rate of atrophy. Additional investigation on the gender, the marital status and the education level did not led to significant differences. It is important to mention that the Mann-Whitney test is sensitive to the number of samples whereas this study focuses on only 154 MCI patients that might lead to insignificant results in some cases, particularly in the case of the educational level (20 categories) or the marital status (unbalanced classes). Finally, it should mentioned that the tests conducted on the individual space shifts w i and the related sources s i did not lead to significant results, mainly because these parameters account for the difference in brain size, and thus thickness, between people."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "The paper presents a mixed-effects model of the atrophy propagation that is able to characterize a typical pattern of propagation, and, that reconstructs individual observations and scenarios of atrophy. The model exhibits brain areas that are the most affected by the cortical atrophy, such as the parahippocampical gyrus, the temporal lobe, and the superior frontal gyrus. The lesions are less important in the primary visual cortex, the prefrontal cortex, and the primary sensomotory cortex. The model allows to account for the different temporal dynamics of the alterations that can be then compared and ordered.\nThe proposed model offers a wide versatility of instantiation in terms of profile of temporal variations (exponential decay, sigmoid decay) and spatial variations (resolution, number of control nodes, kernel bandwidth) as it defines a generic framework for the estimation of longitudinal signals spatially distributed. It should be compared to other types of graph-related approaches, such as supervoxels (38) or a vertex-cluster method (39) . The latter has exhibited clusters of regression that show profiles of atrophy similar to our results. However, such models do not deal with individual characteristics neither directly with imaging data but rather with normalized values or percentiles, which restrict the interpretation. Further efforts should be concentrated on the validation and improvement of our model, possibly with more complex data and signal propagation.\nThe individual reconstructions also inform about subjectspecific patterns of atrophy propagation, with potential personalized estimation of the cortical atrophy at future time-points. Further investigations have to be conducted to ensure the quality of the new observations the model is able to generate, so that one can exploit the outcome that the model can predict for an individual some years after his of her last visit. This should be done with a proper validation set to determine the population parameters, and a test-set to predict the individual parameters and thus the future observations. Consistent results might provide information about the structural biomarkers related to the progression of AD, such as in Ref. (40) .\nAnother improvement of the model relies in the distance matrix computation. In this paper, the distance between the nodes is related to the distance on the brain surface, hiding potential effects of the neuronal connections. New distances might be computed based on functional connectivity or combination of different distances, in order to associate the functional and structural components of the brain that are supposed to be complementary in the disease process (41) (42) (43) .\nThe model has the potential to exhibit the spatiotemporal propagation of any signal spatially distributed over a graph. It can be used in order to compare the patterns of propagation in distinct population, e.g., normal aging or any other neurodegenerative diseases. It is also a first step to define personalized patterns that would help for a future prognosis of the patient stages."}, {"section_title": "AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS", "text": "All authors listed have made substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication."}]
