Dementia is a disease condition that precludes the activities of daily life and self-care behaviors, and it constitutes a great burden on the patients themselves, their careers, and society. The fundamental therapeutics of dementia have not yet been determined, although some therapies for treating symptoms are available. To establish disease-modifying therapies for dementia, a wide range of investigations to elucidate the mechanism of the development and progression of cognitive dysfunction in the elderly is needed.\nDiabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disorder that is manifested in the form of hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance due to relative insulin deficiency, impaired effectiveness of insulin action, or both. About 347 million people have diabetes worldwide, and the number is increasing. 1 There are two types of diabetes mellitus, type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). These two types are differentiated on the basis of etiology and clinical presentation. T1DM is caused by the destruction of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, typically due to an autoimmune reaction. In T1DM, chronic hyperglycemia is caused by insulin deficiency. On the other hand, T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance (IR) and relative insulin deficiency. IR is defined as an inadequate response by insulin target tissues, such as skeletal muscle, liver tissue, and adipose tissue to the physiological effects of circulating insulin, and is often accompanied by raised insulin levels. T2DM is often, but not always, associated with obesity, which itself can cause IR and lead to elevated blood glucose levels.\nThe prevalence of T2DM has been rising in many regions of the world. 1 Many studies have established that T2DM is a risk factor for cognitive dysfunction and dementia in the elderly. With the increase in the number of elderly individuals with T2DM, the number of diabetic patients with cognitive dysfunction has been increasing. Recent remarkable advances in pharmacological therapy have made a variety of interventions available. Patients with T2DM have benefitted from advancements in preventing and treating the classic microvascular and macrovascular complications. 2 Cognitive dysfunction, however, has not been targeted by the current management strategies of T2DM. Cognitive impairment and dementia in patients with T2DM creates a large burden for patients, their families, and society. In the management of T2DM, self-care behavior is very important, but this behavior is impaired by cognitive dysfunction. The future development and implementation of diabetic treatments, especially for the elderly, should take brain protection into consideration."}, {"section_title": "T2DM and cognitive dysfunction or dementia", "text": "It has been established that T2DM is associated with cognitive dysfunction. While a wide range of cognitive domains was reportedly impaired in older patients with T2DM, one of the most frequently reported cognitive functional deficiencies in T2DM is impaired psychomotor speed. 3 The incidences of both T2DM and dementia increase in later life, which increases the prevalence of the comorbidity of these pathologies. Moreover, recent studies have indicated that older people with T2DM have a higher risk of cognitive dysfunction or dementia. 4 Ample evidence has indicated that T2DM is related not only to vascular dementia (VD) but also to the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type dementia. 5 One of the earliest findings from a large epidemiological study showing that T2DM patients had an increased risk for developing dementia came from the Rotterdam Study. 6 Another study demonstrated a 65% increase of the risk for developing AD in T2DM subjects. 7 A cohort of JapaneseAmericans in Hawaii 8 showed a 1.8-fold higher risk for developing AD and a 2.3-fold higher risk for vascular VD, and the Hisayama study reported similar results. 9 The reported risks for total dementia, AD, or VD in T2DM patients are similar (Table 1) . A recent comprehensive meta-analysis 13 in published research studies. It should be noted that the definitive diagnosis of AD is only made pathologically basically postmortem according to these criteria. The clinical diagnosis of AD in most of the previously published research studies was performed at least partly through the exclusion of diseases other than AD. The coexistence of a limited number of other pathologies including ischemic lesions does not prevent the diagnosis of AD. Indeed, more than 60% of autopsy-proven cases of AD had cerebrovascular lesions. 14 Moreover, neuronal dysfunction and death not related to the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) or to hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau but rather to other causes may coexist in clinically diagnosed AD. Although the results of clinical and epidemiological studies largely agree with the increase in AD by comorbidity of T2DM, this does not necessarily correspond to an accelerated AD pathology in T2DM subjects. Many dementia subjects, especially older subjects, have multiple pathologies. 15 "}, {"section_title": "Underlying mechanism of cognitive dysfunction in T2DM", "text": "The precise mechanisms underlying T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction or the development of dementia, especially AD-type dementia, remain to be elucidated; however, several hypothetical mechanisms have been proposed ( Figure 1 )."}, {"section_title": "Neurogenesis", "text": "Neurogenesis in the hippocampus plays a role in learning and memory, and age-associated decline in neurogenesis has been reported. 16 Basic and animal experiments have indicated that "}, {"section_title": "1014", "text": "Umegaki a hyperglycemic environment induces the proliferation of adult neural progenitors, but is detrimental to their survival.

A break in the BBB also leads to potentially toxic substances and metabolites gaining access to the brain. 21, 22 Diabetes is associated with changes in both the barrier and transport functions of the cerebral microvessels. 23 Dysfunction in the BBB may be associated with cognitive impairment and/or the incidence of dementia."}, {"section_title": "Hyperglycemia", "text": "Chronically higher blood glucose levels exert a negative influence on cognition and cause structural changes in the hippocampus. 24 A recent longitudinal study over 6 years also reported higher glucose levels and an increased risk of the incidence of dementia in both diabetes and non-diabetes subjects. 25 High glucose concentration, a major pathological characteristic of diabetes, may have toxic effects on neurons in the brain through several mechanisms. Osmotic insults and oxidative stress may be involved in the mechanism, and the maintenance of chronic high glucose leads to the enhanced formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), 26 which have potentially toxic effects on neurons. Reportedly, AD patients with T2DM have increased levels of AGEs and microglial activation in the CNS compared to AD patients without T2DM. AGEs couple with free radicals and create oxidative damage, which in turn leads to neuronal injury. 27 In addition to their direct toxicity, AGEs also activate microglia in the CNS. A wealth of evidence has demonstrated that microglia, the resident innate immune cells in the brain, can become deleterious and damage neurons. 28 This process is implicated as an underlying mechanism in diverse neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. While microglial function is beneficial and mandatory for normal CNS functioning, unregulated overactivation of microglia causes damage to neurons. In diabetes, oxidative stress also increases because of reduced antioxidant capacity. 29 Oxidative stress has been suggested to lead to neuronal injury through mitochondrial dysfunction. 30 "}, {"section_title": "Inflammatory mechanism", "text": "Inflammation plays a role in the pathogenesis of IR and T2DM. 31 It has also been suggested that inflammation is associated with the pathogenesis of AD. Chronic low-grade inflammation may be a contributor to the disease process of AD. 32 Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of both T2DM and AD. 33 The activation of glia by inflammatory cytokines damages the neurons. Therefore, inflammation may be a link between T2DM and dementia, especially AD."}, {"section_title": "IR", "text": "Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels. It is primarily secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas and is normally released into the systemic circulation through the portal vein in response to a rise in blood glucose. It is catabolized by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in the liver, kidneys, and muscles. 34, 35 Insulin working within the brain is presumably of pancreatic origin, and it has passed the BBB through a saturable transporter mechanism from the systemic circulation, although there is debate about the amount of insulin that is produced de novo within the CNS. 36 Insulin has multiple important functions in the brain including the control of food intake (via insulin receptors located in the olfactory bulb and thalamus) and effects on cognitive functions, including memory. 37, 38 Blood glucose abnormalities and IR may be associated with acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis. ACh transferase, which is an enzyme responsible for ACh synthesis, is expressed in insulin-receptor-positive cortical neurons, and insulin regulates ACh transferase expression. Because ACh is a critical neurotransmitter in cognitive function, it may be relevant to neurocognitive disorders in diabetics. 39 The critical pathological mechanism in AD is an accumulation of A\u03b2. Overproduction of A\u03b2 may be one of the mechanisms by which this accumulation occurs; however, the impairment of clearance of A\u03b2 may also play a role. The desensitization of insulin receptors, ie, IR, reduces the synthesis of several proteins, including IDE. IDE degrades A\u03b2 as well as insulin, and reduced amounts of IDE may result in greater amyloid deposition. Basic research has indicated that insulin controls the expression of IDE in the brain, and IR in the brain may downregulate IDE expression. 40, 41 Another critical pathology in AD is the hyperphosphorylation of tau. Insulin seems to be an important determinant "}, {"section_title": "1015", "text": "T2DM and cognitive impairment of tau protein phosphorylation.

Moreover, the levels of insulin receptor substrate 1 phosphorylation in hippocampal neurons were found to be negatively correlated with episodic and working memory. Another study investigated the critical role of the soluble A\u03b2 oligomer in producing brain IR in AD, and successfully demonstrated the pharmacological manipulation of this pathway by a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist. 45 Intranasal insulin reportedly improved memory and attention in humans. 46 These achievements may hold promise for brain IR as a future therapeutic target in AD."}, {"section_title": "vascular dysfunction", "text": "Excretion of even a very low amount of albumin in urine (microalbuminuria) is a good marker of cardiovascular events. 47 Microalbuminuria, a marker of vascular dysfunction, predicted accelerated cognitive decline in T2DM subjects. [48] [49] [50] [51] These findings suggest that a deficit of vascular endothelial cells can lead to impairment of the functional coordination of the vascular supply in a timely response to the demand created by nervous activity. Neural activity requires a strong increase of cerebral blood flow and an acute increase in neuronal glucose. Hemodynamic neurovascular coupling coordinates these links (neurovascular units). Dysfunction of cerebral autoregulation with increasing age along with structural and functional alterations in cerebral blood vessels due to diabetes mellitus impairs the functioning of neurovascular units. These phenomena may induce functional deficits in neurons and increase neuronal degeneration and the susceptibility to hypoxia and ischemia. 52 Impaired neurovascular units would also induce BBB leakage. 52 Recently, the hypothesis that vascular dysfunction may impair the drainage pathways of A\u03b2 from the brain parenchyma and thus increase the deposition of A\u03b2 has been drawing interest. 53 Vascular dysfunction could be associated with the progression of amyloid pathology."}, {"section_title": "Neurodegeneration, ischemic pathology, or functional alteration?", "text": "van Harten et al in their systematic review, reported consistent associations of T2DM with atrophy across many brain regions, 54 and more recent reports have made similar findings. [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] It was reported by den Heijer et al in their review that subjects with T2DM had more hippocampal and amygdalar atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to subjects without T2DM, and they speculated that this could suggest that T2DM directly influences the development of AD-related neuropathology. 62 More recently, Willette et al reported that IR in an asymptomatic, late middle-aged cohort was associated with progressive atrophy in regions affected by early AD, 63 and similar atrophy was found in older T2DM patients by Moran et al. 64 A PET study demonstrated that subjects with prediabetes and early T2DM have Alzheimerlike reductions in regional cerebral glucose metabolism. 65 These clinical studies may suggest that T2DM induces the AD-related pathology, and the acceleration of AD pathologies leads to neurodegeneration and brain atrophy.\nIn the Rotterdam study, a non-diabetic population cohort study, it was reported that IR assessed by homeostasis model assessment ratio was associated with the onset of AD within 3 years. 66 A Japanese epidemiological study, the Hisayama study, reported that IR was associated with AD pathology. 67 The results of pathological studies using autopsy samples, however, have not been consistent in terms of the association of T2DM with AD pathology. One study demonstrated that diabetics show significantly less AD-associated neuropathology, 68 while another failed to show any relationship between diabetes and AD-associated neuropathology. 69 The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) recently reported that the association between AD-related pathology and IR could not be confirmed. 70 Body mass index, serum insulin level, and IR level were very different between the Hisayama study and the BLSA study, which makes it difficult to interpret and compare the results of these two studies. A recently published study making use of amyloid PET imaging did not find differences in amyloid accumulation between AD subjects with or without T2DM. 71 If T2DM has an impact on cognition only through accelerating AD pathology, the extent of the pathology should be similar when cases of cognitive impairment with similar levels of severity are compared cross-sectionally, either pathologically or using amyloid imaging. Thus, the rate of progression would also be considered when investigating the role of T2DM in increasing the incidence of AD by using amyloid PET or CSF biomarkers.\nAnother issue to be addressed in future studies is the Apo E genotype. Many studies reported that the Apo E4 genotype, which is a major genetic risk factor for AD, 72 enhanced the association of AD with T2DM. 73, 74 Thus, considering the impact of the Apo E genotype is warranted in future pathological studies.\nClinical Interventions in Aging 2014:9 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com"}, {"section_title": "Dovepress", "text": "\n"}, {"section_title": "1016", "text": "Umegaki T2DM is an established risk factor for microvascular and macrovascular complications throughout the body, including brain stroke and small vessel disease. 75 Therefore, vascular damage is likely to be one of the main reasons for the cognitive impairment in T2DM subjects, including VD subjects.

Some studies have reported T2DM to be associated with microstructural abnormalities in the white matter in various pathways in the brain independent of small vessel diseases, and these abnormalities are also associated with cognitive impairment. 76, 77 The combination of vascular lesions and AD pathology is very common in T2DM subjects, and cognitive dysfunction due to vascular pathology may lower the threshold of clinical diagnosis of dementia in early AD subjects.\nA neurodegenerative mechanism other than AD pathology may contribute to the cognitive dysfunction in T2DM.

Improvements in HbA1c, but not in other clinical indices including blood pressure and lipid levels, mediated the effect of the intervention on cognitive decline. 83 These results suggest that blood glucose control is important for the preservation of cognitive function in elderly diabetic patients.
