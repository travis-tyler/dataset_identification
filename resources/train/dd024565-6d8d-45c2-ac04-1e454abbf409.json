The utility of risk scores in precision medicine is an open question. Application of PRSs in 3 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) have shown up to 84% prediction accuracy and opened new perspectives for clinical trials. To estimate the disease risk of a particular individual from a particular population, their PRS has to be aligned with a matching background sample where individual genotypes for each SNP are available for each person. The obtained PRS is normally distributed and its mean and variance depend on the number of SNPs and their characteristics (allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium structure in the population).\nThe PRS approach has been widely used across different traits, but mostly in European populations. Originally PRSs were designed to summarise genome-wide genotype data into a single variable that measures genetic liability to a disorder or a trait 1 . PRS studies often reach quite high statistical significance levels (small p-value) to suggest trait polygenicity, but the prediction accuracy is usually not sufficient for clinical utility 2 . For example, the prediction accuracy from PRS in schizophrenia has an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of about 70% 3 and in bipolar disorder an AUC~65% 4 . Nevertheless, PRS was suggested to be a useful tool for the selection of individuals for clinical trials in individuals of European ancestry across different traits [5] [6] [7] [8] .\nThe PRS prediction accuracy of risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is relatively high, especially if the diagnosis is based upon pathology confirmed (AUC is up to 84%) rather than clinical assessment 9 . Furthermore, PRS improves the prediction accuracy significantly over and above APOE (which is the strongest predictor of late onset AD risk) and genome-wide significant SNPs 10 . To dissect the disease pathology, the PRS is now being frequently studied for biologically relevant pathways 11 , and can potentially be advantageous for translational studies, e.g. prioritizing samples for stem cell research. 4 The predictive ability of the PRS in non-European populations is currently limited due to the lack of genetic research performed in populations of non-European ancestry.\nPrevious studies have attempted to assess PRS accuracy across different populations using well-powered European Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) discovery cohorts, but have shown mixed results. Reisberg et al. compared the distribution of PRSs for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD) for different populations and reported lowest scores for the European population compared to Africans 12 . They concluded that PRS models using effects from European-centred GWAS cannot be directly applied to different ancestries for disease prediction.\nSimilarly, Martin et al., by applying PRS from single-ancestry GWAS to eight phenotypes in diverse populations, reported directional differences in all scores and the strongest correlation of true and observed risk in the population from which the effect sizes were derived 13 . It is likely that the main contributors to these differences are the SNP allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium patterns which differ substantially across populations. The disease association effect sizes are also likely to be different, however, the risk loci are often comparable across populations. For example, Li et al (2017) have shown that about 95% of the genome-wide significant index alleles (or their proxies) from the Psychiatric Genetic Consortium (PGC2) study of European ancestry were overrepresented in Chinese schizophrenia cases, including \u223c 50% that achieved nominal significance 14 . The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study presented consistent association in the same direction for all 19 T2D variants discovered in European cohorts across different ethnic groups 15 . In a more recent PAGE publication 16 , genome-wide association analyses were performed on 49,839 individuals with different ancestry background across 26 traits. They replicated 574 GWAS variant-trait associations in 261 distinct 5 regions of which 132 had significant evidence of effect heterogeneity by genetic ancestry. Therefore gene discoveries and improvement of the disease prediction accuracy for clinical trials still highly rely on powerful GWAS studies in diverse populations.\nFor dementia related phenotypes, Marden et al (2014) tested whether AD PRS can predict dementia and memory function in non-Hispanic black and white participants 17 and has shown that the PRS (which includes APOE) is elevated in dementia cases, with direction of association being similar for both samples.\nIt has also been suggested that causal effect estimates tend to be shared between populations 18 ; however the prediction accuracy by the PRS can vary due to different environmental exposures and gene-environment interactions 19 .\nIn the present study, we present formulae for estimating polygenic risk score distribution parameters based upon allele frequencies, disease association effect sizes for each SNP, and the SNPxSNP LD matrix. The allele frequencies for different populations can be found in publicly available databases. SNP selection for the PRS can also be informed by the LD structure which is specific to the population of interest via publicly available data (e.g. 1000 genomes). With the caveat that most of the disease risk loci are likely to be shared between populations, our formulae can already be used for assessing disease risk for individuals from a European population and estimate the disease risk for individuals from other populations.\nWe demonstrate the precision of our formulae with simulations. We show the utility of our estimates in application to AD in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study 20, 21 .

For easy interpretation the PRS is often standardised. It is expected that the mean of the PRS in cases will be higher than that in controls, indicating a higher genetic risk for the disorder, but the difference may be small. The standardization requires an estimate of the samplespecific mean and standard deviation (or variance).\nIf SNPs are independent, we can estimate the mean and the variance of the PRS distribution without knowledge of individual genotypes, simply using the SNP effect sizes and allele frequencies for the SNPs contributing to the PRS, which are often available from the public resources. In the case where SNPs are dependent, estimation of the PRS variance also requires knowledge of the SNPxSNP correlation matrix or a suitable proxy.\nFormally, the polygenic risk score for each individual\nare the numbers of individuals and SNPs contributing to the PRS respectively, \u0743 is the genotype of SNP i for individual j, which can take values 0, 1 or 2, and \u07da is the effect size of SNP i obtained from an independent GWAS study for the disease of interest.\nThen the corresponding sample mean and variance can be estimated:\nTo derive the expected mean and variance of the PRS distribution in terms of effect sizes and SNPs allele frequencies contributing to the PRS, we assume that allele frequencies in a random mating population (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) follow a binomial distribution.

Formulae (4) and (6) offer a very quick estimation of the PRS distribution parameters.\nWe first examined the performance of the direct calculation of the PRS distribution using formulae (4) and (6) SNPs.\nTo illustrate the performance of the theoretically estimated PRS parameters with formulae (4) and (6) in real data, we tested it in the 1000 genome dataset for three distinct populations: European, African and Asian. To derive PRS we used publicly available AD GWAS summary statistics 24 that have been derived in a Caucasian population. The number of LD independent SNPs (r 2 =0.01) contributing to the PRS at different AD significance thresholds in each population, are shown in Table 1 . It can be observed that the European population has on average a smaller proportion of significantly associated independent SNPs, as compared to the Chinese and African populations 25 , whereas the total number of SNPs was the largest in the European population. The latter can be explained by the fact that the AD GWAS which was used for the SNP selection procedure is European based and therefore SNP coverage was widest in the European population. The formulae (4) and (6) allow the calculation of the expected mean and variance of the PRS distribution directly for each population, assuming that the SNPs are (almost) independent and SNP effect sizes (i.e., the disease-associated SNP-risks) are similar between populations. The latter presupposes that the biological mechanisms for a particular disease development are generally the same, but we do not exclude that the genome variation and structure vary in different populations. Table 2 displays the PRS distribution parameters (mean and variance) calculated from the sample and estimated using the formulae (4) and (6) . The estimates are very similar within the European, Asian and African populations for each of the AD associated p-value thresholds p\u226410 -5 , 10 -3 , 0.1, 0.5 and with LD pruning parameter r 2 =0.01. Note that in African population for p\u22640.1, 0.5 the variance calculated by formula (6) is underestimated suggesting that some unaccounted SNPxSNP correlation remains. When the SNPs are in noticeable LD, the estimation of the PRS variance (5) requires knowledge of the SNPxSNP correlation matrix, which in turn requires the availability of individual genotypes. This complicates the application of formula (5) to real data, as the computational burden for estimation of the full correlation matrix may be substantial.\nIn practice, LD-intelligent pruning is performed before PRS calculation to pick up disease-relevant independent variants. Typically the threshold squared correlation 13 parameter (r 2 ) varies from 0.1 to 0.2 in a 500kb or 1000kb window. Of course, this procedure does not make SNPs absolutely independent and some correlation remains.\nIf this correlation is ignored, then the PRS variance is underestimated. We have compared the variance estimates with our formulae for threshold values r 2 =0.01 (r=0.1) and r 2 =0.1 (r=0.316). As expected, the most stringent pruning (r 2 =0.01) provides a closer resemblance of the theoretically estimated variance (by formula (6)) to the estimate assuming dependence (by formula (5)).\nWhen SNPs are pruned for LD in a window, say 1000kb, only a small proportion of SNPs remains correlated in that window. For example, out of ~10M SNPs in 1000Genomes European data, ~100K SNPs remained after r 2 =0.01 pruning and ~900K SNPs remained after r 2 =0.1 pruning. In a window of 1MB, there were on average 3,000 SNPs before pruning, and ~300 SNPs after r 2 =0.1 pruning. About 30% of SNP pairs had correlation less than r 2 =0.0001, ~93% of SNP pairs had LD less than r 2 =0.01, and only 1% had r 2 greater than 0.1, the pruning threshold. Thus, very roughly, the average correlation per LD block is between 0.002 and 0.003.\nApplying r=0.002 as an approximation of correlation between SNPs in formula (5) provides closer estimates of PRS variance to the data-derived variance for all three populations in 1000 genomes project including the African population, see Table 2 , the variance estimated by formula (5) . Note that this coefficient works also well for other pruning parameters of r 2 =0.01, 0.1 (see Tables 2,3 and Figures 3,4) .\nIn order to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approximation, we use the LD pruning parameter of r 2 =0.1, which is commonly used in practice. Figure 3 : a) -European, b)-Asian and c)-African populations shows the fitted distributions for all three methods: actual PRS densities, PRS density estimated by formulae (4), (6) and PRS density estimated by formulae (4), (5) where SNPxSNP correlation matrix is estimated by r=0.002. Remarkably, even with pruning threshold r 2 =0.1 the variance is severely underestimated when LD is neglected (blue curves); the estimated parameters provide much better fit to the real data when LD is taken into account (purple curves).\nFinally, we demonstrated the performance of our theoretical formulae in AD case/control data (ADNI). First, we used a quite stringent LD pruning parameter r 2 =0.01 and calculated the PRS distribution parameters separately for 172 AD cases and 221 cognitively normal controls. Figure 4 shows histograms of the PRSs and their density curves as compared to the PRS densities whose parameters are calculated with formulae (4), (5) (6) . A better fit can be observed for all p-value thresholds with the formula (5) which accounts for potentially remaining LD between SNPs. Table 3 presents the results when the LD pruning parameter r 2 was set to r 2 =0.1. In this case, accounting for the LD (i.e. using formula (5)) is crucial. The 1 st column shows GWAS AD p-value thresholds, the other columns show the PRS mean calculated from the data vs. estimated mean using formulae (f4), and the PRS variance calculated from the data vs. estimated variances using formulae (f5-f6)."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this study we have derived theoretical formulae to estimate the parameters of any In reality even after a stringent LD pruning, some correlation between SNPs remains.\nWe recommend using formula (5) for PRS variance estimation to account for remaining LD in all cases.\nWe verified our formulae using simulations and then applied it to the 1000 genomes data and the ADNI dataset.
