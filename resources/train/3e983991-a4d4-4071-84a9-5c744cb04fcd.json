Biomarkers that help identify patients at risk for cognitive decline would be useful additions to the clinical management of the disease.\nA total of 45 patients with PD were enrolled in this prospective cohort study and had at least 1 yearly longitudinal follow-up evaluation. CSF was collected at baseline and cognition was assessed at baseline and follow-up visits using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS-2). CSF was tested for amyloid \u2424 1-42 (A\u2424 1-42 ), p-tau 181p , and total tau levels using the Luminex xMAP platform. Mixed linear models were used to test for associations between baseline CSF biomarker levels and change in cognition over time.\nResults: Lower baseline CSF A\u2424 1-42 was associated with more rapid cognitive decline. Subjects with CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels \u0545192 pg/mL declined an average of 5.85 (95% confidence interval 2.11-9.58, p \u03ed 0.002) points per year more rapidly on the DRS-2 than subjects above that cutoff, after adjustment for age, disease duration, and baseline cognitive status. CSF total tau and p-tau 181p levels were not significantly associated with cognitive decline.\nReduced CSF A\u2424 1-42 was an independent predictor of cognitive decline in patients with PD.

Demographic and general clinical information was collected in PD-DOC recommended format (http://www.pd-doc.org). Evaluations were conducted between August 2006 and December 2009. Neuropsychological assessment. Cognitive status was assessed using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (version 2) (DRS-2). 13 The DRS-2 is a detailed measure of general cognitive ability. It contains subscales that measure specific cognitive domains: memory, attention, initiation/perseveration, construction, and conceptualization. It has been validated in patients with PD, 14 and a cutoff score of \u0545123 has been shown to accurately identify patients with PDD. 15 The same study reported a mean DRS score of 133 for patients with PD without dementia.\nMotor examination. Clinical examinations, including Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) staging, 16 were conducted by the patients' treating doctors who are movement disorders specialists. Motor examinations were conducted while patients were receiving their regularly scheduled dopaminergic medications. CSF analysis. CSF samples were obtained by lumbar puncture using a 20-or 24-gauge spinal needle as described in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) procedures manual (http://www.adni-info.org/). CSF was divided into aliquots (0.5 mL) and stored in bar code-labeled polypropylene vials at \u03ea80\u00b0C. A\u24241-42 1-42 , tau, and p-tau 181p were measured using the multiplex xMAP Luminex platform (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX) with Innogenetics (INNO-BIA AlzBio3; Ghent, Belgium; for research use only reagents) immunoassay kit-based reagents. Full details for this combination of immunoassay reagents and analytical platform are provided elsewhere. 17 Reliability studies (http://www.adni-info.org) show that the day-to-day reproducibility for these 3 biomarkers varies by less than 10%. APOE genotyping. DNA was extracted from EDTA blood samples using commercial reagents (FlexiGene, Oiagen, Valencia, CA). DNA was available for 43 of the 45 participants. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs7412 and rs429358) in APOE were genotyped using allelic discrimination assays with TaqMan reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an ABI7500. The APOE genotypes (\u24402, \u24403, and \u24404) were assigned by incorporating the genotyping results from both single nucleotide polymorphisms into an algorithm."}, {"section_title": "Analysis.

Linear mixed-effects models were used to test for associations between baseline CSF biomarkers and cognitive decline as measured by the DRS-2. 18 A linear mixed-effect model accounts for within-person correlations over time, and allows for variable length of follow-up between subjects. These models can also accommodate varying time intervals between assessments. Each subject in this mixed-effect model can be thought of as having his or her own linear regression model, and the population parameters can be obtained by averaging across the individual regression coefficients. In our implementation, the intercept and the regression coefficients for the follow-up time were treated as random effects such that each subject has a unique intercept and regression coefficient for the follow-up time. The population mean coefficients for the follow-up time were obtained by averaging across the subjectspecific regression coefficients for the follow-up time. This population mean coefficient estimated the average annual change for the DRS-2 over time, and accounts for differences in baseline DRS-2 scores. The interaction term time \u03eb CSF biomarker represents the effect of the baseline biomarker on change in DRS-2 score over time. It can be interpreted as the annualized change in DRS-2 score for each one unit change in a given biomarker. In addition to considering A\u2424 1-42 , tau, and p-tau 181p as continuous measures, we also examined the effect of being at or below the A\u2424 1-42 cutoff of 192 pg/mL. This level has been associated with the greatest diagnostic accuracy in separating patients with AD from age-matched controls. 7 In this case, the time \u03eb A\u2424 1-42 group interaction can be interpreted as the between-group difference in annualized rate of DRS-2 decline. Analogous tests were performed for subscales of the DRS-2.\nPotential confounding variables including age, gender, education, H&Y stage, and disease duration were tested in bivariable analysis. Only age, H&Y stage, and disease duration were associated with DRS-2 score below the p \u03fd 0.1 cutoff, and were included in subsequent models. With the exception of APOE genotype, complete data were available for 45 subjects. APOE status was available for 42 of 45 subjects, and the association between APOE \u24404 carrier status and cognitive decline was tested in this subset of subjects.\nAll analyses were conducted at a 2-sided \u2423 \u03ed 0.05 significance level, without adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Results were similar in unadjusted analysis (\u2424 \u03ed 0.041; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.015 to 0.066), and with adjustment for age, disease duration, and baseline H&Y stage (\u2424 \u03ed 0.040; 95% CI 0.015 to 0.066). There was no association of either total tau or p-tau 181p and greater cognitive decline. In addition, there was no association between tau/A\u2424 1-42 and p-tau 181p /A\u2424 1-42 ratios and change in cognition. This was true in spite of the strong relationship between A\u2424 1-42 and cognitive decline. Adding tau or p-tau 181p in a combined metric actually diminished the effect of A\u2424 1-42 alone.\nA CSF A\u2424 1-42 level of \u0545192 pg/mL has been suggested as a useful diagnostic cutoff for AD. 7 We tested whether subjects in our cohort with CSF A\u2424 1-42 below this level were at greater risk for cognitive decline, and found that those with A\u2424 1-42 levels \u0545192 had an annualized decline in DRS score that was 6.1 points greater (95% CI 2.33 to 9.79) than those with A\u2424 1-42 levels above 192 pg/mL. This association was quite similar after adjustment for age, disease duration, and baseline H&Y stage (5.8 points greater; 95% CI 2.11 to 9.58). After 2 years, the mean adjusted DRS-2 score for subjects with low baseline A\u2424 1-42 levels had fallen below the published cutoff for dementia of 123 on the DRS-2, while the mean adjusted score for subjects with A\u2424 1-42 levels above 192 remained above 130 (figure).\nAssociations with APOE status. Fifteen subjects carried at least one APOE \u24404 allele (one subject was homozygous). CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels were substantially lower in these subjects (182 pg/mL vs 251 pg/mL; p \u03ed 0.004). CSF tau and p-tau 181p levels were not significantly different for APOE \u24404 allele carriers compared to noncarriers (tau: 46 vs 55; p \u03ed 0.35; p-tau 181p : 18 vs 19; p \u03ed 0.836). Without adjustment for CSF A\u2424 1-42, having at least one APOE \u24404 copy was associated with an increase in the rate of cognitive decline compared to noncarriers that approached significance (difference \u03ed 3.96 DRS-2 points/year, 95% CI \u03ea0.39 to 8.32; p \u03ed 0.075). However, the association with of APOE \u24404 allele status was no longer present after adjustment for CSF A\u2424 1-42 level (difference \u03ed 1.29 points/year, 95% CI \u03ea3.15 to 5.73; p \u03ed 0.569). No other APOE genotypes were associated with cognitive decline (data not shown)."}, {"section_title": "Association between CSF biomarkers and change in", "text": "individual cognitive domains. Low CSF A\u2424 1-42 was significantly ( p \u03fd 0.05) associated with declines in multiple subscales of the DRS-2. The largest effect size was seen for the attention subscale (\u2424 \u03ed 0.011, SE \u03ed 0.0034). There were also significant associations with change in conceptualization (\u2424 \u03ed 0.0078, SE \u03ed 0.0033) and memory (\u2424 \u03ed 0.0086, SE \u03ed 0.0042). The association with the initiation/perseveration subscale approached significance (\u2424 \u03ed 0.011, SE \u03ed 0.0064, p \u03ed 0.06). There was no significant association with the construction subscale. These findings suggest an association with global cognitive decline, rather than an association limited to one cognitive domain. DISCUSSION Low baseline CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels were a strong predictor of subsequent cognitive decline in this cohort of patients with PD. Neither tau nor p-tau 181p was associated with cognitive decline, and ratios of p-tau 181p and tau to A\u2424 were no better predictors than A\u2424 1-42 alone. The effects sizes we observed are likely to be clinically meaningful. Based on our data, a patient with CSF A\u2424 1-42 below the diagnostic cutoff of 192 pg/mL would be predicted to progress from essentially normal cognition to a level consistent with PDD within a 2-year period of follow-up. Decline was observed across multiple cognitive domains, suggesting an anatomically generalized, rather than focal, degeneration. We found no association between biomarker levels and baseline cognitive status, even after adjustment for disease duration. This may be due to a number of factors including the small number of patients with PD with a DRS-2 score in the dementia range (i.e., \u0545123) or biases inherent in crosssectional analyses. Our results are also consistent, however, with the hypothesis that biomarker abnormalities precede clinical cognitive decline.\nSimilar cross-sectional studies have not found a relationship between CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels or plasma A\u2424 levels and cognitive status in patients with AD. 19, 20 However, recent studies have documented that reductions in CSF A\u2424 are associated with risk of subsequent cognitive decline. In the ADNI cohort, lower CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels (and elevated tau) were associated with increased risk of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD. 7 In another AD cohort, lower CSF A\u2424 1-42 and elevated p-tau 181p (to a greater extent than total tau) predicted more rapid cognitive decline. 21 Finally, a recent study showed that alterations in various A\u2424 peptides in plasma were associated with risk of subsequent dementia. 22 Lower levels of CSF amyloid-\u2424 peptides, specifically A\u2424 1-42 , reflect underlying amyloid pathology. 23, 24 Some have hypothesized that in AD, lower A\u2424 1-42 levels in the spinal fluid may be related to sequestration of the peptide from CSF into amyloid plaques. 25 In Lewy body disorders, the picture is more complicated. Decreased levels of A\u2424 have been demonstrated in CSF from patients with DLB compared to normal controls. 9, 26 In patients with PDD, modest reductions in CSF A\u2424 have been shown compared to normal controls, 27, 28 and in PD without dementia, A\u2424 1-42 levels are not consistently reduced. 9 Increased CSF levels of total tau and p-tau 181p have been associated with impaired cognitive performance in patients with PD and PDD. 10 These differences in CSF A\u2424 1-42 across the spectrum of Lewy body disorders may reflect a gradient in the relative contribution of amyloid pathology to DLB, PDD, and PD without dementia, respectively. Such a hypothesis is consistent with neuropathologic data showing that amyloid plaque pathology is common in DLB and present to a lesser degree in PDD. 29 If lower CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels reflect greater amyloid plaque burden in patients with PD at risk for cognitive decline, then this in turn argues for an important role for amyloid pathology in the development of dementia in PD.\nThe presence of at least one APOE \u24404 allele is an established risk factor for amyloid aggregation and AD. 30 A meta-analysis of the published studies on the relationship between APOE genotype and risk of dementia in PD 31 found modestly increased risk associated with the \u24404 allele, and no definite associations with other alleles. We found a modest association that approached significance between APOE \u24404 carrier status and rate of cognitive decline, with carriers of at least one copy of the \u24404 allele having more rapid cognitive decline. However, this association was substantially smaller than the association with CSF A\u2424 1-42 , and was no longer significant after adjustment for CSF A\u2424 1-42 level. Moreover, consistent with previous studies, 32 baseline CSF A\u2424 1-42 was significantly lower in subjects with at least one APOE \u24404 allele. These findings argue that the APOE4 genotype and A\u2424 1-42 may function in the same pathway, but that CSF A\u2424 1-42 is more directly related, and more predictive of cognitive decline in PD than APOE genotype. Interestingly, there is evidence that reduced CSF A\u2424 1-42 may confer greater risk for conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD in APOE \u24404 noncarriers. 33 Studies with larger sample size and longitudinal design may help clarify the relationship between APOE \u24404 status and other genetic traits such as tau haplotype 34 and dementia risk in PD.\nSeveral limitations of our study should be acknowledged. First, we studied a relatively small sample of patients with PD and for a relatively brief period of time. As a result, we are not able to perform subgroup analyses, such as examining the association between CSF A\u2424 1-42 and cognitive decline in men vs women or in recently diagnosed vs established cases of PD. We were able to detect an association of CSF A\u2424 1-42 level with cognitive decline because the DRS-2 is a relatively precise, continuous measure of cognitive status, and because of the longitudinal design of our study. Our findings should be replicated in larger groups of patients, and in longer studies that examine the risk of conversion to a clinical diagnosis of PDD. Second, our results do not address whether the association between reduced A\u2424 1-42 and cognitive decline is specific to PD. Similar declines in cognition have been observed in apparently healthy populations. 35 Our results may reflect the effects of the primary underlying pathologic process in PDD, or simply coexisting AD pathology that modifies CSF A\u2424 1-42 levels and also may, in part, underlie cognitive impairment in PD. One means to address this issue would be to study additional CSF biomarkers. Recently, specific subtypes of amyloid peptides such as A\u2424 have been shown to differentiate PDD from DLB and may be a more specific marker of cortical Lewy body pathology. 9 In addition, assays for \u2423-synuclein pathology are under development, and may be useful in determining prognosis in patients with PD. 36 These limitations are opportunities for future research. Nonetheless, our study remains significant in that it demonstrates the ability of a CSF biomarker to provide prognostic information for patients with PD on the risk of cognitive decline. In the future, biological data such as CSF A\u2424 1-42 level could be combined with clinical information that has been associated with risk of PDD to provide better predictive accuracy than either type of information alone. port from the NIH (NS053488 [Neuropathology and Genetics Core, Core Co-Leader] and AG010124 [Neuropathology Core, Co-I]).
