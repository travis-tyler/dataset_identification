We defined and classified 15 chronic conditions according to the classification scheme developed by the Department of Health and Human Services. 16 Chronic conditions and the number of hospitalizations were generated from the claims in the year prior to each study year. Geographic location, including urban/rural, primary care HPSA designation, and region, was determined based on residential zip code. Urban/rural location was categorized into metropolitan (if in a metropolitan county), nonmetropolitan urban (if in a county with an urban population of 2500 or more), or rural (if in a county that was completely rural or had less than 2500 urban populations) based on rural-urban continuum codes. 17 The primary care HPSA designation was determined using data from the Health Resources and Services Administration. 18 "}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analyses", "text": "We evaluated beneficiary characteristics, including demographics, clinical conditions, and geographic location, for years 2008, 2011, and 2014. To examine whether a primary care model was more likely to be delivered to beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions and those who resided in rural and HPSAs, we performed multinomial logistic regression, adjusting for beneficiary characteristics, using 2014 data. To assess which patient characteristics were associated with the largest increase in shared care, we built a multinomial logistic regression model to test the interaction between year and the characteristics using all 3 years of data. Since all interactions were statistically significant, stratified models were conducted for each level of the characteristics to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of increasing use of the shared care model compared with the physician model. We used Bonferroni correction to adjust for multiple comparisons in the stratified models.\nWe conducted sensitivity analyses to examine whether the number of primary care office visits per beneficiary in a year affected the designation of primary care model and beneficiary characteristics. First, we assessed the proportion of beneficiaries assigned to each primary care model stratified by number of primary care office visits, ranging from 1 to 20, for each year. The results showed that the proportion of shared care increased and the proportion of physician care decreased in samples with a higher number of primary care office visits (Supplementary Table S1 ). Second, we ran the analyses using different cutoff values for the sample inclusion criteria: \u22651 visit or \u22652 visits. Using the criterion of at least 1 visit underestimated the proportion of shared care; however, using the criterion of at least 2 visits excluded patients with only a single visit (less morbid patients), which biased the results as the NP/PA model tended to serve a larger proportion of patients with 1 visit. Despite these differences, the sensitivity analysis indicated that the overall temporal trends in care models are consistent using either criterion. Therefore, we chose to use the more complete sample with at least one primary care office visit. Furthermore, we validated our multinomial logistic regression models by comparing models with and without adjustment for number of primary care office visits, while adjusting for the same set of variables for beneficiary characteristics; and we found consistent results. All statistical tests were 2-sided with significance level set at .05. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Inc, Cary, NC)."}, {"section_title": "Results", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Beneficiary Characteristics", "text": "Supplementary Table S2 Table  S3 ). Similarly, the number of hospitalizations was highest in the shared care model followed by the physician model and the NP/PA model.\nRural beneficiaries accounted for a small proportion of the total beneficiaries in each care model. The proportion ranged from 4.1% in 2008 to 3.1% in 2014 in the shared care model, 2.2% to 1.9% in the physician model, and 7.6% to 6.5% in the NP/PA model. The proportion of beneficiaries in primary care HPSAs in the shared care model ranged from 50% in 2008 to 61.4% in 2014, compared with 45.1% to 56.8% in the physician model, and 53.8% to 66.7% in the NP/PA model. A large proportion of beneficiaries were in the South across care models. Figure 1 shows the trends in the prevalence of primary care models. The shared care model increased from 11.9% in 2008 to 23.3% in 2014, and the physician model decreased from 85.5% to 70.9% during the same period. The NP/PA model accounted for a very small proportion and increased from 2.7% to 5.9%. We further examined 3 types of shared care: MD-NP, MD-PA, and MD-NP-PA. We found that MD-NP increased from 6.2% in 2008 to 11.5% in 2014; MD-PA increased from 4.9% to 9.0%; and MD-NP-PA increased from 0.8% to 2.8%."}, {"section_title": "Trends in the Proportion of Primary Care Models", "text": "We next examined which patient characteristics were associated with the largest increase in shared care (Table 1) . We present the growth by characteristics in two ways. The first is the absolute increase in the percentage of beneficiaries receiving shared care. The second is the relative increase compared with the physician model from the stratified adjusted models. The shared care model increased in all demographics categories, clinical conditions, and geographic locations. There was higher initial use and higher increased use of the shared care model in Whites compared with Blacks and Hispanics. Higher initial use and higher increased use was also found in sicker beneficiaries shown in 2 aspects: beneficiaries with 3 or more chronic conditions and those with previous hospitalizations. Table 2 presents beneficiary characteristics associated with care models in 2014. The shared care model was more likely to be used than the physician model in caring for beneficiaries with chronic conditions, with previous hospitalizations, and those residing in rural or primary care HPSAs. Among those with 1, 2, or at least 3 chronic conditions, the AORs were 1.3, 1.3, and 1.7, respectively; among beneficiaries with 1, 2, or at least 3 previous hospitalizations, the AORs were 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, respectively. Conversely, the NP/PA model was less likely to be used in beneficiaries with a chronic condition than the physician model. These findings indicate that the shared care model served a sicker population. Compared with beneficiaries residing in metropolitan areas, those residing in nonmetropolitan urban or rural areas had 37% and 66% greater odds of being in the shared care model than in the physician model. Compared with beneficiaries residing in non-HPSA areas, beneficiaries residing in HPSA areas had 14% greater odds of being cared for by the shared care model than by the physician model. Although the NP/PA model served the smallest proportion of beneficiaries in urban/rural and HPSAs/non-HPSAs, beneficiaries residing in nonmetropolitan urban (AOR = 2.35), rural (AOR = 3.97), or HPSA areas (AOR = 1.26) were the most likely to receive care from the NP/PA model. "}, {"section_title": "Use of Primary Care Models in Beneficiaries With Multiple Chronic Conditions and Beneficiaries in Rural and HPSAs", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In 2014, the shared care model accounted for 23%, an increase from 12% in 2008. Nationally, the traditional physician care model remains the most prevalent model, followed by the shared care model. However, a decrease in the physician model and concomitant increase in the shared care model indicates a significant shift in primary care delivery. Our study showed that this shift toward increased shared care was associated with the care delivery to select groups. Beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions and hospitalizations were most likely to receive shared care. Furthermore, the shared care model played a considerable role in caring for beneficiaries in rural and HPSAs. These findings provided empirical evidence in support of a prior recommendation of sharing the care to improve primary care system capacity. 5 As the presence of multiple chronic conditions represents high costs to health care and as its prevalence continues to increase, especially among vulnerable populations in rural and HPSAs, 19, 20 fostering the shared care model is very likely to attain synergistic and double-edge effects. It will bolster primary care system capacity for care delivery to individuals with multiple chronic conditions and will expand access to care to populations most in need. The former is consistent with 1 of the 4 overarching goals established by the Department of Health and Human Services, which is to \"Foster health care and public health system changes to improve the health of individuals with multiple chronic conditions.\" 21 The latter, improving access to care for vulnerable populations, is a national priority.\nA pronounced change in Medicare to incentivize primary care professionals to improve the health of individuals with multiple chronic conditions is the new payment policy for chronic care management. Medicare began to reimburse non-face-to-face primary care services to physicians, NPs, and PAs for managing the care of fee-for-service beneficiaries with two or more chronic conditions in 2015. 22 One of the requirements for billing is the provision of 24/7 chronic care management services. This policy might stimulate more shared care practices among physicians and NPs or PAs in undertaking required chronic care management services.\nThe NP/PA model accounted for a very small proportion of care provision to Medicare beneficiaries and increased slightly over time, which is consistent with a previous study. 23 Although many states have granted greater practice authority to NPs and PAs since 2008 and NPs can do solo practice, 24, 25 our study demonstrates that the majority of care provided by NPs and PAs consisted of shared care with physicians. These findings are consistent with the evidence that most NPs and PAs prefer collaborating with physicians. 12 Care provided solely by NPs and/or PAs were most likely to be in rural and health professional shortage areas where accessibility of physicians was low. The NP/ PA model helped fill the primary care needs of these underserved populations.\nIt is important to continue to monitor trends in these primary care models. The Health Resources and Services Administration estimated that there will be a shortage of 23 640 full-time equivalent primary care physicians by 2025, with shortages prevalent in most states. 13 In contrast, all states are predicted to have a surplus of NPs and most states will have a surplus of PAs. 13 Based on the patterns of provider utilization and health care delivery in 2013, the period covered by our study, HRSA indicated that the projected shortage of physicians can be effectively mitigated if NP and PA services are fully utilized. As shown in our study, NP and PA care are provided through either the shared care model or NP/PA model. A continued growth of these models is likely. However, it should be recognized that the models of primary care delivery can be affected by many factors. For example, there has been a growth in adoption of telehealth, which can help expand access to primary care and influence how primary care professionals are involved in care delivery. 8, 26 Our study was based on services billed in Medicare claims data, which limited the research questions that could be addressed. Future studies are warranted to investigate the nature of shared care among primary care professionals and its impact on patient centered outcomes. The shared care we defined in this paper includes care provided by a team in the same practice location or care provided by a group that may or may not be in the same practice location. Team care and group care are distinct in the way professionals work together. 27 The value of effective team care has been well documented, 28 research is needed for group care in patientcentered integrated delivery system. We also need to better understand the factors that underlie these observed shifts in primary care delivery from health care financing and organizational perspectives. Our study included primary care physicians, NPs, and PAs as primary care professionals. 13 Other professionals such as pharmacists have been recognized as primary care clinician in some states. 29 Future research needs to consider this issue. Nonetheless, the growing trend toward shared care aligns with the extant evidence of a substantial adoption of team care in primary care delivery. Nationally, 53% of office-based primary care physicians worked with NPs or PAs in 2012. 30 The study findings and their implications should be interpreted in the context of the following limitations. First, there might be bias in the estimation of the prevalence of actual care delivery models as the classification of care model is based on claim data. Nonetheless, our primary purpose was to examine the temporal trends among alternative primary care models. Second, this study might underestimate the shared care model or the NP/PA model, and overestimate the traditional physician model due to \"incident billing,\" in which NPs and PAs who provide care under the direct supervision of a physician are billed under the physician. To examine whether \"incident billing\" would affect the study results, we repeated our analyses using data from the states that NPs had full scope-of-practice authority and were not required to provide care under a collaborative agreement with or the direct supervision of a physician. The rate of incident billing was lower in these states compared to states with reduced or restricted NP practice authority. 31 We found consistent results. Third, we were unable to calculate patient panel size due to the limitation that the data is a 5% random sample, which would otherwise provide a more thorough picture of the capacity of the primary care model. Fourth, our study was based on office visits and did not include nonoffice visits. In our data, we observed a general decline in rural beneficiaries across three care models over time, which might be due to increased use of telemedicine visits. 32 Fifth, focusing on patients with Medicare feefor-service coverage limits generalization to Medicaid beneficiaries and privately insured patients. Future studies are needed to examine whether similar patterns and rates of growth of the three care models exist in patients with Medicaid or commercial insurance."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "We found that primary care physicians, NPs, and PAs are increasingly engaged in shared care practice.
