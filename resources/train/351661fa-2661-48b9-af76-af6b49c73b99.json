[{"section_title": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "The nearshore zone is the energetic area of the coastal environment where ocean waves shoal and interact with local morphology. It is an area of dramatic and rapid change as seen by our ever-varying eroding and accreting shorelines. This region is very important to many different groups for a variety of reasons ranging from recreational opportunities to economic investments to coastal zone management to national defense. Problems associated with coastal erosion impacts coupled with increased development along the oceans have created a strong need for knowledge of how this complex system behaves. Effective coastal management policy and sound, sustainable coastal development rely on a detailed understanding of the processes at work in this region in addition to accurate measurements of the specific changes in morphology occurring at a particular site. The measurement of bathymetry is critical to achieving both of the above goals. In a more applied sense, a collection of bathymetric surveys in one specific area can. provide a measure of profile adjustment (i.e. erosion and accretion). Theoretically and scientifically, bathymetry measurements are essential for studying the fluid processes that are responsible for the movement of sand. The objective of the work presented in this paper is to develop an accurate and simple tool for collecting bathymetric survey data that can later be used for coastal management studies or as input into theoretical models of nearshore processes. The dynamics of nearshore processes is composed of the interdependency of an evolving wave field over a shoaling bathymetry and the changes in that bathymetry as a result of those waves. As deep ocean waves propagate towards the shallow nearshore, their initially sinusoidal form become strongly nonlinear. As waves steepen and break, energy is shifted into higher frequencies [Elgar and Guza, 1985] associated with turbulent motions and into lower frequencies associated with mean currents, undertow and infragravity waves (low frequency waves with periods on the order of 60 seconds). The evolution of the wave field and the types of fluid motions forced during wave shoaling are completely dependent on the existence and the shape of the local bathymetry since bathyrnetry acts as the bottom boundary condition for nearshore flows [Holman, et al., 1993]. The bathymetry itself is constantly in flux, moving from one state to another depending on the wave conditions. Turbulent motions near the sediment-water interface and superimposed low frequency flows result in sediment suspension and transport in the surf zone. Subsequent changes in bathymetry can occur on time scales as short as hours to days (such as in the presence of large storm waves and increased infragravity energy) and on spatial scales on the order of meters to kilometers. The relationship becomes very complex as the evolution of the wave field now responds to an altered bathymetry. Nonlinear feedback is associated with the potential for chaos and the development of complexity in the system (which is, in fact, observed). To understand naturally occurring nonlinear systems, the collection of a long time series of system behavior is required. This includes measurements of both the fluids and the sediments."}, {"section_title": "The Importance of the Offshore Profile", "text": "The offshore beach profile forms the bottom boundary condition for all fluid motions in the nearshore. The shoaling profile causes waves to steepen and eventually break, moving energy into higher frequencies and turbulence. Details of this breaking depend on the nature of the beach profile. On a planar beach, breaking will be distributed over a broad region while on a barred beach, breaking wifi be focused over the sand bar and on the shoreline with a quiet region between. Waves breaking at an angle to the beach carry with them a sho reward flux of longshore directed momentum, termed radiation stress, that drives the longshore current [Longuer-Higgins, 1970]. Since longshore currents are driven by breaking waves, the predicted structure of the current will depend on the distribution of breaking. On barred beaches, this would imply that the largest longshore currents would be found along the sand bar where breaking is initiated. However, field experiments have shown that the greatest magnitudes of the current actually occur shoreward of the bar within the trough f Whitford and Thornton, 1988]. Thus, the profile is important in determining, in part, the location and strength of the longshore current. The formation and characteristics of edge waves is also highly dependent on the local morphology. Edge waves are low frequency gravity waves that propagate parallel to the shoreline. They are the result refractive trapping of wave energy near the shoreline. The sloping profile acts as a wave guide that traps the edge wave within the surf zone [Oltinan-Shay and Howd, 1993]. The characteristics of an edge wave are different depending on the types or slopes of the beach profile [Holman and Bowen, 1979]. On planar beaches, the amplitude of the edge wave is a maximum at the shoreline and decreases offshore. However, on complex topographies,studies have revealed that edge waves may also become trapped over offshore sand bars, concentrating energy along the bar rather than along the shore [Bryan and Bowen, 1996]. It is the offshore profile that determines the formation, location and persistence of edge waves. Theories and models involving mechanisms for edge wave growth and for the behavior of edge waves are heavily dependent on accurate measurements of the bathymetry. Not only is the profile critical for all nearshore fluid dynamics, it is also important to sediment suspension and transport. For example, rip channels and offshore canyons act as conduits for the movement of sand offshore. Low lying rip and cusp embayments on the shoreline allow increased run-up [Holland, et al., 1995] and, in turn, cause increased erosion in these areas. The presence of shallow depths over a sand bar cause increased breaking, turbulence and corresponding sediment suspension that could reinforce growth of the sand bar form. Finally, the profile is the actual quantitative measure of the beach response to overlying fluid motion. For many applications, such as coastal zone management, the erosion and accretion of beach topography is the most important measure of beach response."}, {"section_title": "Temporal and Spatial Variability ofthe Profile", "text": "The beach profile is always in a state of flux in response to varying wave conditions. The shape of the profile acts to dissipate wave energy by causing waves to break. This then serves as a natural buffer for the shoreline from the action of waves. Early studies of profiles focused on an annual winter/summer cycle. In the winter, large storm waves remove sand from the shoreline and move it offshore to form sand bars (Figure 1.1). These sand bars serve to dissipate storm energy by making waves break further offshore. In the summer, gentle swell waves bring the sand back onshore to form a profile characterized by a wide berm and smooth offshore gradient [Bascom, 1954]. The transition between the two states has been found to be dependent on wave steepness, sediment settling rates and beach slope. Wright and Short introduced more detailed descriptions of six beach states in which the shape of the profile was dependent upon not only wave conditions but also the preexisting beach state since bathymetry plays a large role in altering fluid motions in the surf zone [Wright and Short, 1984]. The six beach states show morphology response to variations in incident waves, subharmonic oscillations, infragravity motions, mean currents and rip currents. The first state is that of a low sloping, dissipative beach on which incident waves are dissipated by breaking and low frequency infragravity motions are dominant. The other extreme state is a steeply sloping reflective beach which is dominated by incident wave energy. The intermediate states are characterized by a more complex offshore bathymetry marked by longshore variability, offshore bars, rips channels and beach cusps.   Komar, 1976).  Wright and Short (1984). generally observed for each state, as well as typical beach slopes and cross-shore scalings. This method of classification was intended to be used a type of 'yardstick' by which all beaches could be measured and compared. While this method of description of beach states is much more extensive than the summer/winter profile terminology, it is still limited in its abilities to classify beaches with more complex sand bar systems. Lippmann and Holman devised an slightly modified classification scheme which allowed for a more objective quantification of both the temporal and spatial complexity of sand bar morphology [Lippmann and Holman, 19901. Eight beach states were identified based on four objective criteria: absence/presence of a sand bar, incident/infragravity scaling of the sand bar, the presence and rhythmicity of longshore variability, and the existence of a continuous versus discontinuous trough. These process-driven states were then closely studied with respect to their stability and natural transition sequence (i.e., the ordering of states in erosional and accretional sequences). While this study resulted in an improved assessment of beach states, it also visually identified the complexity of the nearshore morphology. In field experiments at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer's Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, North Carolina, the complexity of the spatial and temporal scales of the offshore sand bars has been revealed through detailed three-dimensional offshore surveys conducted by the Coastal Research Aniphibious Buggy (CRAB) [Birkemeier and Mason, 1984]. The CRAB is capable of resolving both cross-shore and longshore variability through densely spaced surveys covering a large area of the nearshore. For example, during the Delilah experiment in 1990, the CRAB performed daily surveys of a 525 m by 375 m region north of the pier [Birkeineier, et al., 1991]. The detailed surveys conducted at the FRF provide proof that the system changes on a variety of temporal and spatial scales and also reveal the need for more detailed and long term studies at other sites. Unfortunately, the surveys conducted with the CRAB require a tremendous logistical effort and can only be conducted at the FRF. The complexity of the offshore profile has been further revealed through video time exposures of the nearshore region at Duck, NC. The collection of ten-minute time exposures has allowed the visualization and quantification of nearshore morphology based on the breaking patterns of incident waves over shallow areas of the profile such as offshore sand bars [Lippmann and Hol,nan, 1989]. Figure 1.3 presents eleven time exposures collected in using an Argus Station which consists of an unmanned video camera connected to a PC-based image processor [Holman, et al., 1993]. The time exposures iii this figure were all collected during the spring at Duck and represent eleven years of complex morphological changes. This series ifiustrates the interannual variability of the profile and provides further evidence of the nonlinear complexity of the system. The images suggest that the common assumption of an alongshore uniform profile may not be correct on all beaches. Since an accurate representation of bathymetry is critical to the understanding of nearshore processes, the three dimensional variability of the profile should be included in models to obtain a more complete representation of the system. The interdependency between the fluid forcing and the sediment response is a topic of great importance in our understanding of the dynamics of the nearshore and the processes that cause accretion and erosion of beaches. In order to obtain a better understanding of the large scale interactions between the waves and sediment/morphology, it is necessary to have accurate measurements of both the wave field and the underlying topography Previous studies of the offshore profile indicate that in order to resolve the complex nonlinear morphological changes observed in the nearshore region, large-scale, long-term data sets of bathymnetry are desperately needed."}, {"section_title": "Collection ofBathymetric Data", "text": "Historically, the collection of offshore bathymetric profiles has been a costly and labor intensive task. This data may be difficult to collect during periods of large waves or strong currents. However, these conditions often represent the most energetic periods of Here we present a technique that will allow for the regular and automatic collection of profile data over long periods of time. This paper describes a method for remotely measuring the underwater topographyof the surf zone using data collected from video cameras. First, wave celerity, or wave .phase speed, is measured from remotely collected video intensity data and then local water depth is inferred based on linear wave theory. The measurement of wave phase speed and associated water depths made at a series of cross-shore positions provides us with a cross-shore profile of beach morphology. These remotely collected profiles may create a long and complete record of the large scale morphology changes at a particular site, in addition to providing depth data for testing of various nearshore process models. Incorporation of the technique into the automated sampling routine of the well-established Argus Stations will allow for a more comprehensive and long-term sampling of nearshore bathymetry, a pre-requisite to the study of the large-scale behavior of profile response. The collection of nearshore data using remote sensing video techniques has proven to be a valuable alternative to sampling using fixed instruments located within the surf zone. For example, Lippmann and Holnian [1989] developed a video time exposure technique for quantifying morphological scales of sand bars based on wave breaking and dissipation. Holland et al. [1995] found a sensible relationship between observations of run-up measured using video techniques and those measured using the more traditional resistance-wire run-up method. Plant arid Holman [in press] measured the slope of the foreshore by mapping video estimates of the shoreline position throughout the tidal cycle. These are Just a few of the techniques that have shown video to be an accurate and appealing technique for measuring nearshore processes. Remote sensing techniques are an aflractive tool for measuring physical processes because they allow for sampling over large spatial (centimeters to kilometers) and temporal scales (seconds to years) [Holland, et al., 1997]. Video techniques also have the advantage over traditional in-situ instrumentation in that they do not involve the deployment of any instruments into the suif zone and can be used to investigate a large range of wave conditions over a long period of time at a low cost [Holman, et al., 1993]. Breaking waves and strong currents make in-situ sampling logistically difficult and may create a damaging environment to sensitive instrumentation. Another advantage of the remote sensing techniques is that the design of the spatial sampling arrays can be created or modified any time to suit the needs of the user. Hence, video techniques for bathymetry estimation allow more complete data sets to be used for the study of largescale, long term profile change. This thesis has two primary objectives. The first is to introduce a video-based technique for the estimation of bottom bathymetry. The second objective is to test estimates against ground truth data, describe the conditions under which accurate depth estimates are expected, and determine the confidence interval for that estimate. Chapter 2 provides a general background on wave phase speed and on the techniques that have been used to measure this quantity in the nearshore. In Chapter 3 the video technique for estimating bathyrnetry is discussed in detail. Chapter 4 presents the results of the video depth analysis from the Delilah experiment in Duck, North Carolina and from Argus Stations located at Duck, North Carolina and Agate Beach, Oregon. Chapter 5 presents a discussion of the accuracy of the technique and of the conditions under which it can best be applied. Chapter 6 contains a brief summary of the final conclusions of this research."}, {"section_title": "BACKGROUND", "text": "The phase speed of a wave is the speed with which a wave form propagates. It is distinct from the speed of propagation of wave energy, known as the group velocity. Phase speed can be calculated from the phase difference between wave records collected at two different points along the wave form {Brillouin, 19601. For example, in the case of surface gravity waves, this signal can be sea surface elevation measurements from surface piercing wave staffs or sea level pressure measurements from pressure transducers. The phase speed, or celerity, c, is defined as the wavelength, L, divided by the wave period, T, or equivalently, where the wavenumber, k, is defined as 2it/L, and the radial frequency, a, is defmed as 2icTT. Airy wave theory, or linear wave theory, is the simplest small amplitude solution of a wave form. In this theory the wavenumber and frequency are related through the dispersion equation, where g is the acceleration of gravity and h is the local water depth. From equations (2.1) and (2.2) the celerity of a wave based on linear wave theory is"}, {"section_title": "3) kcr", "text": "Approximations to the exact solution exist for wave propagating in deep and shallow water. As the depth becomes very large (tanh(kh) -1), we can define a simple deep water The deep water approximations for phase speed is expressed as (2.5) a 2ir which is valid for h/L,> 0.25. In shallow water (h/L0 < 0.05), tanh(kh) is approximately equal to the argument (k/i) and the phase speed of a wave simplifies to 2 c2 (2.6) which is no longer dependent on the wave period but is solely a function of the depth of water through which the wave is propagating. Linear theory is generally an adequate solution for wave propagation in the surf zone. However, higher order theories that account for finite amplitude effects may be more appropriate under large wave conditions [Koinar, 19761. Solitary wave theory is one example of a number of higher order theories. It is based on an asymptotic solution for the higher order Cnoidal wave theory in which the wave period approaches infinity. This solution describes a single progressive crest that has no oscillatory motions, no wave period and no wavelength [Komar, 19761.  propagation and phase speed in order to predict surf conditions in landing operations. In the I 950's, techniques for measuring phase speed in the field were employed that were based on the movement of an identifiable feature of the wave, for example, a wave crest, past fixed points. Early measurements obtained using time-lapse aerial photography were based on the observation of individual wave crests passing a fixed point such as pilings at the end of a pier Fuchs, 1953}. Long crested, high amplitude waves were critical to this study in that they created a well defmed wave crest. It was found that super-imposed wind waves obscured smaller amplitude waves, making individual crests more difficult to identify [Wiegel and Fuchs, 1953]. A later technique involved the use of incremented wave poles placed across the breaker zone. Suhayda and Pettigrew [1977] investigated the phase speeds of individual breaking waves across the surf zone using photographs of the crests that were taken over a specified sampling interval. The average wave crest speed was then approximated by measuring the distance a particular wave crest had moved over the interval of time. The ratio of measured celerity to that predicted by solitary theory was found to increase as waves progressed from offshore towards the break point. Maximum discrepancies were observed at the break point where measured celerities were approximately 20% greater than those predicted by solitary theory and in the mid-surf zone where measured values were approximately 20% less than predicted values. Problems were noted in the visual determination of the wave crest due to the evolving shape of the wave. Errors in the caiculat ion were also attributed to the fact that the speed of the crest does not represent the speed of the wave as a whole. This study alluded to the benefits of data collection using continually recording wave staffs and set the stage for more advanced measurement techniques which soon followed. Eventually, wave phase speed calculations were made from data automatically collected from wave staffs or pressure sensors. As a part of the Nearshore Sediment Transport Study, Thornton and Guza [1982] used time series collected from current meters and pressure sensors to study wave phase speeds inside the surf zone. Using pairs of wave gauges aligned perpendicular to the beach, cross-spectra were calculated to obtain information on the frequency dependent relative phase difference, 4(f), between the wave at the two sensor locations. The phase speed was then calculated between two adjacent sensors using the relationship 2rfAx (2.8) where c is the cross-shore component of phase speed and Ax is the spatial separation between sensor [Thornton and Guza, 19821. For this particular study, the incident wave approach was approximately shore-normal, therefore the longshore component of phase speed could be. ignored.  Figure 2.1, lower panel). The slope of this line could then be a robust estimate of celerity. The calculation of phase speed using this constant sloped phase ramp produces a constant speed at a particular cross-shore location across all frequencies in shallow water depths, indicating that the waves are frequency non-dispersive ( Figure 2.2). Figure 2.3 present the celerity spectra calculated at various depths across the surf zone. Again, the estimated celerities are consistent with linear theory in that the phase speeds were frequency non-dispersive and traveled as a ftmnction of water depth. Some effects of finite amplitude can be observed in the measured phase speeds as some values are slightly greater than that predicted by linear theory."}, {"section_title": "Video Techniques", "text": "The speed of progressive waves may potentially be observable using video-based techniques.

The observed relationship between the true wave signal and a remotely sensed video signal can be described by a modulation transfer function (MTF). A MTF is a linear spectral representation of the relative amplitudes and phases between an input signal and an output signal. The relationship between the Fourier transform of the input signal X(f) and the Fourier transform of the output signal G(f) can be expressed as where the magnitude of M(t) is the modulation transfer function [Gonzales and Woods, 19921. Thus, the complex gain function can be used to describe the relationship between both the phases and amplitudes of the visual signature of the waves and the true wave form. Techniques described in this paper will primarily be based on signal phases. The brightness of the sky varies from very bright near the horizon to darker near zenith, a variation called the sky gradient [Lynch and Livingston, 1995]. Offshore from the breakpoint, a wave can be seen because of the specular (directional) reflection of the sky gradient on the slope of the sea surface. For example, when standing on the beach, onshore propagating waves can be identified by the dark front face of the wave (reflecting in the near zenith sky brightness) while the back face wifi be brighter, ifnot hidden from view. The angle of view of the surface then also determines how strong the visible wave signal will be. For example, if one were to look along a wave crest, there wifi be no sea surface slope component in the direction of view; therefore, the wave would not be as easily discernable as if the view were directly into the wave crest. In the region prior to wave breaking, the MTF is a spatially steady function with a fixed phase relationship between the visual representation of the waves and the true amplitude and phase, dependent on the angle between the camera and the wave approach. Once waves move onshore and begin to break, individual wave crests can be recognized by diffuse (scattered) reflection from the white foam associated with the turbulence of breaking. Since the signature of the wave is now marked by a white face rather than the darker faces observed outside of the break point, the MTF shows a different, yet still coherent, phase relationship between the remotely sensed signal and the true signal. Because the reflection is diffuse, there is no longer any dependence on viewing geometry. Lippmann and Holman [1991 tested the relationship of remotely sensed video data to the actual wave form by comparing time series of pressure data and video pixel intensity taken at a position within the surf zone. A visual correlation between the co-located time series of video intensity and pressure in Figure 2.4 shows similar peaks marking the progression of wave crests. Cross spectra between video and pressure sensor data show a high coherence between the two in the incident frequency band ( Figure 2.5) indicating that video may serve as a valid proxy for the phase progression of breaking waves [Lippmann and Holman, 1991]. Lippmann and Holman further tested the capability of video data analysis for estimation of phase speed and wave angle of individual breaking waves using data frpm the 1990 Delilah experiment in Duck, NC. Video data of the surf zone were collected from a northeast facing camera that was positioned on a tower approximately 43 meters above the beach. Using pixel intensity time series collected with a square array, 4m wide, composed of four pixel sensor locations, phase speeds and wave angles were calculated. The time lag of wave propagation past sensors that were spatially separated in the crossshore was calculated in both the time and frequency domains. In the time domain, traveltime of the wave was calculated using a lagged cross-covariance function. In the frequency domain, cross-spectra were first computed and then time lags were derived from the linear ramp in the phase spectra (equation 2.8). The speed of the wave was then calculated as the separation distance divided by this time lag.   .6 Amplitude, coherence, phase, and celerity spectra between time series collected from sensors separated 1 8m in the cross-shore for both pressure (left column) and intensity data (right column). All spectra were computed for 52 degrees of freedom. The linear (solid line) and solitary (dashed line) theory approximations are plotted on the celerity spectra for comparison (from Lippmann and Holman, 1991). instrumentation. Celerities were reasonably consistent with the solitary wave theory estimate of phase speed, showing the presence of some amplitude dispersion [Lippmann and Hol,nan, 1991]. It seems quite reasonable that the individual point estimates of celerity found by Lippmann and Holrnan could be extended to allow full cross-shore coverage. This involves the extension of the pair-wise calculation to an array of locations and then the estimation of wave phase speed along the transect. Once this measurement has been done, the automatic estimation of full transects of water depths can be calculated from phase speed based on linear theory."}, {"section_title": "VIDEO TECHNIQUE FOR BATHYMETRY ESTIMATION", "text": "From equation (23), the local water depth at cross-shore position, x, can be defmed as The presence of the hyperbolic tangent in equation 3.1 makes the expression for depth complicated to work with.

Figure 3.1 presents a comparison between the full dispersion relationship and the shallow water approximation. In Figure 3.1(a), water depth normalized by the deep water wavelength is plotted versus the wavelength normalized by the deep water wavelength. The two curves begin to diverge visually at LJLO -0.55. This value can also be found making use of h/L = 1/20 and tanh(kh)-0.95(kh) as the shallow water, limits. As L'LO approaches 1, the ability to estimate water depth becomes very sensitive to errors in wavelength and the technique becomes unstable. and the corresponding relative error in water depth (dh/h).

The cross-shore wavenumber is determined from analysis of wave phase structure using a frequency domain empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) of the data collected from the cross-shore array. The CEOF analysis is a method for detecthg propagating signals from data collected over spatially separated sensors. The technique involves eigenvector analysis of the cross-spectral matrix within a frequency band of interest. This type of analysis allows waves of different frequencies to be resolved and then defines their amplitudes and phases through the first mode of the eigenvectors [Wallace and Dickinson, 1972]. For the video technique, the input signal is that of pixel intensity, I(x,t). The Fourier transform of the data is represented as Y(x,f) = FT(1(x,t)). (3.5) The cross-spectral matrix is then calculated as where Y is the complex conjugate of the Fourier transform and <> represents an ensemble averaging, here approximated by averaging over the frequencies within the band of interest. The cross-spectrum is then normalized by the diagonal matrix, , which contains the variance &(x1) at each position.

The phase, 4, and amplitude, A, at each cross-shore position can be calculated as A(x).j(a2(x)+b2(x)) ,and Finally wavenumber is calculated as the cross-shore gradient in phase [Merrtfield and Guza, 1990]. (3.13) For regions for which A(x) is large, the cross-shore phase structure of the mode is likely to be significant. Low amplitudes at the ends of the array and erratic fluctuations of amplitudes within the array are indications of a noisy signal and low coherence across the array [Merrfield and Guza, 1990]. To avoid spurious results, a threshold amplitude was arbitrarily chosen as 0.70, below which the EOF structure was considered to be unreliable. The proposed technique for estimating cross-shore wavenumber was tested using a synthetic time series based on a shore-normal ten second wave shoaling on a beach with a slope of 0.02. The amplitude structure (Figure 3.3a) shows that the first EOF explains approximately 100% of the variance uniformly across the beach. A phase ramp, shown to steepen onshore (Figure 3.3b), indicates a shoreward progressive wave whose phase speed decreases as it shoals. From the slope of this phase ramp, the cross-shore wavenumber (Figure 3.3c) is calculated. Knowing the wave period of this test a priori (or in the case on a natural beach, from the frequency selection described in section 3.1), the depth can then be estimated using equation (33) arid compared to the input depth profile ( Figure   3.3d).

Because of wave refraction, wave-wave interaction, and wave breaking, coherence between sensors is not expected over very large spatial scales [Lippmann and Holman, 1991]. Therefore, a cross-shore sensor spacing of 5 m was used in the array design The cross-shore pixel array shown in Figure 4.3 consists of 25 locations extending from 100 to 225 m in the cross-shore and is located at FRF longshore coordinate 870 m.

A frequency-space plot showing the variability of the wave spectra at each cross-shore location (Figure 4.5) can be used to identify areas where the wave signal is best observed in the video data. The spectral peak is clearly defined between x = 140 m and x = 190 m due to a highly visible wave signal resulting from wave breaking over the bar. The absence of a spectral peak at some locations offshore of the breakpoint indicate that the wave signal is not as strong in this region. Cross-spectra were computed between each pair of adjacent sensors. The coherence between each pair was used to test if the signal of the wave was being sensed at the incident frequency by each pixel in the array.

The coherence between each sensor pair is plotted for every frequency. White stars indicate the frequency of maximum coherence. The 95% confidence interval is 0.14. The phase and celerity spectra were also examined for each pair of adjacent sensors.  In order to more closely examine specific areas along the profile, we have focused on the spectra, coherence, phase and celerity spectra calculated between two specific sensor pairs. In shallow water, celerity should be frequency non-dispersive and vary only as a function of water depth. While a relatively smooth structure is apparent, the celerity spectra measured from the intensity data does not show the same stability observed in observations from in-situ wave gauges. The incident frequency band lies between the two horizontal white lines.   depth (x-38). In Figure 4.11(b), estimated water depths calculated using equation (33) are compared to CRAB survey profiles that were collected daily during the Delilah experiment. The RMS difference error between the estimated and surveyed depths is 0.6 14 mover locations where the CEOF amplitudes are greater than 0.70.  Figure 4.9 Cross-spectra between two pixels located over the sand bar, October 8, 1990 at 1612 GMT: log spectral density (a), coherence (b), phase (c), and celerity spectra (d). Coherence is high within the incident frequency band and the corresponding phase ramp is well defined. The celerity spectrum is stable across all frequencies greater than 0.05 S4.    In the area of the profile associated with the onset of breaking, waves evolve from a sinusoid to a steep and peaky form as they begin to shoal and break, and nonlinear mixing occurs between frequencies. Video techniques for detecting propagating waves are dominated by signals near the wave crest. Just before breaking, the peaky crests created by the harmonics of the fundamental frequency shift forward. The video techniques tend to track this forward pitching face of the wave rather than the wave phase associated with the fundamental frequency which actually lies seaward of the steep face. In this region, the phase speed as measured with video data will appear faster than the true speed of the incident waves due to the evolving form of the waves resulting from nonhinearities associated with shoaling. The relationship between wave form and the intensity signal is described by a MTF. At the break point, the MTF phase changes rapidly from the specular offshore phase to the diffuse scattering signature in the surf zone. While both are coherent and spatially stable in phase, they are distinctly different and individual to the signature of the wave in each region. In the region of the profile marked by both breaking and non-breaking waves, a mix of the two different MTF's will beat down the coherence between adjacent sensors. The region of the break point can be identified by areas of high intensity along a crossshore transect. A peak in a plot of mean intensity across the array (Figure 4.12) defines the position of the break point to be located around x = 180 m over an offshore sand bar. In this region, the low amplitudes from the first mode of the CEOF and resulting poor depth estimates maybe be attributed to the strong shift in the MTF. The location of the onset of breaking, where results are expected to be in error, shifts with tidal elevation. Thus, use can be made of estimates from a range of tides to provide stable measure of depth across the entire profile. Mean averages of depth estimates throughout one tidal cycle were compared to survey depths and the RMS difference errors were calculated (Figure 4.13). The depth at x = 142.5 m was generally overestimated with    Figure 4.13(a), the estimated depth at this location was deeper during high tide than during low tide. Averaging water depths over the tidal cycle is seen to result in a more reliable estimate of water depth as breaking patterns change with the tide."}, {"section_title": "Duck, North Carolina Argus Station", "text": "The accuracy of the technique was tested using intensity data routinely collected from the Argus Station located in Duck, North Carolina. M Argus Station is a long-term remotely-operated video camera connected to a PC-based image processor. Hourly snapshots and time exposures of the surf zone are downloaded to a central computer each night and added to a continually growing database of video images [Hotman, et at., 19933. Argus Stations are currently located in Oregon, North Carolina, California, Hawaii, the Netherlands, England, and Australia. The site in Duck provides an excellent place to test the video technique because regular bi-weekly offshore surveys are conducted at the site and can serve as ground truth for estimated depths. In March 1997, the collection of intensity timestacks was incorporated into the hourly sampling routine of snapshots and time exposures at Duck. This will continue to be an ongoing part of the automatic video data collection at the site. The results presented here are from data collected between April 1 and June 17, 1997. Each timestack of intensity data represents a 17 minute run sampled at a rate of 1 Hz. During this three month period, a total of 794 data runs were analyzed, spanning a wide variety of wave conditions and beach morphologies. Six CRAB surveys of offshore bathymetry were conducted during the study period on April 3, April 5, April 30, May14, June 10 and June 17, 1997 (Figure 4.14). These surveys serve as ground truth for the profiles estimated during the three month study period. Vertical changes in the offshore profile during the five CRAB surveys exceeded I m in some locations along the profile (b). Wave data for this period were obtained from the 8 m array located slightly northeast of the FRF pier (Figure 4.2). Data on incident frequency, wave height, and wave angle were computed as means over three-hour sampling periods (Figure 4.15). Tide data were available for this period from the NOAA tide gauge located at the end of the pier. The ready-availability of these data at the Site provides an ideal opportunity for ground truth testing of the technique. "}, {"section_title": "Water Depth Analysis", "text": "Water depths were calculated at each position in the array for every timestack collected between April 1 and June 17, 1997 using the techniques described in Chapter 3. The analyses were conducted similarly to those completed for the Delilah data set; however, the spectra were calculated using 42 degrees of freedom and a bandwidth of 0.0205 s. For each of the 18 cross-shore position pairs, depth estimates were made for all of the 794 times resulting in approximately 12704 independent realizations of water depth. Before examining the statistics of the whole set of results from the Duck Argus     Station, the data were screened based on three criteria that eliminated physically impossible or statistically unstable estimates: 1. The first criteria was that only onshore phase speed would be used in the estimation of water depth. In the coordinate system defmed for Duck, a wave moving towards the shore would be moving in a negative x direction corresponding to a negative wavenumber. We limited our depth estimates to those instances where the wavenumbers calculated from the CEOF were negative. 2. Second, analysis was limited to deep water waves. Therefore, wavelengths were only considered if they were less than 0.9 times the theoretical deep water wavelength (see previous discussion in Chapter 3). 3. Finally, estimated depths were only considered for which the corresponding amplitude from the CEOF was greater than 0.70. Low amplitudes may be an indication of a very noisy signal or low coherence between adjacent sensors. Screening the initial results using the above criteria eliminated approximately 75% of the estimates from the data set. The remaining 3000 points were used to calculate bulk statistics on the accuracy of the technique. These statistics were used to determine confidence intervals for the estimates and to examine the validity of the technique and the conditions under which the estimates were most consistent with ground truth data."}, {"section_title": "Definitions of Statistics Describing Performance", "text": "The data set was sub-divided into one week periods of time; therefore, at each crossshore position, from a few to as many as 100 tide-corrected depths, h(x), were estimated. The most obvious way is to first look at the mean water depth at each location, h(x), which is defined as where N is the number of observations of depth at each cross-shore position [Bendat and Piersol, 1986]. By nature of the video analysis, depths are constrained to always be less than zero (depth is defined as a negative value). Thus, estimates can only be slightly too shallow but, potentially, can be much too large. Averaging by an arithmetic mean can therefore be biased too deep. An alternate method for obtaining a single value from a set of estimates and for helping to reduce the bias is to calculate the geometric mean. The geometric mean is simply the sample mean calculated in log space and can be defined as The geometric mean is useful when looking at data whose values are constrained at one end. Two further measures can be defmed from the probability distribution function (pdf) of the estimates for any one location. The median is the value for which 50% of the estimates are greater and 50% of the estimates are less [Davis, 1973]. It is often considered to be the most robust measure since it is less sensitive to outliers. The mode is the value that occurs with the greatest frequency and can be identified by the peak of a probability density function. The mode, while being the most probable value, is also the values that is most sensitive to details in the pdf; therefore, it is the least stable estimate. For a symmetric frequency distribution, the mean, median and mode are the same value. However, for an asymmetric frequency distribution, as is the case with the depth estimates, the mean, median and mode represent three distinct values. In order to determine the best representation for the suite of water depths at each cross-shore position, averaged weekly profiles are calculated using each method and then bulk error statistics are used to evaluate the performance of each estimator. Any approximation of a single value from a set of values will have a confidence interval about the estimate based on the variance of the data around the estimate. The central limit theorem states that the mean of a set of N random variables will be normally distributed with an expected value of p., the population mean, and a variance of s2/N, where the sample variance s2 is calculated as s2(x)=__(h(x) h(x))2 (43) [Bendat and Piersol, 1986]. The confidence interval of the estimate is then calculated as the probability with which the estimated value will be within one standard deviation of the true value. Based on the central limit theorem, an error associated with the estimates, E(x), can be defined as where s is the standard deviation of the estimates. A 95% confidence interval for the mean true water depth, h(x), based on an estimated mean water depth, h, and the sample variance is given by the following probability statement h(x) E <h (x) <h(x) 0.95 (4.5) [Bendat and Piersol, 19861. This definition is only valid for confidence intervals for the arithmetic mean. However, we also used this value as a proxy for the confidence interval for the geometric mean, median and mode. E(x) provided us with a useful measure of the spread in the estimates, h, around the central value and allow for the creation of confidence intervals around each estimate. Each seven-day average estimate was compared to CRAB surveyed profile data to examine the accuracy of the video technique. However, CRAB surveys were collected on average only every three weeks. As a results, some of the estimated profiles may potentially be compared to a CRAB profile that is out of date. Based on the evolution of the profile between successive surveys, an error on the ground truth data was created to serve as a measure of the validity of the ground truth for the estimates to which it is being compared. The error in the ground truth data at each cross-shore position, x, for each time, t, is defmed to be ttl (4.6) v2-1 ) where h1(x,t1) is the survey being compared to the estimates, h(x,tz) is the next closest survey, t1 is the time of the comparison survey, and t2 is the time of the next closest survey (which may proceed or follow t1). Negative error is indicative of erosion between successive surveys while a positive error is representative of accretion. On plots of the estimated profile compared to the surveyed profile, the A(x,t) is plotted to provide an envelope of possible true depths represented by the two surveys. Once the average estimated profile had been determined, confidence intervals established, and an error on ground truth defined, bulk statistics on the estimated profile were calculated to evaluate the performance of each of the four techniques for estimating water depth (mean, geometric mean, median and mode). Two basic quantities were used to investigate the accuracy of the estimates: a ratio error and a difference error. The first statistic is a direct comparison between the estimates and the true values, a normalized depth estimate, where a value of 1 is representative of perfect agreement between the estimates and the true value. The mean ratio error can be calculated across the entire profile for each weekly estimate by where N is the number of cross-shore locations. A weighted mean can also be calculated across the profile as :R%XI) (4.9)"}, {"section_title": "XYE(x1)", "text": "This estimate de-weights the values that have high error bars associated with them (those in which you have little confidence) and puts more weight on the estimates with narrower confidence intervals. The second quantity investigated is a difference error which is defined to be Based on this definition, a difference error of 0 indicates total agreement between the estimates arid the ground truth. A negative value of D indicates an overestimate, as water depths in this study are defined to be negative. A mean difference across the profile and a weighted mean difference can be calculated following the formulation above, equations  These six bulk statistics were calculated for each profile estimated using the four techniques previously described. They serve to evaluate the performance of the estimators and allow the selection of one method as the most appropriate estimator for future analyses."}, {"section_title": "Evaluation of Depth Estimators", "text": "For each weekly subset of depth data, a single water depth was calculated at each crossshore position using the four techniques described in section 4.2.1. to be more biased towards the deeper water depths than the median. In this example, (R)man= 1.156 while (Rw)mj,,=i.O59. In this case, the mode,(R)m= 1.039, and the median more accurately estimated the true water depth. In general, the most accurate estimates tended to occur where the confidence interval were the smallest, and consequently were the most believable of the estimates.   Bulk statistics for the ratio errors are presented in Table 4.1. The median is generally shown to provide a more accurate estimate of the water depth over all times. The mean of the R calculated over all times was closest to 1, an indication of an accurate estimate, using the median depth as the representation for the set of estimates, mean(R)mea,n = 1.448. However for the weighted estimates (Table 4. The tables presented indicate that the best method for selecting a single depth estimate out of a suite of estimates is to determine the median of the values. The mean ratio error between the median depth and the true depth was 1.49 over the eleven week period. The ratio error weighted by the confidence interval associated with each depth was 1.34. Generally, the estimated water depths were 34% deeper than the actual surveyed water depths. The time-averaged difference error, ideally equal to 0, was -0.942 m while the weighted value was -0.407 m. Negative rms errors indicate that the video technique generally overestimated the true water depth. Finally, the eleven week averaged rms difference error for the median was 1.864 m and the corresponding weighted error was 0.672 m. Video-based depth estimates calculated as the median depth at each cross-shore location can be expected to be within approximately 70 cm of the true water depth.   First, the accuracy of the technique was examined relative to actual water depths to determine if the technique works better in one region of the profile over another. A gentle trend was observed in the relationship of difference errors to true water depth (    like. To investigate this phenomenon and the effects on the estimated water depths, difference errors and estimate variance were plotted against the gradient in mean intensity between adjacent cross-shore positions, dI/dx (Figure 4.21). The Onset of breaking is identified by a high magnitude, negative gradient in intensity, as the signature of the wave changes from a dark face to white foam associated with breaking. A positive gradient is generally associated with wave reformation within the surf zone after breaking. Errors were expected to increase as the magnitude of the negative gradients increased. While this was not observed in the data, Figure 4.21 does illustrate that the variance of the estimates was significantly more scattered for negative gradients than for positive gradients where the corresponding difference errors were generally low, on the order of I m. It also has been hypothesized that water depth may be overestimated in regions where finite amplitude effects are significant. In these regions, the speed of the wave may be dependent not only on the water depth but also on the local wave height. To investigate the possible effects of finite amplitude, errors were examined with respect to the standard deviation of intensity at each cross-shore position. High standard deviation at one point represents a wide range of intensity values that may serve as a proxy for the progression of high amplitude waves past that point. Figure 4.22 shows the relationship between the difference errors and the variance of the estimates to the standard deviation of intensity. The expected relationship between high standard deviations and the high errors was not observed in either figure.  under some wave conditions, correct depth estimates may not be achieved if waves cannot be detected by video through variations in pixel intensity. The data from the Duck Argus Station provided an excellent opportunity for ground truthing the video technique.

The environmental conditions during the time of sampling play a large role in the collection of meaningful tirnestacks. Rain, fog, and poor lighting conditions all obscure the visual impression of the waves. Additionally, the angle of the sun, or time of day, plays an important role in that the sun can serve to highlight the face of wave crests making them easy to identify or alternately, at a different time of the day, to mask the signal of the waves due to a glare created on the ocean's surface. The position of the camera contributes directly to the visibility of the waves, and hence, to the accuracy of the technique. For example, if the camera were aligned to look directly offshore, then the face of the waves becomes more obvious. In an oblique or alongshore view, as is the case with the Duck and Agate Beach Argus Stations, the camera may be oriented along-wave so that the signature of the waves becomes lost, as the wave crests are not as easily discernible from the rest of the ocean surface. Additionally, an ideal sampling scenario would involve positioning the camera relatively close to the area of interest to improve pixel resolution. For more distant cameras, pixel resolution decreases as does the accuracy of the estimation of phase speed and bathymetry. At Duck, the pixel resolution for the cross-shore array is approximately 0.6mfpixeI while the resolution at Agate Beach is slightly greater, 0.4m/pixel. Certain wave conditions are more advantageous for use with the video technique. A clean narrow banded swell makes the task of identif'ing a peak frequency rather straight forward. A broad banded or directionally spread spectra contains many different wave frequencies and wavelengths, making it difficult to resolve the frequency of interest. Additionally, low amplitude waves (H<O.25 m) may be difficult to detect from long distances, especially if in the presence of superimposed wind chop. However under clean waves conditions, some low amplitude swell can be quite visible and produce very reliable depth estimates that will not be contaminated by fmite amplitude dispersion effects. The environmental conditions present at during the time of sampling will play an important role in the collection of a meaningful tirnestack. After the intensity timestacks have been collected and depths have been estimated using the video technique, it is important to have indicators of when the results are reliable. In section 4.2.1, three criteria were introduced for screening the data for physically impossible or statistically meaningless estimates. Depth estimations were limited only to cases where: (1) the wavenumber was negative indicating shoreward progressive waves; (2) the wavelength was less than 0.9 times the deep water wavelength; and (3) the corresponding CEOF amplitude was greater than 0.70. However, in the examples presented here, the data were not pre-selec ted against a number of known potential sampling problems. In the future, it may be possible to implement a number of pre-filters so that stable depth estimates can be more readily achieved. It is first important to determine if the waves are visible to the camera. One parameter to examine would be the mean pixel intensity at each location in the array. images with significantly low mean intensities (7 <25) correspond to dark or foggy images and should automatically be excluded from all calculations. The variance of the pixel intensity at each cross-shore position also provides an indication as to whether the waves are visible to the camera. The propagation of a wave past a single pixel location is observed through the variations in pixel intensity at that point (see section 2.3 for details). Hence, very low variance magnitudes indicate that the signal of the wave is not well defined visually and accurate estimates of wave phase will be difficult to obtain. A final possible pre-filter for the data would be to examine the pair-wise coherence between adjacent pixel locations along the array. High coherence between two sensors within the incident band is an indication that the wave signal has been detected by the remote sensing techniques and a stable estimate of phase can then be expected."}, {"section_title": "Possible Explanations for incorrect Estimates", "text": "There are three major reasons why the video techniques explained here may provide incorrect estimates of depth. The first is that the relationship between the wave form and the video signal of the wave may not be adequately understood or properly defined. Other possible errors may reside in the analysis techniques chosen to extract phase information from the intensity data. A third possibility is that the phase speed estimated by the video technique may be inconsistent with the theoretical expression for shallow water phase speed."}, {"section_title": "Video Related Error", "text": "One explanation for incorrect depth estimates may be that in some areas of the profile the remotely sensed wave signal is not truly representative of the actual wave form, for example, in the region of the profile near the break point. Here, both breaking and nonbreaking waves are present, each having its own distinct visual manifestation of the true wave. In this region, a single MTF cannot be identified to represent the signal due to the non-coherent interaction of phases from two individual MTFs. Additional problems will arise as waves shoal and become highly nonlinear. Here, the video signal of the wave is marked by the leading crest of the wave. In this case, the phase of the MTF is not spatially stable because as the wave form evolves, the visual signature also begins to change as the crest shifts forward. Hence, the MTF may be dominated by this distinctive, leading wave crest and not faithfully describe the fundamental frequency of the true wave signal."}, {"section_title": "CEOF Re'ated Error", "text": "The CEOF analysis is a robust method for determining the phase relationship across a spatial array; however, it may be sensitive to array length and sensor spacing. The CEOF fails in some regions of the profile, because it is not able to detect the propagating signal at each location. Figure 5.1 shows the sensor by sensor coherence for the example from the Delilah experiment. The coherence is high towards the center of the array but drops off as the sensor spacing increases. Merrifield and Guza [1990] showed that for a fixed wavenumber band of interest, the recovery of the signal at the ends of an array reduced with increasing array length and found that the performance of the CEOF analysis depends on the spread in wavenumber relative to the array size. To obtain the most accurate results using long spatial arrays, a narrow wavenumber band should be investigated. Alternately, if a broad wavenumber band is of interest, a shorter array may be used to retain maximum coherence between the endpoints of the array. This indicates that a piecewise approach to the CEOF may be a viable alternative. By separating the array into smaller areas of interest, perhaps greater coherence can be achieved between sensors and the percentage of the variance explained by the first mode of the EOF will increase, thus increasing the accuracy of the estimates.  Figure 5.1 Amplitudes from the cross-spectral matrix of intensity data for October 8, 1990 in Duck, North Carolina. Amplitude values of 1 are found along the diagonal where there is perfect coherence between each sensor and itself. Amplitudes are seen to decrease for sensor spacing greater than approximately 40m. Amplitudes are also low at the ends of the array where coherence between sensors drops significantly."}, {"section_title": "Discrepancies Between Estimated and Theoretical Phase Speed", "text": "Another possible alternative for discrepancies between the estimated and the true profiles may be rooted in the physics of wave phase speed rather than the techniques used to measure it. In some cases, the phase speed measured using the video technique may not agree with the theoretical representation of phase speed. Phase speeds in the nearshore can be affected by many physical processes such as surface drift currents, mean flows, and rip currents [Plant and Wright, 1980], the directional sprearl of wave energy [Huang and Tang, 1977], and the presence of shorter waves traveling on low frequency long waves [Phillips, 1981]. Estimated phase speeds may also be compared to those predicted by solitary theory which accounts for the effects of fmite amplitude dispersion. While linear wave theory is generally accurate within a first order approximation, some data have suggested that solitary theory may be a more appropriate and accurate estimator of phase speed at shallower locations within the surf zone [Thornton and Guza, 19821. The potential errors associated with inferring water depths from linear theory (h1) rather than solitary theory (hg) can be calculated from equations (2.6) and (2.7) as where the ratio li/h is taken to be 0.42 in the saturated surf zone [Thornton and Gaza, 19821. If fmite amplitude effects are significantly present, water depths estimated within the surf zone using linear theory may be wrong by a factor of 1.42. At the break point, the ratio of H/h may be as high as 0.76, resulting in larger areas in the region of breaking."}, {"section_title": "Future Work", "text": "Future field work is planned for the continued development and ground truthing of the video technique. In September 1997, additional field tests will be carried out in Duck, North Carolina as a part of the SandyDuck experiment. During this experiment, in-situ instrument arrays of pressure sensors and current meters will be deployed and detailed surveys will be collected daily by the CRAB. This will provide an excellent opportunity for obtaining ground truth for water depths estimated from timestacks collected from the Argus Station already in operation at the site. Several changes in the sampling technique will be employed during SandyDuck. First, an offshore looking camera will augment existing views for collection of timestacks. The angle of the camera into the face of the waves will improve the visual signature of the waves. The cross-shore pixel array will be more densely sampled using a smaller sensor spacing (i.e., dx = 2.5 m). This will allow for greater flexibility during the CEOF analysis when choosing the optimal spacing between sensors for achieving the greatest coherence. Additional cross-shore transects will be added to the pixel array design in order to examine the longshore stability of phase speed and bathymetry estimates. Depth estimates will then be compared to daily CRAB surveys to obtain greater insight on the expected accuracy. Finally, an array of pixels will be co-located with a cross-shore array of in-situ instrumentation both inside and outside of the surf zone. Using data collected from pressure sensors or current meters, a direct comparison can be made between the video estimated phase speeds and those measured using data from the wave gauges. Using these data, the phase relationship between video data and broken waves and, especially, video data and unbroken waves can be more closely examined.

Initial tests using Delilah data showed the RMS difference error between the estimated and true water depths for the profile on October 8, 1990 to be 0.6 13 m for those depths where the corresponding CEOF amplitudes were greater than 0.70. During this data run, the cross-shore region prior to wave breaking appeared to be a difficult area of the profile over which to estimate phase speed and water depth due to the changing phase relationship between the video signal and unbroken waves and the video signal and steepening, breaking waves. Averaging the depth estimates over a tidal cycle has been shown to ameliorate the problems in this transition region by shifting the breakpoint to various regions along the profile. Timestacks collected from the Duck Argus Station allowed for the development of an automated technique and for the estimation of long term profile evolution. Weekly averaged profiles were calculated by calculating the median depth at each cross-shore position along the array. Confidence intervals were determined for each estimated depth by measuring the standard deviation of all the estimates about the mean. The weighted, time-averaged ratio error was 1.34 and the weighted RMS difference error was 0.672 m over the eleven week study period. This indicates that depth estimates are generally within 34% of the true water depth. Using timestacks from the Agate Beach Argus Station, the stability of each profile estimate and the consistency between estimates was examined. Again, one week average profiles were calculated using the median water depth at each location and confidence intervals were determined from the standard deviation of the estimates at each location. The elevation and slope of the foreshore remained very consistent and stable through time. The foreshore slope of the estimated profiles was consistent with beach slopes previously observed at the site ((=O.01). Additionally, comparisons of the estimated profiles to the locations of sand bars present in the rectified time exposures from the same day suggest that the topography revealed in the estimates may be a good first order approximation of the offshore profile. The estimated depths at cross-shore positions where the error bars were small (O.3m or less) were relatively stable through time. These results indicate that the technique is capable of producing consistent and reasonable results on high energy beaches. However, ground truth data are essential for critically evaluating the performance and establishing the accuracy of the technique. The preliminary results of this technique are promising. They demonstrate that an array of pixel locations can be used similarly to an array of in-situ wave gauges to gather information on wave phase. They also show that remotely-sensed video data can be used as an alternate to traditional surveying methods for obtaining a first order approximation of nearshore bathymetry. Additional work is needed to increase the accuracy and reduce the associated error bars before the estimated profiles can be used as data for nearshore modeling or in shoreline/profile monitoring programs. However, the results presented in this thesis provide reason to continue work on developing this technique and encouragement that it will provide a useful tool for nearshore oceanographers and coastal managers."}]
