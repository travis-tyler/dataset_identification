For the first time in human history, Thurow noted that knowledge workers had become the wealthiest people in the world. This signaled a profound transformation from the importance of education to the future. Higher cost in tuition and fees may prohibit students from entering graduate education as well as reverse achievements in ethnic diversity through education."}, {"section_title": "Purpose", "text": "The purpose of the research was to predict the differences in the educational debt level of doctoral graduates at Texas Tech University (TTU) in relation to their academic characteristics, family background, and demographics.

In an economic dovmtum, TTU increased tuition and fees 19% over the four years analyzed in the study. This purposive sample represented doctoral students attending Texas Tech University when the increases were implemented from 1998-2001. Therefore, generalizabihty is limited to comparable institutions. Justification Statement Johnstone (1972) reflected that the rising cost of higher education had outran the capacity or willingness of either government or parents to meet the entire bill. Bradshaw (1983) reported that the drastic rise in the cost of education increased the importance of short-term loans at all institutions. WiUiams-Harold (1998) reported that about 70% of Black, Hispanic, and Asian University student dropouts blame the burden of student loans versus 43% of Whites who blamed student loan debt as cause to dropout. Even more alarming was that students reported taking the credit card route to pay tuition and fees. In many cases, what the graduate student needed were emergency funds to resolve an immediate problem. Conventional financial aid offered in higher education institutions does not make available emergency assistance to students (Bradshaw, 1983). Whether conventional financial aid or emergency loan funds, increases in financial aid enlarged the risk that a student may abandon graduate education due to rising cost and debt burden. In such a situation, the increase in the loan amount simply escalated the debt in the student's loan portfolio. This forced the student to leave the university to earn the necessary emergency funds with plans to return after solving the problem. More often than not, the student failed to return to the imiversity and defaulted on the portfolio of conventional financial aid loans. If emergency dollars were not available for a student in need, the result may be an unalterable process that forced the student to withdraw from the imiversity. When conventional financial aid officials were able to make funds available, funds usually were in the form of an increased loan package. This often does not serve the student, because (a) tiie crisis is inunediate and (b) the student may not be able to stay at the university to receive the support in the next loan cycle. Penn and Vejil (1976) believed that enlightened policy development and effective program implementation would over-come money management barriers disadvantaged students face due to lack of experience. Bradshaw (1983) argued that the increasing cost of education was causing financial aid offices to look for altemative programs to assist students. One such program often overlooked by students and aid administrators was the short-term emergency loan. Thus, the interest may be changing on the use and consideration of the emergency loan as a viable tool to assist in student retention. Bradshaw (1983) postulated that short-term loan programs may be part of the answer to maintaining enrollment. A short-term loan may address: (a) a family crisis, (b) a death in the family, (c) a child's need, (d) the separation from a spouse, and (e) a divorce. More importantly, the loan request gave the university an opportunity to direct the graduate student to counseling, encoirrage the development of a debt management strategy, review the goal of graduation, and provide positive support with a financial disbursement. Though the short-term emergency loans may be more malleable in serving the interest of the student, an increase in debt occurred when this is the option available to meet an immediate need. Universities and students have an investment to protect. Livingstone (2003) stated that individual investment in higher education represented a reasonable choice as long as economic costs of obtaining an education (in terms of tuition fees and deferred income) were not prohibitive. No professor wanted to lose students that have potential but distiracted from their studies by a personal dilemma beyond their control. No student wanted to walk away from their education because the sfress of problems impaired the ability to concentrate on research. Emergency loans and conventional financial aid are tools that served graduate students challenged and reliant on an institution to provide sufficient resources to meet their needs."}, {"section_title": "Human Capital", "text": "Human capital means to invest in oneself and one's family. Investment in oneself and one's family contributes to the well being of the individual, household, and community. The importance of human capital theory and government poUcy about student loan debt contributed to the comprehension to develop a model to assist financial aid administrators, staff, and faculty advising graduate students and families about higher education financing. If graduate students mismanaged loan funds, the likelihood was the creation of a prohibitive level of debt. Human capital theory refined the importance of education as a benefit in maintaining a civil society. Legislators argued since the Civil War that restraint of violence in a civil society relied on the underpinning of an educated populace. The belief of government was that education influenced allegiance, industrialization, and economic vitality. Legislators developed programs that legitimized human capital investinent in education to promote individual benchmark gains and expansion of the market economy. This shady looked at the embedded cost of education that created cumulative debt level tiirough human capital investment in oneself Gittins (2003) pointed out that education is a human capital investment and a higher-educated workforce permits more rapid adoption of new technologies. Graduate students borrow millions of dollars to be prepared by colleges and universities to eam at a higher rate than individuals without a higher education as presented in Figure 1.1. Becker (1964) observed that earnings understated the value of college graduates, because social productivity (their effect on development and spread of knowledge) goes unnoticed by society. The commoditization of education engenders greater discussion about the public good of education. The human capital investment by a student in education ( Figure 1.1) improves potential earnings and contributes to the well-being of the community.  Mincer (1958) noted that differences in tiraining result in differences in levels of earmngs. Education provides a life path that increases income dispersion with age. Syverson (2001) pointed out that not only did earnings rise with degrees, unemployment rates decreased. Syverson reported that the unemployment rates for graduate degree holders were 1.6% for those with a master's and 1.4% for those with a doctorate."}, {"section_title": "Research Hypotheses", "text": "The study compared the level of educational debt to the academic characteristics and demographics of doctoral graduates at Texas Tech University.

The research analyzed differences in cumulative debt level by racial group, parental education level, and marital status from data reported on the Survey of Eamed Doctorates by graduated doctoral students. The data were analyzed to identify the relationship among predictor variables and the criterion variable. The review of literature addresses: (a) a historical overview of the development of financial aid in education, (b) credit card and loan debt of students, and (c) the role of demographics in the formation of student debt. This review of literature provides insight into guiding principles that encourage the use of debt to achieve higher education. Kaufinan (1972) found federal aid to education based in the political notion that an educated populace served the national needs. In 1865, the Committee on Reconstraction recommended establishment of a Department of Education (DOE) to the 39* Congress in order to assess national educational needs. The DOE was established in 1867. The rationale was related to seeking a cause for the Civil War. Congress believed education preserved institutions and that the absence of common schools and education directly related to the Civil War. The assumption was that educated people behave in a rational and political way rather than in a physical and aggressive one (Kaufinan, 1972)."}, {"section_title": "Overview of Financial Aid", "text": "Education legislation after the Civil War defmed the direction of the nation before the Second Industrial Revolution. Two unsuccessful pieces of legislation-the Hoar Amendment of 1870 and the Blair Amendment of 1881-focused on the question of federal responsibility in education. The Hoar Amendment presented the necessity of an educated public to maintain a republican form of government and the preservation of national existence in the new industrial age. The Blair Amendment proposed support for public schools and federal aid to prepare the workforce for the growing demands of the industrial revolution. The Hoar and Blair Amendments outlined that a literate public was a necessity for industrial expansion and a republican form of government. Though this legislation failed due to states' rights issues, the enlightened public saw widespread education as the cure for America's troubles. In 1917, the Congress passed the Smith-Hughes Act. This legislation provided federal aid to vocational-training programs in various frades. For the first time in history, federal legislation designed to set the national agenda on federal aid in education was behind a rapid succession of laws that benefited vocational training (Kaufman, 1972). Kaufinan (1972) reviewed the 1940 Lanham Act that provided emergency federal aid for schools and other local government needs. This legislation established the modem role of the federal government in education. In 1944, The Servicemen's Readjustinent Act (GI Bill of Rights) guaranteed educational opportunity to returning veterans of World War II. Legislators believed that education led to behaviors that would increase the well-being of the individual and the general growth and development of the nation. In 1957, the Soviet Union's space laimch served as the catalyst to pass the National Defense Education Act of 1958. The hope of the legislation was to advance the United States into scientific leadership. The National Defense Education Act of 1958 sanctioned the notion that borrowing for college was an acceptable practice. Livingstone (2003) stated that human capital theory through greater individual and aggregate investinents in learning activities led to greater individual and societal economic benefits. Legislators sought to enhance the nation through investing and encouraging citizens to believe tiiat investment in education was right. The legislature passed several other aid bills to shape the nature of the educational effort for the national good and promote a superior competitive position in the worid arena. Although equal opportunity for citizens was an issue throughout all federal legislation, legislators de-emphasized equal opportunity as a major issue in the passage of federal legislation. Kallio (1994) noted that federal aid influenced the decision where a graduate student chose to attend graduate school. Kallio found men more likely to continue their studies after completing the baccalaureate degrees. Also, graduate school students tended to rely on spouse, family, and work considerations as well as the well-being of their spouse in the selection of a university. The university that invests in the satisfaction of the spouse may recruit married graduate students much easier. Kallio (1994) identified six key factors that graduate students used in selecting a graduate school to attend: (a) residency status, (b) characteristics of the academic environment of the institution and its programs, (c) work-related concems, (d) spouse considerations, (e) financial aid, and (f) the social environment of campus life. Of the six factors, residency, academic, and work considerations were the greatest influences on sttident decisions. The research completed by Kallio showed the importance of the family in the selection process. Credit Card and Loan Debt Pahner, Pinto, and Parente (2001) pointed out that if traditional indicators are used, such as debt-to-income ratio, time employed, and other debts, then the vast majority of stiidents probably would be mcapable of obtaining a credit card. Haddad and Patel (2001) reported that university adminisfrators often gave credit card companies access to their students. Credit card issuers financed campus activities and alumni programs for the privilege of marketing their brand name. If students are unable to create credit card debt as undergraduates, one may hypothesize that graduate schools will benefit. The graduate student enters graduate school less the sfress of monthly payments toward credit card debt. When credit cards are not used, students use guaranteed loans and other debt instruments to support their graduate education. King and Bannon (2002) reported that 71%) of students from families with incomes less than $20,000 graduated with debt, compared to 44% of students from families with incomes more than $100,000. Palmer et al. (2001) established through research that parental/guardian involvement as co-obligor tended to lead to lower credit card balances. Haddad and Patel (2001) found that, since 1998, the average student's debt from credit cards rose 46%, $2,748, while nearly 1 in 10 owed more than $7,000. The researchers reported that credit card issuers targeted college students, because they were (a) debt free, (b) had disposable income, (c) borrowed to their limit, and (d) paid minimum monthly charges. Schultz (1960) reasoned that education was an investinent in human capital and presumed to be worth borrowing for. Syverson (2002) calculated that average debt for master's students was $29,319 and doctorate recipients borrowed $34,659 to complete academic programs. The researcher argued that borrowing might not be altogether bad since students are investing in their own human capital. Nellie Mae (2002) reported 16%of loan debt owed by students was credit card debt. Chien and DeVaney (2001) stated that credit card issuers made little or no effort to review borrowers' financial status. Credit card issuers required minimum monthly payments that mathematically guaranteed the user would be in debt for a long time. Chien and DeVaney reported that consumers with low current incomes financed consumption predicated on higher future income. Hayhoe, Leach, Tumer, Brain, and Lav^ence (2000) found that female students were more likely than men to report feeling sorry a purchase was made and writing a check with insufficient funds. Tsiros and Mittal (2000) fotmd that regret was the result of comparing one's outcome with a better outcome that would have occurred had a different altemative been selected. Hayhoe et al. (2000) concluded that male and female students did not differ on the practices of paying interest, making minimum payments, and feeling they did a good job managing their finances. Students were unable to identify problems with their debt creation practices. Chien and DeVaney (2001) suggested that educators needed to distinguish between general and specific attitudes associated with credit use. They found that this helped consumers focus on decisions involved with an installment loan or charging on a credit card. Credit card use was influenced by demographics and economic factors. Stiidents as consumers were not equipped without advisement to manage debt level issues. Malveaux (2001) reported that students liked credit cards for the same reasons as their parents. Credit cards served as a convenience or provided a bridge between hard times and good ones. As a result, students used credit cards as an income supplement. Parents cosigned for just 15% of the credit cards used by students. Students failed to realize that a scarred credit report would hurt future job prospects. Zhou and Su (2000) found that the combined burden of student loans and credit card debt may lead to unaffordable problems for students when scratinized for employment. McWade (1996) stated that graduate students who used credit cards to support their academic program set up five pitfalls: (a) tie up future income, (b) easy to overspend, (c) high interest charge, (d) risk credit rating, and (e) student budget unable to manage increased debt. The researcher encouraged students to balance expenses with their resources."}, {"section_title": "The Education Resources Institute (TERI) and The Institute for Higher Education", "text": "Pohcy joint study (1995) reported that 62% of black non-Hispanic, 54%. white non-Hispanic, and 60% of Hispanic students borrow to achieve higher education. The study sfressed that every effort must be made that advanced education not be overtaken by rising cost to individuals that result from their increased need to borrow. Increased debt may compel students to seek academic majors that provide high earnings and dissuade students from professions in public service or employment in rural areas where salaries may not be competitive. Demographic: Debt Accumulation Factors Scott (2001) identified factors that conspired to keep poor stiidents out of college: (a) The Clinton Adminisfration focused on tax breaks for middle-and upper-middlemcome famihes, not the poor who pay little or nothing in taxes, (b) most new state aid programs are aimed at stiidents with high grades, who typically are more affluent, (c) most of the increase in available sttident aid has been in the form of loans, not grants, (d) the best aid program for low-income stiidents, federal Pell Grants, has not kept pace with the rising cost of attending college, and (e) state fimding has not kept up with the rising cost of higher education, prompting raises in tiiition. Scott (2001) reported that in the 1980-81 academic year, grants made up 55% of aid and loans 41%, but the numbers reversed in 1999-2000 grants 40% and loans 59% awarded to stiidents. Churaman (1992) reported that family financial management issues and intergenerational equity must be considered to manage the escalating cost of education. The full development of human capital was at risk due to changing family patterns and the need for national policy decisions on federal aid to education. The concentration of female heads of households was disproportionately high in the Black community. Parental contribution was significantly influenced by family type, race, and savings patterns of parents. In family financing of college education, parents played the ultimate role of aid adminisfrators. Churaman (1992) stated that 70% of students from female single-parent famihes received financial aid, as compared to 47% of those from male single-parent families and 44% from two-parent families. Smgle female-parents were disadvantaged in saving due to mcome. Black single female-parents were in a significantly worse wealth building position, because ethnic barriers limited job opportunity. The researcher suggested that business and government policy makers rethink financial aid practices to meet the challenges of the demand for diversity, a more competent and productive workforce. Hayhoe et al. (2000) found that single female stiidents with high affective credit attitiide scores and high income were more likely to purchase clothes with their credit cards. Punch (as cited by Hayhoe et al., 2000) reported that fiill-time college stiidents represented over 60 billion dollars in buying power. Lennon, Lillethun, and Buckland (1999) found that college women faced a different challenge than men. Women believed they had to maintain an attractive image (p. 383). The researchers attiibuted the behavior to the years of media advertisement watched by women that linked image to self-esteem. Women are awarded less money in grants and loans to achieve an education. They entered the university burdened with a sociological norm that affected their available resources. Moran (1987) fotmd that since 1970, college enrollment of women increased 77%, compared to a 23% increase for men. Results of the study showed women received 68 cents in college earnings, 73 cents m grants, and 84 cents in loans for every dollar received by a man in the same fund categories. Women tended to depend on low-cost institutions to get their education. More often women were listed as independent, not affiliated with a college or major and imclassified students that presented barriers to participating in financial aid programs. Single women with children faced the greatest unmet need under current student aid policies. Child care was a significant cost that increased financial need, created a higher drop-out rate, and required part-time work to supplement their college costs. Financial aid policies failed to make an adjustment to assist women with their academic goals. Women relied on family assistance and parttime work rather than increase financial aid through the Guaranteed Student Loan program. Wolf-Wendel, Baker, and Morphew (2000) studied the underrepresentation of eamed doctorates among females. The researchers found instiiictional expenditiire per stiident a positive predictor of doctoral productivity. Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-serving Institutions (HSIs), and women colleges graduated higher proportions of women that subsequently eamed doctorates compared to predominately White coeducational institutions. Hayhoe, et al. (2000) concluded that understanding differences that were gender-based may help financial counselors and educators better target programs to individuals. Their study indicated that males required more basic fraining in financial practices, while female needed to focus on budgeting clothing purchases. However, HBCUs and HSIs spent less instractional expenditures per student and maintained competitive productivity preparing women to receive the doctorate degree. The researchers concluded that endovmients or spending more money does not guarantee productivity. Efficient uistitutions with high productivity shared a focused mission dedicated to serving a specific population of students. All females fared better in environments that nurtured their baccalaureate achievements not driven by maledominated values. The Institute for Higher Education (2002) found that due to the escalating costs of education, students from high-income families were more likely to attend doctorate granting institutions, while students from low income families were more hkely to attend proprietary schools. Thomas Mortenson, a higher education pohcy analyst (as cited by Scott, 2001) suggested, in a meeting of higher education experts, that the most efficient and fairest way to use financial aid was to focus on low-income students with grants that did not have to be repaid. Scott's research indicated that the gap between whites and minorities in higher education was widening. The cost of education without sufficient subsidy penalized the families and students. The erosion of grants forced families and students with aversion to debt to borrow money. Dennis (1993) believed that the student and family should start financial aid planning six months to a year prior to requesting institutional aid. Parents need to decide what part of their financial contribution will come from past savings, current income, and future borrowing. Fisher (2001) reported that 80% of Black students completed their undergraduate degree with an average debt load of $13,000, which discouraged them from going to graduate school. Yieh (as cited in Chien & DeVaney, 2001) found that households headed by African American, female, married, unemployed, and those who rented were likely to have a negative attitude toward instalhnent borrowing. Malveaux (2001) warned credit card debt might be particularly difficult for Afiican American students.\nPolicy study (1995) reported that borrowing increased three times faster than college cost and four times faster than personal incomes. Similarly, 68% of the respondents in their study considered stiident loans necessary and a major hardship for students and families when combined with escalating college costs. Students and families believed that education is not an optional purchase or debt, but an essential objective despite the hardship of debt. Avery and Hoxby (2003) stated that students were the largest human capital investment in the nation because when graduated they will become \"walking capital stock\" of considerable size (income-generating power). Fisher (2001) reported that HBCU presidents called for an increase in the Pell Grant maximum award from $3750 to $6000. The presidents wanted incentives tied to the increase to encourage excellence. Moore (1995) noted that changes in the Guaranteed Student Loan Program hampered middle-class stiidents seeking the advantages of higher education. With reshictions tightened on the availability of this stiident financial aid, Moore saw no significant decrease in stiident borrowers. Stiidents remained steadfast in their belief that higher education was a means to a desirable end, a way to find satisfaction in Ufe. The Guaranteed Student Loan was considered a loan of convenience. However, the loan's popularity among students dropped, with students continuing to use the loan borrowing a greater sum. McWade (1996) reasoned that students should consider five things before creating a debt: (a) future income, (b) amount of time needed to repay loan, (c) interest rate charged, (d) personal hfestyle planned after graduation, and (e) unexpected circumstances that could alter future income or the ability to repay amount borrowed. McWade presented that the long-term impact of debt needed to be considered by students prior to any decision about debt accumulation. TERI and The Institute for Higher Education Pohcy joint study (1996) reported that graduate students used the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL), formerly known as the Guaranteed Student Loan program, and the Federal Dfrect Student Loan as their primary debt creation instniment. The FFEL program is insured by the state or non-profit guarantee agencies and re-insured by the federal government. Borrowers have a six-or nine-month grace period to start repayment after leaving the university. The FFEL and FDSL accrae interest that must be paid from origination. FDSL originates with colleges or universities. Capital for these loans is provided through the United States Treasury. Qualified borrowers may get their loan subsidized which means the federal government paid the interest while the student is in school through the grace period before repayment begins. Unsubsidized FFEL and FDSL require that the stiident is responsible for interest and principal with no government participation in payment of interest (TERI and The Institute for Higher Education Policy, 1995). Among White students, loan default increased in famihes where the income was below $17,000, dependent children were present, and parents were separated, divorced, or widowed. Degree completion lowered the loan default rate among all ethnic groups. The grade point average of the student was a stiong indicator that corresponded to positive repayment behaviors. Family and money management skills played an important role in how a student used or abused their financial aid. Kobliner (1995) reported that student debt, resulting from borrowing under federal loan programs at 347 institutions, rose 47% between 1992 and 1994. With graduate school tuition rising twice as fast as inflation, graduate students were foimd to borrow more to stay in the uistitution. In 1992, Congress raised the ceiling on the maximum amount graduate students could borrow in federal loans from $11,500 to $18,500, a 61%) increase. Graduate students stacked graduate student loans on top of undergraduate loans of $ 10,000 or more in the majority of cases. Students received more professional advice when purchasing a vehicle or property. As student loan recipients, students received very littie, if any, professional advice about debt management. The average student loan debt has nearly doubled over the past eight years to $16,928 (King & Bannon, 2002). In their stiidy. King and Bannon found that 39% of student borrowers now graduate with unmanageable levels of debt that exceed more than 8%) of their monthly incomes. Figures from Nellie Mae (2002) showed that the average percentage of borrower's monthly income that goes toward student loan payment was 12%) with the median being 8%. With graduate tuition rising twice as fast as inflation, graduate students have had to borrow to continue their graduate education (TERI and The Institute for Higher Education Policy 1996). Zhou and Su (2000) identified that the increased cost of college-education caused student borrowers to delay starting families, purchasing new homes, and making other major life decisions. Nelson and Lovitts (2001) suggested that institutions provide a combination of assistantships and grants to allow a graduate student to live through the academic years without going into debt. Their research demonsfrated that colleges and universities may take a series of steps to create a more hospitable environment for graduate students. McWade (1996) concluded that graduate students needed to pursue institutional aid opporhinities. This combined with other programs, such as scholarships, and fellowships, reduced the escalation of debt. In summary, the review of literature emphasized the importance of cumulative debt level associated with completion of doctoral academic programs. The Education Resources Institiite and The Institiite for Higher Education Policy (1995) reported that borrowing increased at a rate nearly tiiree tunes as fast as college costs and four tunes as fast as personal incomes. The research organization suggested that borrowing would jump from $23 bilhon in 1995 to $50 bilhon by the year 2000. The stiidy pointed out that debt levels increased at a faster rate among older students, part-timers, and minorities. The Education Resources Institiite and The Institiite for Higher Education Policy (1996) reported that graduate and professional stiidents borrowed even faster than the record rate of increase in total student loan borrowing. The researchers found that graduate and professional students accounted for 19 percent of all stiident borrowers but borrowed 28 percent of the total stiident loan dollars. The stiidy indicated that graduate and professional students were creating a new class of indebted stiidents with substantial increases in sum borrowed and number of stiidents borrowing. King and Bannon (2002) found that 64% of students borrowed in 1999-2000 compared to 42% m 1992-93. Syverson (2002) wrote that the most serious issue facing graduate students was the amount of education-related debt accumulated through undergraduate and graduate study. The researcher reported that as costs rose and federal loan regulations liberalized, students used more loans to finance their undergraduate and graduate education. Syverson presented that increased cost challenged the commitment to diversification of student population concemed the graduate community, and advocated development of new programs to stiengthen the enterprise of graduate education. Syverson (2001) noted that Afiican Americans and Hispanics were not represented in higher education in a percentage representative of their national population. Penn and Vejil (1976) stated that money management skills should become an intricate part of financial aid programs. Moran (1987) sfressed that enrolhnent of women has increased significantly at colleges and imiversities, but women received less in financial aid than their male counterparts. Moran reported that women were more likely to default on their student loans. Women are challenged by childcare, inconsistent aid practices, financial and social barriers males do not face. The literature in numerous studies stated concern about the impact of debt due to credit card use and student loans to achieve an education. Rising tuition and fees were identified as factors contributing to the cumulative debt level among doctoral students."}, {"section_title": "Debt Levels", "text": "The researcher found that Afiican American stiidents were more likely than others to file for bankruptcy's because tiieir parents were not able to bail them out of credit card problems. St. John (1998) reported Black students were carrying a hghter debt load than their White and Asian peers. The researcher found that 69% of Afiican Americans dropped out of college because of high student loan debt. Additionally, 59% of the African American student loan borrowers felt \"extiemely\" or \"very\" burdened by stiident loan payments. In 1997, the stiident debt level for Afiican Americans was $16,800, compared to $18,900 for Whites, and $20,900 for Asian borrowers.  Szelest, Cabrera, and Napierski-Prancl (1998) determined that after three decades of public investment to remove economic barriers to attend and persist in college, problems still remain. The researchers used a nationally representative database of student loan borrowers to examine the similarities and differences among White, Afiican Americans, and Hispanics. Loan defaults ranged from 30% to 60% among Afiican coming from families of little education. During the 1980s, federal loan volume grew 58% and default claims grew 1200% equal to over a fifth of total program costs. The family income related issue was the lower the family income, the lower the opportunities to perform well in college and to persist. A stiong indicator of loan default was being Black from a low-income family. Low levels of loan defaults included being Asian or White, having a college-educated parent, and coming from a family with an income above $30,000. Students reahzed loan repayment was required, so ignorance and misinformation seemed not to be a factor in loan default. The causes stipulated for Afiican American and Hispanic defaulters were unemployment, dissatisfaction with educational programs, and personal problems that interfered with repayment ability."}, {"section_title": "CHAPTER m METHODOLOGY Population and Sample", "text": "The population were graduates from Texas Tech University (TTU) who have completed their doctoral programs.

There are four threats to intemal validity ui the current study: (a) subject characteristics, (b) subject attitude, (c) history, and (d) location. Subject characteristics may present a problem (e.g., international students). These students may be uncomfortable discussing debt when the response may require referencing family assets. The best confrol is to affirm confidentiality with coded questionnaires and informing respondents that no one handling the surveys will be able to identify respondents by name. Subject attitude is another potential threat. Participants may get upset because it often will be the first time to analyze debt created while getting an education. Because of embarrassment, subjects may refiise to complete the survey. The best control for this is advising participants that information obtained may be instrumental in building a more cost-effective way to attend graduate school.

"}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Education is an essential component to human capital formation. Mincer (1958) reported that there was a hfe path income differential among racial groups with college education and high school or less. St. John (1998)  There should be a concern about the impact that cumulative debt has on non-White students. Becker (1964) reported that the earnings from a college education were not the most important factor. The researcher expressed that the knowledge, mentoring, and service to the community were the significant elements of college education. Non-White community may forfeit the most important benefits of college education offers due to escalation of tuition and fees that increase demand to borrow more. The instability of financial support from tiie state and federal governments is subject to contiibute to irreparable harm being done to non-White students seeking higher education. Failure to serve tiiis population impacted by social mores that discourage accumulation of debt will slow and alter the number of students from disenfranchised populations from pursue of mainsfream opportunities through education. The escalation of tuition and fees increase cumulative debt through loans that make the goal of higher education appear out of reach or not worth the burden of long-term debt for students undecided about graduate education. The nation does not want any population to conclude that an improved quality of life is unaffordable in our democratic society. Intellectual democratization requires that the best and brightest have seats in colleges and universities. State and federal governments must intervene with financial support that reassures the disenfranchised populations opportunities to achieve higher education will remain available despite increased tuition and fees. The greatest threat to the United States is disenfranchisement and belief by an individual or groups that neither hope nor opportunity exists. Government intervention is an element in funding education needed where famihes are unable to contribute fully. In graduate education, the data mdicate that parents do not influence debt accumulation of their family members who are students. Parents may not have influence for numerous reasons. Graduate students may be using debt confrol measures taught in their family and parents are unable to enhance the stiident's ability to manage cumulative debt level. There may be siblings at home or other family members who need resources that prevent parents from having a role in cost management of graduate education. In the United States, the custom is for the family to help in part or total witii education through the bachelor's degree. Graduate stiidents are on their own to achieve a degree beyond the bachelor's. There is a real need to rethink the approach to funding education. The best practice in the future may be for the family and stiident to split the cost of the Bachelor degree. If the student decides to acquire an advanced degree, parents may pay 100% for the graduate degree. This modified practice allows the student to leave the university in a higher salary bracket, and with higher earnings, the students will have more resources to allocate toward education loan debt repayment. State and federal governments should support this modified practice with greater tax relief legislation for parents, because the student enters the market economy with a graduate degree in the 28% tax bracket the community, state and nation benefits. The current process has stiidents paying off significant debt over ten years on average or refinancing their education debt over fifteen to twenty years. This restricts students from full economic benefits of their education, and restricts then consumer consumption. A modified strategy driven by government legislative initiatives enlarges the market economy through maximizing the spending power of graduate students by minimizing cumulative debt level. Because graduate students contribute much to their communities with tiieur education, government needs to pass legislation that encourages parents to contmue their investment beyond the bachelor's degree. The idea to keep the parents involved, in the educational process until complete, may also contiibute to cumulative debt level reduction for married and unmarried graduates with family that assist. The sfrength of democracy is the family. Parental extended participation in the education process of the next generation protects democratic institutions. Marital status is significant in management of cumulative debt level. The research asserts that married students generate less debt than unmarried students. There is a likehhood that married graduate students plan financially to share and maintenance household cost. Societal expectations for married couples may drive their low cumulative debt level. Married stiidents have no expectation of parents fimding their risk. Graduate married students live with scarcity to maintain the autonomy of their households. Contributions from parents may mean forfeiture of some of that autonomy so married students' work to significantly reduce the need for assistance from financial sources beyond then household. One or both may work to manage the cumulative debt level. Legislation that promotes tax relief to accelerate married students' full participation in the market economy will encourage others to seek advance education. This concept rewards married graduate students for managmg their cumulative debt level while completing their graduate education. Moreover, tax relief for married graduate students will reduce the delay in home purchase. Married graduate stiidents will be able to eliminate their cumulative academic debt to expedite their investment m the community, which is a good for the consumer market economy. Unmarried graduate students generate considerably more in their cumulative debt level than married stiidents. This occurs for several reasons: (1) life-style choice, (2) payment for auxiliary services such as data enfry, prepared food, etc., and (3) credit card use. Unmarried graduate students do not have a spouse that provides support services in research paper preparation. With no family living in the household, unmarried students spend more time at entertainment venues that require an admission charge. Unmarried graduate students may be more likely to make greater use of their credit card to support their entertainment and academic needs. The impact of their behavior is that unmarried students may increase their request for student loans to maxunum levels and maximize credit card use. The combination of loans and credit card use contributes to unmarried graduate students' cumulative debt level. This study does not involve the level of credit card use by graduate students. The credit card debt is a part of the cumulative debt level. Unmarried and married graduate students as reported by Nellie Mae (2002) might have up to 16% of their debt from credit card use. This does not mean credit card use is negative, but the cumulative debt level that results from credit card use can become unmanageable as reported by King and Bannon (2002) for graduate students. Colleges and universities must take greater responsibihty m fmancial advising of graduate students to reduce the risk of students graduating with a prohibitive cumulative debt level. One area where advisors may focus attention is on time to degree. The longer a student takes to complete the degree; the greater the likelihood the cumulative debt level may increase. Time to degree (Appendix C) is an indicator for accumulation of debt while in graduate school. The research indicates tiiat non-White graduate students averse to cumulative debt may be particularly vuhierable to becoming dropouts if their time to degree increases the need for additional funding. When gender (Appendix E) is assessed, time to degree is important to females because the research indicates their funding for education may be less than what men receive. Therefore, females achieve the goal of a graduate education with fewer resources in the same time-frame as males. Time to degree has a significant relationship to cumulative debt level. The objectives for a graduate student is to master the curriculum with an efficient approved study sfrategy consistent with university requirement. Departments must constract degree plans to help graduate students achieve a quality graduate education at a least cost. Graduate students are consumers that contribute to the well being of the community and market economy when unburdened of education debt. This does not mean that debt is detiimental. Debt is a financial tool that may be an indicator of wealth gained and loss. To manage their cumulative debt level, graduate students need to understand tiiat debt must have purpose and an exit sfrategy. The graduate students that understand the important use of confroUable debt will become wealtii builders in the nation. The government can assist the process through estabhshmg a proprietary credit card coded to the college or university the graduate stiident is attending. This proprietary credit card can be fransportable and used to pay for tuition, fees, and services on the campus where the graduate stiident attends. Graduate stiidents that appear to have fiill financial confrol of then resources manage tiieir cumulative debt level with a higher efficiency. The estabhshment of a proprietary credit card can efficiently he withm present state and federal guidelines to protect pubhc funds from abuse by graduate students. In this study, nearly 50% reported a cumulative debt level associated with their doctoral program. The human capital expenditure to get a higher education continues to rise. Figure 1/1 shows that the life-time earnings potential make higher education a worthwhile investment. The research indicates that government has an opportunity to improve funding of education that disenfranchised populations may not be left behind. The challenges faced due to gender and ethnicity make debt accumulation an obstraction to the achievement of a graduate education. Debt is not negative but the mismanagement of debt is. To maximize human capital investment by all in the society, public and private agencies must invest more to develop strategies to reward graduate students that complete their academic programs. Schultz (1960) presented that borrowing for education was positive behavior consistent with the human capital notion everyone gained from the exceptual attributes of higher education. The model extends beyond the concept that education is good. The study examines the value of cumulative debt that may discourage students from colleges and universities with a greater economic burden and no degree. The model enables staff, adminisfrators, and faculty to recognize cumulative debt as a factor that leads graduate students make choices that may derail their objectives. The model provides student driven with recognizable variables that can contribute to improvement of aid advismg at colleges and universities. The study infroduces the three predictor variables tiiat challenge graduate stiidents with cumulative debt. Stiident driven adminisfrators can constiiict a matiix from the model to include variables in the configuration for local use. The use of the model in advising graduate stiidents may 1prevent a stiident from dropping out, (2) identify an altemative route to accelerate degree completion, and (3) organize a sfrategy to assist graduate students tiiat feel overcome by the burden of cumulative debt. Practitioners that adminisfrate within the framework of the model demonsfrate needed empathy for graduate students to assiu-e access and pursue of remedies when circumstances are tiie students' control. The model improves the ability the ability of colleges and universities to address complex issues associated with cumulative debt that the cost of education does not become a detriment to academic achievement for graduate students. In summary, the study gives graduate students, student driven admmistrators, and famihes tangible that may be assessed while attending graduate school. Knowledge of the predictor variables alerts involved individuals how and why unexplained events may lead to self-destractive anxiety. In an environment driven by interest in the student, the sense of burden associated with cumulative debt can be significantly reduced with sensitive student advising."}, {"section_title": "Future Research", "text": "There are opportunities for future research about cumulative debt.

More research needs to be done to understand the impact on consumerism when married couples forgo high-end purchases to reduce accumulated debt.
