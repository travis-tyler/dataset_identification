[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "Abstract: This article investigates gender differences in 181 gifted and 181 average-ability sixth graders in achievement, academic self-concept, interest, and motivation in mathematics. Giftedness was conceptualized as nonverbal reasoning ability and defined by a rank of at least 95% on a nonverbal reasoning subscale of the German Cognitive Abilities Test. Mathematical achievement was measured by teacher-assigned grades and a standardized mathematics test. Self-concept, interest, and motivation were assessed by questionnaire. In both ability groups, boys earned significantly higher test scores but there were no gender differences in grades. Girls scored lower on measures of academic self-concept, interest, and motivation. Gender differences were larger in gifted than in average-ability students. Ability group differences for self-concept and interest were only found for boys in favor of the gifted. Results support the assumption that gender differences in self-concept, interest, and motivation in mathematics are more prevalent in gifted than in average-ability students.\nPutting the Research to Use: What can educators do to increase the number of gifted females choosing academic courses and careers in domains related to n;tathematics, the inorganic sciences, and engineering? First ot aU, they have to know the reasons why gifted as welI asnongifted females are underrepresented in tliese areas. Students' choices of mathematical careers largely depend on the way they react to statements like the following ones: \"It is easy for me to solve mathematical problems\" (academic self-concept), \"I am interested in mathemati~s\" (interest)\\ \"I want to learn as much as possible from math class\" (motivation). However, in spite of eamjng equally good grades in mathematics as boys, ' gi11s report lower mean levels of academic self-concept, interest, and motivation. Thi\\) holds for gifted students as well as for students of average apility. In samples of si/'th-grl\\de students, we found thaJ this gender gap is even more pronounced in gifted thanfu average-ability, students. Thus, it seems Very important to foster females', and particularly gifted females', positive attitudes toward mathematics. One possibility for doing so would be to foster gifted female students' attdbutions to ability when they receive good grades. In addition, interventions should not only focus on the girl herself but also on environmental factors including parents, teachers, the peer group, and administrative planning."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "math-science domain is Eccles's (1983) model of achievement-related choices, which has also been applied to the gifted (Eccles & Harold, 1992) . This is an expectancy-value model of motivation for achievementrelated choices that addresses two clitical variables: (a) expectations for success and failure, which are affected by an individual's specific beliefs and interpretations of ability, aptitudes, tasks, and past events and (b) subjective task value, which is influenced by an individual's affective memory of past events as well as the beliefs and behavior of significant others (see also Pekrun, 1993) . In particular, parents' perceptions of their children's abilities are assumed to be major determinants of children's competence beliefs and values (i.e., Eccles, 1993; Jacobs & Eccles, 1992) . According to Eccles and colleagues, lower participation rates of females in the math-science domain (courses and vocations) result from girls', as compared to boys', lower rating of their abilities in math and science and from girls' lower rating of the value of participating in related fields (Eccles, Adler, & Meece, 1984) .\nAnother model that explains gender differences in the gifted in mathematics and science was developed by the researchers associated with the Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (Lubinski et at., 2000) at Johns Hopkins University. Based on the theory of work adjustment (Dawis & Lofquist, 1984) , this approach stresses factors related to personal choice including preferences and values as well as ability differences (both as having some natural base) instead of viewing culturally imposed internal and external barriers as the primary cause of gender differences (Lubinski et at., 2000) . The authors argued that social influence alone cannot be responsible for gender differences because the male advantage is found only for specific mathematical tasks, whereas females do equally well or even better on other mathematical tasks."}, {"section_title": "Gender Differences in Mathematics", "text": "Mathematical ability. Meta-analytic findings indicate that gender differences in numerical and nonverbal reasoning, which are critical predictors of mathematical competence, are minimal in unselected samples (Hyde, Fennema, & Lamon, 1990) . In a large normative sample of 5th-to 10th-grade students (Jager et at., 2006) , gender differences in numerical and nonverbal reasoning were found in favor of male participants, but these differences explained no more than 0.3% to 1% of the variance in Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores. However, another picture emerges in samples of gifted individuals. There is an overrepresentation of males among the mathematically gifted. This gender difference can be detected at a very young age (Halpern, 2000) and becomes more pronounced at higher levels of education. For the top 5% of 7th-and 8th-grade students in talent searches, a male-to-female ratio of 13: 1 has been reported (Benbow & Stanley, 1983) . In a more recent publication, Brody, Barnett, and Mills (1994) reported a male-to-female ratio of 6: I.\nLooking at performance differences-typically assessed with standardized mathematics tests-metaanalytic research indicates that most gender differences are small and steadily declining in samples from the general population (Hyde et aI., 1990; Leahey & Guo, 2001 ). In their meta-analytic study, Hyde et al. (1990) found a slight age trend implying performance differences in favor of males that start to occur after primary school and become most pronounced at the high school and university levels. However, findings were dependent on the type of task: Males scored higher on problem solving, females scored higher on mental arithmetic tasks, and there were no gender differences found for computational tasks (Educational Testing Service, 1987; Hyde et a1., 1990) . Similar findings were repOlted for mathematically gifted 12-to 13-year-old students (Benbow & Lubinski, 1993) .\nThe Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (formally called Third International Mathematics and Science Study) showed that gender differences for eighth graders in mathematics, assessed between 1990 and 2003, were quite small (c. E. and declined over the years (Hanna, 20(0) . However, in the 2003 cycle of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which investigates mathematical literacy in 15-year-old students, gender differences in mathematics in favor of males were found in almost all of the participating counti-ies (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD], 2004) .\nFor students' school grades, it has been documented that females, throughout their school careers, earn higher grades than do males in most academic courses, including advanced mathematics (i.e., 1. Halpern, 2000; Hosenfeld, Koller, & Baumert, 1999) . For the intellectually gifted, results are less consistent. Some studies documented higher grades in math and science for gifted males (Colangelo et aI., 1996) , some studies found no gender differences (for 10th-grade students : Schober, Reimann, & Wagner, 2004; Roznowski et aI., 2(00) , and others found that gifted males had lower grades in math than did gifted females (students between ages 7 and 18: 1. Lubinski & Benbow, 1992 ; 5th-to 10th-grade students:\n148 Jager et a1., 2006). Thus, there are no consistent findings suggesting a male or female lead with respect to grades in mathematics. In part, these inconsistent findings may be traced to cultural differences in administrative planning, style and content of school cUlTiculum, and teaching practices (1. Freeman, 2003 .\nIn sum, in the general population, gender differences in numerical and nonverbal reasoning, which are critical aptitudes for achievement in mathematics, as well as gender differences in mathematics performance, including teacher-assigned school grades, are minimal. The age trend of better performance of males as compared to females reported by Hyde et al. (1990) refers to specific tasks. In many countries, males show better performance in tasks that call for mathematical literacy. For the gifted, there is an overrepresentation of males within the group identified as highly gifted. However, the disparities found for the male-to-female ratio at high ability levels cannot solely explain why females avoid careers in the inorganic sciences to such a large extent. In addition, even those females who show extraordinary scientific ability are entering the math-science pipeline less frequently than are their male counterparts (Kerr & Robinson Kurpius, 2004; Lubinski & Benbow, 1992) . Thus, gender differences in career choice can hardly be explained solely by ability differences.\nIn the following section, we describe findings for gender differences in math-related competence beliefs, interest, and motivational variables (i.e., goal orientation). First we report results for unselected samples for each of these constructs. Then we report results found for intellectually gifted students.\nCompetence beliefs in mathematics. Gender differences of academic self-concept in mathematics are consistent with traditional gender role expectations and stereotypes, showing higher scores in mathematics selfconcepts for males (e.g., for elementary school students: Eccles, Wigfield, Harold, & Blumenfeld, 1993; Marsh & Yeung, 1997 ; see also the meta-analysis by Wilgenbusch & Merrill, 1999) as well as higher scores in math selfefficacy for males (e.g., Pajares & Miller, 1994; for 15-year-old students: OECD, 2004; Pekrun & Zirngibl, 2(04) . Gender differences in math-related competence beliefs in favor of boys have been documented as early as the first grade (Eccles et aI., 1993; Wigfield et aI., 1997) and have been found to be relatively stable over the school years (Marsh, 1993) . Girls, more often than boys, think they have to work harder to achieve good results in mathematics (Lupart, Cannon, & Telfer, 2004) and show less self-confidence in their math ability (students in the last ~tages of secondary education: Baumert, Bos, & Lehmann, 2(00).\nIn the PISA 2003 assessment of 15-year-old students in countries of the OECD, effect sizes between .14 and .72 were reported for gender difference in academic self-concept in mathematics, in favor of boys (Pekrun & Zimgibl, 2004) . Higher self-perception of math ability in boys was found to be relatively independent of performance history (e.g., Frome & Eccles, 1998) , achievement level, and ability (12th-grade students and undergraduate university students: Holling & Preckel, 2005) . Thus, in both gifted and nongifted groups, boys have higher self-perceptions of their math abilities than do girls (students in the last stages of secondary education: Fox, Engle, & Paek, 2001; Terwilliger & Titus, 1995; Ziegler, Heller, & Broome, 1996; Zorman & David, 2000) ."}, {"section_title": "Mathematics interest.", "text": "In the PISA 2003 assessment of ninth graders, male students in all participating countries reported higher interest in math than did female students (although the mean effect size was rather small; d = .21; Pekrun & Zimgibl, 2004; OECD, 2004) . The Trends in Intemational Mathematics and Science Study also found higher interest in math and science for boys (students in the last grades of secondary education: Baumert et a!. , 2000; see also Luprut et al., 2004) .\nThere are fewer gender-stereotyped interest patterns found among the gifted as compared to average-ability students in nonacademic domains (10th-grade students: Lubinski & Humphreys, 1990) . For academic domains, however, gender differences ru'e found to be similar to those observed in unselected groups: Gifted males show more interest in physics, whereas gifted females show higher interests in social issues, literature, and the arts (Lubinski & Humphreys, 1990) . With respect to the Holland model (Holland, 1997) , the main interests of mathematically talented adolescent males lie in the investigative and realistic sectors. In contrast, mathematically talented adolescent females are socially and aesthetically oriented and have interests that are more evenly divided among investigative, social, and rutistic pursuits (Lubinski et aI., 2000) . Mathematically talented females are attracted to social values (people dimension), which are negatively corTelated with interests in inorganic science, whereas mathematically talented males are theoretically oriented in their study values (things dimension) (Achter, Lubinski, & Benbow, 1996) ."}, {"section_title": "Motivation in mathematics.", "text": "Throughout the entire ability range, girls demonstrate lower levels of motivation with respect to mathematics thrul do boys (students in 6th, 9th, and 11th grades: Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2004 ; Zonnan & David, 2000) . Recent reseru'ch on academic motivation has focused on students' academic goal orientations, distinguishing between mastery goals (pertaining to the development of competence through task mastery) and perfolmance goals (pertaining to achieving more than others or no less than others) (Elliot & Harackiewicz, 1996) . Research has documented that male middle school students tend to have higher performance goal orientations than do their female countelpruts (Pajares, Britner, & Valiante, 2000) . In mathematics, it was found that males have higher performance goals than do females (15-year-old students: Pekrun & Zimgibl, 2004 ; students in 6th, 9th, and 11th grades: Skaalvik & Skaalvik, 2004) .\nIn a meta-analytic study, Finsterwald and Ziegler (2002) found higher performance goal orientation in intellectually gifted boys as compared with intellectually gifted girls (d = .23), whereas no gender differences were found for mastery goal orientation.\nTo summarize, mean gender differences in mathematical ability are of negligible size in unselected student populations. However, for students with very high levels of mathematical ability, there is an overrepresentation of males. In the general as well as the gifted populations, gender-related differences in math performance are task specific: Boys show better mathematical problem-solving abilities than do girls, whereas girls show a slight advantage in mental arithmetic. Females seem to get better grades at school, but males outperform females on tasks that require mathematical literacy. Furthermore, in the general as well as the gifted populations, males show higher mathematics-related competence beliefs, a stronger interest in math, and a stronger performance goal orientation in mathematics than do females."}, {"section_title": "Research Questions and Hypotheses", "text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate gender differences in gifted students with respect to achievement, self-concept, interest, and motivation (i.e., mastery and performance goal orientation) in mathematics. Furthermore, we aimed to explore the extent to which differences in these variables are specific to gifted students. Therefore, gender differences in gifted students were compru'ed to gender differences in average-ability students.\nThe study was designed to avoid the two drawbacks of previous research. One problem of prior studies on the gifted, including studies on gender differences, was that samples were drawn from specialized programs for the gifted in which participants knew about their abilities and received specialized educational treatments such as accelerated instruction, advanced math courses, or math enrichment options (e.g., summer schools). Therefore, it is difficult to generalize findings to other groups of gifted individuals. Second, most of the studies cited above lacked suitable control groups. To avoid these problems, students in this study were recruited from regular classrooms. Furthermore, a sample of gifted students and a sample of average-ability students were included. A large, representative sample of unselected classrooms was used to recruit these two groups.\nOur hypotheses on gender differences in achievement and affective variables were derived from the extant research literature, as described above. Succinctly stated, our hypotheses were as follows:\nHypothesis Ja: There are no gender differences in grades in mathematics in gifted or in average-ability students. Hypothesis J b: Males show higher mathematical competences in terms of mathematical literacy than do females among both gifted and average-ability students. Hypothesis 2: There are gender differences in academic self-concept, interest, and motivation in mathematics in both gifted and average-ability students. Males have (a) a higher academic self-concept and (b) more interest in mathematics. Males and females show (c) similar levels of mastery goal orientation in mathematics but (d) males show a stronger performance goal orientation in mathematics than do females."}, {"section_title": "Method Definition of Giftedness", "text": "In this study, giftedness was conceptualized as an ability that can manifest itself in extraordinary achievement (performance) but does not necessarily do so in all individuals at all points of time (Sternberg & Davidson, 200S) . Generally, the definition of giftedness used in empirical studies is not only a conceptual issue but can also be influenced by context of the study. In many educational contexts where the selection of gifted students for special programs is a major concern, a definition of giftedness from an aptitude perspective that takes into account not only cognitive abilities but also domain specific knowledge and academic accomplishments is useful (Lohman, 200S) . This study, however, does not aim to investigate the selection of students for educational programs but 150 focuses on basic research questions pertaining to math-related gender differences.\nIn accord with Preckel and Thiemann (2003) , who concluded that differences between average and high intellectual ability students are best identified by use of item material that shows high loadings on the gfactor or a factor of fluid intelligence (such as items of reasoning tests), we chose a measure of nonverbal reasoning that is an established marker of fluid intelligence (Carroll , 1993) and plays an importa nt role for learning in math and science comparable across different school settings. We did not use measures of verbal or quantitative reasoning because these measures reflect more crystallized intelligence (i. e., verbal and numerical knowledge) than figural measures and are more closely aligned with type of schooling (Jager et ai., 2006) ."}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "The sample consisted of 181 gifted and 181 non gifted participants. Both groups were drawn from a random stratified sample of 2,OS9 sixth-grade students that is representative with respect to SES, school type, rural versus urban population, and gender.\n1 This sample of students (SO.02% female) came from 81 classes in 42 schools from all tracks of the German three-track education system. In this school system, after fourth grade, students are placed into one of three tracks (lower, middle, and top track) according to their level of achievement. Of note, \"top track\" does not refer to a track reserved for gifted students because up to SO% of the general student population attend this track.\nThe mean age of the sample was 12.77 years (SD = 0.S2; range = 11.17 to IS.42). The gifted were drawn from the random stratified sample in accordance to a cut-off score on the nonverbal reasoning test above 9S%. The sample of average-ability students was recruited as follows : For each gifted student, a non gifted student (nonverbal IQ within the range of 1 SD from the mean of IQ 100) was drawn who had the same gender as the gifted student, came from the same school class, and whose family had an equivalent SES. The distTibution of all paJticipants (gifted and paJ'allei) across school tracks was as follows: S6.4% attended the top track, 33.1 % the middle track, and 10.S% the lower track. For the gifted students, there were no gender differences as to school track attended (KolrnogorovSmimov Z = .92, p = .37). In Table 1 , the distributions of nonverbal reasoning scores and SES are described for the two groups. SES was categorized in accordance to the Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero classification of occupations (Erikson, Goldthorpe, & Portocarero, 1979) , which takes into account title of occupation, full-versus part-time occupation, and functions and powers related to the occupation. As defined by the sampling procedure, the gifted and the parallel samples differed significantly in nonverbal reasoning ability but did not differ with respect to SES. Compared with the total , unselected sample, the gifted sample came from families with higher SES (Z = -2.22, p = .03). There were no gender differences for the gifted in SES (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z = 1.30, p = .07)."}, {"section_title": "Measures", "text": "Nonverbal reasoning ability. Nonverbal reasoning ability was assessed with the respective scale of the Thorndike and Hagen (1971) , last revision in 1996.\n2 In Germany, the KFf 4-12+R is one of the most frequently used intelligence tests and also is widely used in research on giftedness and education. For the identification of high potential in math and science, usually the nonverbal reasoning scale is used (e.g., Ziegler et aI., 1996) . Both in the standardization sample and in the sample of this study, there were no gender differences on this scale of the KFf 4-12+R, suggesting that nonverbal reasoning as assessed by this scale is not confounded with spatial abilities that have been found to be gender linked (with higher scores for males). The scale contains 25 figural analogy multiple-choice items that ask participants to make inferences, deductions, and extrapolations pertaining to figural stimuli (inductive reasoning; Canoll, 1993) . The test was presented in a paper-and-pencil format. Time limits were followed as outlined in the test handbook. Testing took place under speeded power conditions, which means that time limits applied were generous (97% of the paIticipants worked on the last test item). Correlations with mathematics achievement were r = .56 for teacher-assigned grades and r = .58 for scores on the mathematics achievement test described below (N = 2,059).

In line with the concept of mathematical literacy, the test measures students' ability to recognize and interpret mathematical problems encountered in their world, translate these problems into a mathematical context, use mathematical knowledge and procedures to solve the problems, interpret the results in tenns of the original problem, reflect on the methods applied, and communicate the outcomes.\nAnalyses were based on a total test score derived from the subscales quantity, change and relationship, shape and space, and computation. The test is presented in paper-and-pencil format and scaled according to the Rasch model (Likelihood Ratio Test: A = 2.14 X 10-2 1 , lSI ns; cf. Anderson, 1973; Embretson & Reise, 2000) . The mean total score was set to 100 and the standard devialion to 10. Testing took place under speeded power conditions. Teacher-assigned school grades in mathematics were used as a second indicator of achievement.\nAcademic self-concept in mathematics. Six items of Ihe German version of the Sears Self-Concept Inventory (Ewert, 1979) were adapted for the assessment of academic self-concept in mathematics (e.g., \"It is easy for me to solve mathematical problems\"). Pmticipants responded on a Likert scale from I (strongly disagree) 105 (strongly agree). Responses were summed and averaged by the number of items (M = 3.34; SD = .88). Sample reliability was alpha = .90.

In contrast to many previous studies on the gifted, the sample of gifted students was drawn from an unselected student sample. It is reasonable to assume that most of these gifted students were not identified as being gifted and did not receive specialized fostering options. This assumption is supported by the finding that nearly 44% of the gifted students attended the mediumor low-level school tracks. In accordance with former studies (e.g., Roznowski et aI., 2000) , we found that the gifted, on average, came from families with higher than average SES. On average, the gifted students clearly outperformed their nongifted counterparts with respect to achievement in mathematics (i.e., grades and scores on a standardized mathematics test). In line with expectations, gifted females and males had equally good grades in math. However, as expected, gifted males performed better on a test of mathematical literacy than did their female counterparts. Thus, findings documented in many Western countries for samples of the general population were confirmed here for the gifted. For averageability students as well, findings of this study are in line with previous findings, showing comparable grades but lower mathematical literacy scores for average-ability female students as compared to average-ability male students.\nThe higher scores of males on the test of mathematical literacy can be explained to some extent by the male advantage in mathematical problem solving (Benbow & Lubinski, 1993; Hyde et aI., 1990; see also Nuttal, Casey, & Pezaris, 2004 , for a discussion of the influence of spatial ability on mathematics performance). However, gender differences in mathematical problemsolving show substantial cross-cultural variation. Therefore, in accordance with theoretical approaches such as the Eccles (1983) model, it is reasonable to assume that achievement differences in mathematical literacy are primarily caused by gender-role socialization practices as well as by teacher and parent expectations. These practices and expectations can be assumed to shape the development of achievement-related motivational traits (such as academic self-concept, interest, and goal orientations) that influence students' development of mathematical competences.\nSimilarly, as to the development of gender differences in mathematics-related self-concept, interest, and motivation, it can be assumed that socialization practices relating to gender roles are more important than cognitive ability. Our results are consistent with this assumption. Girls in both ability groups showed lower levels of self-concept, interest, and motivation (mastery and performance goal orientation) in mathematics than did their male counterparts.\nHowever, for all of these affective variables, gender differences were larger in the sample of gifted students than in the sample of average-ability students. T he interactions between ability group and gender were significant for self-concept, interest, and mastery goal orientation. These striking, unexpected interactions of ability group and gender imply that gender differences in attitudes toward mathematics are even stronger in gifted students than in the general population. Using the Eccles (1983) model of achievement-related socialization, this finding might be explained by assuming that gender-linked socialization practices relating to academic domains are more powerful when applied to gifted students as compared to average-ability students.\nFor example, it might be that gifted students are more aware of their aptitudes, and of social expectations how to use these aptitudes, such that gender-role stereotypes and the gender-linked development of academic motivation become more pronounced in this group of students. By implication, it may be that gifted girls, more so than average-ability girls, tend to develop and use their abilities only if type of ability and gender-linked social expectations are congruent to each other, which may contribute to explaining why there is such a dramatic loss of female talent in the domains of mathematics, the inorganic sciences, and engineering."}, {"section_title": "Limitations", "text": "Study limitations can be used to derive suggestions for future research. For reasons outlined in the method section, this study used a narrow definition of giftedness; that is, we chose nonverbal reasoning ability as the single criterion for defining the samples of gifted and average-ability students in our investigation. This should be kept in mind when comparing our results with findings derived from other studies. Also, our study focused exclusively on the domain of mathematics. The gender differences as analyzed in this study should be investigated in other domains such as science or verbal subjects.\nFurthermore, the self-concept, interest, and motivation measures employed in our study were self-report in nature. Instead of actually experiencing different levels of motivation, male and female students may differ in their ability and willingness to express their motivational beliefs (see Grossman & Wood, 1993 , for differences relating to affective experiences). By implication, males ' and females' self-reports might have been influenced by factors such as social desirability and stereotyping.\nFurthermore, when interpreting the findings of this study, it should be taken into account that the sample consisted of 6th-grade German students. Further studies are needed to investigate whether our findings can be replicated in other cultures and in students of different ages. However, as noted, these results on differences between gifted and average-ability students as well as the findings on gender differences in average-ability students are similar to those found in previous research that used samples from different cultures and age groups. Thus, it can reasonably be assumed that it should prove possible to generalize the present findings on gender differences in gifted students to other age groups and types of students."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "Gender differences in mathematics-related attitudes (self-concept, interest, and motivation) in favor of male students were substantially larger in gifted students as compared to average-ability students. Also, mathematicsrelated self-concept and interest differed in male students of different ability, whereas ability group did not explain the variance of attitudes in female students. For example, we found no differences in the mathrelated self-concepts of gifted and average-ability girls. Females tend to estimate their mathematical competence lower than their male counterparts d~and the gifted females in our study were no exception, in spite of the fact that they earned equally good math grades as the gifted boys.\nRecent research has investigated the Ijnkages of competence beliefs with interest development, motivation, and affect (e.g., Pei<.run, 1993; Todt & Schreiber, 1998) , and evidence is accumulating that the relationships between these constructs are reciprocal (e.g., Byrne & Gavin, 1996; Hannover, 1998; Pei<.run, 1992) , thus sustaining converging developments over the school years. In accordance with assumptions on convergence of different attitudinal variables, we found a consistent pattern of unfavorable mathematics-related attitudes in girls and a consistent pattern of more favorable attitudes in boys. The disadvantageous attitudes found for girs, including gifted girls, likely reduce the probability for high achievement and high participation rates of girls in the domain of mathematics and related fields (Eccles & Harold, 1992) .\nIn a review of the literature on factors influencing the realization of high mathematical abilities in girls, 156 Le Maistre and Kanevsky (1996) concluded that a combination of interventions is required to foster gifted girls' development in mathematics. Gender differences in math-related competence beliefs in favor of boys have been documented as early as in the first grade. Therefore, early identification of abilities as well as early intervention is crucial to reduce the likelihood that girls develop disadvantageous self-perceptions and negative attitudes toward mathematics. Interventions should not only focus on the girl herself but should also address environmental factors such as parents, teachers, peer groups, and administrative planning (J. . Possible interventions include programs for enhancing interest by single-sex education, changes of curricula and classroom instruction (Baumert & Koller, 1998; J. Freeman, 2004) , enhancing the number of math courses for female students (Eccles, 1987 ; see also Kerr & Robinson Kurpius, 2004 , who developed a I-day intervention program for mathematically and scientifically talented girls who are at risk for dropping out of the math-science field), attributional retraining , provision of role models and mentoring (Le Maistre & Kanevsky, 1996) , and teacher and parent counselling (Le Maistre & Kanevsky, 1996) . The findings of this study confum the need for such programs and interventions for girls, particularly girls of high ability.\nSupport should not pursue the goal of enforcing equal representations of males and females in the domains of mathematics, science, and engineering but rather make it possible that the genders will be more equally represented in these domains in the future. Gifted females need better conditions that allow them to develop more functional self-perceptions of mathematical abilities and more interest in mathematics so that they can make well-advi sed decisions for or against educational and occupational careers in these domains."}, {"section_title": "Notes", "text": "I .
