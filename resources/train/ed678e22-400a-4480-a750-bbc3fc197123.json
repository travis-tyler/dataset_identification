Floods alone cost the nation an average of $8.2 billion (NWS 2013); the overall economic consequences, including indirect 1 losses such as time off work, retail sales, and lost production may have more impact, and are harder to estimate (Kliesen 1994;Hallegatte 2014). Social infrastructure along with cultural and personal effects, some irreplaceable, are also damaged or destroyed by floods; the human pain and suffering is incalculable. Floods cannot be avoided, but for every conceivable reason they should be mitigated. A dollar spent on mitigation is repaid four times over in dollars not spent on response and recovery (Rose et al. 2007;FEMA 2014). Floods generally are more predictable than earthquakes, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and other natural hazards precisely because they do recur, and their magnitude at various recurrence intervals has been extensively studied in many locales (Bell 2003). Thus, it is possible to estimate flood risks and protect against them. Although floods occur throughout the U.S., two regions are particularly prone to them: the Midwest, from riverine flooding (on the Missouri, Ohio, and Tennessee rivers); and the Atlantic seaboard, from coastal flooding (throughout the Gulf of Mexico and from Florida to Maine), primarily caused by hurricanes. (The Pacific coast is relatively immune to hurricane-induced floods.) Much of the damage from hurricanes is caused by storm surge, the run-up of ocean water onto land. Over the past twenty years, a spate of large Atlantic hurricanes has caused large damages (Table 1). The U.S. government reaction, in addition to essential response and recovery, has been to improve hurricane prediction, with the goal of facilitating evacuations and relocations when needed as well as mitigating future damages. One predictive approach, SLOSH [Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes] has been championed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); this is based on fluid-dynamics modeling, but generally pre-computed for an ensemble of historic/typical storms and presented statistically to avoid the vagaries of individual storms. A second predictive approach, HAZUS [Hazards US], has been developed by FEMA; this too is based on fluid-dynamics modeling -exactly the SLOSH model in fact -but does focus on a specific storms and their impacts in specific coastal locales, and also incorporates economic and social dimensions (damages to building and impacts on human activities). This thesis directly compares the SLOSH and HAZUS approaches in a re-analysis of the Hurricane Sandy (\"Superstorm Sandy\") event of November 2012, which caused about $20 billion in direct damages in the New York City (NYC) area (City of New York 2014). Because of the magnitude of these damages, which were to some extent anticipated, FEMA "}, {"section_title": "Chapter 2: Background", "text": "Hurricanes are large, violent, ocean-borne storms combining low pressure, high winds, torrential rain, and abnormal pile-ups of water onto land, known as storm surge, i.e. \"water pushed onto shore\" (Figure 1). Similar to tsunamis, storm surges come on-shore in a matter of minutes, quickly inundating coastal areas and precluding orderly response, or even evacuation.   Low-lying urbanized coastal areas, such as New Orleans and New York City, are obviously the most at risk to surge from hurricanes; they are also the slowest to drain from flooding induced by the surge, which increases the flood damage. River estuaries are also 2 Deaths occurring as a direct result of the forces of the hurricane are referred to as \"direct\" deaths. These include those persons who drowned in storm surge, rough seas, rip currents, and freshwater floods. Direct deaths also include casualties resulting from lightning and wind-related events (e.g., collapsing structures). Deaths occurring from such factors as heart attacks, house fires, electrocutions from downed power lines, vehicle accidents on wet roads, etc., are considered \"indirect\" deaths (Blake et al. 2013). susceptible to surges, and in addition may be swelled by rainfall from the storms. For example, during Hurricane Sandy, parts of the Hudson and East Rivers flooded into areas of Manhattan and Bronx, which are several miles inland."}, {"section_title": "Hurricanes", "text": "Hurricanes originate in the Southern Atlantic Ocean during the warmest months of year, late summer through fall. Hurricane strength is categorized on a five-level scale, the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (NWS 2013), according to peak wind speed, from CAT 1 (74-95 mph winds) to CAT 5 (157 mph+). Hurricanes form when warm, so-called extra-tropical (ET) water pushes north into cooler surrounding water. Latent heat energy fuels the storm (Phillips 2003): evaporation from the ET warm pool drives moist air aloft, causing an area of low pressure. As the moist air rises, it spreads, cools, and eventually condenses in the storm bands, dumping water back down in areas of higher pressure. Cyclonic (counter-clockwise) circulation of the system occurs because of the Coriolis 3 force. The storm as a whole migrates northeastward, driven by the trade winds, often in unpredictable spurts. However, it may suddenly detour to the West, because prevailing winds may not be strong enough to steer the hurricane in assumed direction making a path erratic (Netting 2003). When the storm encounters land, its source of energy is removed, and it quickly dissipates. Hurricanes are characterized by bands of intense thunderstorms swirling around a relatively quiet, often rain-free, \"eye\" at the center. A cross-section through a hurricane (refer to Figure 1) shows the eye as a core of low atmospheric pressure, surrounded by rings of higher pressure. Because of the low central pressure, sea-water mounds up there; the storm's peripheral winds push other, larger mounds of water. As the storm migrates, ocean swells and sometimes breaking waves are produced. If the storm makes landfall, its mounded-up water is suddenly driven on-shore in a tangible event, i.e. storm surge. Regular tidal processes can either reduce or enhance storm surge by several feet, depending on the phase of the tides and the time of landfall. Coastal geomorphology, vegetation (or lack of it), and build-up (including levees and sea-walls) all affect storm surge, too. Within an embayment, surge may be further concentrated, whereas at a cape, it is spilled away. A gentle slope permits longer, deeper run-ups, whereas the steep slope results in breaking waves, which can significantly damage lower elevation buildings near the coast and in open bays, even without flooding."}, {"section_title": "NOAA's SLOSH Model", "text": "Surge modeling is an art (Jelesnianski, Chen, and Shaffer 1992). In 1992, NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS), through its National Hurricane Center (NHC), began to predict storm surges on the U.S. Eastern Seaboard using a computer model called SLOSH [Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes] for the purpose of forecasting storm surge height well before a hurricane makes landfall (Jelesnianski, Chen, and Shaffer 1992 The NHC uses SLOSH to predict storm surge for both emergent and hypothetical hurricanes on the basis of historical ones (NWS 2010). In the latter case, the predictions can be verified from water depth gauges and/or high water marks (HWM), such as inundation lines left on trees or structures, observed the field. SLOSH's prediction/ verification history is systematically updated every few years, thus adapting to changes in hurricane behavior over time. Reflecting the importance of coastline geometry and bathymetry, SLOSH considers 37 separate basins (          Power outages interrupted the lives of 800,000 customers, equating to over two million people in NYC. Many customers were without electricity for up to 17 days after the storm. Inundation was a major factor in Sandy's impact in NYC. Its worst-case tidal surge -Sandy made landfall at high tide with a full moon -caused higher than anticipated water levels and unexpected damages far inland. Significant parts of NYC, especially lower Manhattan, were, and are, vulnerable to flooding because of their low elevation; much of that area is built on fill (Figure 8). Tidal surge as low as 6 ft. destroyed homes, knocked-out power, damaged power substations, and flooded transportation routes, thereby making evacuations all the more difficult (Figure 9, Figure 10).    Altogether, 305,000 homes were destroyed, making it the largest storm-related outage in NYC history. According to the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), Sandy was also the worst disaster in its 108-year history causing an additional $5 billion in damages to the subway system, with persistent flooding in eight tunnels that took numerous subway lines out-of-service for weeks after the storm (refer to Figure 10). All waterfronts in NYC were affected, particularly in low-lying neighborhoods. The East River on the Manhattan side, where a major electric power generating station (East River) and East 13 th St. distribution substations are located, was severely flooded (refer to Figure 9), causing equipment to malfunction and preventing re-electrification up to 12 days 6 . The New York Stock Exchange closed for two days, its longest period of closure since the Blizzard of 1888. However, a few days before Hurricane Sandy, the inundation predicted for the tristate area 7 ( Figure 12  In the case of Hurricane Sandy, which was recognized as a potentially huge hazard long before its landfall, MOTF was assigned to the New York / New Jersey metro area for close to three weeks ( Figure 13). In late 2012, the MOTF was further tasked to define the extent of flooding from Hurricane Sandy based on a variety of direct measurements and observations. The MOTF work came to be known as the Hurricane Sandy Impact Analysis (HSIA) (MOTF 2013). USGS supplied surge-sensors also capture temporal data about floodwater arrival and retreat, together with maximum water depth, estimated by the pressure applied from the force of the storm surge. Surge sensors are temporarily installed on posts or structures before a storm and removed after to extract their recorded data (Longenecker 2014). The HSIA workup has been used and verified by several other groups, including a $25 million study by USACE (USACE 2013). The MOTF data are acknowledged as accurate to 1/10 ft. vertically and 1 m horizontally, in data rich areas. Further evidence is provided by the 319,000+ buildings in NYC, which were verified by FEMA inspectors has having suffered some sort of flood damage, i.e. water reached them to some degree; however, this data is not publicly posted, for reasons of privacy. In summary, the MOTF work represents the best possible \"ground truth\" for Hurricane Sandy, which is well documented in the HSIA report (MOTF 2013), included as Appendix A in this thesis."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 3: Data and Methods", "text": "This study compares the outputs of HAZUS combined hurricane and flood model runs for Hurricane Sandy, both with and without coastal surge, against: 1) predicted flood inundation based on historical storm statistics, and 2) measured flood levels at selected locations. Primary data inputs to the HAZUS modeling were topography of the NYC region together with meteorology of Sandy's evolution through time. A high-accuracy flood-depth grid prepared by the FEMA MOTF was also used."}, {"section_title": "Study Region", "text": "The greater New York City (NYC) region comprises five boroughs (which are also New York  For this study, experiments were conducted with two NED resolutions: 30 meters and 10 meters. Each NED download is an ArcGIS GRID, immediately usable within HAZUS as its digital elevation model (DEM) in the flood module. HAZUS contains code to clip DEMs to its study region, in this case, the five boroughs of NYC.   The probabilistic forecast (P-Surge) is reported as an \"exceedance\" above mean sea level (NGVD29 10 ): the expected storm surge heights that have only a one-in-ten chance of being exceeded. For Hurricane Sandy, a 7-13 ft. exceedance was reported in the most exposed areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens (Figure 16).   Within CSM, use of SWAN is an option; and SWAN itself presents two sub-options, near-shore waves only or both deep-water and near-shore waves. Starting from the HU model, the options are presented as shown in Figure 20. When SWAN is in use, storm surge analysis is performed via SLOSH for a period of simulation time (nominally 15 minutes) and then suspended. The new water-level data from SLOSH are then passed to SWAN, and the wave model is advanced for the same fixed period of simulation time. The near-shore breaking wave stresses from SWAN are then passed back to SLOSH for the next time period, and simulation continues until the hurricane passes through and beyond the study region (FEMA 2012a) Because of SWAN's relatively coarse scale for deep-water waves (see Figure 5), only the near-shore option is recommended for use with the CSM. In addition, SWAN is compute-intensive. As a practical matter for this study, the entire five-borough NYC study region could not be modeled at once in HAZUS using SWAN; rather each of the boroughs had to be run separately.  "}, {"section_title": "Measured Flood Levels", "text": "During Hurricane Sandy, because of the storm's size and anticipated impacts, the FEMA MOTF was assigned to the New York / New Jersey metro area for close to three weeks ( Figure 13). Included in the MOTF's Hurricane Sandy Impact Analysis (HISA), of particular importance to this thesis, were its delineation of the floodwater boundary and associated depth-grid, both utilized in the CSM. The HSIA utilized high-water marks and storm surge sensor data, geolocated using GPS with a horizontal accuracy of ~10 feet, to create a floodwater surface using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) 12 tool in ArcGIS. Among the commonly used spatial interpolation methods, IDW was preferred in this case because it \"draws for the data\", i.e. creates no artifacts. This surface was intersected with the 10m DEM for NYC, to produce a floodwater boundary (also made available as shapefile). Based on this boundary, flood-depth grids were developed by subtracting from the flood-level the underlying topography for NYC. In fact, two topographic DEMS were considered: the first from the New York Office of Emergency Management (NYOEM), at 3 m (horizontal) resolution; and the second from the New York City Office of Emergency Management (NYCOEM), at 1 m resolution. The NYCOEM flood-depth grid together with the flood surface elevation produce the user-defined depth grid (UDG) 13 used for some aspects of this study. This final UDG has been used and verified by several other groups, including USACE, which confirms its accuracy to 1/10 ft. vertically and 1 m horizontally, in data rich areas. The HSIA flood boundary in comparison with SLOSH (CAT 1) is depicted in Figure 21. Altogether, twelve CSM runs were completed for this study. Each run began with the HU model, which generated the wind field, then progressed with the CSM as appropriate. The first two runs, covering all of NYC, allow evaluation of the effects of spatial resolution. The remaining ten runs (two sets of five runs each) allow evaluation of the CSM, including wind-blown waves with and without a deep-water wave component via SWAN. Owing to the compute-intensity of SWAN, as mentioned before, the entire study region could not be run at one time, but instead had to be run borough-by-borough and reassembled, significantly increasing the human effort involved. Table 3 summarizes these model runs. Flood-related damage to buildings was also examined, although without validation. Additional damages were widely reported to transportation and utility \"lifelines\", but were not incorporated in this study, due to HAZUS' requirement of a user-defined inventory of complex assets to model such damages meaningfully. Some anecdotal evidence of was provided by the extent of utility outages, which lasted up to three weeks. Overall, Hurricane Sandy caused more than four times as many customer outages as the previous worst storm in Con Ed's history (Con Ed 2013). Within four days after Sandy's departure, most of the Con Ed's customers who lost power had their power restored. However, critical substations in lower Manhattan, in particular the power station located at East 14th street, had been damaged extensively. The 12-foot wall protecting the transformer was breached by the 14-foot storm tide resulting in a series of network (power) shutdowns, for all of downtown Manhattan and up to 34th street, which lasted about five days (Con Ed 2013). Across NYC storm tide varied in height because of topography and location. The Battery (Lower Manhattan) experienced flooding over 11 ft. relatively lower than the 14 ft. seen in the Lower East Side (E. 14 th street) (USGS 2013; Henson 2012)."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 4: Results", "text": "The results presented below compare the CSM predictions for Hurricane Sandy in three ways: first, amongst themselves, to assess the effects of scale (30m or 10m DEM), and the contributions of waves (none, near-shore only, or deep-water and near-shore); second, against the stochastic SLOSH predictions, which apply to a generic storm; and third to \"reality\" as established in detail by the HSIA (ground-truth) for this storm. In all cases, the area and perimeter of the flooded area are taken as proxy for flood damage. The depth of floodwater and duration of flooding is not considered. The detailed shape of the flooded area, which certainly affects the spatial distribution damage, particularly in low-lying areas, is also not considered in any quantitative way, but only graphically. Differences in perimeter are quite visible. Figure 22 shows the CSM baseline \"out of the box\" scenario, without waves, for the entire NYC area (i.e. as a single study region), using a 30m (1 arc-second) DEM and a presurge tidal height of 1.46 feet. Only a very minor reduction in flooded area, from 36.92 mi 2 to 36.90 mi 2 (0.05%) resulted from using a 10m (1/3 arc-second) DEM, which took almost ten times longer to complete.  CSM scenarios involving waves could not be run for the entire NYC study area, apparently owing to array size limitations in HAZUS; rather, these were run for the five boroughs (each a county of New York state) as separate study areas. To obtain the most detailed results, all runs were made with the 10m DEM. Results are shown in Table 4, in comparison to SLOSH and HSIA for the individual boroughs, which were obtained by ArcGIS geoprocessing (as both SLOSH and HSIA considered NYC as whole). Curiously, the sum of the CSM no-waves scenarios for the individual borough study areas (33.61 mi 2 ) does not closely match the CSM no-waves scenario for NYC as a whole (36.90 mi 2 ). The reason for this large (~10%) discrepancy is unknown.

These are significant differences, specifically in the later. \uf0b7 In Manhattan, CSM under-predicted by comparison to both SLOSH and HSIA in all scenarios. Lower Manhattan is a particular trouble-spot. Curiously, the scenarios with waves were significantly worse than without. \uf0b7 In Bronx, CSM over-predicted by comparison to both SLOSH and HSIA in all scenarios, and still missed the inundation on the west coast of the Bronx entirely. In the areas that CSM predicted, the inundation seems to be deeper than in the other methods.     Of course, no prediction is perfect; nor even is an after-the-fact report such as HSIA. During Sandy, Con Ed experienced flooding in eleven of its power generating and distribution facilities (Table 5). At most, CSM predicted six of these and SLOSH predicted ten. However, HSIA only reported nine. In part the reason for these results is that urban flooding, particularly around tall buildings and down streets that behave as tunnels, is quixotic. Still, it appears that CSM is less reliable than SLOSH, at least for New York City.  Chapter 5: Discussion HAZUS CSM significantly under-predicted the flooding for Hurricane Sandy as shown in Figure 26. The most egregious \"gaps\" for NYC are marked. Specific problems for Manhattan were presented in detail above, some suggested explanations for which follow."}, {"section_title": "Figure 26. Gaps in CSM Prediction", "text": "Individual borough (county) analysis presents a complicated story (Table 4) Figure 27. There appears to be an error in the radial-to-rectangular grid interpolation, most obvious in the lower East side by the East River (boxed in blue): it is not credible for water to be deeper near shore and shallower in the river. Similar errors appear along the West side piers, opposite Midtown. The reason for these errors is unclear, although they always occur in conjunction with protrusions from the land, i.e. the spurious \"dagger\" into the East River and the West side \"piers\". It seems that any block in the grid file that contains land is exempted from interpolation. The fundamental problem, however, in CSM's prediction for NYC is the restricted area being modeled (Figure 28, thin red outline), which excludes essentially all of the East River. The HAZUS Coastal Flood Model, on which CSM is based, automatically derives a default shoreline from TIGER data, which can be modified by DEM-based transects for open coasts. However, in the CSM, the transect modification is unavailable, and it is also impossible to multiple shoreline segments beyond the default. For NYC in particular, the default shoreline curiously cuts through both the West side piers and the Brooklyn docks; it also excludes the East River, where heavy flooding occurred in fact. CSM under-predictions for Manhattan are thus explained. Similarly, the under-predictions for Staten Island primarily appear on its West shore, Arthur Kill, a tidal strait in between New Jersey and Staten Island. Arthur Kill is not wide enough and deep enough to be considered an active shoreline or transect for the CSM. Overall, SLOSH did a better prediction of Hurricane Sandy storm tide than CSM. The erratic results obtained with CSM for the five boroughs, under-predictions for Manhattan and Staten Island and over-predictions for Brooklyn, Bronx, and Queens are particularly disturbing. Knowing that a prediction is biased in some way is workable; not knowing if it is biased, and in what way, is not."}, {"section_title": "Chapter 6: Conclusion", "text": "It is clear that a solid method of storm tide/surge prediction is essential in preparing for future, inevitable hurricanes and associated flooding in New York / New Jersey region. In particular, New York City has vast underground utility systems, particularly for electrical distribution, that are susceptible to flood events. Hurricanes Irene and Sandy proved that storm tide/surge events could cause major, extended losses -not just of electricity but of other services (gas, steam, water) as well. Because electricity is essential both to initial emergency response and to recovery from hurricanes, a power company's major assets, specifically its generating stations and distribution substations, are amongst the \"consumers\" for accurate flood predictions. Even without electrical outages, the economic burden of storm surge is devastating and it can take weeks, months, or even years (as with Katrina and Sandy) for the community to fully recover from a hurricane event. Reciprocally, utility companies in particular would benefit from better flood prediction, as the cost of protecting their assets in flood-prone areas is very large. Severe storms, including Hurricanes Irene and Sandy, have cost Con Ed $600 million in damage recovery through 2013. After Sandy, Con Ed began to invest an additional $1 billion over a four-year period (Con Ed 2013) to mitigate future storm damages. It is an engineering practice to build in a safety factor (SF) of 10% above the actual structural \"load\", here the expectable floodwater depth. For electrical distribution facilities within the NYC area the safety factor is +2 ft. above the highest estimation of future flooding. If flood predictions can be in error by +/-5ft, this error factor is meaningless. If the possibility of an outsized flooding is ignored, however, the result can be enormously expensive recovery and repair, as occurred with the Con Ed generating station at E. 13 th street, which was flooded by Hurricane Sandy at least 3 ft. above the high-water experienced in Hurricane Irene, just a year earlier (Con Ed 2013; City of New York 2013). The result was much more expensive repair of the station as well as protracted electrical outage for ratepayers. Of necessity, electrical power stations along with supporting railway and dock facilities are located near or actually in the floodplain (City of New York 2014). These cannot be relocated, only mitigated in place. A solid prediction of flood risks and hence flood mitigations needed are essential to protecting them. For emergency management purposes, only SLOSH and HAZUS CSM are available prior to a hurricane event. Hurricane mitigation plans, specifically for storm hardening, must be based on such models. NOAA and FEMA personnel are well versed in the operations of their respective models and can help emergency managers with using them. However, the models must give correct results. Regrettably, despite its more extensive modeling capabilities for wind-blown waves in particular, the CSM in HAZUS 2.1 is currently less accurate than SLOSH. However, FEMA has engaged on HAZUS \"modernization\" (FEMA 2015) which has the potential to make it better in many aspects. A major impetus for this effort is to allow HAZUS to run in ArcGIS v10.2 18 . On the list of modernizations for CSM are to incorporate the higher-resolution (0.5x0.5 km) 'ny3' vs. 'ny2' SLOSH grid (Figure 29). If internal arrays are limiting CSM to small study areas, viz. single boroughs of NYC, they should be expanded. The interpolation errors from the SLOSH/SWAN grids to the HAZUS FL \"surge files\" obviously need to be fixed. Finally, the \"coastline\" in CSM should be made more visible, and easily adjustable. It will be useful to repeat this study with the new CSM, when available, to validate the improvements that are made. Figure B- "}, {"section_title": "ny3 ny2", "text": ""}]
