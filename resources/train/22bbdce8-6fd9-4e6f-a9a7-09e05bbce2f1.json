[{"section_title": "Abstract", "text": "The evaluation of historical water use in the Upper Rio Grande Basin (URGB), United States and Mexico, using Landsat-derived actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from 1986 to 2015 is presented here as the first study of its kind to apply satellite observations to quantify long-term, basin-wide crop consumptive use in a large basin. The rich archive of Landsat imagery combined with the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model was used to estimate and map ETa across the basin and over irrigated fields for historical characterization of water-use dynamics. Monthly ETa estimates were evaluated using six eddy-covariance (EC) flux towers showing strong correspondence (r 2 > 0.80) with reasonable error rates (root mean square error between 6 and 19 mm/month). Detailed spatiotemporal analysis using peak growing season (June-August) ETa over irrigated areas revealed declining regional crop water-use patterns throughout the basin, a trend reinforced through comparisons with gridded ETa from the Max Planck Institute (MPI). The interrelationships among seven agro-hydroclimatic variables (ETa, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), maximum air temperature (Ta), potential ET (ETo), precipitation, and runoff) are all summarized to support the assessment and context of historical water-use dynamics over 30 years in the URGB.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1587 2 of 25 than 20% in the Northwest, which is dominated by high rainfall and moderate temperatures, to over 80% in the arid Southwest, which is characterized by low rainfall and high temperatures [3] . Due to the large range in ETa variability and the close association of ETa with soil moisture, vegetative health, and atmospheric demand, ETa can serve as a valuable indicator of landscape response to environmental and climatic drivers.\nThe process of recycling water into the atmosphere via ET involves not only the transport of water, but the transfer of energy as evaporative cooling also reduces the temperature of the land surface. Thus, ETa can be estimated using either a mass balance or an energy balance approach. The mass balance approach requires the tracking of supply (rainfall and/or irrigation) using prognostic modeling where ETa is determined as a function of soil moisture and vegetative condition for a given atmospheric demand [4, 5] . An energy balance approach, on the other hand, relies on land surface temperature (LST) to measure evaporative cooling in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system-a diagnostic modeling approach to estimating ETa [6] .\nAdvances in remote sensing, gridded weather datasets, and process-based algorithms can produce spatially explicit ETa maps across large areas, whereas direct measurements are limited to select locations using expensive instrumentation. Most remote sensing-based ET models employ key variables such as LST, as in Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) or SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm), METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration), ALEXI (Atmospheric-Land Exchange Inverse), or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), such as in the SIMS method (Satellite Irrigation Management System), in approaches that range from empirical to full energy balance algorithms [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . A comprehensive review of the different remote sensing methods for ET modeling is summarized by various researchers [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .\nAs the archive of data expands, satellite data are being used for trend studies in ETa. As opposed to seasonal drought monitoring and spatial assessment of ETa by land cover type, trend analysis faces more challenges from consistency in data quality and model stability across years. Most studies that have looked at trends in ETa have relied on the combination of climatic datasets such as potential evapotranspiration and NDVI for model parameterization at regional and global scales using satellite sensors such as Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR, since 1970s) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, since 2000) for characterizing ETa for various land cover types [24, 25] . In addition to NDVI, Jin et al. [26] examined recent (2001 to 2014) trends in ETa at a regional scale using the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model.\nETa trend analysis over croplands are more common with the use of the crop coefficient (Kc) approach where NDVI is used to estimate Kc, which in turn is used to scale atmospheric demand such as reference ET to study field-based water-use trends of specific crops such as corn and soy [27] [28] [29] . Other techniques include the use of the complementary ETa relationship, which has been applied to investigate long-term crop ETa trends at a watershed scale [30] .\nCrop coefficient-based historical ETa trends are important in determining crop water requirements in well-managed irrigated agriculture that is operating under optimum agronomic practices and water management. In actual practices, Samani et al. [31] list several reasons for the variability of field-level ETa and crop coefficients, including limited water supply, knowledge of irrigation scheduling, cultural practices, and economic factors among others.\nThe use of Landsat data for quantifying historical crop water-use dynamics and trend analysis at a regional scale has not been reported. However, Landsat data have been used to study ETa trends over wetland vegetation through the scaling of potential ET with NDVI [32]. The foundation of this study is based on several of our previously published research efforts. Singh et al. [33] and Senay et al. [34] demonstrated the use of Landsat thermal data to characterize the spatial and seasonal distribution of crop water use for the Colorado River Basin for individual years. Furthermore, Senay et al. [35] reported on the importance of land and water management policy changes in driving ETa trends in the Palo Verde irrigation district, California, during 1984-2014 using thermal-based ET modeling. Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 1587 3 of 25\nSeveral studies have reported on the estimation and mapping of ETa in the western United States and the Upper Rio Grande Basin (URGB) using remote sensing techniques for natural systems and quantifying ETa by crop types [14, [36] [37] [38] [39] . However, no study has reported on ETa for the entire URGB over 30 years at the Landsat scale to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of ETa including trend analysis. This study applies comparable modeling techniques with improved model parameterization-from previous studies in the Colorado River Basin and in California-on the URGB over 30 years using Landsat datasets and weather parameters [33] [34] [35] .\nThe overall goal of this study was to estimate and characterize historical water use in the URGB using Landsat-derived evapotranspiration (ETa) from 1986-2015 using the SSEBop ETa model. The specific objectives were to (1) evaluate accuracy of SSEBop ETa using in situ observations from six eddy-covariance flux towers (2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014) in the study region, (2) evaluate long-term trend results using historical gridded FLUXNET datasets, and (3) quantify spatiotemporal distribution of crop water use in the basin at basin and region scales.\nIn this study, 10,335 Landsat images (Landsat 5, 7, and 8) were processed using the SSEBop model to quantify water use for the URGB for 30 years. This is the first ETa study to be completed at this spatial and temporal scale. We present the spatiotemporal dynamics of ETa at the scale of the basin, state regions, and pixel-level including seasonality and historical water-use trends. The interrelationships among seven agro-hydroclimatic variables (ETa, NDVI, LST, maximum air temperature (Ta), maximum potential evapotranspiration (ETo), precipitation, and runoff) are summarized to contextualize the historical water-use dynamics in the URGB."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is the hydrologic process that converts liquid water on the soil-vegetative surface into atmospheric water vapor.

In the United States, the ratio of ETa to precipitation ranges from less "}, {"section_title": "Landsat Imagery", "text": "Pre-Collection 1 Landsat imagery was collected for 13 path/rows (path 32/rows 38-39, path 33/rows 34-39, path 34/rows [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] from scenes between 1986 and 2015 with less than 60% cloud cover (https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros). In total, 10,335 Landsat images were collected from all Landsat satellites (5/7/8) with 54% of the images coming from Landsat 5 (5614), 39% from Landsat 7 (4019), and a further 7% from Landsat 8 (702) as presented in Figure 2 . For years with only one satellite in operation, specifically 1984-1998 (Landsat 5) and 2012 (Landsat 7), the average number of path/row images was 14 per year ( Figure 2 ). Previous studies have suggested at least 10-12 images per year are desired to generate a reliable ETa estimate [33] . With two satellites in operation (1999-2011; 2013- The Colorado section of irrigated areas in the URGB is mostly composed of the SLV and its associated irrigation districts. The SLV is a high-altitude agricultural valley, an alpine desert, in south-central Colorado at an elevation of approximately 2300 m (7600 ft) and bordered by the San Juan Mountains to the west and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the east [41] . The valley averages less than 200 mm of annual precipitation as it lies in the rain shadow of the San Juan Mountains, which receive 1000-2000 mm of precipitation annually [41] . The hydrologic system of the SLV is primarily driven from snowmelt, with most of the water coming from river and stream flow from the surrounding mountain ranges [42] . Due to the high elevation and latitude, the SLV experiences a shorter growing season and colder winters (winter low temperatures of less than 253 K or \u221220 \u2022 C) than the southern regions of the URGB [41, 43] . Despite the arid climate, the valley is a major agricultural region for Colorado, producing much of the state's potato (14,000-30,000 hectares (ha)) and alfalfa (80,000-100,000 ha) crops. Agriculture in SLV accounts for 30% of the valley economy [41] . The arid conditions require virtually all agriculture to be irrigated and reliant on surface water of the Rio Grande and groundwater reserves in the valley's aquifer [41] .\nMuch of the irrigation in New Mexico is clustered around the Rio Grande, which flows south through the URGB. The Rio Grande is bordered by bosque, or riverside forest, but within the narrow floodplain of the river, there is widespread irrigated agriculture despite receiving less than 250 mm of annual rainfall [44] . In New Mexico, irrigated agriculture is dependent on surface water provided by administrative irrigation districts such as the MRGCD or the EBID with some supplemental groundwater from privately owned wells [45] . The largest concentration of irrigated agriculture in the basin is in the Rincon and Mesilla Valleys, which extend from Elephant Butte Reservoir, through Las Cruces, New Mexico, and end at the New Mexico/Texas border.\nAbout 80% of irrigated lands in the EBID are devoted to the production of alfalfa, cotton, and pecans [45] . Pecan production in the EBID accounts for a large proportion of the district's consumptive water use with 11,625 ha of pecan trees (Carya illinoinensis) according to the 2012 U.S. Census of Agriculture [46, 47] . The \"thirsty\" label for pecan was investigated by Skaggs et al. [46] using lysimeters and evaporation pan techniques, which found that the seasonal consumptive use (April-October) of Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 1587 5 of 25 mature pecan trees near Las Cruces ranged from 1000-1300 mm for closely spaced, full-grown trees; however, these were limited-scope, site-specific studies.\nPre-Collection 1 Landsat imagery was collected for 13 path/rows (path 32/rows 38-39, path 33/rows 34-39, path 34/rows [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] from scenes between 1986 and 2015 with less than 60% cloud cover (https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros).

However, in some images, we found undetected clouds and cloud shadows that were missed by the FMask algorithm. To further remove these 'cloud contaminated' pixels, a secondary cloud buffer was applied using a masking threshold greater than 15 degrees (K) difference between the Ta (maximum air temperature) and Ts (Landsat LST), known as Tdiff, to remove unrealistic cold outliers. After removing clouds and cloud shadows, NDVI was calculated using top-of-atmosphere reflectance bands (red and near-infrared), and Ts was calculated from the thermal band aided by emissivity values derived from NDVI [34] ."}, {"section_title": "SSEBop Model", "text": "The SSEBop model calculates ETa from each Landsat image using an algorithm that takes Ts and ETo as primary model forcing inputs [6, 16] . SSEBop is an energy balance-based approach but only solves for latent heat flux at the daily time scale using a satellite psychrometric approach to determine a daily index or ET fraction (ETf ) for every Landsat pixel, which, when used with ETo, produces a daily ETa estimate [6] . The ETf is calculated per-pixel using Equation (1):\nwhere ETf is the daily ET fraction for each pixel nominally ranging between 0 and 1; \u03b3 s is the 'surface' psychrometric constant over a dry-bare surface, and it is the same as the inverse of the dT parameter in Senay et al. [16] . Ts (K) is derived from the Landsat thermal band; and Tc is the coldest/wettest surface temperature (K) limit, derived from Ta [6, 35] . The constant 1 represents the ET fraction value during maximum ET, i.e., when Ts = Tc. Daily ETa is then determined on a per-pixel basis using Equation (2):\nwhere ETa is actual ET (mm); ETo is (grass-reference) potential ET (mm); and k is a scaling coefficient of 1.25, which scales-up the grass-reference ETo to an alfalfa-reference type. Before ETa is computed, cloud-masked pixels in each ET fraction image were filled using per-pixel linear interpolation from temporally adjacent ETf images ranging up to 48 days before and after the image date. The interpolation method is more effective with multiple images, but in cases where there were insufficient images to complete the interpolation algorithm, a monthly median ET fraction, taken from all years, was used to fill missing pixels. Monthly total ETa was calculated by aggregating daily ETo into equal periods and then using Equation (2) with the corresponding ETf grid for that period. These monthly ETa totals are then mosaicked together for all path/rows using a mean operator in scene-overlap areas. Monthly SSEBop ETa data for URGB are available as a supplementary material at Available online: https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/ssebop/landsat/605 (accessed 3 July 2019).\nFor this study, parameters listed in Table 1 were implemented. These parameters are slightly different from those reported in Senay et al. [35] based on updated information on model performance, but the overall change is rather small at a large spatial scale. Daily median Ta grids were computed using Ta from 1984-2015 (32 years) provided by TopoWX [49] . The SSEBop c factor, which converts Ta into Tc, was applied per Senay et al. [35] with the median Ta dataset rather than yearly Ta data for the purposes of consistency and simplicity. In addition, improved Tdiff thresholds used in cloud masking as described in Section 2.1.3 were identified and included for all calibration and scene processing steps. TopoWx includes the standard environmental lapse rate (ELR) for elevation in the creation of Ta; however, exploratory investigation found that the slope of ELR for Ta was less than that of Ts. According to SSEBop parameterization, when Ts cools faster than Ta, ETa will be overestimated. To solve this problem, an additional ELR correction was applied to condition the Ta. An elevation DEM (digital elevation model) dataset at 90-m spatial resolution was acquired from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)-the Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data 2010 [51] . In areas where elevation exceeded 1500 m, such as the upper and middle parts of the basin, Ta was reduced by a factor of 0.003 K/m, equating to an additional reduction of 3 K for every kilometer rise. Continued analysis in lapse-rate atmospheric dynamics and conditioning for various Ta-to-Ts relationships will aid in improving the application of SSEBop in complex, high-elevation terrain."}, {"section_title": "Cropland Extent", "text": "For this study, a map of the maximum cropland extent for the basin was developed to analyze water-use trends. The maximum cropland extent (484,492 ha) was derived from a combination of U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Services (NASS) crop data layers, National Land Cover Database (NLCD) crop zones, and maximum NDVI. The USDA-NASS provides gridded landcover/land-use classifications called crop data layers (CDL) derived from Landsat with a decision-tree classification algorithm [52] . The USDA-NASS CDL data are available CONUS-wide at 30-m spatial resolution starting in 2008 and are released annually (https://nassgeodata. gmu.edu/CropScape). To determine maximum USDA cropland extent, all CDL agricultural crop type classifications for the URGB from 2008-2015 were combined to create a maximum extent of agricultural land. Then, landcover from three NLCD products (2001, 2006, and 2011) was acquired for the basin [53] [54] [55] . The NCLD is a CONUS-wide landcover classification provided by the USGS at Landsat-scale 30-m spatial resolution. For each of the three NLCD datasets, the \"Cultivated Crops\" and \"Hay/Pasture\" zones were isolated and then combined to find the maximum cropland extent for all NCLD landcover datasets. This maximum extent was then combined with that derived from the USDA CDL to create a subsequent maximum cropland extent data layer. However, because USDA/NLCD cropland extent is based on different algorithms with their own errors and may not be uniformly accurate in all areas, it was used as a guide to filter the summer (June-August) maximum Landsat NDVI (>0.6) to find pixels actively vegetated or irrigated in each year. Yearly maximum NDVI grids were combined to find the widest extent of cropland for the entire basin. This final maximum cropland extent derived from three independent datasets was used as the sampling zone for all variables in the time-series analysis presented in this paper.\nRemote Sens. 2019, 11, 1587 8 of 25 We focus here on the peak growing season of June-August when plants are actively transpiring and green.

Compared to the upper basin areas, the lower basin ETa shows higher year-to-year variability but still displays a general downward trend over time including reduction in water use during the early 2000s and the 2011-2015 period, suggesting that drought stressors, unsurprisingly, continue to be felt downstream (see Figure 8 )."}, {"section_title": "Characterizing Seasonality of Agro-Climatic/Hydrologic Variables within Agricultural Lands", "text": "Each of the seven variables-both water management-influenced and climatic variables in the Colorado irrigated areas-show distinct seasonal patterns of low activity in the winter months and a high peak in the summer months (Figure 9 ). Maximum air temperature and ETo show strong seasonal patterns with characteristic summer peaks. Annual precipitation is very low with a peak in mid-summer. NDVI remains low for much of the year except between the months of June through August. LST warms rapidly in the spring, then declines in June and July-this decline in the summer can be attributed to the evaporative cooling of vegetation, a pattern not shared by maximum air temperature. This decline is a testament to the fact that LST is impacted by management practices-in this case, irrigation. The seasonal pattern of SSEBop ETa in the SLV is very low in magnitude but shows a characteristic seasonal pattern of very low ETa, down to almost background (precipitation levels) in the winter months before rising in May and peaking in July. The basin-scale MK analysis was performed on each of the seven hydro-climatological variables. Results from the MK analysis conducted on the seasonal time-series data for the entire basin and regions are presented in Table 4 . At the entire basin scale, the climatic parameter Ta showed a Whereas the seasonal patterns of climatic variables in New Mexico are similar to Colorado, the management-influenced variables in New Mexico are noticeably different. NDVI suggests a slightly longer growing season in New Mexico as opposed to the SLV in Colorado, with irrigated cropland in New Mexico showing higher NDVI from May through September. Conversely, LST for irrigated cropland in New Mexico rises sharply but peaks in June when crops are developing and evaporative cooling brings the LST back down again through the summer months. The SSEBop ETa has a characteristic seasonal pattern, rising in spring to above 100 mm/month in May with more variability in the early summer until peaking in July (nearly 150 mm/month) and finally falling below 100 mm/month in September, suggesting a May-September prime growing season.\nIn the lower basin regions (Texas-Mexico), ETo and Ta both have high magnitudes, most likely due to the lower latitude and elevation, but the overall seasonal pattern does not radically change (Figure 9 ). As shown in Figure 9 , ETa tends to peak between ETo and NDVI, confirming the dependence of ETa on weather (ETo) and vegetation/soil moisture conditions, which is comparable to the Idaho-based study previously reported [66] ."}, {"section_title": "Mann-Kendall (MK) Trend Analysis", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Basin-Scale Mann-Kendall Trend Analysis", "text": "The basin-scale MK analysis was performed on each of the seven hydro-climatological variables.

The challenge has been in the use of remote sensing data for historical studies and trend analysis due to the relatively short history (1984-present) and changes in sensors over time. Consistent methods that are applicable to multiple sensor types are vital for accurate historical trend analysis.\nAlthough ETa trend studies at regional scales have been conducted using AVHRR (since 1970s) and MODIS (since 2000) sensors, no historical field-scale study has been reported using Landsat-based ETa for crop water use studies [24, 25] . Existing long-term crop water use studies have focused on the use of crop coefficients (Kc) derived from NDVI for specific crops, which assumes optimum agricultural practices [27] [28] [29] . And as Roy et al. [67] point out, NDVI may vary by sensor in the Landsat record and should not be assumed to be consistent over time. As Samani et al. [31] reported, even irrigated agriculture is not 100% efficient in water use for various reasons ranging from poor understanding of irrigation scheduling to availability. Thus, the use of the direct observation of ETa with minimal assumptions is critical for capturing spatiotemporal variability of water use under all (optimal or non-optimal) agricultural practices.\nThe use of the SSEBop model for this historical study brings an advantage over use of crop coefficient methods for the following reasons: (1) There is no assumption on crop types and thus eliminates uncertainty associated with crop-type classification; and (2) there is no assumption on optimum crop management, which could exaggerate crop water use. However, the SSEBop model is still prone to uncertainties from input data quality, especially from cloud contamination and unequal number of images over different years. Nevertheless, SSEBop is a robust ETa model as it relies on two model parameters (\u03b3 s and Tc) that rely on average climatic data and handles sensor differences through the c factor parameter. Potential differences in LST among Landsat 5, 7, and 8 are minimized using the scene-based c factor, which helps evaluate every LST image for corresponding environmental conditions between the wet (Tc) and dry limits (Tc + 1/\u03b3 s ). Furthermore, validation results with six eddy-covariance sites and with the independent MPI gridded flux datasets support the reliability of the SSEBop estimates. While the flux tower comparison provides a suite of accuracy metrics, the MPI supports the overall negative ETa trend in the URGB.\nThis study presents trends and volumetric magnitudes on the different parts of the basin using state boundaries as one way of summarizing regional variability. It is important to note that the volumetric water use estimates are only presented for the 3-month peak-summer period and thus should not be used as annual magnitudes. The fact that the order of volumetric water use percentages of 51%, 33%, and 16% correspond with Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas/Mexico region of the basin, respectively, is not surprising as it follows the order of crop area percentages with the corresponding 60%, 26%, and 14%, respectively. However, it is interesting to note that in terms of water use per unit area, the Colorado region uses the least and New Mexico uses the most. This spatial difference in water use is related to the regional climate, with the cooler upper basin using only 51% of the water while occupying 60% of the crop area. New Mexico and Texas/Mexico are more comparable, both having a higher percentage of water use than their crop area proportion with New Mexico having slightly more than Texas/Mexico.\nAlthough both SSEBop and MPI (1985 MPI ( -2011 show an overall negative trend (more persistent since 1995), the 3-year moving average shows a more cyclic water use pattern, most likely affected by drought events that could influence water availability. In regional-scale analysis, only New Mexico and Texas showed a statistically significant negative trend, which is supported by the decline in runoff in the same region. This trend suggests declining surface water is leading to a decline in irrigation-based ETa. On the other hand, the Colorado region did not show a statistically negative trend in ETa in the upper basin, potentially corroborated by a neutral trend in runoff ( Table 4 ).\nAs expected, during drought periods, the ETa from all regions showed a reduction compared to the average year, but the rates of decline suggest a differential impact of drought in different regions of the basin. The water use decline ranged from 7% in New Mexico (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) to 13% in Colorado, Texas/Mexico (2011-2015); the New Mexico region showed the least decline compared to the other regions on the two drought periods. Understanding the causes for the variability in drought impacts requires more information on the water management strategies, including conjunctive use of groundwater resources in the basin and potential shifts in crop types over time and space.\nThe pixel-based trend analysis reveals two pieces of information: (1) Most of the pixels did not show significant trends both in basin-wide (82%) and cropland analysis (63%); and (2) pixels show most negative trends at the basin scale, but this varies in crop areas ( Figure 11) . The neutral trend observed in all landcover pixels of the basin could be explained by the vast desert area in the basin, which shows little change in ETa, and/or the changes are too small to be captured by the resolution of the data and the accuracy of the model. The statistically neutral cropland pixels are most likely tied to the consistency of irrigation over those areas across the years. The mix of positive trend (7%) and negative trend (30%) pixels over cropland areas could be attributed to the expansion and abandoning of irrigated areas or change in crop types with varying ETa rates. The percent of neutral pixels over crop areas appears to generally decrease as we move south with 66%, 55%, 52%, and 59% associated with Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico regions, respectively, suggesting stability of irrigation practices with increasing proportion of neutral pixels.\nMann-Kendall trend analysis of the seven agro-climatic/hydrologic parameters was useful in partially explaining the trends observed in ETa. It is interesting to note that the MK tests for NDVI shows no statistically significant trends, except for the irrigated area in Texas. However, the Theil-Sen's slope of NDVI is slightly negative, which is in line with the increasing slope of LST, as these two variables show strong inverse correlation in peak (June-August) summer with statistically significant r of \u22120.54 and \u22120.73 for Colorado and New Mexico, respectively (not shown). When looking at year-to-year change in Colorado, the average change in NDVI approaches zero whereas the average change in LST is +0.14 K. However, when looking at a more drastic change in a drought year, such as 2002, we see NDVI drops 0.12 from 2001, while LST increases from 301 K in 2001 to over 309 K in 2002, an increase of over 8 K. Even in a drought year where drastic change is expected, the NDVI does not show as much change as LST, which demonstrates that LST is more dynamic than NDVI.\nOn the other hand, the negative trend in runoff for the lower basin areas may be attributed to changes in precipitation, which showed a statistically negative trend at p = 0.1 level in the relatively abundant precipitation upstream region of Colorado and the basin at large. The decreasing runoff can explain the reduction in ETa in these lower regions. However, the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater for irrigation complicates the effort to connect the decreasing runoff to changes in irrigation practices."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "The main objective of this study was to estimate, map, and analyze historical (1986-2015) crop water use dynamics in the Upper Rio Grande Basin (URGB) over a 30-year period. The study used peak-summer (June-August) ETa to characterize and assess water use trends in different parts of the URGB.\nReview of existing literature indicated the lack of research on the application of historical Landsat thermal data for long-term crop water use studies and trend analysis. The comparison of SSEBop ETa to ETa derived from six eddy-covariance flux towers, located in diverse agro-climatic regions, over an 8-year period (2007-2014) showed a strong correlation between the remote-sensing ETa and land-based observed ETa. SSEBop ETa showed an average \"r\" of 0.92 and RMSE of 11.7 mm. The average percent bias in monthly ETa between SSEBop and AmeriFlux ranges from 14% at the most extreme to less than 1%. Furthermore, the gridded FLUXNET data from MPI corroborated the SSEBop ETa trends by showing significant negative trends at basin and regional scales. These independent evaluations demonstrate the reliability of SSEBop ETa, derived from Landsat imagery, for conducting a spatiotemporal characterization of ETa in diverse agro-climatic settings.\nOverall, the seasonal (June-August) crop water use in the URGB showed a decline over the 30 years on different parts of the basin: for the entire basin, the seasonal water use declined at a rate of \u221213.9 mm/decade, which is equivalent to a 12.8% percent reduction from the 30-year average water use (\u221241.7 mm out of a basin-wide 327 mm/season). The Texas region showed the highest decline at a rate of \u221233.4 mm/decade followed by New Mexico (\u221223.4 mm/decade) while the Colorado and Mexico regions did not show a significant trend. Furthermore, per-pixel trend analysis revealed much of the observed trend in the basin is attributable to less than 20% (all land cover type) or less than 40% (cropland) of the area while the rest of the basin remained neutral, suggesting stability of irrigation practice over the majority of irrigated fields.\nThe volumetric seasonal water use has shown a consistent reduction during 2002-2006 and 2011-2015 that included known drought years, suggesting the decrease in water use may be linked to surface water availability as it is supported by a negative trend in runoff. However, drought seems to have differential impact across the basin, with the least decrease (7%) observed in New Mexico and the highest decrease (13%) in Colorado, as well as the Texas/Mexico regions during the two drought periods. Further investigation is planned to determine the relative contributions of management and climate drivers in the observed negative water-use trend using more detailed water budget studies and analysis of changes in cropping patterns in space and time.\nThis study has demonstrated the consistency and usefulness of historical Landsat data (Landsat 5, 7, and 8) and the robustness of the SSEBop ETa model for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of water use in a relatively large and complex basin. This approach is scalable to any basin in the world using Landsat and associated climatic datasets owing to advances in cloud-computing resources, which can allow nationwide and global applications of SSEBop ETa. Irrigation managers, water resource planners, and policy makers can make best use of these powerful datasets and tools for better management of scarce water resources."}]
