The interaction between sex and ApoE \u03b54 carrier status on AD risk remains an area of intense investigation. We hypothesized that sex modulates the relationship between ApoE \u03b54 carrier status and brain tau deposition (a quantitative endophenotype in AD) in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: Preprocessed 18 F-AV-1451 tau and 18 F-AV-45 amyloid PET images, T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, demographic information, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measurements from 108 MCI subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were included. After downloading pre-processed images from ADNI, an iterative reblurred Van Cittertiteration partial volume correction (PVC) method was applied to all PET images. MRIs were used for PET spatial normalization. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in standard space, and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images relative to cerebellum were computed. ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction analyses on 18 F-AV-1451 and CSF tau (t-tau, p-tau) were assessed using generalized linear models. The association between 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR and CSF tau (t-tau, p-tau) was assessed. Results: After applying PVC and controlling for age, education level and global cortical 18 F-AV-45 SUVR, we found that the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate, and occipital ROIs exhibited a significant ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction effect (false discovery rate P < 0.1) among MCI individuals. We also found a significant ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction effect on CSF t-tau and p-tau. 18 F-AV-1451 SUVR in the 5 ROIs with ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction was significantly correlated with CSF p-tau and t-tau. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that women are more susceptible to ApoE \u03b54-associated accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles in MCI compared to males.

AD is characterized by the presence of amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) which are thought to be responsible for neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive dysfunction. The lack of therapies for AD highlights the clinical need to better understand the environmental, genetic, and demographic risk factors underlying disease risk and progression. Apolipoprotein E type 4 allele (ApoE \u03b54) is the largest genetic risk factor for AD development [1, 2] . ApoE \u03b54 carriers exhibit faster cognitive decline [3, 4] , increased amyloid \u03b2 deposition [5] , higher NFT density [6] and increased glucose hypometabolism [7] than ApoE \u03b54 non-carriers. In addition to genetics, sex is an important demographic factor that influences AD risk. Compared to males, females are reported to have higher incidence of AD [8] , worse cognitive functions when they have AD [9] , and increased AD pathology [10, 11] . The interaction between sex and ApoE \u03b54 carrier status on cognitive decline remains an area of intense investigation. Sex has been shown to modulate the effects of ApoE \u03b54 in AD clinical conversion risk. Strikingly, healthy older females and females with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who carry the ApoE \u03b54 allele are more likely to develop AD than their male counterparts [12, 13] . Female ApoE \u03b54 carriers exhibit higher tau levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to male carriers [13] , especially among amyloid positive females [14] .\nNeuroimaging shows promise in early AD diagnosis. The novel PET tracer 18 F-AV-1451 (also called 18 F-T807, 18 F-flortaucipir) showed higher selectivity of >25 fold for paired helical filaments of hyperphosphorylated tau (PHF-tau) compared to amyloid \u03b2 [15] . The 18 F-AV-1451 radiotracer displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties, good overlap with PHF-tau deposits as described by Braak staging [16] , and strong association with dementia severity [17] . These characteristics make 18 F-AV-1451 a useful imaging biomarker for studying AD and dementia.\nThe analysis of ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction in tau PET imaging is critical for understanding the role of sex and ApoE \u03b54 on brain tau PET as a quantitative AD endophenotype. Uncovering regions with ApoE by sex interaction in MCI patients will also help in the development of precision-medicine therapies targeted to sex and ApoE-stratified patient groups in MCI. Further, this analysis will also help to define more appropriate sex and ApoE-stratified imaging-based endpoints for clinical trials in AD. In this study we examined whether sex modulates the ApoE \u03b54 effect on brain tau deposition measured by 18 F-AV-1451 PET among MCI subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "In this cross-sectional study, we collected subjects with available ApoE \u03b54 genotyping information and 18 F-AV-1451 PET, 18 F-AV-45 PET and T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from ADNI. 108 MCI subjects were included.

Briefly, all PET images were coregistered to matched structural MRI images. The MRI images were normalized to standard Montreal Neurologic Institute (MNI) space using SPM12 and VBM8 toolbox with a MRI template (image volume: 121\u00d7145\u00d7121, voxel size: 1.5\u00d71.5\u00d715 mm in x, y, z). The transformation parameters determined by MRI spatial normalization were then applied to the coregistered PET images for PET spatial normalization. Regions of interest (ROIs) including cerebellum gray matter for reference tissue were manually drawn on the MRI template using PMOD (PMOD Technologies Ltd., Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland) in standard MNI space. ROI templates developed previously in the Johns Hopkins Department of Radiology were used in this study [7, [19] [20] [21] . To measure whole brain amyloid deposition, a global cortex was defined as a union of orbital frontal, prefrontal, superior frontal, lateral temporal, parietal, posterior precuneus, occipital, anterior cingulate, and posterior cingulate. Standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) images were calculated relative to the cerebellum. ROI SUVRs were obtained by calculating mean SUVR within ROIs on the SUVR images in the MNI space.\nA partial volume correction (PVC) was applied to the processed 18 F-AV-1451 and 18 F-AV-45 PET images to correct or minimize potential underestimation in PET measurement due to low image resolution, especially for small tissues as the amygdala and striatum. In brief, an iterative reblurred Van Cittertiteration method was used for PVC on the mean images, where a 3-D Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHM was used for spatial smoothing function h, step length \u03b1=1.5, and the iteration was stopped if relative percent change of PVC images < 1% [22] ."}, {"section_title": "Statistical Analysis", "text": "To increase statistical power, a ROI feature selection method was used to select regions of interest for ApoE by sex interaction analyses.

Additional covariates of CSF amyloid or global cortical AV45 were added were added as indicated.\nA recently published study analyzed ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction effects on 18 F-AV-1451 PET using healthy elderly individuals [28] . The authors found a significant ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction effect in a meta-ROI containing the entorhinal cortex, inferior temporal cortex, amygdala, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal cortex, but no significant ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction effect on the entorhinal cortex alone. In contrast to this prior study that investigated only cognitively normal individuals, our study focused on a cohort with MCI demonstrating that this ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction on tauopathy persists in individuals progressing towards symptomatic AD. This result is particularly important when considering clinical trials aimed at an MCI cohort. Furthermore, our study identifies this interaction using different imaging processing methods and additional ROIs, suggesting that the ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction on tauopathy identified by both studies is robust to different methodologies within the ADNI cohort.\nImportantly, in the present study we controlled for global cortical amyloid load measured by 18 F-AV-45 PET. Recent work shows that amyloid might increase brain tau through mechanisms involving Sirt3 [29] , GSK3\u03b2 [30, 31] or Cdk5 [32] . In imaging studies involving brain tau, it is important to control for the potential confounding effects of amyloid on tau. In our data, we observe a significant ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction on AV-1451 PET after controlling for global cortical amyloid burden, suggesting that the ApoE \u03b54 allele exerts a sex-dependent effect on brain tau, independent of amyloidosis. These results are supported by recent biochemical studies demonstrating that ApoE \u03b54 triggers higher neuronal levels of phospho-tau independent of amyloid [33] . Further, transgenic mice overexpressing ApoE \u03b54 exhibit greater hippocampal phospho-tau and exhibit deficits in tau clearance independent of amyloid pathology [34] . It should be noted however that in spite of possible amyloid-independent mechanisms, additional statistical models analyzing amyloid by sex interaction effects suggest that our originally-reported ApoE by sex interaction effect on brain tau in the occipital cortex may be partly due to amyloid as females may be more susceptible to amyloid-induced tauopathy in this region (Result S1 in the Supplement). Table 4 .\nOur ApoE \u03b54 and sex-stratified analysis help explain the nature of ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction effect in 4 out of the 5 ROIs with a significant ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction effect (entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate and occipital ROIs). In these ROIs, there is no sex difference in 18 F-AV-1451 among ApoE \u03b54 non-carriers. However, in ApoE \u03b54 carriers, we observed a significant sex effect ( Table 3) . This suggests that the presence of ApoE \u03b54 allele is associated with significantly higher levels of brain tau deposition in females as compared to males.\nAs a further measure of clinical relevance of our study, we found that 18 F-AV-1451 signal in all 5 ROIs with significant ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction effect is also associated with CSF p-tau (Figure 3) . Previous studies have found an ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction effect on CSF p-tau, a well-studied biomarker in AD [13, 14] . Our data adds to the clinical validity of CSF p-tau by elucidating a brain-based correlate. Overall, by integrating 18 F-AV-1451 PET and CSF p-tau data, we find a robust relationship between brain tau and biomarker changes outside the brain.\nA possible additional explanation for the sex differences identified in our study might be that women could be cognitively more resilient to the effects of tauopathy. Recent findings suggest that women may have on average \"younger brain predicted age\" based on structural brain MRI [35] and metabolic brain PET imaging [36] . Similarly, younger individuals with autosomal dominant AD show markedly increased tauopathy compared to late onset AD individuals despite similar degrees of cognitive impairment [37] . It is possible then that due to increased brain resilience, women with more ApoE \u03b54 mediated tauopathy than men can nevertheless remain cognitively normal as demonstrated by Buckley et al. [28] or mildly impaired as demonstrated in our results. In order to further test the hypothesis that women may be more resilient to higher loads of tauopathy than men in MCI, we refitted our ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction models controlling for MMSE score (Table S2 in the Supplement). These results show that all five regions with significant ApoE \u03b54 by sex interaction effect in MCI in the original model ( Table  2 ) are also significant when controlling for MMSE score. This analysis further suggests that compared to men, women experience greater ApoE \u03b54-mediated tauopathy while remaining at the same level of cognitive deficit. Notably the idea that sex differences in brain resilience to AD might help explain our findings is not mutually exclusive from the idea that sex also influences the risk to AD pathology; both sex brain differences and ApoE status might carry both risks and resilience to neurodegeneration and dementia, as well as vascular disease. Further studies to disentangle these potentially complex relationships are needed.\nThis study has clinical implications for precision medicine. Our results demonstrate that female ApoE \u03b54 carriers exhibit greater tau accumulation than their male counterparts. Several anti-tau clinical trials are underway [38, 39] . In designing clinical trials, our results suggest that the dosage of anti-tau antibodies should be modified by ApoE \u03b54-sex group. In future efforts to validate tau as a quantitative endophenotype or clinical outcome measure, studies should stratify patient cohorts by ApoE \u03b54-sex group. Likewise, in mechanistic studies exploring tau-dependent mechanisms underlying ApoE \u03b54-mediated AD risk, results should be analyzed separately in males and females.\nAs a limitation to our study, it should be noted that our study contained a small percentage (35%) of ApoE \u03b54 carriers. While this proportion is in line with previously published studies and the larger ADNI cohort [40, 41] , possible selection biases may be present in our cohort. Future studies should be conducted in larger cohorts to minimize selection biases. Our study is however balanced in terms of proportion of female and male ApoE \u03b54 carriers (females: 36% ApoE \u03b54 carriers vs males: 35% ApoE \u03b54 carriers; P = 0.93, Chi-Square test).
