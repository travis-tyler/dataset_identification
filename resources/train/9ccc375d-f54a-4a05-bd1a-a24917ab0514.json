[{"section_title": "", "text": "cases and more than 1.06 million deaths due to COVID-19 are reported in more than 210 countries and territories. 4 The collaborative efforts of WHO and scientist's community across various countries are evaluating the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and their signaling pathways to target biomarkers for controlling, preventing, and developing new therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nThe SARS-CoV-2 is positive-sense single-strand RNA (26-32 kb) coronavirus belonging to Coronaviridae family, Coronvirinae subfamily, and Nidovirales order. 5, 6 On the basis of their genetic structure, the coronavirus have been classified into alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3), and delta (\u03b4) genera. Among these genera, only \u03b1and \u03b2coronavirus infect mammals. 7 By evaluating the complete genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, it was reported that the virus posses a genetic similarity of 96.2% with bat CoV RaTG13 and 70% with SARS-CoV. [7] [8] [9] Furthermore, similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 also encodes structural proteins, namely nucleocapsid protein (N), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), and spike protein (S). 7 Initially, the combination of antiviral drugs, such as chloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, and arbidol, along with antibiotics were prescribed for SARS-CoV-2 infection in clinical patients. [15] [16] [17] Randomized clinical trials were studied by administering lopinavir-ritonavir (1:1 ratio) in COVID-19 patients twice a day for 14 days. A similar mortality rate between treated and standard care groups was reported. 18 Severe gastrointestinal adverse effects in the standard care group were noticed, and therefore, treatment was stopped in 13.8% patients. Furthermore, irregular heartbeats and cardiac arrest in patients prescribed with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and antibiotic azithromycin against SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were also reported. 19, 20 Therefore, HCQ was approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) on March 30, 2020, for only hospitalized suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients under emergency use authorization. 21 On the other hand, convalescent plasma or immunoglobulins based treatment therapy was also provided to COVID-19 patients. It has been previously prescribed in H1N1, HIV-1, and Ebola viral infections. 22 However, plasma therapy is not efficient in end-stage COVID-19 patients. 23 In considering forgoing passive antibodies, a short period of time and their regulatory and logistical challenges limit their use in the current situation. 24 Contemplating various challenges associated with treatment therapies against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, while investigating cross-resistance of other vaccines with COVID-19, the new candidates for vaccines have been evaluated. [25] [26] [27] [28] Presently, over a dozen potential candidates including recombinant protein subunits, oligonucleotides, and live viruses are being evaluated against SARS-CoV-2. Besides, more than 100 preclinical studies, 42 clinical trials are being analyzed to develop new and effective vaccine therapy. 29 However, formal testing toxicology study, additional manufacturing steps, and finding volunteers to study COVID-19 specific vaccine are continuously delaying the development. The funds from manufacturers who were previously developing vaccines for SARS and Zika viruses were reallocated by federal funding agencies since the pandemic associated with these viruses were ended before vaccine development was completed. 25 "}, {"section_title": "| RESULTS", "text": "This review assimilates the search results of 1789 articles after preliminary screening conducted on PubMed, Google scholar, and web resources. Abstract and methodology screening were then performed and 1137 articles and documents were shortlisted. The flowchart of the final articles selection is illustrated in Figure 1 .\nFurthermore, 424 articles and documents were excluded after the full-text screening, among them 49 articles were also in languages, other than English and 189 articles did not specify relevant results for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. During the process of SARS-CoV-2 infection, proteolytic processing of S-protein is occurred once host cell receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binds with C-terminus of S1-subunit of S-protein resulting in a protease activity which allows fusion of the virus to the host cell membrane. 12, [30] [31] [32] Most viral RNA act as pathogen-associated molecular patterns and detected by pattern recognition receptors, namely toll-like receptor (TLR) types 3, 7, 8, and 9 in the endosome. 12, 14, 33 Furthermore, RNA receptor retinoic-acid inducible gene I, cytosolic receptor melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5, and nucleotidyltransferase cyclic GMP-AMP synthase facilitate the cytosolic recognition of the virus. These complex signaling triggers downstream cascade molecules and activates NF-\u03baB, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, and few proinflammatory cytokines. 12, 14, 34 Cytokines storm and dysregulated immune responses further induce respiratory disease pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2 which is similar to SARS-CoV and MERS. In addition, the imbalances in levels of interleukins, GCSF, macrophages, colony-stimulating factor, interferons, and the complement system are reported in patients suffering from COVID-19. 8, 13, 35, 36 Large number of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells subtypes were reported in COVID-19 convalescent patients. [37] [38] [39] However to envisage a larger perspective, cohort studies are needed to perform to examine whether the excess of T cells are protection or conversely associated with the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
