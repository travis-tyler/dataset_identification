[{"section_title": "", "text": "iii"}, {"section_title": "Foreword", "text": "This First Look presents findings from the 2008-09 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study (B&B:08/09), which describes the enrollment and employment experiences of a national sample of college graduates who completed a bachelor's degree in the 2007-08 academic year 1 year after they graduated. The tables in this report provide a sampling of the data available on graduates who earned their first bachelor's degree in 2007-08, presenting information on their undergraduate enrollment, including time to degree and education financing; postbaccalaureate enrollment and employment, particularly employment in teaching; and student loan repayment 1 year after completing college. B&B:08 is the third in a series of studies of bachelor's degree recipients that have previously covered 1992-93 graduates through 2003 (B&B:93) and 1999-2000 graduates through 2001 (B&B:2000). Reports that have used these studies and public access to the data upon which these reports are based may be found on the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) website for B&B at http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/b%26b. The data on which this report is based are available to researchers and the public through the NCES DataLab at http://nces.ed.gov/datalab. The DataLab provides users with two options, QuickStats and PowerStats. QuickStats is an easy-to-use introductory tool designed for the public that allows users to create their own tables from the 100 most frequently used variables. PowerStats is a simplified and improved version of the older Data Analysis System (DAS) and provides researchers with many more options for producing tables and multivariate analyses. PowerStats contains about 1,000 B&B:08/09 variables with descriptions, programming notes, and frequency distributions. We hope that the information in this report will be useful to a wide range of readers and will encourage researchers and others to make full use of the NCES DataLab tools to answer their own questions about the undergraduate and postbaccalaureate experiences of college graduates.

The study addresses questions related to bachelor's degree recipients' education and employment experiences. The first follow-up study, conducted 1 year after graduation, explores both undergraduate education experiences and early postbaccalaureate employment and enrollment. The second follow-up, planned for 2012, will examine bachelor's degree recipients' labor market experiences and postbaccalaureate education through the fourth year after graduation. More specifically, the Baccalaureate and Beyond (B&B) series of data collections allows researchers to address questions regarding bachelor's degree recipients' undergraduate experiences, including participation in various financial aid programs, undergraduate debt, and repayment of that debt; entrance into and progress through postbaccalaureate education, including time to the bachelor's degree; and employment, particularly as elementary/secondary teachers. A sample of the data available on these topics is presented in the eight tables that make up this First Look. The purpose of this First Look report is to introduce new National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) survey data through the presentation of selected descriptive information. Because this report is purely descriptive in nature, readers are cautioned not to draw causal inferences based solely on the bivariate results presented in it. It is important to note that many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one another, and complex interactions and relationships among the variables have not been explored. The variables examined here are also just a few of those that can be examined in these data; they were selected to demonstrate the range of information available from the study. These findings are examples of estimates that can be obtained from the data and are not designed to emphasize any particular issue. The release of this report is intended to encourage more in-depth analysis of the data using more sophisticated statistical methods. Among the approximately 137,800 undergraduate students who were sampled for the 2007-08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:08), approximately 17,160 students were determined to be eligible for B&B:08/09. Eligible students were those who had enrolled at an institution that was eligible to participate in Title IV federal student aid programs and was located in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or Puerto Rico; had completed requirements for a bachelor's degree INTRODUCTION between July 1, 2007, andJune 30, 2008; and were awarded their baccalaureate degree by the institution from which they were sampled no later than June 30, 2009. These students represent approximately 1.6 million students who completed the requirements for a baccalaureate degree between July 1, 2007, andJune 30, 2008. In this report, the 7 percent of 2007-08 bachelor's degree recipients who had earned another bachelor's (or higher) degree before the 2007-08 bachelor's were excluded from the analyses. This study includes the following information provided by respondents in the NPSAS:08 and B&B:08/09 interviews and by various organizations and institutions: \u2022 administrative data from the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS); \u2022 test score data from the College Board and ACT; \u2022 postsecondary enrollment data from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC); and \u2022 financial aid data collected through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This report is organized as follows. The first section presents key findings from the set of detailed tables that follow. Tables 1-2 provide information on the demographic and undergraduate enrollment characteristics of 2007-08 bachelor's degree recipients. Tables 3-4 examine some of the resources-time taken and money borrowed-that graduates used to complete their bachelor's degrees. Tables 5-8 address postbaccalaureate activities and outcomes: education, employment, income, and participation in or preparation for K-12 teaching.

B&B, therefore, focuses on issues relevant to graduates such as workforce participation, enrollment and persistence in additional education, and income and debt repayment. As with previous B&B studies, B&B:08/09 includes a multi-mode student interview component that collects information on students' education and employment since their graduation.

Institution Sample for NPSAS:08 NPSAS:08 constructed its institution sampling frame from the IPEDS:2004-05 Institutional Characteristics, Fall Enrollment, and Completions files. The institutions on the sampling frame were partitioned into 46 institutional strata based on institutional level and control, highest level of offering, and proportion of bachelor's degrees awarded in education. 2 NPSAS:08 also includes state-representative undergraduate student samples for four degree-granting institutional sectors (public 4-year; public 2-year; private nonprofit 4-year; and private for-profit 4-year) in six states: California, Georgia, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, and Texas. 3 Institutions were selected using Chromy's sequential probability minimum replacement (PMR) sampling algorithm (Chromy 1979), which is similar to systematic sampling. This algorithm led to the selection of institutions with probabilities proportional to a composite measure of size based on expected enrollment. Initially, a sample of about 1,630 institutions was selected in fall 2006 so ) provided student enrollment lists for use in selecting the student sample.

To more accurately estimate the overall sample yield, student sampling rates were revised after sufficient lists had been received. The final sample included 137,800 students.

"}, {"section_title": "First Follow-Up Study (B&B:08/09)", "text": "The primary task of the B&B:08/09 sample definition process was to confirm or reject a potential respondent's baccalaureate status. Institutions were asked during NPSAS:08 to identify students on the enrollment list who had received or were expected to receive a baccalaureate degree between APPENDIX A-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY A-9 July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008. NPSAS:08 oversampled potential baccalaureate recipients to allow for sufficient numbers to be included in B&B:08/09, and thus stratified them separately from other undergraduate students. Potential baccalaureate recipients and other undergraduate students were each divided into in-state and outof-state strata because undergraduate in-state students were oversampled in the six states with state-representative samples. 6 B&B:08/09-eligible persons were individuals who completed requirements for a bachelor's degree from a NPSAS:08-eligible institution between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008, and were awarded their baccalaureate degree by the institution from which they were sampled no later than June 30, 2009. Eligibility for the B&B:08 full-scale cohort prior to the B&B:08/09 interview was based primarily on information obtained from the student's transcript. Lacking a transcript, eligibility was based on responses provided during the NPSAS:08 student interview. Without either the transcript or the interview, eligibility was based on the student's institutional record obtained through NPSAS:08 computer-assisted data entry (CADE) or the enrollment list provided by the NPSAS:08 institution at the time of student sampling. The National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) data on degree completion were used to identify eligible students but could not identify ineligible students with certainty. These data were used for stratification (see below). Table A-3 shows the distribution of the 25,050 NPSAS:08 sample members who were potentially eligible for membership in the B&B:08 cohort according to their NPSAS:08 interview, CADE, and/or enrollment list status. Among potential baccalaureate recipients, business majors were undersampled to ensure that the baccalaureate sample did not consist primarily of business majors. Additionally, science, technology, engineering, or mathematics majors; National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (SMART) grant recipients; and Academic Competitiveness Grant (ACG) recipients were oversampled to allow for sufficient numbers for analysis. Finally, institutions that awarded proportionally higher amounts of education majors were oversampled to ensure sufficient numbers for analysis. A-10 APPENDIX A-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY Of the 18,000 students who completed the NPSAS:08 full-scale interview and were confirmed to be B&B:08/09 eligible, at the time of sampling about 83.6 percent (15,050) had a transcript that confirmed eligibility, 5.9 percent (1,060) were ineligible based on transcripts, and 10.5 percent (1,890) did not have a transcript. Table A-4 shows the transcript status of the B&B:08/09 sample with baccalaureate receipt confirmed in the NPSAS:08 interview. Additionally, transcripts were requested for the 7,050 NPSAS:08 interview nonrespondents who were either confirmed in CADE to be degree candidates or listed by the NPSAS:08 sample institution as bachelor's degree candidates. Approximately 5,150 of these NPSAS:08 nonrespondents were not determined to be ineligible for B&B:08/09 based on transcript data. In order to have full population coverage of the B&B:08/09 sample, a subsample of 500 of these 5,150 NPSAS:08 interview nonrespondents was selected. The sample was selected to maximize eligibility. The 5,150 NPSAS:08 interview nonrespondents were stratified based on study respondent, transcript, NSC, and CADE statuses. Within each stratum the nonrespondents were sorted by institution sector to ensure representation of the sample. The sample was drawn within each stratum with probabilities proportional to the NPSAS:08 sampling weight, and within sector the nonrespondents were sorted by this weight. The sampling rates used in each stratum were different in order to maximize response and eligibility rates while also representing the various types of sample members.

The unweighted range of missingness across variables was 0 percent to 19 percent. Variables with missing values have been imputed singly or as part of a vector, (i.e., simultaneously imputed). The imputation procedures employed a three-step process for each variable, or vector of variables, with missing values. In the first step, missing values were deterministically, or logically, imputed. In the second step, imputation classes were created based on a prediction model or response propensity model, as appropriate, for the variable with missing data. Imputations were then processed independently within each class. In the third step, missing values were stochastically, or randomly, imputed. That is, the weighted sequential hot deck process was applied, whereby missing data from recipient cases were replaced with valid data from donor cases from the same imputation class. 8 Variables with the lowest levels of missingness were imputed first, using variables that did not have any missing data in the construction of the imputation classes. Next, variables with increasing levels of missingness were imputed using variables that did not have any missing data and previously imputed variables in the construction of imputation classes. The order in which variables were imputed was also determined by the substantive nature of the variables. NPSAS:08 variables were imputed first and were used to impute B&B:08/09 variables. The majority of variables with missing data were imputed sequentially, but depending on the levels and patterns of missing data, some variables requiring imputation were imputed simultaneously. For some variables, deterministic imputation was used to ensure data consistency for legitimate skips and other explicitly defined relationships. That is, if a consistency relationship specified that the value of a known variable required a specific value of an imputed variable, the missing value was assigned the appropriate imputed value, based on the value of the known variable. For all variables, the imputation classes were determined using subject matter expertise and a tree-based methodology. The tree-based methodology identifies variables associated with the variable that is being imputed. This step produced a number of imputation classes that contain sets of donors that were used to impute missing values belonging to recipients in that class. Next, the imputation classes were used as input to a SAS macro that implemented the weighted sequential hot deck procedure. 9"}, {"section_title": "Weighting", "text": "All estimates in this report were weighted to represent the target population described in the sample design section. The weights compensate for the unequal probability of selection of institutions and students in the NPSAS:08 sample. The weights also adjust for multiplicity 10 Because the students in the B&B:08/09 sample are a subset of the NPSAS:08 sample, the B&B:08/09 weights were derived from the NPSAS:08 weights. The B&B:08/09 base weight is the product of the first seven NPSAS:08 weight components given in exhibit A-3. at the institutional and student levels and unknown student eligibility for NPSAS:08. 9 For further details, see Cox (1980) and Iannacchione (1982). 10 After the 2008 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:08) institution sample selection, it was determined that in some cases either (1) an institution had merged with another institution, or (2) student enrollment lists for two or more campuses were submitted as one combined student list. In these instances, the institution weights were adjusted for the joint probability of selection. Likewise, students who attended more than one institution during the NPSAS year also had multiple chances of selection. If it was determined from any source (the student interview, or the student loan files) that a student had attended more than one institution, then the student's weight was adjusted to account for multiple chances of selection."}, {"section_title": "A-18", "text": "APPENDIX A-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY"}, {"section_title": "Quality of Estimates", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Unit Response Rates and Bias Analysis", "text": "The bias in an estimated mean based on respondents, R y , is the difference between this mean and the target parameter, \u03c0 (i.e., the mean that would be estimated if a complete census of the target population was conducted and everyone responded).

The weighted response rates, by sector of institution, range from 81 percent for private for-profit less-than-2-year institutions to 95 percent for public 4-year non-doctoral institutions. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted during NPSAS:08 for the two sectors of institutions with a weighted response rate below 85 percent. However, these two sectors are irrelevant to B&B:08/09 because they do not include baccalaureate recipients. Interested readers can refer to the NPSAS:08 Methodology Report (Cominole et al. 2010) for more information regarding the institution bias analysis."}, {"section_title": "Student-Level Bias Analysis", "text": "As mentioned in the \"Sample Design\" section above, a NPSAS:08 study respondent was defined as any student sample member who is determined to be eligible for the study and has valid data from any source for a selected set of key analytical variables. While these were the minimal data requirements, the vast majority of study respondents had considerably more complete data. Of the 132,800 NPSAS:08 eligible students, the unweighted and weighted study response rate was 96 percent. The weighted study response rate for students is above 85 percent overall, and for all institution sectors. The weighted study response rates by sector of institution range from 89 percent for students in public less-than-2-year institutions to 99 percent for students in private for-profit 2-year-or-more institutions. Therefore, a student-level nonresponse bias analysis for NPSAS:08 was not necessary for any sector of institution. Three types of respondents were evaluated for B&B: \u2022 student interview; \u2022 student transcript; and \u2022 combined student interview and transcript Of 17,160 eligible sample students, the B&B:08/09 weighted interview response rate was 78 percent, the transcript weighted response rate was 92 percent, and the combined interview and transcript weighted response rate was 73 percent. 11 Since the weighted rate is less than 85 percent for those who responded to the interview and those with both an interview and transcript, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted. The nonresponse bias was estimated for variables known for most A-20 APPENDIX A-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY respondents and nonrespondents. The variables are included on PowerStats and are listed below: \u2022 institution sector; \u2022 region; \u2022 institution enrollment from IPEDS file (categorical); \u2022 Pell Grant receipt (yes/no); \u2022 Pell Grant amount (categorical); \u2022 Stafford Loan receipt (yes/no); \u2022 Stafford Loan amount (categorical); \u2022 Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS); \u2022 federal aid receipt (yes/no); \u2022 institutional aid receipt (yes/no); \u2022 state aid receipt (yes/no); and \u2022 any aid receipt (yes/no). First, for the variables listed above, the nonresponse bias was estimated and tested to determine if the bias was significant at the 5 percent level. Second, nonresponse adjustments (see the weighting section of this appendix) were computed, and the variables listed above were included in the nonresponse models. Third, nonresponse bias analyses were performed to determine whether the nonresponse adjustments influenced bias. Fourth, poststratification adjustments were computed and combined with the nonresponse adjustments. Once the final weights (after nonresponse and poststratification adjustments) were computed, any remaining bias was estimated for the variables listed above and statistical tests were performed to check for remaining measurable nonresponse bias. As shown in table A-6, some measurable bias remains after the student interview nonresponse and poststratification weight adjustments. Measurable bias was reduced after the nonresponse weighting adjustments for the variables known for respondents and nonrespondents. However, the poststratification adjustment to IPEDS and NPSAS:08 totals resulted in an increase in the measurable bias. The poststratification was necessary to match the baccalaureate counts in B&B:08/09 to known IPEDS counts and NPSAS:08 weighted estimates of federal aid receipt and to get the B&B:08/09 weights and estimates more in line with the NPSAS:08 weights and estimates for the B&B:08/09 students.  Table A-7, the combined student interview and transcript summary of bias analysis, shows some reduction of measurable bias but measurable bias still remains. Similar to the student interview bias analysis, the poststratification resulted in an increase in the measurable bias.

The item response rate is calculated as: APPENDIX A-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY"}, {"section_title": "A-23", "text": "A student is considered to be an item respondent for an analytic variable if the student has data for that variable from any source, including logical edits. As shown in table A-8, for the 15,050 responding students, the weighted item response rates for items used in this First Look Report for all students ranged from 81 percent to 100 percent. The weighted item response rates by sector of institution ranged from 67 percent to 100 percent. 12 Per NCES Standard 1-3-5, response rates for constructed variables must account for missing inputs prior to imputation. Most of the components of the constructed variables had response rates greater than 85 percent. A-24 APPENDIX A-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY Seven of the items (B1NFCUM1, B1TSTAT, NTCONSID, PAREDUC, PRIVLOAN, TESATDER, and TNFEDLN) had a weighted response rate below 85 percent. As shown in table A-8, the response rates for four of these seven items were below 85 percent for all students and all three institution sectors. The response rates for the other three variables were below 85 percent only for students from private for-profit institutions. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for these seven items. The nonresponse bias was estimated for variables known, that is, nonmissing, for interview respondents. These variables are important to the study and will be related to many of the items being analyzed for low item response rates. The set of variables and procedures used for the item nonresponse analysis are the same as those used for the student-level bias analysis presented earlier in this section. Table A-9 shows the percentage of variable categories for which these seven items have statistically significant bias prior to imputation. The bias due to item nonresponse ranged from 35 to 48 percent for all students. The amount of bias varied by sector of institution and ranged from 3 to 46 percent. The median relative bias ranged from 1 to 3 percent overall and from 1 to 10 percent by sector of institution. Any bias due to nonresponse, however, is based upon responses prior to imputation. The potential for bias in these estimates may have been reduced due to imputation. While item-level bias before imputation is measurable, such bias after imputation is not, so whether the imputation affected the bias cannot be directly evaluated. Therefore, the item estimates before and after imputations were compared to determine whether the imputation changed the biased estimate, thus suggesting a reduction in bias. For continuous variables, the difference between the mean before imputation and the mean after imputation was estimated. For categorical variables, the estimated difference was computed for each of the categories as the percentage of students in that category before imputation minus the percentage of students in that category after imputation. These estimated differences were tested for statistical significance at the 5 percent level. A significant difference in the item means after imputation implies a reduction in bias due to imputation. A nonsignificant difference suggests that imputation may not have reduced bias, that the sample size was too small to detect a significant difference, or that there was little bias to be reduced. As shown in table A-9, statistical tests of the differences between estimates computed before and after imputation for five of the seven variables analyzed were significant, indicating that the nonresponse bias was reduced through imputation. The items B1NFCUM1, B1TSTAT, and PAREDUC have significant differences for all A-26 APPENDIX A-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY students and students from public and private nonprofit institutions, and PAREDUC also has a significant difference for students from private for-profit institutions. The items PRIVLOAN and TNFEDLN have significant differences for students from private for-profit institutions. The differences between the estimates before and after imputation for NTCONSID and TESATDER were not significant. APPENDIX A-TECHNICAL NOTES AND METHODOLOGY A-27 "}]
