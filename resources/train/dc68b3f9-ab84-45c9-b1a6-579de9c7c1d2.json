[{"section_title": "Introduction Problem and Significance", "text": "The Coronavirus 2019 disease pandemic is an ongoing disease spreading all over the world. It has negatively impacted the world public health and economy. It caused more than 67M confirmed cases and more than 1.5M deaths since December 2019. It caused a world economic slowdown and made hundreds of millions of people unemployed. These numbers are continually climbing until herd immunity occurs naturally or a high percentage of the world population is vaccinated.\nTo suppress the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic before herd immunity, various mitigation measures have been implemented all over the world. Now, an important problem facing the world is: How do we assess the effects of various mitigation measures implemented to the COVID-19 pandemic and what did we learn from it? Furthermore, How many people will be infected and how many people will die in this pandemic? When will this pandemic end? How does this pandemic affect the world economy? To answer these questions requires epidemic laws that accurately describe how an epidemic evolves under intervention measures. In this research, we discover epidemic laws based on the COVID-19 data facts."}, {"section_title": "Data Facts", "text": "In epidemiology, a case is an individual infected by a disease; an epidemic curve is a curve of time series data of daily new cases; and a cumulative curve is a curve of total cases against time. Fig. 1(a) shows the cumulative curve of the first COVID-19 wave in Italy; and Fig. 1(b) is the corresponding epidemic curve. Mathematically, the change of the slope in Fig. 1(a) gives the epidemic curve in Fig. 1 (b) that is observed with the following facts:\nIt has three phases: a growth phase, a decay phase, and an endemic phase.\nIt increases exponentially in the growth phase.\nIt decreases exponentially in the decay phase but the decay rate is affected by intervention measures.\nThe growth and decay phases are connected with a hump but positively skewed.\nIt tends to a constant asymptotically. If the constant is zero, the epidemic dies. Otherwise, the epidemic becomes an endemic that may trigger a second epidemic wave.\nThese facts make the cumulative curve in Fig. 1 (a) bend upward exponentially in the growth phase and downward exponentially in the decay phase, and increase linearly in the endemic phase. These facts set the premises to justify an existing epidemic theory and to induce a new epidemic theory."}, {"section_title": "Status and Gaps", "text": "Let us first justify that the current epidemic models or theories cannot replicate all of the facts in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) accurately. For example, the most popular model to describe the cumulative cases against time in Fig. 1(a) is the Richards (1959) where c = dimensionless number of cumulative cases scaled by the carrying capacity; t = a dimensionless time; t 1 = ln[(c m 0 1)=m] = a dimensionless reference time with c 0 as the initial condition; and m = an asymmetric parameter that is the only parameter to express the effects of intervention measures for mitigating the COVID-19 disaster. Thus, in this research, we call m the intervention parameter. At m ! 0, Eq. (1a) reduces to the Gompertz (1825) function; and at m = 1, it reduces to the classic logistic function.\nIn terms of the initial condition, Eq. (1a) is rewritten as:\nwhich is plotted in Fig. 2 (a) with m 0 as a parameter and assuming c 0 = 0:001. Let t ! \u221e and consider c 0 1, Eq.

Eq.\n(3) has the left asymptote:\nand the right asymptote:\nEqs. (2a) and (4a) show that the intervention parameter m has a significant effect on the initial growth rate. Eqs. (2b) and (4b) show that in the decay phase, though the intervention parameter m has an effect on the magnitude, it has no effects on its decay rate. These conclusions contradict our common understanding of the topic that intervention mitigation measures do not affect the initial exponential growth but do significantly flatten the curve in the decay phase. Besides, as t ! \u221e, Eq. (2b) tends to 1 instead of a linear growth; and Eq. (4b) tends to zero instead of a positive constant. These results disagree with the data facts in the endemic phase in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b).\nTherefore, in terms of the effects of intervention measures and the endemic phase, the Richards (1959) generalized logistic function fails to describe the COVID-19 evolution in all of the three phases. Besides, it provides little knowledge on an epidemic with multiple epidemic waves."}, {"section_title": "Objective and Research Questions", "text": "The objective of this research is then to fill the above gaps with three innovative epidemic laws, which form a new epidemic theory.

How do we model an epidemic evolution with multiple epidemic waves?"}, {"section_title": "Hypotheses", "text": "We answer the three research questions by making the following hypotheses: A pandemic consists of many epidemics.

This process merges the two exponential laws in the growth and decay phases [ Fig. 1(b) ] into a single differential equation that results in the first epidemic law on cumulative cases without an endemic phase [ Fig. 1(b) ]. This law includes an explicit parameter expressing the effects of intervention mitigation measures, which answers our first research question. As a corollary of the first law, we deduce an epidemic curve equation on the time series of daily new cases.\nStep 2: We generate the second epidemic law on cumulative cases by combining the first law with the endemic phase (Hypothesis 5) in Fig. 1(a) . As a corollary of the second law, we deduce an epidemic curve equation that includes all three phases in Fig. 1(b) . This step answers the second research question.\nStep 3: We apply the superposition principle to an epidemic with multiple epidemic waves (Hypothesis 6) to form the third epidemic law. As a corollary of the third law, we deduce an expression to describe epidemic curves with multiple epidemic waves.

Here, we assume people are not susceptible if they stay home and do not contact with infected individuals. Eqs. (5) and (6) result in the susceptible population at time T as:\nwhere the data of C (T ) are reported everyday by health agencies (Worldometer 2020) as COVID-19 evolves.\nIn what follows, we find three mathematical laws to describe C (T ), based on the COVID-19 data. For brevity, we denote C (\u221e) = C 1 ."}, {"section_title": "The First Epidemic Law without an Endemic Phase", "text": "Let \u00b5 = initial infection rate (d 1 ) that is the number of individuals infected by an existing case a day. This rate depends on virus features, climate conditions, and human behaviors, namely, \u00b5 = \u00b5(virus features, climate conditions, human behaviors)\nAccording to Hypothesis (1) and Fig. 1 , the daily new cases dC=dT increases exponentially at T ! 0. Thus, the two numbers C and dC=dT in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) satisfy the following differential equation:\nAccording to Hypothesis (2) and Fig. 1 , in the decay phase, the daily new cases dC=dT decreases exponentially but the decay rate is affected by human interventions, which leads to\nwhere similar to it in Eq. (1a), m = intervention parameter expressing change of human behaviors in Eq. (8). Hypothesis (4) requires dC=dT = 0 at T ! \u221e. Considering C (\u221e) = C 1 , we revise Eq. (10a) as:\nwhere \u00b5=m = effective infection rate with intervention measures = decay rate, and C 1 C = susceptible at time T according to Eq. (7). Eq. (10b) states that the most efficient way to suppress the daily new cases dC=dT is to minimize the susceptible C 1 C by reducing C 1 through Eq. (6). This is what China did in controlling the COVID-19 virus despite vaccines. The second way is to make the intervention parameter m > 1 by changing human behaviors such as keeping social distancing, mask wearing, and hand hygiene, which reduces the effective infection rate \u00b5=m and thus reduces the daily new cases dC=dT . The second way is widely practiced in the rest of the world. Taking Eqs. (9) and (10b) as premises, by analogy to an eddy viscosity model for turbulent open channel flow (Guo 1988) , we induce the following generalized differential equation:\nwhere 1 (1 C=C 1 ) m = probability that susceptible meet infected individuals, which is intuitive if taking m = 1 (natural spread) and assuming P h = P v = 0 in Eqs. (5) and (6). Eq. (11a) is then interpreted from the right to the left side as: At time T , the system has susceptible C 1 C who meet infected individuals with a probability 1 (1 C=C 1 ) m . If the effective infection rate is \u00b5=m, then the product of the three factors is the daily new cases dC=dT .\nDefining c = C=C 1 as the dimensionless number of C and t = \u00b5T as the dimensionless number of T , Eq. (11a) reduces to\nwhich has three special cases:\n(1) At m ! 0, according to L'Hopital's rule, lim m!0 [1 (1 c) m ] =m = ln (1 c), which makes Eq.

This case represents the fastest growth of a disease spread and is plotted in Fig. 3 , assuming c 0 = 0:05.\n(2) At m = 1, Eq. (11b) reduces to\nwhich results in the standard logistic function:\nwhere t 1 = dimensionless inflection time at c = 1=2. Eq.

These extremes agree with our common understanding of the topic but are completely opposite to Eqs. (2a) and (2b) from the Richards (1959) generalized logistic function. The effects of the intervention parameter m are further explained in Fig. 3 by plotting Eq. (17a).

Thus, in this research, we call a single epidemic wave a solitary epidemic wave or simply an epidemic soliton. If 0 m < 1, the epidemic curves from Eq. (19b) grow and decay faster than the natural disease spread (m = 1), as shown in Fig. 4(a) . This states we can quickly reach herd immunity and end an epidemic by mixing susceptible and infected individuals by mass gatherings and events. Nevertheless, this may quickly overwhelm public health systems and thus risk population lives. To save lives from COVID-19 before vaccines are invented, we should flatten the curves in Fig. 4 (a) by increasing m from 1.\nParticularly, Fig. 4 (a) shows that unlike Fig. 2 (b) from the generalized logistic function, the intervention parameter m does not affect the initial growth, as expected from Eq. (18a). This is also explained in Fig.  4(b) with the logarithmic scale. Furthermore, Fig. 4(b) shows that Eq. (19b) successfully replicates the two exponential laws in the growth and decay phases. Unfortunately, similar to the Richards (1959) generalized logistic function of Eq. (1a), Eq.

Note that the number of cumulative cases in Australia increases linearly as T becomes very large until herd immunity is achieved, which is further explained with the daily cases. The epidemic curve of daily cases from Eq. (29), together with the data, is plotted in Fig. 9(b) . At T ! \u221e, Eq. (30) gives Q (\u221e) = 6:53 10 4 (6644 + 16939) = 15 cases/d, which implies that COVID-19 in Australia is controllable even without vaccines.\nAs for the death waves, we directly fit Eq. (28) to the cumulative death data in Fig. 9 (c), resulting in \u00b5 1 = 0:122 d 1 , T 1 = 40 d, D 1 = 98, m 1 = 1:01 \u00b5 2 = 0:0904 d 1 , T 2 = 174 d, D 2 = 811, m 2 = 1:04 A = 2:29 10 14 d 1 which yields the solid line in Fig. 9 (c) with a determination coefficient R 2 = 0:9996. The death epidemic curve from Eq. (29) and the data are then compared in Fig. 9 (d). At T ! \u221e, Eq. (30) gives Q d (\u221e) = 0, implying that COVID-19 in Australia has been controlled. The total deaths will be D (\u221e) = D 1 + D 2 = 909.\nGenerally, the values of \u00b5 for deaths are less than those for cases, implying the death grows slower than that of cases. Second, the natural inflection times T k are comparable with those for cases, implying the death pattern follows that of cases. Third, both values of m for deaths are close to 1, implying that the COVID-19 death in Australia grows almost naturally and can be well described by a double-logistic model."}, {"section_title": "Data of the U.S.", "text": "The COVID-19 data in the U.S. are plotted in Fig. 10 that is different from Fig. 9 for Australia, because it does not have an endemic phase and two consecutive waves have a time overlap. Furthermore, a new normal condition (the third stage) with constant mitigation measures has not been developed because each state applied different measures in different times. For such a case, we fit Eq. (27a) to wave data one by one.\nWe first apply Eq. (27a) to the data until T = 100 d in Fig. 10(b) for the first wave, namely,\nresulting in \u00b5 1 = 0:270 d 1 , T 1 = 40 d, C 1 = 4:51 10 6 , and m 1 = 33 that means the first wave is significantly flattened. The resulting cumulative and daily cases equations are plotted in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), respectively, with dashed lines. We next add the second wave to the first wave and fit the data until T = 200 d in Fig. 10(b) for the second wave parameters, resulting in \u00b5 2 = 0:146 d 1 , T 2 = 138 d, C 2 = 4:72 10 6 , and m 2 = 8:60. The resulting cumulative and daily cases equations are also plotted in Fig. 10 (a) and 10(b) with dashed lines. We see that \u00b5 2 < \u00b5 1 , T 2 T 1 = 98 d > T 1 = 40 d and m 2 > 1. Thus, the second wave is further suppressed.\nWe then add the third wave to the second one. Because the third wave has not yet completed in Fig.  10 (b), we assume m 3 = 4 based on the values in Table 1 for developed countries and the first wave of Australia. The other model parameters are then fitted as \u00b5 3 = 0:0647 d 1 , T 3 = 274 d, and C 3 = 2:09 10 7 . We see that though \u00b5 3 < \u00b5 2 , T 3 T 2 = 174 d > T 2 T 1 = 98 d, which suppress the third wave, the value of C 3 is one order of magnitude larger than C 1 and C 2 and magnifies the daily cases significantly according to Eq. (10b). Therefore, the current mitigation measures in the U.S. cannot further suppress the COVID-19 transmission. The only way for the U.S. to return to normal is to vaccinate a large part of the population, as stated in Eq. (6), which then reduces the infection potential in Eq. (10b)."}, {"section_title": "22", "text": "All rights reserved.

Fig. 10(d) shows that the death waves follow the case waves. Similarly, we can find the wave parameters as follows: \u00b5 1 = 0:208 d 1 , T 1 = 35 d, D 1 = 1:59 10 5 , m 1 = 10:1 \u00b5 2 = 0:283 d 1 , T 2 = 140 d, D 2 = 1:63 10 5 , m 2 = 48:4 \u00b5 3 = 0:079 d 1 T 3 = 272 d D 3 = 1:60 10 5 m 3 = 4 (assumed) which plot Eqs. (27a) and (29) with A = 0 in Figs. 10(c) and 10(d), respectively. The total deaths in the U.S. will be D (\u221e) = D 1 + D 2 + D 3 = 482K. The terminal case fatality rate in the U.S. is then approximately 482000= 30 10 6 = 1: 61%.\nBriefly, the data of the U.S. and Australia validate the third epidemic law and its corollary. Yet, further tests with the whole world data, including the U.S. states data, are needed in future studies. Besides, To incorporate the proposed theory into the classic SIR model is also a research need, which is briefed below.\nto describe the three phases mathematically. Furthermore, we extended the two laws to an epidemic with multiple epidemic waves to obtain a third epidemic law. Specifically, we reach the following conclusions:\nThe first epidemic law states that given an isolated epidemic system with human interventions, if the epidemic decays out asymptotically without an endemic phase, the curve of cumulative cases is a sigmoid curve (Fig. 3) described by the complement of the generalized Fermi function [Eq. (17a)]. As a corollary, this law leads to an epidemic curve that grows and decays both exponentially, but the decay phase is flattened by intervention mitigation measures [Eq. (19b) and Fig. 4 ]. The classic logistic law is a special case under constant environmental and normal societal conditions.\nThe second epidemic law combines the first law and the endemic phase [Eq. (24b) ]. It states that if an epidemic has an endemic phase, the number of cumulative cases increases linearly as time tends to infinity [ Fig. 5(a) ]. As a corollary, this law states that the number of daily new cases grows exponentially, decays exponentially, but tends to a constant in the endemic phase [ Fig. 5(b) ]. If the endemic constant is small, the epidemic is controllable with mitigation measures even without vaccines; otherwise, it is out of control if without vaccines.\nThe third epidemic law is a superposition principle for an epidemic system with multiple epidemic waves. It states that: (1) If there is not an endemic phase between two consecutive waves, then the resultant number of cumulative cases is a superposition of the first epidemic law [Eq. (27a) ]. (2) If an epidemic has an endemic phase even after multiple epidemic waves, then the resultant number of cumulative cases is a superposition of the second epidemic law [Eq. (28) ]. Similarly, an corollary can be deduced for epidemic curves with multiple epidemic waves.\nThe three epidemic laws are confirmed with the COVID-19 data of cumulative cases from 18 countries including undeveloped, developing and developed countries (Figs. 7 to 10). The three corollaries agree with the time series data of daily new cases. Besides, the three laws and the three corollaries are validated with the COVID-19 death data because of similarities of epidemic curves between daily new cases and daily deaths (Figs. 7 to 10). To further validate the three epidemic laws, extensive tests with other COVID-19 data, including the U.S. states data, and other epidemic data are required in future studies.\nFinally, we paved the way for future research to incorporate the proposed theory into the classic SIR model."}]
