For 8253 non-Hispanic white (NHW) and non-Hispanic black (NHB) Health and Retirement Study participants with memory scores measured 1 to 8 times between 1998 and 2012 (average baseline age = 62), we calculated weighted polygenic risk scores [AD Genetic Risk Score (AD-GRS)] using the top 22 AD-associated loci, and an alternative score excluding apolipoprotein E (APOE) (AD-GRSexAPOE). We used generalized linear models with AD-GRS-by-age and AD-GRS-by-age 2 interactions (age centered at 70) to predict memory decline. Average NHB decline was 26% faster than NHW decline (P < 0.001). Among NHW, 10% higher AD-GRS predicted faster memory decline (linear b = \u00c00.058 unit decrease over 10 y; 95% confidence interval,\u00c0 0.074 to \u00c0 0.043). AD-GRSexAPOE also predicted faster decline for NHW, although less strongly. Among NHB, AD-GRS predicted faster memory decline (linear b = \u00c00.050; 95% confidence interval, \u00c00.106 to 0.006), but AD-GRSexAPOE did not.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Because AD diagnoses are potentially influenced by both premorbid level of cognitive function and rate of cognitive decline, 6 it is important to confirm associations of genetic polymorphisms with longitudinal rate of memory change, the hallmark of AD. However, apart from the apolipoprotein E E4 (APOE4) allele, the reported effect sizes of individual genetic loci associated with AD are generally small. 7 Polygenic risk scores can help evaluate the joint effects of multiple previously identified genetic variants, each of which may have effects too small to reliably detect in independent samples. 8, 9 To date, only 3 studies have evaluated the association of a polygenic risk score for AD and cognition in older adults, and findings were inconsistent. [9] [10] [11] Further, only 1 study has investigated the association between a polygenic risk score for AD and rate of cognitive decline. 11 An additional major gap in prior literature on AD-related genotypes is information on whether these loci predict outcomes for nonwhite populations. For example, APOE4 has not been consistently linked to rate of decline in nonwhite populations. 12 This inconsistency may be largely because of limited sample sizes in studies of nonwhites, but there could be race-based genetic differences in susceptibility to AD. 13 Limited research has been conducted in nonwhites examining associations between other genetic loci and AD, cognitive function, or decline. 12, 14 It is important to conduct studies in racially diverse samples because genetic markers for disease discovered among primarily European ancestry populations may not be associated with disease in other racial groups for many reasons. First, individuals from different racial groups with diverse ancestry make-up are more likely to have different linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns, for example, the correlations among specific genetic variants may differ for blacks and whites. 15 Thus, if certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are in LD with a causal genetic variant among European ancestry samples, it does not guarantee that the same relationship will hold in non-European populations. Second, epistasis, or gene-gene interactions, as well as locus and allelic heterogeneity, could operate differently in diverse samples. 16, 17 Third, environmental modifiers-such as socioeconomic status and health behaviors-could impact SNP effects differently in European and non-European ancestry populations. 16, 18 Fourth and finally, minor allele frequencies may vary between ancestral groups and could therefore alter the detectable effect sizes for those SNPs. 18 The potential for survival bias is especially important to assess in research on determinants of cognitive decline because death rates are high in older populations and rate of cognitive decline predicts mortality. 19, 20 However, survival bias only poses a problem if a study's exposure of interest, in addition to the outcome, is predictive of mortality. Our exposure, genetic variants associated with AD, may impact mortality. Some research has found that carriers of the APOE4 allele have higher mortality rates than noncarriers. 21, 22 Yet, aside from the APOE studies, few published studies assess whether genetic variants associated with dementia risk are also associated with survival. To add to this literature, we directly assess the likelihood of survival bias by testing whether the AD Genetic Risk Score (AD-GRS) predicts survival and dropout after DNA collection.\nWe report here the associations of a 22-locus polygenic risk score (AD-GRS) with memory decline in non-Hispanic whites (NHW) and non-Hispanic blacks (NHB) in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). We report the findings for the AD-GRS both including and excluding APOE to test whether other loci besides APOE add to the prediction of memory decline.

We used proxy SNPs in LD with the SNPs reported in the Lambert and colleagues' paper for 4 of the 21 loci. We calculated the AD-GRS by multiplying each individual's risk allele count for each locus by the b-coefficient for that polymorphism as reported by Lambert and colleagues (except for APOE, where we used the b-coefficient reported by AlzGene 31 ) and summing the products for all 22 loci (for a list of SNPs and b-weights see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/WAD/A130). This step essentially weighted each polymorphism in proportion to its anticipated effect on dementia risk. Next, to convert to the odds of dementia for each individual, we exponentiated the weighted allele sum, multiplied the resulting value by 0.1 (the estimated dementia prevalence in the sample), and converted odds to probabilities.\nThe AD-GRS can be interpreted as the probability of dementia predicted by the 22 alleles, on the basis of the strength of the associations estimated in previously published GWAS and meta-analyses. We also calculated an alternative AD-GRS excluding APOE to assess whether the other 21 loci contributed information in predicting memory loss.

We model a quadratic growth curve for memory decline by including AD-GRS-by-age and AD-GRS-by-age 2 interaction terms. Using age as the time dimension allows us to reduce concerns about practice effects, take advantage of betweenperson differences that have accrued by the time of enrollment, thus improving statistical power, and is appropriate as the temporal order of exposure and outcome are clear. Next, this model was replicated using the alternative AD-GRSexAPOE which excluded APOE. We plotted memory trajectories for each racial group and each specification of the AD-GRS for a reference group of 70-year-old females. When calculating these curves we used the point estimates from the models, regardless of statistical significance. To directly test whether there was evidence for a differential effect by race of the AD-GRS both with and without APOE on memory decline, we estimated a race-pooled model with race-by-AD-GRS-by-age and race-by-AD-GRS-by-age 2 interaction terms, as well as a race-by-age interaction term. In addition, we estimated a race-pooled model adjusting only for race and age (as timescale) and their interaction terms to assess whether there were differences in rate of decline by race in our sample.\nWe examined whether the association of the AD-GRS (with and without APOE) and rate of memory declined prevailed in both middle-aged and older adults by estimating the same models stratified by age (+ /\u00c0 65 y). Using the alternative AD-GRS excluding APOE, we also estimated models controlling separately for APOE status to attempt to increase the precision of our estimates. We examined the 2 ABCA7 SNPs, rs115550680 and rs3764650, in separate models as predictors of memory change.\nFinally, we conducted analyses to ascertain whether the AD-GRS predicted death and dropout and whether these associations differed by race and prior memory score. For this analysis, we used 2 pooled logistic models where the outcomes were death and dropout from 2008 to 2012 (using data from 2010 and 2012 to capture events in those 4 y) and the predictors were AD-GRS as well as AD-GRSby-race and AD-GRS-by-prior memory score (2004) interaction terms."}, {"section_title": "RESULTS", "text": "Characteristics from the time of the first wave are shown for the 7172 NHW and 1081 NHB used in our models ( Table 1) . Average follow-up was 12.3 years for NHW and 11.3 years for NHB (of 14 possible). On average, NHW contributed 7.2 cognitive assessments and NHB contributed 6.6 (of 8 possible). Average NHB rate of decline was approximately 26% faster than the NHW rate (P < 0.001 for race-by-age interaction term).\nAmong NHW, in the model using the AD-GRS including APOE, there was a significant negative interaction between the AD-GRS and age [b = \u00c00.058 for a 10% higher AD-GRS and 10-y increase in age; 95% confidence interval (CI), \u00c00.074 to \u00c00.043; P < 0.0001] and the AD-GRS and age 2 (b = \u00c00.002; 95% CI, \u00c00.003 to \u00c00.001; P = 0.004), suggesting that an increase in the AD-GRS is associated with faster rate of memory decline, which accelerated with age ( Table 2 ). In the model using the AD-GRS excluding APOE (AD-GRSexAPOE), effect sizes for linear (b = \u00c00.029; 95% CI, \u00c0 0.050 to \u00c00.007; P = 0.008) and quadratic (b = \u00c00.001; 95% CI, \u00c00.003 to 0.001; P = 0.227) terms were smaller in absolute magnitude than effects when using the AD-GRS including APOE, and only the linear age term was significant. Models excluding the quadratic age terms were similar (Table, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/WAD/A131). For example, a 70-year-old with an average AD-GRS score would be expected to decline 0.50 memory score units by age 80; a similar individual with a 1 SD higher AD-GRS would be expected to decline 0.54 memory score units by age 80. Alternatively, while a 70-year-old with an average AD-GRSexAPOE score would also be expected to decline 0.50 memory score units by age 80; a similar individual with a 1 SD higher AD-GRSexAPOE would be expected to decline only 0.51 memory score units by age 80. Figure 1A shows the predicted memory trajectories for NHW with the average AD-GRS as well as for people 2 SD above and below the average AD-GRS. Figure 1B illustrates predicted memory decline trajectories for NHW based on the AD-GRSexAPOE. Among NHB, there was a marginally significant interaction between the AD-GRS and age (P = 0.080) but not between the AD-GRS and age 2 (P = 0.948), suggesting that the AD-GRS was associated with memory decline, but we do not have evidence that this association accelerated at older ages ( Table 2 ). Among NHB, in models with linear age terms only, a 70-year-old with an average AD-GRS score would be expected to decline 0.58 memory score units by age 80; a similar individual with a 1 SD higher AD-GRS would be expected to decline 0.60 memory score units by age 80. The magnitude of the association between the AD-GRS and change in rate of memory decline was smaller among NHB than among NHW. However, we found no evidence for a differential effect by race of the AD-GRS on memory decline in a race-pooled model (P = 0.782 for race-by-AD-GRS-byage interaction term; P = 0.255 for race-by-AD-GRS-byage 2 interaction term). The AD-GRS excluding APOE (AD-GRSexAPOE) did not predict memory decline among NHB (b = \u00c00.005; 95% CI, \u00c00.080 to 0.070; P = 0.899). Results were similar in models without the AD-GRSex-APOE-by-age 2 interaction term: the AD-GRSexAPOE-byage term remained nonsignificant (P = 0.30). We again found no evidence that the effect of the AD-GRSexAPOE on memory decline differed for NHW and NHB (P = 0.891 for race-by-AD-GRS-by-age interaction term) in a racepooled model. Figure 1C shows the predicted quadratic memory decline trajectories for NHB with the average AD-GRS as well as for people 2 SD above and below the average AD-GRS and Figure 1D shows the memory decline trajectories for NHB using the AD-GRSexAPOE.\nUsing the alternative AD-GRS excluding APOE, we estimated models controlling separately for APOE status to increase the precision of our estimates. Although APOE was predictive of memory score and decline, our SEs for the AD-GRS b-coefficient and the AD-GRSexAPOE-by-age interaction term remained qualitatively similar to the results displayed in Table 2 , regardless of separate adjustment for APOE. In addition, we tested whether new ABCA7 SNP rs115550680, recently reported as associated with AD in blacks by Reitz et al, 4 was a better predictor of memory decline in our sample than the original ABCA7 SNP (rs3764650) used in our AD-GRS.

When we dropped the 3-way interaction term between the AD-GRS, race, and prior memory score to boost power, results remained qualitatively similar."}, {"section_title": "DISCUSSION", "text": "We found that a 22-locus polygenic risk score for AD (AD-GRS) predicts memory decline in nationwide "}, {"section_title": "AD-GRS AD-GRSexAPOE", "text": "\nPredicted quadratic trajectories of memory function by Alzheimer Disease Genetic Risk Score (AD-GRS) from race-specific generalized linear models adjusted for baseline age, sex, and eigenvectors.

An alternative AD-GRS excluding APOE predicted both predecline level of memory function 8 and change in memory function over time among NHW, whereas it did not predict either among NHB. However, we were unable to find evidence that the effect of the AD-GRSexAPOE on memory decline was statistically different between NHW and NHB. This suggests that recently discovered AD-related loci add to the prediction of rate of memory loss in late life among NHW, but whether they improve prediction among NHB remains to be seen. Several studies have examined associations between individual AD polymorphisms and both cognitive level and change. Apart from APOE, evidence was mixed for other polymorphisms across different memory instruments and cohorts. CLU, PICALM, and CR1 were associated with cognitive decline (global cognition and attention) in 1831 participants of the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study. 33 When evaluating memory outcomes in black and white subjects, Pedraza and colleagues found a nominally significant association with CR1 in white subjects and with CLU in black subjects. CR1 was associated with episodic memory and global cognition in a combined analysis of 2 US cohorts of nondemented people. 34 CR1 was also found to interact with APOE in predicting episodic memory decline in 2 US cohorts. 35 CLU was associated with memory scores in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging 36 and with global cognitive function in 2 Danish cohorts. 37 However, these studies also report null associations between some AD polymorphisms and cognitive outcomes. For instance, PICALM was not associated with any cognitive outcomes in the study by Pedraza and colleagues. Similarly, CLU was not associated with cognition in the study by Chibnik et al. 34 BIN1, CLU, ABCA7, CR1, MS4A6A, CD33, and MS4A4E were not associated with memory in the study reported by Thambisetty et al. 36 Many studies looked at genetic predictors of age-related cognitive decline beyond only AD polymorphisms and have identified APOE, COMT, BDNF, and DTNBP1 as predictors of cognitive decline. 38 Few studies have examined the association of a polygenic risk score for AD and cognition in older adults, and none of their samples included nonwhite populations. In 5171 nondemented people (age 45 to 99 y) from the population-based Rotterdam Study, Verhaaren et al 9 found that a GRS constructed from APOE, EPHA1, ABCA7, BIN1, CD2AP, CLU, CR1, MS4A4E, MS4A6A, and PICALM genotypes predicted both baseline global cognition and baseline memory function. However, after excluding APOE from the score, these associations were no longer statistically significant. In the National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study, a multilocus genotype, which combined information from PICALM, CR1, BIN1, and CLU, predicted episodic memory. 10 Conversely, a cross-sectional study across 5 cohorts of the GERAD1 consortium found no associations between 5 polygenic risk scores (created using different thresholds for P-values of AD-polymorphism associations) and cognitive ability in later life or age-related cognitive change. 11 Only this last study examined change in cognitive function, whereas the previous 2 estimated only cross-sectional associations. Additional research on the link between the genetic risk factors and memory change is important because the genetic predictors of memory decline could differ from those of memory level.\nThese contrasting results may be due to differing cognitive measures, sample differences, low statistical power, design issues (retrospective studies), and the high risk of type 1 error because of multiple testing. These methodological challenges motivated our use of a polygenic risk score, which aids in overcoming the issues of lack of power and multiple testing.\nOne possible explanation for the different results between NHW and NHB is that different genetic markers influence AD progression in the 2 racial groups. As the GWAS studies informing the weights for the AD-GRS use predominantly NHW samples, our AD-GRS could be misweighted for our NHB sample. In addition, some of the loci included in our AD-GRS may not actually be predictive of AD, predecline level of cognition, or decline among nonwhite populations. However, amidst mixed evidence of the relevance of APOE for AD prediction among NHB, 30, 39 we found evidence that the AD-GRS including APOE strongly predicted memory decline in our sample of NHB. Moreover, we found no evidence that a new ABCA7 SNP (rs115550680) identified among blacks as predictive of AD was predictive of memory decline. We need more GWAS conducted in racially diverse samples to create more relevant polygenic scores for minority race groups and evaluate the performance of loci previously identified in predominantly European ancestry samples.\nThis large, diverse data set with genetic information and repeated memory assessments is uniquely suited for this research question. However, it has limitations. We have no information on gene expression or epigenetic modifications. Gene expression patterns could explain differences in rate of memory decline in people with similar gene frequencies. Further, HRS does not have a clinical dementia diagnosis or assessments of many important domains of cognitive function and available measures likely have substantial measurement error. In particular, differences in the validity and reliability of the memory assessment for blacks and whites may have contributed to our findings. Memory scores were scaled based on more detailed assessments available in the predominantly white ADAMS subsample. Inequalities in quality and quantity of education may also compromise the validity and reliability of standard memory assessments for older US blacks. Both of these limitations of the memory score measure could have attenuated the observed effect among NHBs. 40 Finally, we have a smaller sample size among NHB (N = 1081), so our finding that the alternative AD-GRSexAPOE does not predict memory decline among NHBs could be an issue of power.\nA strength of this study is that we focused on the genetic contribution to late life memory decline, not just level of functioning. As both premorbid level of cognition and rate of decline contribute to AD development, it is critical that we understand the determinants of both. Another strength of this paper is that we directly assessed the possibly of survival bias-a potential source of bias that is widely recognized by AD researchers but rarely addressed. For example, if a population is genotyped at age 70, those with a harmful genotype may be more likely to be omitted, because of prior mortality. The disproportionate omission of the worst performing group could make this genotype seem less harmful than it really is because survivors are not representative of other carriers. As we found that neither APOE alone nor the AD-GRS predict death or dropout, this is evidence that survival bias in studies of the AD-GRS may not be a major concern. One limitation of our assessment was that everyone had to be alive for genotyping (in either 2006 or 2008), so we only had 4 years of mortality follow-up from 2008 to 2012. However, we did not find large differences in the mortality rates of NHW and NHB alive in 1998: 23.8% of NHW and 26.7% of NHB died by 2006. Whether GRSs predict mortality is also of substantive interest because it may elucidate possible biological mechanisms or clinical relevance. Substantively, our findings may mean that these SNPs are causally related to memory function and rate of decline, but not to overall survival.\nIn conclusion, we found that a GRS for AD predicts not only level but also rate of memory loss in a nationally representative sample of older NHW and NHB. However, because of the smaller sample size of NHB, our results were consistent with an association between the AD-GRSex-APOE and memory decline among NHB of both: (1) zero; and (2) the same as the association found among NHW. Although recently discovered AD-related loci add to the prediction of rate of memory loss in older NHW adults, whether they contribute to our understanding of the genetic determinants of cognitive decline among NHB remains to be seen. Future studies should attempt to identify loci that are predictive of AD as well as cognitive function and decline in NHB (and other nonwhite populations) samples. Because of the heterogeneity of associations and the relatively small amount of variance in rate of cognitive decline explained by genetics to date, next steps among NHW include investigating whether gene-environment interactions exist. For example, researchers should explore whether the AD-GRS has differential effects on rate of cognitive decline among people with high versus low cognitive reserve. The AD-GRS can facilitate investigations of this and other important questions to help us better understand how genes and life experiences influence risk of developing AD."}]
