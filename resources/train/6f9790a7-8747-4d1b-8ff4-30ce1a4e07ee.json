We assessed the pharmacokinetics (PK)/ pharmacodynamics (PD) of crenezumab and its interaction with monomeric A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42) peptides in serum/plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from the phase II ABBY and BLAZE studies and the phase Ib GN29632 study.\nMethods: In ABBY, BLAZE, and GN29632 studies, patients with mild-to-moderate AD were treated with either placebo or crenezumab (300 mg subcutaneously every 2 weeks [q2w], or 15 mg/kg, 30 mg/kg, 45 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, or 120 mg/kg intravenously q4w). Serum/plasma PK/PD analyses included samples from 131 patients who received crenezumab in all three studies. CSF PK/PD analyses included samples from 76 patients who received crenezumab in ABBY or BLAZE. The impact of baseline patient factors on A\u03b2 profiles was also evaluated. Results: The serum concentration of crenezumab increased in a dose-proportional manner between 15 and 120 mg/kg q4w. Total monomeric plasma A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42) levels significantly increased after crenezumab administration. The mean crenezumab CSF to serum ratio was~0.3% and was similar across dosing cohorts/routes of administration. No clear correlation was observed between crenezumab concentration and A\u03b2(1-42) increase in CSF at week 69. The target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) model described the observed plasma concentration-time profiles of crenezumab and A\u03b2 well. Elimination clearance (CL el ) and central volume of distribution (V cent ) of crenezumab were estimated at 0.159 L/day and 2.89 L, respectively, corresponding to a half-life of~20 days. Subcutaneous bioavailability was estimated at 66.2%.\nConclusions: Crenezumab PK was dose proportional up to 120 mg/kg, with a half-life consistent with IgG monoclonal antibodies.

Accumulations of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides and amyloid plaque deposition in the brain are characteristic of AD [2] . A\u03b2 peptides can exist as monomers or aggregated forms (soluble oligomers, fibers, and plaque), and although the extent to which different A\u03b2 species contribute to the pathophysiology of AD remains uncertain, in vitro and ex vivo evidence suggests that soluble oligomers may be major drivers of neurotoxicity [3] [4] [5] .\nCrenezumab is a fully humanized anti-A\u03b2 immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to monomeric as well as aggregated forms of A\u03b2 [6, 7] . In vitro, crenezumab has been shown to block A\u03b2 aggregation, promote disaggregation, and protect neurons from oligomer-induced cytotoxicity [6] . Completed clinical trials of crenezumab in patients with mild-to-moderate AD include the phase II ABBY (NCT01343966) and BLAZE (NCT01397578) studies [8, 9] . Despite these studies not meeting their primary endpoints, exploratory post hoc analyses of the effects of crenezumab in a subset of patients with very mild AD in the high-dose 15 mg/kg intravenous (IV) cohort suggested the utility of testing earlier treatment of AD with higher doses of crenezumab [8] . Interim data from a phase Ib GN29632 study (NCT02353598) [10] [11] [12] supported further testing of higher doses of crenezumab. Two phase III studies (CREAD, NCT02670083; CREAD2, NCT03114657) investigated the efficacy and safety of crenezumab at a dose of 60 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks (q4w), i.e., fourfold higher than the high dose in phase II, compared with placebo in patients with early (prodromal-to-mild) AD [13, 14] . These studies were recently discontinued following a pre-planned interim analysis of CREAD, which indicated the study was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint; no safety signals were observed in this analysis and the overall safety profile was similar to that seen in previous trials [15] . A study of the efficacy and safety of crenezumab in individuals who carry the PSEN1 E280A autosomal-dominant mutation and do not meet the criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to AD or dementia due to AD and are, thus, in a preclinical phase of AD (autosomal-dominant AD) is ongoing [16] .\nHere we report the PK of crenezumab and its interaction with monomeric A\u03b2 and A\u03b2 peptides (peripheral target engagement pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers) as assessed in serum/plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in samples from phase II ABBY and BLAZE studies and the phase Ib GN29632 study. Monomeric A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42) peptides were evaluated in this analysis, as they can be measured reliably in plasma and CSF using automated high-precision immunoassays. While A\u03b2 oligomers have also been measured successfully in CSF from the ABBY and BLAZE studies [17] , it is technically challenging to measure those forms of A\u03b2 in plasma. PK/PD characteristics of mAbs such as crenezumab, and their interactions with target molecules, can be described by target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) models, which take into account the binding affinity of the antibody for its target molecule and the resulting degradation/clearance of the antibody-target complex and as such can provide insights to unmeasured species such as free target concentrations. This is of high value as development of assays for free targets are often technically challenging. We constructed a TMDD model to describe crenezumab serum concentrations and plasma A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42) peptide levels in patients treated with crenezumab to help quantitatively interpret observed interactions and simulate the concentration of unmeasured species, such as free plasma A\u03b2. In addition, plasma A\u03b2 levels have been reported to be influenced by baseline patient characteristics, e.g., age and renal function [18] ; therefore, we also used this model to assess the impact of baseline patient characteristics on the A\u03b2 profiles."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study design and subjects", "text": "In this analysis, crenezumab PK and PD data, i.e., serum total crenezumab concentrations and plasma total monomeric A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42) levels, collected from patients enrolled in the phase II ABBY and BLAZE studies and the phase Ib GN29632 study were used. The detailed methodology, study randomization, and sample size determination for the studies have been described previously (Table 1) [8, 9, 12] .\nABBY was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of crenezumab in patients with mild-tomoderate AD [8] . Patients received low-dose 300 mg SC crenezumab or placebo q2w, or high-dose 15 mg/kg IV crenezumab or placebo q4w. To assess the potential for using a higher dose of crenezumab compared with phase I, part 2 of ABBY was preceded by a safety run-in (SRI) period (for SRI dosing schemes, see Table 1 ) [8] .\nBLAZE was a phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the effects of crenezumab on brain amyloid plaque load as assessed by florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) and other biomarkers in patients with mild-to-moderate AD [9] . Patients were required to have evidence of elevated amyloid burden consistent with a diagnosis of AD. The study was conducted in two parts as described above for the ABBY study without the SRI period/cohort. Dosing regimens and patient numbers for both ABBY and BLAZE are described in Table 1 .\nIn both ABBY (including the SRI period) and BLAZE, blood samples were collected for PK measurement of serum crenezumab concentrations at week 1 (on day 1, including a pre-dose baseline sample), at specified times throughout the treatment period (through week 69), during the efficacy and safety follow-up visits (weeks 73, 81, and 85), and at end-oftreatment/treatment discontinuation visits. For patients in the SC cohort, samples were collected prior to study drug administration on dosing days; for those in the IV cohort, samples were collected prior to study drug administration and 60 min after the end of infusion, unless otherwise specified. Blood samples for PD analysis were collected during the screening period and at the week 1 (day 1) visit, at specified times during the treatment period (through week 69), weeks 73, 81, and 85 of the safety follow-up visits, and at endof-treatment/treatment discontinuation visits. On dosing days, blood samples for PD analysis were collected prior to study drug administration. In ABBY, CSF samples were collected as an optional procedure at week 1 (day 1/baseline) and before study drug administration at week 69 (steady state). In BLAZE, CSF samples were collected from all patients at screening and prior to dosing at week 69 or at early termination/discontinuation, if necessary.\nGN29632 was a phase Ib, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group ascending dose study followed by an open-label extension (OLE) study. This study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of crenezumab delivered at higher doses than those used in the phase II program. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the three cohorts and received between 30 and 120 mg/kg IV q4w of crenezumab or placebo. Dosing regimens and patient numbers per cohort are detailed in Table 1 . Blood samples for serum PK and plasma PD analyses were collected at baseline (week 1/day 1; pre-dose, 1 min, and 60-90 min post-administration), week 1/day 2, week 1/day 8 (\u00b1 2 days), week 2/day 15 (\u00b1 2 days), week 5 (\u00b1 2 days), week 9 (\u00b1 2 days), week 13 (\u00b1 2 days), week 21 (\u00b1 2 days), at end of treatment, and at the start of the OLE study. Per protocol, all scheduled serum PK and plasma PD samples were obtained just prior to study drug administration and 60-90 min after the end of infusion.\nAll studies were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and complied with Good Clinical Practice. A central investigational review board and individual site institutional review boards reviewed and provided approval for the protocols as well as informed consent forms. All subjects provided informed consent and consent for publication. Following a protocol amendment, patients in cohort 1 could increase to 60 mg/kg q4w dose after week 133.

As may therefore be expected, the modeling data suggested that plasma A\u03b2 was predominantly bound (Fig. 8) . The reduction in free plasma A\u03b2 levels associated with crenezumab treatment was better maintained at higher doses, even after the increase in total A\u03b2 level had plateaued."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "In this pooled analysis of data from the phase II ABBY and BLAZE studies and the phase Ib GN29632 study, we showed that the PK of crenezumab in patients with mild-to-moderate AD was dose proportional across the dose range tested (15-120 mg/kg q4w IV and 300 mg q2w SC) and was characterized by clearance and t 1/2 values expected of IgG mAbs (0.159 L/day and t 1/2~2 0 days, respectively) ( Table 2 ) [22] . Body weight was shown to influence the elimination clearance of crenezumab (CL el ), intrinsic clearance of crenezumab-A\u03b2 complex (CL int ), and central distribution volume (V cent ), all of which increased with increasing body weight (Fig. 7) . These findings are consistent with the results observed for other therapeutic IgG molecules that exhibit linear kinetics in humans [22] . Total plasma A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42) levels increased significantly following each administration of crenezumab demonstrating peripheral target engagement of monomeric A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2 . The increase in total A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42) levels can be attributed to slower elimination of crenezumab-A\u03b2 complex than free A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42): 0.36 vs 114 [A\u03b2(1-40)] or 287 [A\u03b2(1-42)] on day 1. The observed increase in total plasma A\u03b2 levels was dose dependent but not dose proportional and reached a plateau with the 120 mg/kg q4w IV dose. A TMDD model developed to characterize the observed serum crenezumab concentrations, plasma A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42) levels, and the PK/PD relationship between them, successfully described the observed data, including the non-dose-proportional increase in plasma A\u03b2 levels. This model suggested that reductions in free A\u03b2 levels associated with crenezumab dosing are better maintained at higher doses, even after the total plasma A\u03b2 levels had plateaued (Fig. 8 ).\nOur analysis suggested that age and GFR explain some of the BSV in baseline A\u03b2 levels. This is consistent with a previous study by Toledo and colleagues [18] who analyzed baseline A\u03b2 measures in 715 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://www.adni-info.org/index) and reported that age, platelet count, total protein, and creatinine concentration were independent predictors of baseline A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2(1-42) levels, explaining 12.1% and 12.9% of the observed variability in the respective parameters [18] . The model estimated K d of crenezumab against A\u03b2(1-40) and A\u03b2 were similar to each other. This is consistent with in vitro observation that crenezumab has similar binding affinity to these two A\u03b2 species (~10 nM) [F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.; data on file]. Patient factors, such as age or sex, were not identified as significant covariates for K d , suggesting that the binding of crenezumab to A\u03b2 is independent of currently evaluated patient factors.\nThe PK/PD data from this study provide evidence of peripheral target engagement by crenezumab at evaluated dose levels. This complements the target Fig. 7 Predicted impact of patient baseline characteristics on PK profile of crenezumab and plasma A\u03b2 levels.

The increase in total monomeric A\u03b2(1-42) is likely due to slower elimination of crenezumab-A\u03b2 complex. We further evaluated relationships between crenezumab concentration and A\u03b2(1-42) increase in CSF, but no clear correlation was observed ( Fig. 5) , which could be due to limited ranges of evaluable doses and high variability between patients for demonstrating exposure-response relationships in CSF. The concentration of crenezumab in CSF was much higher than the concentration of A\u03b2, yet still much lower than in serum (approximately 0.3% of serum). This suggests that a wider dose range is needed to be able to quantify the exposure-response relationship in the central nervous system.\nThe PK/PD simulation provided several important insights. Firstly, the simulation showed that circulating crenezumab is predominantly unbound. This indicates that the transfer of crenezumab to peripheral organs and Fig. 8 Simulations illustrating effects of varying crenezumab doses (mg/kg q4w) on plasma A\u03b2 kinetics based on the developed PK/PD model. Note that total and free crenezumab concentrations overlap with each other. Abbreviations: A\u03b2 beta-amyloid, PD pharmacodynamics, PK pharmacokinetics, q4w every 4 weeks the central nervous system is likely not influenced by its binding to A\u03b2. The low concentration of crenezumab-A\u03b2 complex, compared with total crenezumab, also suggests that the transfer of the binding complex is unlikely to serve as a new source of A\u03b2 for peripheral organs including the central nervous system.\nAnother interesting observation is that predicted free A\u03b2 levels continued to decrease with increasing dose, even after the accumulation of total A\u03b2 reached a plateau ( Fig. 8 ), suggesting that total A\u03b2 change may not be fully reflective of actual drug effect. The reason for this apparent discrepancy between total and free A\u03b2 profiles is that accumulation of total A\u03b2 is due to slower elimination of crenezumab-A\u03b2 complex than free A\u03b2. Therefore, once the crenezumab-A\u03b2 complex becomes the predominant species of total A\u03b2, there will be no further increase in total A\u03b2 with increased crenezumab dose. In contrast, binding of crenezumab to residual free A\u03b2 can still occur with a higher free crenezumab concentration. Additionally, since analytical quantification of free A\u03b2 is technically challenging due to changing levels of bound vs free A\u03b2 in vitro after CSF collection that might differ from the levels in vivo, the model proposed in the current study could be a promising tool to integrate available information, such as total A\u03b2 levels, and provide further insights on the kinetics of unmeasured species such as free A\u03b2."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In this study, we showed that crenezumab PK was dose proportional at doses between 15 and 120 mg/kg with a t 1/2 consistent with IgG mAbs, and provided evidence of peripheral target engagement in patients with mild-tomoderate AD, based on data pooled from three clinical trials of crenezumab (two phase II studies; one phase Ib study). We also observed dose-dependent increases in total monomeric A\u03b2(1-42) levels in CSF; however, exposure-response relationships need to be further evaluated at higher doses and in larger studies. We demonstrated how a TMDD model can be used to integrate available information, such as the serum PK characteristics of crenezumab and the plasma total A\u03b2 levels, and to make inferences to unmeasured species such as free A\u03b2 levels.
