Therefore, we hypothesized that the ApoE-\u03b54 allele is associated with altered patterns of longitudinal ventricular expansion, in dementia and normal aging. We tested this hypothesis in a large sample of elderly participants, using a linear discriminant analysis-based approach. Carrying more ApoE-\u03b54 alleles was associated with faster ventricular expansion bilaterally and with regional patterns of lateral ventricle morphology at 1-and 2-year follow up, after controlling for sex, age, and dementia status.

These findings, combined with earlier investigations showing that ApoE is also directly implicated in other conditions, suggest that the selective enrollment of ApoE-\u03b54 carriers may empower clinical trials of other neurological disorders."}, {"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "Age-and disease-related expansion of the lateral ventricles reflects the accumulation of brain tissue loss throughout multiple brain regions. It co-occurs with gray and white matter degeneration globally and in nearby subcortical regions (Ferrarini et al., 2008; Qiu et al., 2009) . In normal aging, ventricular enlargement rates accelerate around the age of 60 years, and then continue at a stable pace even in those who survive into their late 90s (Jernigan et al., 2001; Walhovd et al., 2005) . Dementia affects ventricular volumes (Carmichael et al., 2007a) and the rate of ventricular enlargement (Carmichael et al., 2007b) , and this rate distinguishes Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients from healthy elderly control subjects, even when cross-sectional ventricular volumes overlap between the 2 groups (Wang et al., 2002) .\nThe apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele (ApoE-\u03b54) is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late onset AD, and has unequivocally been linked to AD in over 100 studies (Bertram et al., 2007) . Although there are ethnic and demographic differences in allele frequencies, around 25% of the world's population carries at least 1 copy of the \u03b54 risk allele, and each copy of this risk allele is associated with an approximate 3-fold increase in the odds of developing AD (Bertram et al., 2007) . The ApoE-\u03b54 allele increases not only the risk of developing late onset AD but also the rate of dementia progression both in terms of cognitive decline (Stone et al., 2010) and temporal lobe atrophy (Filippini et al., 2009b; Hua et al., 2010; Lehtovirta et al., 1995) .\nA recent study examined how the ApoE-\u03b54 allele affects ventricular volume trajectory (Erten-Lyons et al., 2013) . Greater ventricular volume enlargement over time was significantly associated with carrying the ApoE-\u03b54 allele (Erten-Lyons et al., 2013) . However, this study had several limitations, including a small sample (N \u00bc 71), and the use of a semi-automated methodological approach to measure ventricular volumes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Most importantly, the study included both healthy elderly individuals and individuals with dementia, but the investigators did not control for dementia status when assessing how the ApoE-\u03b54 allele related to longitudinal ventricular expansion. As dementia affects the rate of ventricular enlargement (Carmichael et al., 2007b; Erten-Lyons et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2002) , this study design did not reveal whether the ApoE-\u03b54 allele may independently influence ventricular volume trajectory, or whether the observed effects were mediated by dementia status, since people with AD are also more likely to carry the ApoE-\u03b54 allele.\nBrain structure and function are related to ApoE genotype not just for AD patients but also in healthy elderly individuals, and even in asymptomatic young individuals who carry the ApoE-\u03b54 allele. For example, healthy young ApoE-\u03b54 carriers show different patterns of brain activity both in resting state and during memory encoding tasks, compared with noncarriers (Filippini et al., 2009a) . Further, medial temporal lobe volumes are smaller in healthy middle-aged carriers as well as elderly ApoE-\u03b54 carriers (Barboriak et al., 2000; den Heijer et al., 2002; Wishart et al., 2006) and hippocampal volumes are reduced in healthy young ApoE-\u03b54 carriers (O'Dwyer et al., 2012) . Moreover, cognitively normal, latemiddle-aged adults show whole-brain atrophy rates that are correlated with ApoE-\u03b54 gene dose (Chen et al., 2007) . Healthy elderly ApoE-\u03b54 carriers also have localized abnormalities in ventricular shape and volume (Chou et al., 2008 (Chou et al., , 2010 . Based on the above findings, we thus hypothesized that the ApoE-\u03b54 allele is associated with the overall trajectory of ventricular volume expansion both in dementia and in normal aging.\nHere, we tested this primary hypothesis in a large sample of elderly participants (N \u00bc 736 at baseline) from the Alzheimer's Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI). To track the volume of the lateral ventricles across baseline, 1-year (N \u00bc 622) and 2-year (N \u00bc 479) follow up scans; we used an innovative linear discriminant analysis-based approach previously developed by our group . We also applied advanced surface-based anatomic modeling to examine associations between ApoE-\u03b54 loading and regional changes in the shape and volume of the lateral ventriclesdafter controlling for age, sex, and dementia status. This allowed us to create 3D maps of ventricular expansion associated with the ApoE-\u03b54 allele. We also conducted exploratory post hoc analyses to examine the effects of ApoE genotype on ventricular expansion and expansion rate within each hemisphere and within each diagnostic group, to assess its possible impact on left-right asymmetry in expansion, and to test alternate models of allele effects."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Subjects", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI database. The ADNI was launched in 2003 by the National Institute on Aging, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the Food and Drug Administration, private pharmaceutical companies and nonprofit organizations, as a 5-year public-private partnership. The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, positron emission tomography, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to help researchers and clinicians develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as decrease the time and cost of clinical trials.\nAll ADNI studies are conducted according to the Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and U.S. 21 CFR Part 50 (Protection of Human Subjects), and Part 56 (Institutional Review Boards). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before protocol-specific procedures were performed. To avoid the known effects of population stratification on genetic analysis (Lander and Schork, 1994) , we only included nonHispanic Caucasian subjects identified by self-report and confirmed by multi-dimensional scaling analysis (Stein et al., 2010) . The ADNI cohort included 3 diagnostic groups: people with AD, amnestic MCI, and healthy elderly (cognitively normal) participants (Aisen et al., 2010) . About 14% of ADNI participants reported a paternal history of AD and 35% reported a maternal history of dementia (Andrawis et al., 2012) and the 2-year MCI to AD conversion rate was 37.7% (Tatsuoka et al., 2013) . Our final analysis comprised 736 individuals (average age AE SD \u00bc 75.52 AE 6.79 years; 436 men/300 women) including 173 AD, 358 MCI, and 205 healthy participants at baseline (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "ApoE genotyping", "text": "ApoE genotyping was performed on DNA samples obtained from subjects' blood, using an ApoE genotyping kit, as described in http:// www.adni-info.org/Scientists/Pdfs/adniproceduresmanual12.pdf (also see http://www.adni-info.org for detailed information on blood sample collection, DNA preparation, and genotyping methods). The ApoE gene is polymorphic, with 3 major isoforms: ApoE2 (\u03b52 allele), ApoE3 (\u03b53 allele), and ApoE4 (\u03b54 allele). In all our analyses, ApoE genotype was coded as 0, 1, and 2 for the presence of 0, 1, and 2 ApoE-\u03b54 adverse alleles, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Image acquisition, correction, and pre-processing", "text": "Participants were scanned with a standardized MRI protocol developed for this cohort (Jack et al., 2008; Leow et al., 2006) . Briefly, high-resolution structural brain MRI scans were acquired at 58 sites across North America, using 1.5 Tesla MRI scanners. There was no trend in the data whereby a great number of people with any one diagnosis were preferentially evaluated on any one scanner. To minimize variation because of technical nonuniformity in the data collected at different sites, a major effort was taken to establish very specific standards in the MRI protocol and acquisition parameters. The ADNI MRI protocol was selected in a data-driven manner with considerable deliberation by a group of experts in the field (Jack et al., 2008) . A sagittal 3D MP-RAGE sequence was used, and optimized for consistency across sites (repetition time/echo time \u00bc 2400/1000 ms; flip angle \u00bc 8 ; field of view \u00bc 24 cm; final reconstructed voxel resolution \u00bc 0.9375 \u00c2 0.9375 \u00c2 1.2 mm 3 ) (Jack et al., 2008) . In addition, phantom-based monitoring of the instruments themselves was conducted to monitor performance over time for each scanner involved in the ADNI project (Jack et al., 2008) . Based on 622 phantom scans collected at 49 sites, the average standard deviations of scale factors across individual scanners were 0.04, 0.07, and 0.11% along the x, y, and z axes, respectively (Gunter et al., 2007) . Furthermore, image quality control procedures and post-acquisition correction of various image artifacts were performed at a single site (Mayo clinic) to ensure the consistency of these preprocessing steps (Jack et al., 2008) ."}, {"section_title": "Segmentation of the lateral ventricles", "text": "For lateral ventricle segmentation, we analyzed baseline (N \u00bc 736), 1-year (N \u00bc 622), and 2-year (N \u00bc 479) follow up brain MRI scans from the ADNI cohort. Raw MRI scans were pre-processed to reduce signal inhomogeneity and linearly registered to a template (using 9 parameter registration). Prior methods for ventricular segmentation have used semi-automated, automated (Chou et al., 2008) , and single-atlas or multi-atlas methods (Chou et al., 2009 ). Here, we chose to segment the ventricles with our modified multi-atlas based approach described previously , which was further tested and expanded in 2 prior analyses (Madsen et al., 2013) . Our segmentation approach uses group-wise surface registration to existing templates in addition to surface-based template blending to yield more accurate results. The lateral ventricles were segmented in each subject using a validated method (Chou et al., 2008) . Ventricular surfaces were then extracted from these segmentations and an inverseconsistent fluid registration with a mutual information fidelity term aligned a set of hand-labeled ventricular templates to each scan (Leow et al., 2007) . The template surfaces were registered into homologous point-to-point correspondence as a group using medial-spherical registration (Gutman et al., 2012) .\nTo construct a surface boundary of the new subject, a normalized similarity measure (mutual information) between each template image and the new image was computed around each vertex point of each deformed template surface. The position of each new boundary point was defined by the template with the best similarity score, and the final surface was then constrained to be a smooth approximation of this \"winner-takesall\" construction. This approach is very similar to that of Yushkevich et al. (2010) , except that the current approach is based on surface geometry rather than image voxels. This \"patchbased\" approach is advantageous compared with whole-template approaches typically used in multi-atlas segmentation, allowing more flexible segmentation, particularly for outliers. Segmentations were assessed visually for defects from multiple views. While visually inspecting ventricular surface segmentations, we removed 4 subjects (2 CON, 1 MCI, 1 AD) whose meshes deviated by several millimeters from the actual periventricular boundaries. Our final analysis included 736 ADNI subjects at the baseline, 622 at 12-month follow up, and 479 at 24-month follow up (Table 1) ."}, {"section_title": "Volumetric analyses: statistical associations of ApoE genotype with ventricular volumes", "text": "In most analyses, the number of ApoE-\u03b54 alleles (0, 1, or 2) was used to predict variations in ventricular volumes and ventricular expansion using general linear models (GLMs) in SPSS 21.0. As each copy of the \u03b54 risk allele is associated with an approximate 3-fold increase in the odds of developing AD (Bertram et al., 2007) , and ApoE-\u03b54 gene dose correlates with whole-brain atrophy rates (Chen et al., 2007) , our primary modeling approach essentially assumed an additive model of allele effects. In some of the post hoc analyses described in section 3.3.2, we tested other models of \u03b54 alleles effects. In the dominant model, ApoE-\u03b54 genotype was defined as carrying 0 \u03b54 allele versus carrying of 1 or 2 \u03b54 alleles; in the recessive model, it was defined as carrying of 0 or 1 \u03b54 allele versus being homozygous for \u03b54.\nIn the primary volumetric analyses (section 3.2), GLM outcome measures included ventricular volume at baseline (in cubic mm, N \u00bc 736), difference between total ventricular volume at baseline and volume after 1 year (in cubic mm, N \u00bc 622), and difference between total ventricular volume at baseline and volume after 2 years (in cubic mm, N \u00bc 479). In the exploratory post hoc volumetric analyses, we examined additional GLM outcome measures, including difference between ventricular volumes at baseline and volumes after 1 or 2 years, within each hemisphere (N \u00bc 622 at 12-month and N \u00bc 479 at 24-month follow up, section 3.3.1), difference between ventricular volumes at baseline and volumes after 1 or 2 years divided by volume at baseline, within each hemisphere (i.e., \"expansion rate\", N \u00bc 622 at 12-month and N \u00bc 479 at 24-month follow up, section 3.3.1), and difference between left and right ventricular volumes and ventricular expansion at baseline, 12-month, and 24-month follow up (i.e., \"left-right asymmetry\", section 3.3.5).\nUnless otherwise specified, all analyses controlled for age, sex, and diagnosis (i.e., baseline dementia status: healthy elderly control, MCI, or AD).

As in the GLMs described above, age, sex, and dementia status (i.e., healthy elderly control, MCI, or AD) were included as nuisance covariates in the primary surface-based analyses (section 3.4.1). As also mentioned previously, since the volume images were already normalized for overall brain size during the 9-parameter affine alignment, we did not control for total brain volume. Maps were corrected for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% (q < 0.05) according to the implementation by Storey et al. (Storey, 2002; Storey et al., 2004) . In the post hoc surfacebased analyses (section 3.4.2), we generated individual distance maps to assess relationships between the number of ApoE-\u03b54 alleles (0, 1, or 2) and regional ventricular surface morphology within diagnostic groups, controlling for age and sex. Maps did not pass correction for multiple comparisons using a FDR of 5% (q < 0.05), so we presented uncorrected maps.

At 12-month follow up, carrying more ApoE-\u03b54 alleles was associated with ventricular surface expansion, especially at the center (body) of the lateral ventricles. That is, higher ApoE-\u03b54 loading was associated with regions of expansion in the ventrolateral and dorsomedial ventricles bilaterally, while the frontal and temporal horns appeared less affected (N \u00bc 622, Fig. 1 ). At 24-month follow up, carrying more ApoE-\u03b54 alleles was significantly associated with expansion of almost the entire ventricular surface. Only very small regions, notably the outer edges of the frontal and temporal horns did not show a detectable association with ApoE \u03b54 status in our maps. This suggests that the association between higher ApoE-\u03b54 loading and expansion of the ventricular surfaces may \"spread\" from the body toward the edges of the structures over time (N \u00bc 479, Fig. 2 )."}, {"section_title": "Post hoc surface-based analyses", "text": "As with the volumetric analyses, we sought to further characterize the effects of ApoE in each diagnostic group by testing the association between genotype and ventricular surface morphology separately within each group. The uncorrected maps suggested associations between ApoE-\u03b54 status and ventricular morphology consistent with the results of the primary surface-based analyses across groups (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Carrying more ApoE-\u03b54 alleles was associated with ventricular surface expansion, and this association was more widespread and more significant at 2-year than at 1-year follow up, in all diagnostic groups ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). However, the effects of genotype on regional patterns of lateral ventricle morphology at 1-and 2-year follow up after controlling for age and sex, did not pass FDR correction within any diagnostic group, probably as a result of insufficient statistical power, as sample size were much smaller than in the surface-based analyses across groups."}, {"section_title": "Discussion", "text": "This study is the first to show that the ApoE-\u03b54 allele is directly associated with altered 3D profiles of longitudinal ventricular expansion rates and lateral ventricle surface morphology, both in dementia and in normal aging. Our 3D maps of ventricular surface morphology revealed that the effects of the ApoE-\u03b54 allele on longitudinal ventricular expansion were somewhat spatially distinct from the known effects of dementia progression. In contrast to prior studies showing that the frontal and temporal horns (Thompson et al., 2004) were most sensitive to AD progression, we found that the association between higher ApoE-\u03b54 load and expansion of the ventricular surfaces started in the body of the lateral ventricles and extended toward the frontal and temporal horns over time.

Carrying more ApoE-\u03b54 alleles was associated with being younger, within the MCI and AD groups but not within the control group. Assuming that all participants enrolled in the ADNI study a similar amount of time after disease onset, this finding could reflect the fact that ApoE-\u03b54 carriers develop dementia at younger ages, consistent with the literature (Slooter et al., 1998; Thambisetty et al., 2013) . Post hoc analyses suggested that the association between ApoE-\u03b54 genotype and longitudinal ventricular expansion was significant using all possible models of allele effects. Previous studies focusing on medial temporal lobe atrophy reported no gene dose effects of ApoE-\u03b54 in the healthy elderly individuals (Crivello et al., 2010; Lemaitre et al., 2005) , and found significant effects of ApoE genotype and dementia on hemispheric asymmetry (Donix et al., 2013) . In contrast, our results suggest that the ApoE-\u03b54 allele may affect longitudinal ventricular expansion in a dosedependent manner, and that neither ApoE-\u03b54 genotype nor diagnosis affect left-right asymmetry in ventricular volumes and ventricular expansion.\nWe found a significant genotype by diagnosis interaction at 2-year follow up, indicating that ApoE-\u03b54 status did not affect ventricular expansion equally in each diagnostic group. Withingroup analyses of total ventricular expansion also suggested that at 24-month follow up, the effects of ApoE genotype on ventricular expansion may be smaller in the AD than in the CON or MCI groups. It is likely that AD patients have more factors contributing to faster ventricular expansion than participants in the other 2 groups, including other dementia-related genetic factors, as well as additional developmental and lifestyle factors. As a result, ApoE genotype appears to account for a smaller portion of the variance in ventricular expansion in the AD group. Family history of dementia is related to genotype, but it may well be another factor influencing the trajectory of ventricular expansion differently in each diagnostic group, as emerging evidence suggests that ApoE-\u03b54 status and family history exert independent effects on brain atrophy (Andrawis et al., 2012) .\nDespite these group differences, the effects of ApoE-\u03b54 genotype on ventricular expansion became larger and more significant over time in the entire sample, after controlling for dementia status. In addition, the effects of ApoE-\u03b54 status after controlling for diagnosis, remained significant in studies restricting the analyses to the control and AD groups, even if the sample sizes were about half as large at both time points. Likewise, the effects of ApoE-\u03b54 on ventricular expansion remained significant within each diagnostic group in the volumetric studies of expansion rates. Furthermore, in all diagnostic groups, the uncorrected maps indicated associations between genotype and ventricular morphology consistent with the results across groups, even if the within-group surface basedanalyses were not adequately powered to detect the effects of ApoE-\u03b54 status on lateral ventricle morphology after correction for multiple comparisons. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that ApoE genotype is associated with ventricular expansion rate and surface morphology in both cognitively normal and demented participants.\nProgressive ventricular expansion reflects atrophy of the surrounding gray and white matter, and there is growing evidence that the ApoE4 protein has direct neurotoxic effects that in turn can lead to secondary neuronal dysfunction and degeneration (Mahley and Huang, 2012b; Zlokovic, 2013) . ApoE4 leads to the generation of neurotoxic fragments, which cause pathologic mitochondrial dysfunction and cytoskeletal alterations. Protein instability and altered protein conformation (\"domain interaction\") are responsible for these neurotoxic effects (Mahley and Huang, 2012b) . As ventricular expansion reflects the accumulation of neuronal loss in neighboring tissues, future studies should examine whether ApoE-\u03b54 effects on regional brain volumes follow a similar pattern of spatial progression in the areas surrounding the lateral ventricles. This could be achieved by mapping the longitudinal effects of ApoE-\u03b54 loading on regional brain atrophy, to determine whether the association is first observed in regions adjacent to the callosal body and thalamusdlocated just above and below the body of the lateral ventricles, respectively. Future investigations could also examine the spatial progression of ApoE-\u03b54 effects on other areas in the brain, such as in the cortex, where thinner gray matter has been linked with ventricular expansion rates in the elderly individuals (Madsen et al., 2013) .\nApoE4 exerts its neurotoxic effects both via amyloid bdependent and amyloid b-independent pathways (Zlokovic, 2013) , consistent with the involvement of the ApoE-\u03b54 allele not only in AD but also in the etiology, pathogenesis, and prognosis of various other neurologic disorders. Indeed, the ApoE-\u03b54 allele is associated with genetic predisposition to (Ely et al., 2007) and lower rates of recovery from delirium (Adamis et al., 2007) . ApoE-\u03b54 also predicts poor neurologic outcome after traumatic brain injury (Friedman et al., 1999) and cerebral hemorrhage (Alberts et al., 1995) . Moreover, the same allele is a risk factor for hippocampal volume loss in alcoholics (Bleich et al., 2003; Wilhelm et al., 2008) , suggesting that ApoE-\u03b54 may also promote neurodegeneration based on certain gene-environment interactions (Wilhelm et al., 2008) .\nApoE genotyping is currently considered beneficial in clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, but the relevance of ApoE is not limited to AD and its prodromal states. ApoE participates in general cellular pathways designed to respond adaptively to many environmental, metabolic, and genetic stimuli (Mahley and Huang, 2012b) . Our findings, combined with earlier investigations showing that ApoE-\u03b54 is a risk factor for other neurological conditions (Ely et al., 2007) , is associated with reduced capacity for neuronal regeneration (Friedman et al., 1999) and modulates the neurotoxic effects of alcohol abuse (Bleich et al., 2003; Wilhelm et al., 2008) , suggest that the selective enrollment of ApoE-\u03b54 carriers (or post hoc stratification by ApoE status) may empower clinical trials of other disorders, such as alcoholism and traumatic brain injury.\nApoE genotype should also be an important factor when devising novel approaches to treat and prevent a large spectrum of neurological disorders. In fact, an emerging approach is to prevent neurodegenerationeas opposed to treating a specific brain disordereby developing therapies to directly counteract ApoE4's neurotoxic effects, before the onset of any sign of neuropathology (Mahley and Huang, 2012b) . For example, as ApoE4's detrimental effects result from its altered protein conformation (\"domain interaction\"), small-molecule-based therapeutics that induce proper ApoE4 folding and block domain interaction in ApoE4 have been shown to reverse many of its harmful effects, both in vitro and in vivo (Mahley and Huang, 2012a) . Moreover, wholetranscriptome cerebral cortex gene expression data in unaffected ApoE-\u03b54 carriers recently identified a set of candidate core regulatory mediators, including SV2A, which encodes a well-described regulator of neuronal endocytosis (Rhinn et al., 2013) . In human induced neuron cultures derived from human skin fibroblasts of \u03b54 carriers or noncarriers, a selective SV2A inhibitor was shown to suppress the accumulation of amyloid b species selectively in the ApoE-\u03b54 carrier cultures (Rhinn et al., 2013) . It is still unclear whether such a therapeutic approach will be successful in human trials. Even so, this line of research represents an important shift from the current \"reactive approach\" to treating neurological disorders, which focuses on managing a specific condition after symptoms appear, to a more \"proactive approach\" based on early prevention and personalized treatments."}, {"section_title": "Disclosure statement", "text": "The authors have no actual or potential conflicts of interest.
