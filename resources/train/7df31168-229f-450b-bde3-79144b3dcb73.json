This allows them to not only estimate the implicit price of amenity factors but also construct a state-level quality of life index based on these amenity weights.\ndifferentials. Non-parametric quality of life indices avoid this issue. In an effort to eliminate completely the need for \"ad hoc\" selection of quality of life indicators, Douglas and Wall (1993) appeal to the legacy of Tiebout (1956) in arguing that migration patterns should reflect quality of life differentials: mobile residents will \"vote with their feet\" for those communities with high quality of life. They therefore construct a quality of life index based on the presumption that the probability of a resident moving from location A to B will depend on the degree to which the quality of life in location B exceeds that of location A (Douglas and Wall 1993) . This index allows them to rank locations in a relatively objective manner, but they do not attempt any further examination of the specific factors contributing to these quality of life rankings.\nThe methods described above each have their pros and cons. The hedonic method explicitly addresses specific factors contributing to quality of life, but its results are highly sensitive to functional form. The Tiebout method is non-parametric, but it does not provide any information about how the abstract concept of \"quality of life\" breaks down into its composite factors. In this study we use a unique new approach called data envelopment analysis (DEA) and a recent extension of DEA called value efficiency analysis (VEA) to explore the \"production\" of quality of life within counties in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States using counties as the units of analysis. These methods allow a non-parametric approach to ranking communities and analyzing the contributions of different factors to quality of life production. DEA is a non-parametric frontier analysis method that was originally developed to analyze the performance of organizations whose goals are not limited to profit maximization (Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes 1978) . The methodology has been applied to issues as diverse as fisheries management, health care provision, national defense, and the socioeconomic performance of nations (Bowlin 1998 , Golany and Thore 1997 , Walden and Kirkley 2000 .\nUsing linear programming, DEA creates a frontier of efficient units that envelopes other, relatively inefficient units. Various measures of inefficiency are available, based on different methods for measuring the distance from a unit's observed production point to the efficient frontier. DEA is flexible in that it does not require specification of an underlying production relationship between inputs and outputs, it is able to incorporate inputs and outputs that are measured in different units and at different scales, and it is able to accommodate multiple inputs and multiple outputs with minimal value judgments placed on the relative \"worth\" or \"cost\" of these inputs and outputs (Charnes et al. 1994) . The first and second features make DEA appealing for evaluating the performance of communities in providing quality of life using varying measures of economic, social, and environmental inputs and outputs. In using DEA for that purpose, the third feature represents an innovative approach to the aggregation of quality of life indices. Essentially, it provides an objective procedure for weighting inputs and outputs that requires the analyst to assume no more than that outputs should be maximized and inputs should be minimized. Since value judgments about the relative worth of alternative community attributes create potential minefields in quality of life assessment, this third feature is one that offers some appeal for objective assessments.\nExtensions of the DEA technique that retain the first two features noted above but that allow for stronger value judgments to be imposed regarding the relative desirability of inputs and outputs have been developed. Value efficiency analysis (VEA) is one such extension that is appealing in that it does not require those evaluating quality of life to explicitly assign weights, or relative weights, to inputs and outputs. Instead, evaluators need only to select a \"reference community\" against which other communities will be measured. The levels of inputs and outputs of that reference community establish implicit constraints on the weights that can be assigned to inputs and outputs in the remaining communities.\nIn the following section we briefly explain the basic structure of DEA and VEA. We then describe the quality of life model, explaining the relevant dimensions and the data used in our efficiency analysis, and present results. In doing so, we will explore the hypothesis that a fundamentally different efficiency frontier exists for rural counties than for urban counties; if this is the case, a county's performance should be measured relative to only those counties that share its rural/urban classification."}, {"section_title": "Data Envelopment Analysis and Value Efficiency Analysis", "text": "We envision counties as entities that make a collection of development decisions that in aggregate produce quality of life for their residents. Desirable outcomes that are created, such as employment opportunities and high quality educational systems, may be accompanied by undesirable outputs such as crime and pollution. In choosing a development path to maximize quality of life for its residents, counties would like to maximize the desirable outputs and minimize the undesirable outputs. Counties that are relatively efficient at producing high quality of life will produce relatively more desirable outputs per unit of undesirable output than counties that are relatively inefficient."}, {"section_title": "Data Envelopment Analysis", "text": "DEA provides a uniquely flexible way to model the scenario described above. Fundamental to our measurement of efficiency is the proposition that different development paths lead to communities with different combinations of attributes, and that overlying all of these possible combinations is a community attribute frontier that represents maximum achievable performance along the many dimensions making up quality of life. Efficient counties lie along the frontier and produce a higher ratio of desirable outputs to undesirable outputs than the inefficient counties that lie within the frontier. Using these frontiers as a standard for judging the relative performance of counties in producing quality of life requires few value judgments about the relative worth of various desirable or undesirable community characteristics. DEA makes only the weak but reasonable assumption that communities prefer to have more of \"good\" development outcomes (e.g., natural amenities, literacy, affordable living) and fewer of \"bad\" development outcomes (e.g., pollution and poverty).\nUsing terms borrowed from more traditional production relationships, in our analysis entities to be minimized (undesirable outcomes) will be referred to as inputs, and entities to be maximized (desirable outcomes) will be referred to as outputs. Of course, no direct production relationship exists among these factors-inputs are not actually transformed into outputs-but DEA is a nonparametric methodology and requires no assumptions about the form of the underlying relationship connecting inputs and outputs.\nThe most basic DEA formulation evaluates the relative efficiency of a production unit by estimating for each unit a measure of weighted outputs weighted inputs (Cooper, Seiford, and Tone 2000) . A unit with an efficiency ratio of 1 is efficient, while one that uses relatively many inputs, or produces relatively few outputs, will be found inefficient with a ratio of less than 1. One fundamental innovation that DEA offers is an objective method of determining what weights will be assigned to outputs and inputs in determining this ratio. The procedure computes a set of weights for each decision making unit (DMU) that maximizes its efficiency ratio, subject to the constraint that the efficiency ratio calculated at that set of weights does not exceed one for any DMU in the data set. Accordingly, the assigned weights vary by DMU and are derived from the data such that each DMU is allowed to be as efficient as possible relative to the other DMUs.\nThe original formulation for DEA can therefore be expressed as the following fractional programming problem, which must be solved for all n DMUs in the data set:\n(1) To ensure validity of the results, it is important to measure the performance of DMUs relative to an appropriate frontier. With our quality of life analysis, for instance, it may not be appropriate to measure the distance of inefficient rural counties from a frontier partially formed by efficient urban counties since the production relationship for urban and rural counties and their efficient frontiers may be fundamentally different. To illustrate, consider Figure 2 , which depicts three frontiers for two abstract outputs-environmental quality of life and economic quality of life. The frontier for urban communities implies only that urban regions are capable of producing very high economic quality output, but that their environmental quality output is limited. The frontier for rural communities implies the opposite: rural regions are able to produce high environmental quality, but it is not technically possible (according to observed data) to also produce high economic quality of life. The remaining frontier represents an overall frontier that would be computed by combining rural and urban communities.\n(2) , \nDMUs with weights that yield an efficiency rating of 1 define an efficient production frontier. Those with efficiency ratios less than 1 fall some distance from the frontier. A measure of this distance is a measure of the inefficiency of the DMU in question. For this formulation, the measure of distance is a radial measure indicating how the output/input ratio would have to change in order for that DMU to be considered efficient (i.e., to occupy a position on the efficient frontier).\nTo illustrate the problems inherent in using inappropriate frontiers for efficiency measurement, consider point A, which represents an urban community. This community will appear considerably more efficient as a production unit when measured relative to other urban regions (as shown along the line from the origin to the urban frontier) than when measured against rural regions or against a composite frontier. If it is the case that urban regions are fundamentally incomparable to rural regions in the provision of environmental amenities, then the two groups should be used to generate different efficiency frontiers. In this study, we use our efficiency results to explore whether there is evidence that such differential frontiers exist.\nTo illustrate, suppose that we have five DMUs producing two outputs using one input. The production possibilities frontier, assuming a constant input level equal to 1, is shown in Figure 1 . DMUs 1 through 4 lie on the frontier, and are therefore efficient (i.e., distance to the frontier is zero). The solution for the above LP model would therefore yield an efficiency ratio of one for each of these units. DMU 5, however, lies within the frontier. The solution of the LP problem for DMU 5 yields an efficiency ratio of \u03b7 = .527. In Figure  1 , this result is the ratio of distances OB/OA, where O refers to the origin, and points A and B are as indicated on the graph. The ratio indicates that the output/input ratio for DMU 5 is 52.7 percent of what is required for technical efficiency. Accordingly, to become efficient, DMU 5 can either reduce inputs to 52.7 percent of their current levels, or increase the level of each output produced to In the DEA formulation described by equation (2), we have fixed the aggregate value of weighted inputs at 1, and then determined weights by maximizing the weighted outputs. Running this formulation allows each DMU to be awarded weights that maximize its outputs subject to a"}, {"section_title": "Figure 1. Efficient Frontier with Five Production Units", "text": "fixed level of input. Such a formulation is called an \"input-oriented\" DEA formulation, as all weights are selected relative to a fixed weighted input level. As illustrated above, the resulting efficiency measurement indicates how outputs in an inefficient unit must be increased in order to achieve an efficient output level, given the fixed inputs.\nAn alternative formulation would fix weighted output levels at 1, and then select weights that minimize weighted input levels. This formulation is called an output-oriented formulation, and it produces an efficiency measurement describing how inputs must be reduced to achieve efficiency in the case of fixed outputs. This formulation is described by the series of equations below: \nIn the most fundamental case illustrated here, one is assuming constant returns to scale in the production process and that all inputs and outputs are controllable, and therefore can be altered in the pursuit of efficiency. In such a case, the two formulations described above produce identical efficiency rankings. However, one modification of the DEA formulation allows for the flexibility to assume variable returns to scale in the production relationship (Banker, Charnes, and Cooper 1984) . Another modification allows the decision maker to assume that certain variables are nondiscretionary, and therefore not amenable to alteration to achieve efficiency (Banker and Morey 1986 ). An extensive explanation of these modifications will not be included here, as they are covered in the prior literature, but we make use of V D tively weak criterion of technical efficiency. However, it can be useful to evaluate performance under stronger assumptions about the relative value of inputs and outputs by imposing logical restrictions on the weights allowed. These restrictions reflect judgments that exist independent of the data and that impose restrictions on efficiency measurements based on pre-existing perspectives about the relative importance of individual inputs and outputs or on prior views on what constitutes an efficient or an inefficient DMU (Allen et al. 1997) . We can then ask, how do communities perform contingent on a set of judgments about the relative value of different community outcomes?\nSeveral methods of weight restrictions have been developed in the literature, but in this study we will implement value efficiency analysis-a recent extension of DEA that allows the decision maker (DM) to incorporate into the efficiency analysis some information about preferences among production outcomes. The task of assigning constraints to weights or relative weights in DEA can be quite difficult and somewhat arbitrary, and is complicated in cases where the inputs and outputs are measured in different units. Rather than requiring the decision maker to set such constraints, VEA simply requires the decision maker to designate one DMU as a \"most preferred solution\" (MPS), denoted u*, which will be used as the standard against which other DMUs are measured. The decision maker is assumed to have a value function that is pseudoconcave, strictly increasing in outputs, and strictly decreasing in inputs, and that reaches a local maximum at the point u* on the efficient frontier (Halme et al. 1999; Korhonen, Tainio, and Wallenius 2001) . That point u* is therefore assumed to lie along a value contour that is unknown but, given the above assumptions, can be linearly approximated by the hyperplane tangent to the efficient production surface at u* (Halme et al. 1999) . Measurements of value efficiency evaluate how far a DMU lies from this approximated value contour, rather than from the technical efficiency frontier itself.\nVEA is illustrated in Figure 3 . As among the DMUs previously identified as efficient (DMUs 1 through 4), DMU 3 has been identified as the most preferred solution. It is assumed that there is an underlying value function whose exact functional form is unknown; a single isovalue curve is illustrated on the figure passing through the most preferred point. A value efficient measurement with full information would indicate how far each unit lies from the isovalue contour itself. However, in VEA the exact functional form of the underlying value function is unknown, as is the exact location of the isovalue contour. An approximation is used instead. Given the above assumptions about the utility function, a plane formed parallel to an adjacent facet on the efficient frontier will encompass that isovalue curve, and is therefore an upper bound for the value efficiency measurement. The dashed line indicated in Figure 3 represents such an approximation, and a lower bound for the inefficiency measurement can be found using the distance of value-inefficient points to this line. Note that DMU 1, which was efficient according to DEA, would be found to be value-inefficient using VEA because its mix of outputs, though technically efficient, is dissimilar to that of the most preferred solution, DMU 3. DMU 5, which was hree dimensions-soonomic. We began our fo an even smaller efficiency measurement using VEA because efficiency is now measured relative to the approximated isovalue curve, rather than to the technical efficiency frontier. (Note that in Figure 3 , point A now represents a point on the approximated isovalue curve.) In this study, we will expand upon the technical efficiency analysis provided by DEA to explore the value-efficiency of DMUs relative to a \"most preferred solution\" in the provision of quality of life, as well as the sensitivity of those value-efficiency scores to selection of the MPS."}, {"section_title": "M", "text": "In this section we c the procedures used to estimate the efficiency of quality of life provision by counties in the midAtlantic states.\nIn the literature, broadly categorized into t cial, environmental, and ec search for indicators with a list of variables taken from the literature and representing these distinct dimensions. There are, however, problems with including an exhaustive list of indicators as inputs and outputs in a DEA model: as one increases the number of inputs and outputs, the discriminatory power of the model declines. There is no standard approach to variable selection in DEA; several possible approaches are reviewed in Cinca et al. (2002) . We initially eliminated variables from the list based on the availability of complete data at the county level and a desire to balance the representation of the three quality of life dimensions in the final model. We then examined the correlations among the remaining variables and removed a set of variables that appeared to contain duplicate information. The final set of model variables was selected using an analysis that involved step-velopment outputs that counex provides for each county a measure of the risk of cancer-related health efformation about both cost of living and\nwise addition of variables to a base model to identify variables that appeared to have little independent contribution to the ranking of the decision making units.\nThe final variables included in the model are shown in Table 1 . Inputs to the model are considered to be those de ties would like to minimize-including factors that might be characterized as negative \"side effects\" of development, such as cancer risk, and factors that describe positive development outcomes, but for which smaller means better, such as teacher/pupil ratios. Model outputs are those outcomes that counties would like to maximize, such as affordability or percentage of the population with a high school degree. Note that the latter category could also include factors that are not literally \"produced\" in the development process, such as acres of natural areas; the model does not distinguish between desirable characteristics that are actually produced, and those that merely survive the production process unscathed.\nIn many production scenarios, variables exist that affect production but are nevertheless out of the control of the DMU, for example weather in agricultural production models. Such variables are called \"non-discretionary\" or \"fixed\" variables in the DEA literature. We include a single nondiscretionary variable-the amenity index produced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (ERS) (McGranahan 1999) to describe a region's climate, topography, and water area. This variable has been found to be significant in explaining rural migration patterns over the past couple of decades (McGranahan 1999) . The amenity index is assumed to influence quality of life, and therefore to influence how counties rank with respect to efficiency, but it cannot be manipulated in order to improve an efficiency rating. A county with high amenity value, for instance, may score quite high with respect to quality of life, but an inefficient county with low amenity value cannot change that value to increase efficiency; the remaining output variables may have to be improved by an even greater amount to compensate for the fixed (and poor) amenity value.\nThe cancer risk ind The affordability index is a variable constructed with in median household income. The Family Economic Self-Sufficiency Project has generated for most states figures indicating the hourly or annual wage that would be necessary for families of various sizes to achieve self-sufficiency. These el T We selected as a representative household a two-parent household with one pre-school child and one school-age child. In those cases in which the self-sufficiency standard for a city or other high-cost area was calculated separately from the surrounding county, we needed to combine the two values into a single, aggregate self-sufficiency standard that could be applied to the county as a whole. We combined the two separate numbers into an aggregate self-sufficiency standard for the county by taking a weighted average, using total number of households in each geographical area as the weight. The overall county self-sufficiency figure was therefore a weighted average combining the self-sufficiency figure for the rural part of the county and the self-sufficiency figure for the higher-cost metropolitan area based on how many households live in each area.\nThe affordability index was calculated as the ratio of median household income (from the 2000 U.S. scribed above. A ratio of greater than 1 indicates that more than half of the households in a county have adequate income to be self-sufficient. Such a county is considered more affordable than one in which the affordability index is less than one, suggesting that more than half of the households do not earn enough income to be considered selfsufficient. The affordability index therefore captures two different factors affecting quality of life-the expenditures necessary to live in that county, and the availability of economic opportunities to provide income to cover the cost of those expenditures. In theory, a county could increase its affordability index in one of two ways-by lowering costs or by increasing incomes.\nFor all of the variables described above, data from Virginia's independent cities were combined with surrounding counties accordin guidelines presented in the 2004 ERS County Typology Codes (ERS 2004a).\nThe previous section provided a brief overview of the most fundamental DEA model. We use several extensions to this original model. The model tance, a described above, for ins lying constant returns to between inputs and outputs. We use a less restrictive model that allows for the existence of variable returns to scale in the production relationship-the BCC model developed by Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (1984) . The original model also assumes that all inputs and outputs can be controlled by the decision maker and are therefore able to be adjusted in arriving at an efficient production point. To accommodate a non-discretionary output, we used a further extension as described in Banker and Morey (1986) . The model that we use is therefore an output-oriented, customized BCC model, as shown below: The computational modification of DEA to form simply involves an additional constraint ensuring that the reference unit, indexed above by ains efficient at all sets f weights used by counties in calculating their value efficiency easurements.

Counties c also known as Beale codes (ERS 2004b) . Counties with a Beale code of 0-3 are considered urban, while those with a Beale code of 4-9 are considered rural (Figure 4) .\nTo test for differences in the efficiency frontiers, we first use DEA to construct efficient frontiers for each group. Next the results of the DEA analysis are used to project those units that are inefficient onto the efficient frontier, creating new sets of data that consist of bo units and formerly inefficient units that have been adjusted to efficiency. When run only within its rural or urban category, every unit in the new data sets would now be rated efficient. We then pool the new data sets back into one large data set and perform a combined DEA. The results of the DEA on the combined data are then ranked according to their efficiency ratings. If there are no significant differences in the two frontiers, there should be no significant difference in how urban and rural counties are ranked in the combined model. As suggested in Cooper, Seiford, and Tone (2000), we then use the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to test for significant differences in the rankings of rural and urban counties.\nThe T statistic for that test is\nm m n S T mn m n\nwhere S denotes the sum of the rankings of the m denotes the number of urban units, n denotes the number of rural units. The T value that we derive in testing the hypothesis of no significant difference between urban and rural nkings is T = -10.64. For a two-tailed test the use one of the frontiers urban units, and ra critical level associated with \u03b1 = .05 is T .025 = 1.96. We therefore reject the hypothesis of no significant difference in efficiency frontiers. Because there is evidence that the production frontier differs between rural and urban counties, the appropriate efficiency measures are those that we originally estimated in calculating the DEA model separately for the two groups. The implication of the difference in frontiers is that rural and urban counties use significantly different production technologies in generating quality of life for their residents. In general, this may be because the frontiers intersect (as shown in Figure 2 above), or beca is completely enclosed within the other. If the latter scenario were the case, however, one would expect to find that, when the model is run on all of the data together, all of the members of one group would be found to be inefficient relative to the other group. This is not what we observe. When the full model is run on the projected data (as described above), the resulting frontier is predominantly urban, but also contains a small number of rural counties; this suggests that although most of the rural frontier is enclosed within the urban frontier, the frontiers intersect along one or more dimensions. Nevertheless, in general, even when all units are operating efficiently according to their respective technologies, urban counties will tend to dominate over rural counties in the provision of quality of life.\nGiven the adjustments for return to scale, and the multiple dimensions involved, it is not possible to illustrate the actual frontiers. However, should be given to the various quality of life in determining a ormance; in determining their most dvantageous set of weights, counties may spegroups may provide additional clues about their be measured relative to a higher standard than re values for the two groups are shown in Table 2 . Not surprisingly, rural counties appear to outperform urban counties with respect to the environmental quality inputs, while urban counties outperform rural counties along the socioeconomic dimensions of affordability, poverty, percentage with a high school degree, and access to arts, recreation, and entertainment facilities. Although these averages are useful for highlighting the relative strengths of the different groups, it is important to recall that the frontiers themselves are not generated by average performance-the frontier is composed of reference extremes from either group.\nIt is also interesting to explore the averages of the projected values that are used to generate the rural/ur performance within a group assuming that all units are performing efficiently. These averages are shown in Table 2 as well. Although the frontier reduces the gap in performance that exists along some of the dimensions, for the most part average relative differences between the groups have been maintained. Together with the frontier test above, this finding implies that in calculating sions, but relative to a lower standard along the socioeconomic dimensions.\nThe actual efficiency values calculated for the counties in the mid-Atlantic region are shown in Figure 5 . Recall that these are relative efficiency measures, and, as explained above, they are not measured relative to all other counties but only to other urban or rural counties figure suggests that the counties with highest efficiency are scattered throughout the mid-Atlantic region, with the areas of lowest technical efficiency concentrated in West Virginia and Virginia. These counties tend to perform poorly along a number of indicators-poverty level, percentage high school graduates, and affordability, in particular."}, {"section_title": "VEA Results", "text": "In measuring technical efficiency via DEA, we have made no value judgments regarding the importance that dimensions of county's perf a (Korhonen, Siljamake, and Soismaa 1998) . preference, however, was to use external data to provide additional information about quality of parisons among the candidate counties.\nassumption, the most preferred solution st lie on the production frontier, and therefore is efficient according to the original DEA measents.

Both counties earn the highest efficiency rating possible, and no further distinction between them is made based on the original DEA model.\nAlthough people likely consider several, or all, of these \"products\" when evaluating a county based on quality of life considerations, is it reasonable to assume that they are all equally important, and interchangeable, in that decision?

Amelia County comes in second among the urban efficient counties in terms of net migration rate, Figure 7 indicates, the VEA results are highly sensitive to choice of the most preferred solution within each group. One way to anticipate the response of the VEA analysis to a particular MPS is to characterize the candidate MPS counties on a continuum from \"generalist\" to \"niche\" performance. Generalist counties are counties that earned their DEA-efficient rating by performing above average on a large number of dimensions, while niche counties are able to earn a DEA-efficient rating by specializing smaller number of input or output dimensions. Loudoun County is an example of a generalist county: it performs above average along 7 of the 8 dimensions. In contrast, Amelia is more of a niche county: it outperforms the average along only 4 of the 8 dimensions.\n1 Generalist counties represent a more flexible standard, because they are able to remain efficient along a much wider range of input/output weight combinations. Niche counties, on the other hand, are extremely restrictive as reference counties; they remain efficient for a very limited range of weight combinations. In general, one would expect the scores of other counties to drop more significantly when a more limited number of weight combinations is available for their efficiency calculation; we observe an extreme case of this when Amelia County is used as the urban reference county. In fact, the excessive impact of using Amelia County as the reference county indicates a problem with selection of that county as MPS; one could argue that, although it is rated urban, Amelia County has little in common with the other urban counties and that using it as an urban standard is like comparing apples to oranges.\nThe \"niche/generalist\" characterization provides a rough guideline about the impact that a particular MPS will have on the remaining efficiency landscape, but a great deal of variation can occur within each point along that continuum. The rural counties-Worcester in Maryland, and Floyd in Virginia-both outperform the average along 6 of the 8 dimensions, and are therefore moderate generalists in their performance. However, Floyd County clearly has a much more significant impact on the value efficiency ratios of the other counties than does Worcester. Another characterization of counties is useful in explaining this difference.\nCounties can be considered \"super-achievers\" if they experience an extraordinarily high level of performance along one or more input or output dimensions. Such counties also present problems for the other counties when they are used as the of developed area. The rprisingly, reference community. This again leads such counties to place a high weight along those dimensions at which they excel, making them in essence niche counties along those dimensions. It is not surprising for niche counties to also be superachievers-it is in fact that super-achievement along only a few dimensions that enables them to be DEA-efficient. Amelia County is again a case in point: with only 0.30 percent of its land area developed, the remaining urban counties, with an average of 12.6 percent land area developed, simply cannot stack up.\nGeneralist counties can also be super-achievers, and as that causes them to place a heavy weight on only a few of their above-average dimensions, they in effect turn into niche counties along those few dimensions. Floyd County is an example of such a county. As mentioned earlier, Floyd County is above average on several dimensions, but its concentration of arts and entertainment establishments is a particularly impressive 5.26 establishments per square mile other rural counties, with an average of 1.54 establishments per developed square mile, are at a great disadvantage when this variable is identified as an important component in the output mix. Similarly, its percentage of developed area, at 0.10 percent, significantly outperforms the rural average of 1.96 percent."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "Our results suggest that there are significant differences between rural and urban counties in the generation of quality of life. The set of most-efficient rural counties defines a frontier that is significantly different from that formed by the set of most-efficient urban counties. The efficient frontier appears to be a dynamic entity that changes as counties develop, with ability to perform along the different dimensions dependent upon the development history of the county. Not su rural counties that are projected onto their efficient frontiers outperform similarly projected urban counties along the environmental dimensions. Urban counties, on the other hand, generally outperform rural counties along all of the socioeconomic dimensions considered, including the index of affordability. This suggests that there has been a certain amount of trade-off in community development patterns, with counties advancing along the socioeconomic dimensions at the expense of the environmental dimensions.\nThis analysis is unable to determine whether such trade-offs are an inevitable result of development, or merely a common, historical result. Our efficiency measurements are based upon observed performances rather than upon an underlying judgment of what production levels, and input/ output mixes, are theoretically possible. Among the midAtlantic counties, however, there are no examples of counties that have successfully achieved relavely high levels of performance along several the environmental dimensions. This result may hange over time as an increased awareness of the nvironmental impacts of development decisions, as well as the role of the environment in residents' judgment of quality of life, influences the manner in which development occurs and the types of development decisions made.\nThe economics/environment trade-off results are not as bleak as they initially appear, however. Further analysis of the results regarding technical efficiency indicate that most of the rural frontier is encompassed by the urban frontier; when a joint frontier is run for the projected data, that frontier is predominantly composed of urban units, and all but nine rural counties become inefficient. Those rural counties that remain efficient are generally counties with exceptional environmental performance. One interpretation of this result is that, in general, rural counties are not as efficient as urban counties in producing quality of life; i.e., urban counties are generally able to produce more output per unit of input than are rural counties. In just two dimensions, such a situation ight appear as shown in Figure 2 , but with only is that for many levels of environmental quality, urban counties are able to achieve greater socioeconomic development at the same level of environmental degradation as rural counties. Together, these results suggest that \"pristine\" environmental conditions-as measured by extremely high performance along the environmental dimensions-may not be consistent with urbanization and socioeconomic development, but that this required trade-off holds only for very high levels of environmental quality. Below those environmental quality levels, urban counties are able to achieve higher socioeconomic performance than rural counties without further sacrifice in environmental quality. This suggests that the process of urbanization shifts and rotates the efficient frontier in such a way that, below a certain, relatively \"pristine\" level of environmental quality, urban counties can perform better along the socioeconomics dimension while performing at least as well as the rural counties along the envia great deal of information about the technical efficiency of rural and urban counties and about the aggregate production frontiers that emerge from observed data. The DEA analysis also provides a wealth of policy-relevant information of interest to specific counties, which we are unable to present here. For any county found to be technically inefficient, the DEA analysis can be used to identify the shortest route to the efficient frontier. DEA also identifies for each inefficient unit a list of that unit's \"benchmark DMUs,\" or the DMUs that occupy the efficient frontier nearest to the inefficient unit and against which the inefficient DMU was measured in determining its efficiency rating. Such units in effect represent \"role models\" for inefficient counties and demonstrate what levels of performance are achievable given a particular development direction, as captured in the current combination of quality of life attributes. Such information can be useful in helping policymakers determine how limited county resources should be allocated to improve a county's relative efficiency in providing services related to quality of life. frontier. Value efficiency analysis provides added depth to the results by identifying desirable combinations of outputs and using that standard to further distinguish among both efficient and inefficient units.\nThe results of the value efficiency analysis illustrate rankings for the mid-Atlantic counties based on their \"value-efficiency,\" which measures how much the unit's outputs must be expanded to reach beyond the efficiency frontier to the isovalue curve associated with the most preferred solution. This analysis considers that even those counties on or near the technical efficiency frontier may not be producing a mix of outputs that is socially desirable, and ranks counties accordingly. In aggregate, such an approach provides interesting insight into regional variation in performance given a more limited definition of what constitutes high quality of life and a more limited set of allowable trade-offs among quality of life attributes. In specific counties, such information can again be helpful in directing policy attention toward those dimensions of quality of life that are poorly developed relative to the standard set by the most preferred community.\nIn our study, the VEA analysis yielded a broad range of value efficiencies among mid-Atlantic counties in the production of quality of life. This range of efficiencies is highly sensitive to the county that is selected as the reference county. If the reference county has a mix of inputs and outputs and performance levels that are similar to the remaining counties, the value efficiency scores will remain relatively closer to the technical efficiency scores received through DEA. However, if the county chosen as the some ways unique or unrepresentative of the other counties, the value efficiency scores of the remaining counties will fall far below their corresponding DEA scores.\nDEA and VEA therefore represent flexible methodologies for integrating environmental and socioeconomic variables in an analysis of regional differences in quality of life. These methods provide a great deal of information about relative production performance while requiring few ex ante assumptions about functional relacompass other abstract multidimensional concepts such as quality of life or standard of living. In this study we fi room for innovation in application, with the traditional view of \"productivity\" expande providing insight about the distinctions between and among rural and urban counties in generating quality of life, and we believe there is ample opportunity for creative application of such techniques in interdisciplinary research."}]
