[{"section_title": "", "text": "Introduction and summary. Of fundamental importance to the theory of ideals in commutative rings satisfying the ascending chain condition for ideals has been the works of Noether [6] and Krull [4] . What follows, in the first two sections, is an attempt to extend more of the Krull-Noether theory of commutative rings to one-sided ideals in noncommutative rings. A decomposition theory for one-sided ideals in the noncommutative case was provided by Fitting [l] . Although Fitting was able to prove uniqueness theorems in certain cases, he did not prove uniqueness theorems for arbitrary noncommutative rings satisfying the ascending chain condition for right ideals. By methods based on the works of Noether and Fitting, we shall prove decomposition and uniqueness theorems for arbitrary noncommutative rings with identity that satisfy the ascending chain condition for right ideals. Actually, the theorems in this paper are proved for what we define to be A-R modules, which is a generalization of noncommutative rings. In the third section, we discuss completely indecomposable A-R modules, which follow along the lines of a paper by Snapper [7] . A sufficient condition for two faithful representations of a noncommutative ring with identity to be equivalent follows from this discussion.\nThe author is indebted to Professor C. W. Curtis for valuable suggestions in the preparation of this paper. 1 . A property of the A.C.C. for ^4-P modules. We begin by defining an A-R module Definition 1.\n1. An A-R module is a system consisting of an additive abelian group M, a ring A containing the identity element 1, a ring P containing the identity element e, and two functions defined on the product sets (MXA) and (MXR) having values in M, such that if xa and ya denote the elements in M determined by the elements x, y in M, a in A, and a in P, then 1-1.\nx(a + b) = xa + xb, 1-2.\nx(ab) = (xa)b, 1-3.\nx(a + P) = xa + xp\\ 1-4.\nx(a$) = (xa)P, TV is an A-R submodule if it is both an A and R submodule.\nExamples. Every ring with identity can be considered as an A-R module by taking the ring of right multiplications as R and the ring of left multiplications as A.\nA module M over a ring R containing the identity element can be handled as an A-R module by taking as A the ring of endomorphisms that commute with the endomorphisms which are the multiplications of the elements in M by the elements of R.\nConventions.\nIn the future, except where the contrary is stated, the letters TV, TV,, TV2, etc., will stand for R and A submodules; the letters a, b, c, for elements of A; the letters a, @, y, for elements of R; the symbols m, n, p, q, will stand for ideals in R and A.\nThe proofs of the theorems, except for Theorems 1.2 and 2.2, in the first two sections follow closely the proofs of similar theorems for the commutative case given by Noether and Krull, and are therefore omitted.\nFor proof of the following theorem we refer to [2, p. 242 ]. Proof. We shall show that the A.C.C. holds for right ideals in ^4/q. A similar discussion proves this statement for P/q'.\nConsider A as a right module over its ring of right multiplications. For a fixed Xi in M the set (0:xi; A) = {a\\xia=0, XiCM, aCA } is a right ideal of A, and hence an A submodule of A. The mapping if/, which takes a + (0: Xi\u25a0:, A) into x\u00bba, is an A -isomorphism of the A module A/(0'.Xi; A) upon x{A = {xta\\aCA }, which is an A submodule of M. Since XiA is an A submodule of M, it satisfies the A.C.C. for A submodules, i.e., right ideals. We have also assumed that M satisfies the A.C.C. for R submodules. Hence there must exist a set of generators xit x2, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , x\", for M as an R module. Then, fromq = (0: M;A) = (0: {xu \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 ,x\"} ;A) = (0:xi;A)r\\ \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 r~\\(Q:x\";A) and Theorem 1.1, it follows that A/q satisfies the A.C.C. for right ideals.\n2. Decomposition of submodules of an A-R module. Let M be an A-R module.\nDefinition 2.1. If TV is an P submodule of M, the set V*(N) = {a\\ NaQN, ad A } is called the centralizer oi TV. V*(N) is a subring of A which contains the identity element. We denote an arbitrary subring of V*(N) that contains the identity element by V(N). we shall denote the V shadow of TV by n. Definition 2.3. If TV is an P submodule of M and Pi\" is a set in V(N), then (N:H)= {x\\xhdN, xdM, all hdH} is an P submodule. Definition 2.4. The V radical oi an P submodule TV of M is defined to be the set of all aG V(N) such that a' is contained in the V shadow n of TV for some positive integer t. Definition 2.\n5. An P submodule TV is said to be V primary provided that xadN, ior xdN and ad V(N), implies Ma'QN for some positive integer /, i.e., a is contained in the V radical of TV.\nOne should note here that if an P module TV is F primary, then it is necessarily V primary, where V is any subring of V(N) containing the identity element. Definition 2.\n6. An ideal p of an arbitrary ring K will called completely prime provided a&Gp, a, bdK, implies at least one of these elements is contained in p. Definition 2.7. An ideal q of an arbitrary ring K is said to be right primary provided a&Gq, aGq, a, bdK, implies &*Gq for some positive integer 5.\nOne can easily show that the V shadow of a V primary P submodule is a right primary ideal of A. The radical p is closed under right and left multiplication by elements of V(N). Again, for aCp, let s be the least positive integer such that a\u00bb\u00a3n. Since n is an ideal of V(N), a\u00abc\u00a3n, for any cCV(N).\nIf s>l, then a,~1(ac)Cn. Hence, since the F shadow n of TV is right primary and a*~l\u00a3rt, it follows acCp-If 5 = 1, the result is trivial. Since (ca)'=c(ac)'~1a, caCpWe conclude by showing that p is completely prime in V(N). Suppose ai-aiCp, a,i, a2CV(N). Then (<iia2)'\u00a3n for some positive integer t. From these elements let a,-,, a,\" \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , atk be the smallest subcollection whose product a.ya,-,.aik is in n. Since atl.ali_1 is not in n and n is right primary, it follows a^Cp-Usual lattice theoretic methods give us the following theorem. The subcentralizer F*(N) is contained in the centralizer of TV and is not zero since it contains the identity element. We denote an arbitrary subring of F*(N) that contains the identity element by F(N). The radicals, which we \u2022 shall now consider, will be in just such a subring F(N). From the preceding theorems, we can state a theorem quite similar to that given by Noether and Krull. However the radicals will not be ideals of the ring A, but will be ideals in a subring of A. In the example following we show that the same result cannot be stated unless the ring F(N) is used. If TV = TVfP\\ \u2022 \u2022 \u25a0 C\\Nf is another such reduction of TV, then r=s, and for a suitable rearrangement of the subscripts the corresponding prime F radicals are equal.\nWe shall call such a reduction of TV an F-short representation oi TV, and the prime radicals the F associated prime ideals of TV.\nIf the .4-P module M satisfies the A.C.C. for P submodules, then for any P submodule TV and any ideal q of V(N), the P submodules (TV:q) are fixed for large r. We denote this limit by TV(q). it follows p'^n (see [5] ). In addition, if F(N) satisfies the D.C.C. for right ideals, then pi\u00bbCn. In fact, in this case, F(N)/pi is a division ring, and the pi are maximal ideals of F(N). Therefore each TV< would be an isolated component. Hence, in this case, the representation would be unique. Proof. Suppose (a,,) is contained in Tlf and is not contained in TV, say ci\u00a37. Let (bii)ieV*(N) = (I, D),, i.e., b2xdl-Then if (aii)(bii)l = (bii)(aii) = (ca) GTV, we have c2i =d+a2xb22, with dGL Since (c,;) GTV, c2i = cf+a2ic>22GL Inasmuch as I is primary in D and ci2iG7, then b22dp, the radical of I in Z>.\nHence (ft</)i\u20ac(7, /\u00bb)i, the F*(V) radical of TV.\nA similar discussion holds if a22G7.\nLet D = F[l, x,y], the ring of polynomials in x and y over the field F. Let I = (x2, xy), Ix = (x), and Ia = (x2, y+ax), where aeE and Iaj^I$ if a5^/3. Then in D, I = IxC\\Ia, where the radical p = (x, y) of Ia is the same for each decomposition of 7 in primary ideals.\nIn D2, let\nThen, by Lemma 1, TV = TVi C\\ Na.\nHowever, here the V*(Na) radicals (Na, p) are different for each decomposition. If we let P = n7\"n7i, then in (F, D)=f\\a V*(Na)nV*(Ni) the radical (F, p)i is the same for each decomposition. Thus although the corresponding F* radicals may be distinct for two decompositions of an R submodule, the corresponding F* radicals are the same.\n3. Completely indecomposable A-R modules. From 11-3 and Theorem 1.2 we conclude that 22/q' and P/q both satisfy the A.C.C. for right ideals, where q' and q are the annihilating ideals of Min R and A respectively. By II-l the 0 module is irreducible as an R submodule, for if TVi and TV2 are P submodules such that 0 = Nir\\N2, then Ni + N2 = Ni\u00aeN2. Hence, by Theorem 2.1, the 0 submodule is A = F*(0) primary, and, by Theorem 2.2, the radical p of 0 in A is a completely prime ideal of A. Furthermore, since ^4/q satisfies the A.C.C. for right ideals and p is a nil ideal in A/q, then from a theorem proved by Levitski [5] , it follows that p'CIq for some positive integer s. Similarly by II-2, the 0 module is an irreducible A submodule. Hence 0 is R primary and its radical p' in R is a completely prime ideal in P, where p'rCq' for some positive integer r.\nFor a set 27 in M and a set m in A denote by 77m the set of all sums zZxiai f\u00b0r XiCH and o,\u00a3m. For a set m'CP we denote by 77m' the set of all sums zZxi\u00b0Li f\u00b0r xiCH and ai\u00a3m'. Proof. By II-4, T17 contains a minimal P submodule TV0, which is necessarily a unique minimal P submodule. For if TVi is another such minimal P submodule, then 0 = TV0^\\TVi. Similarly T17 contains a unique minimal A submodule TV.\nWe shall now show that TV0 is an A submodule.\nLet 77(a) be the homomorphism x->xa of M for aG-4. Then 77(a) will be an P homomorphism of TV0 with kernel TV0 or 0. If the kernel is TV0, then TV0a = 0. If the kernel is 0, then TV0a is an isomorphic image of TV0 and therefore a minimal P submodule. Since TV0 is the unique minimal P submodule, then TV0a = TV0. In both cases TV0aCTV0, and therefore TV0 is an A submodule. Similarly TV' is an P submodule. Hence it follows that N0QN' and TV'CTV0, and therefore TV0 = TV'. Inasmuch as the 0 module of AT\" is A primary, we have (0:TV0;.4)Cp. Consequently p is a maximal right ideal in A, and since p is also a completely prime ideal in A, it follows that A/$ is a division ring. Similarly i?/p' is a division ring. Proof. Consider A as a right module over its set of right multiplications. Since M satisfies both chain conditions for 22 submodules, there exists a chain (2) . From this chain we shall show that the factors of (4) are either 0 or isomorphic to a simple A module, i.e., the chain is a normal chain which can be refined to a composition series of right ideals in ^4/q. From this we can conclude that A/q satisfies the D.C.C. for right ideals, and the length p, ol A/q in right ideals is less than or equal to the length X of M in Rsubmodules.\nIn the second part of this proof we shall show in a similar manner that the chain (3) is a normal chain that can be refined to a composition series of 22 submodules in M. From this we can conclude that m = X, which completes the proof of the theorem.\nSince (2) X^p.\nWe shall now show that p=X. Since (1) is a composition series we have by Lemma 6 that n,pCn;_i. Hence (0:ny_i)n.,p =0, and since (0:p) =TV0, it follows that the A submodule (0:ny_i)tij equals 0 or TV0 since TV0 is a minimal A submodule. If this A module is 0, we have (0:n/_i)/(0:n,-)=0.\nHowever, if this A submodule is TV0, there must exist an adtij, adni-i and an xG(0tn,-_i) such that xa^O. Since aGny, a$n;_i it follows that xij-X+aA =n,-. Since xa^O, we have (0:tiy_i)a = {xa|xG(0:n,_i)} is an P submodule equal to TV0, since TV0 is a minimal R submodule. The correspondence y^ya for yG(0:ny_i) is an P homomorphism of (0:n,_i) onto TV0 with kernel (0:ny_i) P\\(0:a) = (0:n,). Therefore (3) except for repetition is a composition and\nThe following theorem is proved in the same manner as Theorem 3.1. Lemma 8. In a completely indecomposable A-R module M, an R submodule TV is completely determined by its annihilating right ideal in A, and an A submodule is completely determined by its annihilating right ideal in 22. Proof. We shall consider S not as a ring, but as a module with 22 as right operator domain, according to the following definitions.\nx(77i + 272) = xHi + xH2, x(Ha) = (xH)a, for all xCM, 77,, 272, 27\u00a3g, aCR.\nTo any aCR there corresponds the mapping 27(a) in S defined by xH(a) = xa tor all x\u00a3Af. If 72 is considered as a right module over its set of right multiplications, then the correspondence a->H(a) is clearly an 22 endomorphism from 22 into S with kernel q'. Hence \u00a3 contains an R submodule E' which is 22 isomorphic to 22/q'. We have but to show that S=\u00a3'.\nSince E' has finite length, namely the length p, of 22/q' in right ideals, we shall show that S as an 22 module has length p. This would imply that S = E'. By Theorem 3.2, since 22/q' has length p. for R submodules (right ideals), the length of M for A submodules will be p. Let Since TV,_i77 = 0, the length of TV.-77 is at most 1; hence TV.-TJC TV0 = (0: p'). The following lemma which holds for arbitrary modules over a noncommutative ring is proved by Snapper [7, p. 131 ].\nLemma 10. Let M and W be two additive groups with the same ring R as operator domain. Let TVi and Ni be two R submodules of M and let Wi and Wi be two R submodules of W. Let L be an R isomorphism between TVi and Wi, and let Ii be an R isomorphism between N2 and W2. Let 7i map N3 = Nif^Ni isomer phically onto W3= WiH\\W2, i.e., 7i induces an R isomorphism Ii* between W% and TV3. In the same way, let I2 map TV3 isomorphically onto W3. Finally, let 7i*=-72* = 73. Then there exists an R isomorphism between TVi + TV2 and Wi + Wi which is simultaneously an extension of 7i, 72 and 73. Proof. If TV is the unique maximal A-R submodule of T17, then for xdM, xG^V, it follows that xR=xA = M. The mapping a^>xa, all aG^4, is an A homomorphism of A onto T17 with kernel q, for suppose xa=0, then xaP = 0, which implies that xPa = 0, i.e., T17a = 0.\nThe following is an extension of a theorem proved by Snapper [7, p. 133 ]. Proof. It is obvious that if TI7 and W are A isomorphic, they have the same annihilating ideals in A. Hence we assume that Tlfand IF have the same annihilating ideal q in A and prove they are A isomorphic.\nSince the length of M and IF in ^4-P submodules are both equal to the length of the difference module A/q in A submodules (two sided ideals), let p be the common length of W, Mand A/q.lip = l, both T17and Whave their zero submodules as unique maximal ^4-P submodules, and hence, by Lemma 11, are A isomorphic to A/q, and hence isomorphic to each other. Consequently, we assume p > 1 and make our induction hypothesis that Theorem 3.5 has been proved for p = 1, 2, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 , p -1. There are two cases to be considered. Case 1. One of the two modules, say M, has a unique maximal A-R submodule. Since M has a unique maximal submodule, it follows from Lemma 11 that M is A isomorphic to A/q. This implies that .4/q contains a unique minimal two sided ideal. Consequently, there exists only one two-sided ideal qi where the length of A/qi is p -1 in two-sided ideals. If 0' is the zero element of W, the length of IFi = (0': qx) is n -1 and hence Wx is a maximal ^4-P submodule of IF. We assert that IFi is the only maximal A-R submodule of IF. A-K module with the same annihilating ideal qi, it follows by induction that TVi and IFi are 4 isomorphic. In the same way TV2 and IF2 are A isomorphic. Hence, let 7i be the 4 isomorphism which maps TVi onto Wi and 72 the A isomorphism that maps TV2 onto IF2. We claim that 7i maps N3 = NiC\\N2 A isomorphically onto Wz=Wir\\W2 and that 72 maps TV3 A isomorphically onto IF3. In the first place, the annihilating ideal of TV3 and IF3 in 4 is qi+q2 according to Lemma 9. In the second place, both TV37i and TV372 are A-R submodules of IF which are A isomorphic with TV3. Hence these modules have qi+q2 as annihilating ideals in 4, which implies, according to Theorem 3.4 , that TV32i = TV372 = IF3. Let 7i* and 72* be the A isomorphism which map TV3 onto IF3 and which are induced respectively by 7i and 72.\nHowever, we cannot as yet apply Lemma 10 since it may be that 1*9^1*. However, we shall change 7i into a new A isomorphism Ji such that J* = I2*. Let (7*)_1 be the inverse of I*; hence (7*)-1 maps W3^4 isomorphically onto TV3. Then (I*)\"1!* is clearly an A isomorphism, say 27*, of IF3 onto itself. Since W3CI IFi, it follows from Theorem 3.3, Corollary 1, that there exists an A isomorphism 27 of IFi onto itself, where 27 is an extension of 27*. For Ji we then take the A isomorphism Ji=IiH which clearly maps TVi onto Wi. Furthermore, if J* is the A isomorphism between TV3 and W3, induced by J\\, then J* = I2* because, if x\u00a3TV3, then xJ?=xIiH = xI*H and, since x7i*\u00a3 W3, then x7i*77 = x7*77* =x7i*(7i*)_172* =x72* =x72. We can conclude from Lemma 10 that there exists an 4 isomorphism between TV1 + TV2 = M and Wi + W2=W which proves our theorem. [7] . Example 3'.1. Every Grassmann(3) Algebra with finite basis can be considered as a duo completely indecomposable A-R module by taking as P the ring of right multiplications and as A the ring of left multiplications. Suppose the basis elements are ex, e2, \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 , en. Then this A-R module is duo since eiej= -e,ei, and satisfies II-l and II-2 since xR=xA, where x=ei-e2 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 en, is a unique minimal .4-P submodule (two-sided ideal).\nExample 3'.2.
