[{"section_title": "Introduction", "text": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a communicable infectious disease caused by the newly circulating coronavirus (WHO, 2020a). As of 21 April 2020, confirmed cases of coronavirus have been found in 213 countries; 2 356 414 people worldwide are known to be infected and the number of reported deaths has reached 160 120 (WHO, 2020b) . A genus of the Coronaviridae family, it spreads through droplets released during coughing, sneezing or secretions of the infected person and targets the human respiratory system. The seriousness of the virus can be gauged by the rate of its rapid spread around the world (Lipsitch, Swedlow, & Finelli, 2020) and the many infected persons confined in isolation wards in health centres (Munster, Koopmans, Doremalen, Riel, & Wit, 2020) . Due to the lack of either a vaccine or drug for coronavirus, non-pharmaceutical measures are being introduced as preventive and controlling measures (Tian et al., 2020) . In order to shield people from exposure to the coronavirus, most countries have introduced lockdowns on human mobility. According to the BBC, by the end of March 2020 more than 100 countries instated either complete or partial lockdowns (BBC, 2020). Besides health challenges, the coronavirus has given rise to various rumours and fake information on social media platform (Shimizu, 2020; Tasnim, Hossain, & Mazumder, 2020) . Newitz (2020) argues that video conferencing and video calling apps such as Zoom and Skype have become a necessity in home quarantine despite being unsecure and filled with fake and abusive information.\nAccording to Gerber (2020) 'as health professionals, medical librarians are sometimes considered essential personnel and therefore required to work, either onsite or remotely'. With the closure of physical spaces, librarians are working in virtual spaces to provide remote services, resources and support for research, innovation and public health in the current health crisis. The role of academic health librarians now includes controlling fake information and providing authentic, updated information to health workers and the public. According to the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA, 2020) 'Health librariansworking in hospitals, research centres and governments -have to deliver more than ever, even as they face the same restrictions and rules as everyone else'. However, the biggest challenge in the COVID-19 crisis for librarians is to keep providing their usual services to library users. The intention of this paper is to present a summary of the broader initiatives taken by the librarians across the globe. A desktop analysis of selected websites of library association was carried out to identify innovative approaches taken by health science librarians during this unprecedented pandemic.\nThe author suggests that health science librarians have three important roles to play during the COVID-19 pandemic:\n1. To provide awareness on preventive measures relating to COVID-19 2. To provide document delivery services during lockdown 3. To support researchers working on COVID-19"}, {"section_title": "Scope of paper", "text": "The paper uses the method of desktop analysis to review the initiatives undertaken by health science librarians around the world in response of COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic."}, {"section_title": "Objectives of this paper", "text": "\u2022 To explore initiatives undertaken by health science librarians for to raise public awareness on preventive measures for dealing with COVID-19.\n\u2022 To identify problems faced by health science librarians in providing document delivery services in this global lockdown.\n\u2022 To identify useful resources and websites providing the latest COVID-19 research findings which health science librarians can access to support researchers and faculty."}, {"section_title": "Methodology", "text": "A desktop analysis approach was used in the study. To explore the role of librarians and library associations around the world, the author examined the official websites of some of the oldest library associations and organisations with an international scope. A summary of sources used in the study is listed in Table 1 .\nTo meet the objectives of study, data were extracted from the dedicated COVID-19 pages created by these library associations.\nFindings: how health science librarians are responding to the pandemic The findings in this paper are organised under the three study objectives."}, {"section_title": "Initiatives by health science librarians to", "text": "generate public awareness about COVID-19.\nThe key measures to prevent infection from COVID-19 are as follows: social distancing; using masks; using sanitizers; and hand washing. Library associations and individual libraries have been designing posters to educate people regarding COVID-19. Table 2 lists some initiatives aimed at generating awareness through posters. These posters aim to educate people on social distancing, the use of masks and how to wash hands properly.\nLibrarians are also playing a vital role in motivating COVID-19-infected people to share As a result of lockdown in most countries, libraries are closed. But some libraries, such as the US Library of Congress, need to support their parent bodies and therefore remain open. Some libraries are offering home delivery of documents and consequently sanitizing of documents has become a big concern. At present, no research has been conducted on the transmission of corona virus through library document surfaces (such as book cloth, book jackets, coated and uncoated papers) which is a cause for concern amongst Access to the right information at the right time is critical for researchers working on COVID-19. Various publishers are offering free access to econtent on COVID-19. Librarians can use these databases to download information related to the research interests of their researchers, research teams, faculty members and health workers. Librarians have a key role to play as the quantity of information explodes. Coren (2020) observes that scientific papers on COVID-19 are doubling every 14 days. Another study by Reuters reveals that owing to the pace at which academic papers on COVID-19 are being published papers are not always being peer reviewed which can leading to false information being published (Sharma, Scarr, & Kelland, 2020) . Librarians using keywords and other tools have the skills to monitor recent publications and provide the most reliable papers to researchers.\nThe WHO has created an important database of global literature on COVID-19. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of this resource.\nElsevier has created a Novel Coronavirus Information Center to provide free information related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 (Elsevier,  2020 https://www.elsevier.com/connect/corona virus-information-center). Some researchers have taken the initiative to create a COVID-19 open research dataset (CORD-19) which comprises about 24 000 research papers for researchers working on COVID-19. Figure 2 shows a snapshot of the CORD-19 data set.\nSome major publishers are providing free access to articles on COVID-19. Table 3 lists some of the major journal publishers providing free access and the links to their articles on COVID-19.\nSome librarians have also compiled material on recorded knowledge related to past pandemics and disasters which might help in the present crisis. The Library History Round Table of American Library Association has assembled an exhaustive list of resources related to epidemics or related disasters. The Society of American Archivists (2020 https://www2.archivists.org/resources-forresponse-to-covid-19-health-crisis) has also put together a compendium of resources of global initiatives taken in response of COVID-19 crisis."}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "text": "In the current health crisis created by COVID-19, the role of librarians has of necessity expanded significantly. Librarians are playing crucial roles from generating awareness, filtering fake information, supporting researchers and faculty members, to providing reference and document delivery services. Library professionals have always been committed to providing people with information; during the pandemic they are finding new ways to support their mission as demonstrated in this paper."}]
