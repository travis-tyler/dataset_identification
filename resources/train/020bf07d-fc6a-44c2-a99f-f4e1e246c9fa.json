Age is a strong risk factor for AMD, with the prevalence of advanced AMD increasing from about 0.2% in ages 55 to 64 years to 13% in those older than 85 years. 4 Smoking, [5] [6] [7] obesity, white race, 8 and low intake of dietary antioxidants 9 and \u03c9-3 fatty acids 10 are associated with an increased risk of AMD. There is a strong genetic susceptibility to AMD as shown in twin studies, 11 familial aggregation analyses, 12 and a large and growing body of association studies that have identified several common AMD-associated variants, for example, in and around complement factor H and the ARMS2/HTRA1 region. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Other studies have implicated lipid metabolism genes such as apolipoprotein E, hepatic lipase, cholesterol ester transfer protein, lipoprotein lipase, and very lowdensity lipoprotein receptor as well as extracellular matrix genes such as hemicentin 1 and fibulin 5 in AMD risk. 16, 17 Although variants within identified major susceptibility genes to AMD play a role in more than half of AMD cases, many individuals carrying AMD risk genotypes never develop the disease, and only a fraction diagnosed as having it progress to advanced AMD with vision loss. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a heterogeneous group of bioactive molecules formed by the nonenzymatic glycation of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. They are implicated in a wide number of adverse age-related outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, osteoporosis, and sarcopenia. 18 They alter the structural integrity of tissues by cross-linking collagen and are thought to upregulate inflammation through binding with the receptor for AGEs (RAGE). 18 The AGEs are implicated in the pathogenesis of AMD through various lines of evidence. Immunohistochemical studies have shown accumulation of AGEs such as pentosidine in the Bruch membrane with increasing age, 19 carboxymethyllysine (CML) in drusen of eyes with AMD, 20 and AGEs and RAGE in photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium of eyes with AMD. 21 Basal laminar deposits, which develop between the retinal pigment epithelial cells and the basement membrane and are specific for AMD, show greatly increased expression of RAGE. 22 A key factor in the pathogenesis of neovascular AMD is the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. The activation of RAGE leads to the increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor via the activation of NF-\u03baB. 23 One study suggested that plasma CML and pentosidine concentrations were higher in 58 patients with AMD compared with 32 control participants, 24 but further corroboration is needed. We hypothesized that an elevated level of circulating CML is independently associated with AMD in older adults. To address this hypothesis, we measured serum CML concentration and assessed its relationship with AMD in a large, population-based cohort of older adults in Iceland."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Study Participants", "text": "The Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility (AGES)-Reykjavik Study is a population-based study aimed to investigate genetic and environmental factors contributing to health, disability, and disease (including systemic disease as well as eye disease) in older people.

The ocular component was included as part of the third visit in which 5330 persons participated. As part of the assessments at the Icelandic Heart Association Research Center, a questionnaire was administered, visual acuity was assessed, and images were acquired from the retina. 26 Fundus images were available from 5272 individuals for the determination of AMD status.

Two photographic fields were taken of each eye, with the first centered on the optic disc and the second centered on the fovea. Software was used for image acquisition and archiving (Eye QSL; Digital Healthcare Inc). Retinal images were evaluated by the University of Wisconsin Ocular Epidemiology Reading Center for assessment of AMD in a semiquantitative fashion by a grader using EyeQ Lite (an image-processing database for storage, retrieval, and manipulation of digital images) and a standard AMD grading protocol, 28 including the modified Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System used in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. 29 Early AMD required one of the following: (1) the presence of any soft drusen and pigmentary abnormalities; (2) the presence of a large soft drusen 125 \u03bcm or larger in diameter with a large drusen area (>500-\u03bcm-diameter circle); or (3) large (\u2265125 \u03bcm in diameter) soft indistinct drusen and no signs of late AMD. Late AMD was defined by the presence of geographic atrophy or exudative AMD. A participant's AMD status was based on the eye with the more severe disease classification or the eye with gradable signs if only 1 eye was graded.

The mean (SD) serum CML concentration was 623.1 (197.7) ng/mL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.00489). Of the 4907 participants, 1025 (20.9%) had early AMD and 276 (5.6%) had late AMD. The characteristics of the participants are shown by AMD status in Table 1 . Participants with early or late AMD were significantly older, had a lower BMI, were current smokers, had higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein levels, and had lower triglycerides levels compared with participants without AMD. Participants with early or late AMD were also significantly more likely to have a history of myocardial infarction and chronic kidney disease. There were no significant differences between participants with and without AMD by sex, alcohol consumption, total cholesterol level, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. The prevalences of hypertension, angina, and diabetes were not associated with AMD status. Higher plasma CML concentrations were weakly associated with AMD (P = .07). The characteristics of the participants by quartile of serum CML concentration are shown in Table 2 . Being older, being male, not smoking, having a lower BMI, and having a higher HDL cholesterol level were associated with higher quartiles of serum CML concentration. Higher triglycerides level, C-reactive protein level, and eGFR were associated with lower quartiles of CML concentration. The prevalence of diabetes was lower and the prevalence of chronic kidney disease was higher among those with higher serum CML concentration. Higher quartiles of CML concentration showed a trend toward a higher prevalence of hypertension (P = .06) and a lower prevalence of angina (P = .07). The prevalence of AMD was highest in the top quartile of serum CML concentration. There were no significant associations of total cholesterol level, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, or myocardial infarction with quartiles of serum CML concentration.\nMultivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between serum CML and any AMD (early or late AMD) or late AMD only after controlling for potential confounding ( Table 3 ). In models for the outcome of any AMD (early or late AMD), we observed no significant relationship with log CML (per 1-SD increase) after adjusting for age and sex (model 1), additionally adjusting for BMI and smoking (model 2), with the addition of eGFR (model 3), and finally with addition of diabetes, alcohol consumption, total cholesterol level, and HDL cholesterol level (model 4). There was also no significant relationship between the highest vs lowest quartiles of CML concentration in association with any AMD in multivariable models adjusting for the same covariates as described earlier. For late AMD, we observed a suggestion of an association between log CML (per 1-SD increase) when adjusting for age and sex (model 1, P = .10), but the relationship diminished after adjusting for BMI and smoking (model 2, P = .21), additionally for eGFR (model 3, P = .36), and finally with the addition of diabetes, alcohol consumption, total cholesterol level, and HDL cholesterol level (model 4, P = .14). In similar multivariable models comparing the highest quartile of CML concentration vs the lowest quartile, there was no significant relationship between serum CML concentration and late AMD. Alternative multivariable logistic regression models were explored in which either neovascular AMD or geographic atrophy was the dependent variable; serum CML concentration was not significantly associated with either form of late AMD (data not shown).

To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study to examine the relationship between a circulating AGE and AMD. The findings from this study do not corroborate a previous clinicbased study in which mean plasma CML concentrations were more than 50% higher in 58 cases with AMD (27 with early AMD and 31 with late AMD) compared with 32 control participants. 24 In our study, although mean serum CML concentrations were higher in participants with AMD compared with those without AMD, the difference in circulating CML concentration was minor (approximately 3%) and not statistically significant. The strengths of our study are that it involved a large sample with more than 1300 cases of AMD, the participants were a population-based sample of community-dwelling adults, AMD was carefully documented using standardized fundus photography and AMD grading at the University of Wisconsin Ocular Epidemiology Reading Center, and serum CML was measured using a well-characterized assay with low coefficients of variability. Serum CML is the best-characterized circulating AGE in epidemiological studies. 18 The limitations of the study are its cross-sectional design, single measurement of CML, and measurement of only a single type of circulating AGE. Specifically, other AGEs such as pentosidine and hydroimidazolone were not measured; however, previous studies show that circulating CML and pentosidine are moderately correlated. 24 The findings of this study in a white population cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other study populations. The relationship between other circulating AGEs and AMD could be explored in future studies. Elevated concentration of circulating CML has been associated with other adverse age-related outcomes such as cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, arterial stiffness, decline in skeletal muscle strength, and chronic kidney disease. 18 The factors that regulate circulating CML are not clear. Cigarette smoke is a source of AGEs, but the prevalence of current smoking was actually lower among those with higher serum CML levels. A large population-based study from Finland also found no significant association between higher serum CML levels and smoking. 34 Activation of the AGE-RAGE pathway is thought to increase inflammation, 18 but in our study, serum CML and C-reactive protein levels were inversely related. This association was not adjusted for age, sex, or other possible confounders. The lack of an association between serum CML and Creactive protein levels is consistent with the Finnish study."}, {"section_title": "34", "text": "In our study, although current smoking was higher among those with late AMD, this association was not statistically significant.
