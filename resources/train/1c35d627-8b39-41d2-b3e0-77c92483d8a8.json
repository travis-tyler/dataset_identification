The hippocampus, which is the center of learning and memory, is often one of the first regions of the brain to be damaged. It has also been shown that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers can become abnormal in the presymptomatic phase of the disease, preceding positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers followed by clinical markers (Jack Jr et al., 2010; Biagioni and Galvin, 2011) . Currently, the cause of AD is not clear, and there is no cure or effective treatment to stop its progression, but an early diagnosis of the disease, especially in the presymptomatic stages, can provide time to treat symptoms and plan for the future. However, early diagnosis of AD is Figure 1: An illustration of how the proposed method (red curves) tackles the existing biomarker curve fitting problems. Left: A flexible function is used to better fit the asymmetric shape of the data points. Middle: A constrained function is utilized to estimate the exact dynamic of the biomarker considering its known lower and upper asymptotes. Right: A robust estimator is applied to fit a curve to data contaminated with outliers.\nchallenging mainly because elderly subjects under study can suffer from different age-related pathologies and normal aging besides AD. Therefore, methods to stage and identify at-risk individuals are critical to dementia research.\nDisease progression modeling use longitudinal studies to develop data-driven quantitative models that describe the evolution of the disease over time. The approach can therefore provide a complete perspective of the disease by computationally exploring the available data to help with better understanding of the disease for diagnostic, staging, monitorization, and prognostic purposes. Parametric disease progression modeling methods can be divided into two categories, continuous fitting for modeling the dynamic of biomarkers and discrete ordering for abnormality detection of biomarkers, both relying on unsupervised learning, e.g., by using maximum-likelihood estimation. The goal of the continuous approaches is to model biomarker values as a function of disease progression (Jedynak et al., 2012; Oxtoby and Alexander, 2017) . The discrete approaches, on the other hand, focus on temporally ordering of biomarkers becoming abnormal during the disease stages by discretizing the disease progression trajectory using generative, event-based models subjected to a number of assumptions (Fonteijn et al., 2012; Venkatraghavan et al., 2019) .\nContinuous, data-driven Alzheimer's disease progression modeling has been inspired by the hypothetical models assuming sigmoidal evolution of AD biomarkers (Jack Jr et al., 2010 . Accordingly, a variety of approaches have been applied to fit a continuous function to the longitudinal dynamic of each biomarker using statistical models such as differential equations and mixed-effects models (Oxtoby et al., 2014; Yau et al., 2015; Guerrero et al., 2016) , in which one needs to align the trajectory of individuals based on some time measure, e.g., time-toconversion or years-to-onset. These methods are simple and require less data, but parametric assumptions on the biomarker trajectories limit the flexibility of the fits.\nRecently, nonparametric disease progression modeling methods has been introduced to model biomarkers jointly while taking temporal dependencies among measurements into account (Lorenzi et al., 2017; Ghazi et al., 2019) . These methods are flexible, make less assumption for modeling, and do not require alignment of the trajectories of the individuals. On the other hand, they are less interpretable, need a lot of multidimensional data for successful training, and cannot simply be applied to predict the test data when it includes missing or irregular visits, or when it has fewer biomarkers than what is used to train the network. Jedynak et al. (2012 Jedynak et al. ( , 2015 proposed a parametric algorithm, which requires less time-series data to train and incorporates information from multiple biomarkers for modeling progression of AD over a common disease timescale. The method linearly transforms the chronological age of individual to a disease progression score (DPS) for timewise alignment of within-cohort measurements, assuming that the visit intervals in the data under study are short relative to the disease duration. Alternating least squares is used to fit a sigmoid function to the longitudinal dynamic of each biomarker. The model results in a reasonable approximation for normal or cognitively impaired subjects; however, it is not robust to outliers that can be found in a more contaminated data and does not generalize well for AD patients due to lack of data covering severe AD.\nIn this paper, a robust extension of Jedynak et al. (2012 Jedynak et al. ( , 2015 is proposed that fits a constrained generalized logistic function to the longitudinal dynamic of each biomarker using M-estimation to address potential curve fitting problems in the biomarker modeling. Figure 1 illustrates 1) how the use of a generalized logistic function improves the curve flexibility, 2) how the use of a constrained function moves asymptotes and ensures the full biomarker range fitting, and 3) how the use of M-estimation reduces the influence of outliers. The estimated parameters are quantified using bootstrapping via Monte Carlo resampling, and the inflection points are used to temporally order the biomarkers in the disease course. In addition, kernel density estimation with normal bases is applied to the estimated DPSs for clinical status prediction using a Bayesian classifier. Different logistic functions, including a new generalized type proposed in this study called modified Stannard, and loss functions are applied to AD progression modeling of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center (NACC) (Beekly et al., 2007 ) data using volumetric MRI biomarkers, PET measurements, and neuropsychological tests. The obtained results indicate that the proposed generalized logistic function (modified Stannard) fitted using the modified Huber loss achieves the best modeling performance over different bootstraps, and it consistently outperforms the basic algorithm of Jedynak et al. (2012 Jedynak et al. ( , 2015 in all the considered experiments.\nThe main contribution of this study is four-fold. First, the introduction of different generalized logistic functions including the new type proposed in this study called modified Stannard allows for more flexibility, e.g., asymmetry, improving the biomarker trajectory modeling capabilities of the method compared to using a standard sigmoid function. Second, the use of M-estimation suppresses the effect of outliers on the fit. Third, the across-cohort generalizability of the proposed model is evaluated by applying the model trained using ADNI data to the test data from the NACC cohort. Finally, an end-to-end approach is introduced that performs biomarker trajectory modeling (unsupervised learning), biomarker's significant change detection (event ordering), and clinical status prediction (supervised learning). This is a holistic way to implement a system suitable for both research and clinical applications to better study and monitor AD."}, {"section_title": "The proposed method", "text": "The main objective of this work is to minimize the error of parametric disease progression modeling while making the estimates stable and robust to outliers. This is achieved by fitting a constrained generalized logistic function using a maximum likelihood type estimator (M-estimator)."}, {"section_title": "Modeling dynamics of biomarkers", "text": "Similar to Jedynak et al. (2012 Jedynak et al. ( , 2015 , two sets of parameters are estimated in the model: observed biomarkerspecific parameters, which are assigned for fitting the biomarker curves, and hidden subject-specific (age-related) disease progression parameters that are defined for aligning the trajectory of subjects. Assume that y i,j,k is the k-th biomarker's value at the j-th visit of the i-th subject and f (s; \u03b8) is an S-shaped logistic function of DPS s with parameters \u03b8. Each biomarker measurement is defined as\nwhere \u03c3 k is the standard deviation of the k-th biomarker with \u03b8 k parameters, i,j,k is additive white Gaussian noise (random effect) with i.i.d. assumption, and s i,j is the DPS for the j-th visit of the i-th subject and is obtained as\nwhere t i,j is the chronological age of subject i in visit j, and \u03b1 i \u2208 R >0 and \u03b2 i \u2208 R are the rate and onset of disease progression of subject i, respectively. Finally, the objective function for robust nonlinear regression is defined as {\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b8,\u03c3} = min\nwhere \u03c1(\u00b7) is a maximum likelihood type function. For fitting the longitudinal trajectories of biomarkers, four logistic functions are considered (Table 1 ). All functions have the same range (0, 1) and can produce the same inflection points at c \u2208 R, to be used for biomarker ordering. We candidate utilization of a flexible logistic function obtained by modifying Stannard function (Stannard et al., 1985) so as to create an asymmetric growth curve with an inflection point at c. In the defined functions, b \u2208 R >0 and \u03b3 \u2208 R >0 denote the growth rate and symmetry parameter of the curves, respectively. The reason for restricting b to the positive real numbers is to make parameters of the estimation identifiable.\nIt can also be deducted from Table 1 that the sigmoid function first introduced by Verhulst (Verhulst, 1845 ) is a special (symmetric) case of both Richards' function (Richards, 1959) and the proposed function when \u03b3 = 1. Moreover, Gompertz's function (Gompertz, 1825 ) is a simplified form of Richards' function when \u03b3 approaches zero, i.e., lim \u03b3\u21920 (1 + \u03b3u) \u22121/\u03b3 = e \u2212u . Finally, the upper and lower asymptotes of the curves can be adjusted by two additional parameters (Zwietering et al., 1990 ) as "}, {"section_title": "Logistic function", "text": "The range parameters, a and d, are set to fixed values corresponding to the pre-defined range of biomarkers, which is almost always the case for neuropsychological tests.

This way, there is no need to optimize the objective function for the standard deviation of biomarkers \u03c3 k , and they can be obtained when the biomarker-specific parameters are estimated. The proposed algorithm can be summarized as follows Initialization: initialize {\u03b1 (0) , \u03b2 (0) , \u03b8 (0) } and update them by iteratively applying linear least squares regression to fit the dynamics of biomarkers while linearly mapping ages to DPSs in an alternating scheme. Optimization: iterate l until convergence.\nBiomarker fitting: estimate the biomarker-specific parameters using values of all subjects and visits.\nAge mapping: estimate the subject-specific parameters using values of all biomarkers and visits.\nwhere I k , N k , and N i correspond to the number of subjects available for the k-th biomarker, number of measurements among all subjects and visits available for the Loss function\n1.2107\nk-th biomarker, and number of measurements among all biomarkers and visits available for the i-th subject, respectively. Moreover, |\u03b8 k | denotes the number of biomarkerspecific parameters for the k-th biomarker,\u03c3 k is called the generalized M-scale estimator (Van Aelst et al., 2013) for the k-th biomarker, and N k \u2212 |\u03b8 k | \u2212 2I k represents the degrees of freedom of the k-th fit. Therefore, the algorithm can be applied in case any subject has at least two distinct points considering all biomarkers and visits, and if any biomarker contains more than |\u03b8 k | + 2I k points considering all subjects and visits. The utilized maximum likelihood type functions for robust regression (Holland and Welsch, 1977; Pennacchi, 2008) are described in Table 2 . These estimators attempt to diminish influence of the outliers while fitting curves. In general, M-estimators use a tuning parameter called \u03c4 to scale the functions as \u03c4 2 \u03c1(r/\u03c4 ) in order to yield 95% asymptotic efficiency with respect to the standard normal distribution. The corresponding tuning constants for the utilized functions are also reported in Table 2 .\nFinally, the obtained DPSs are standardized with respect to the scores of the available cognitively normal visits of subjects in order to calibrate all biomarker trajectories in different experiments. This process removes mean of the normal visits' distribution of DPSs and scales the range to give a better intuition of timing of disease progression in the course of AD. In this case, it would be necessary to properly update the parameters as\nwhere \u00b5 cn and \u03c3 cn are the mean and standard deviation of the DPSs in the available cognitively normal visits of subjects, respectively."}, {"section_title": "Biomarker value prediction", "text": "Biomarker values can be predicted using the fitted model parameters.

To overcome both aforementioned problems of difference in software (version) and head size, we employ the residual approach (O'Brien et al., 2011) based on the analysis of covariance, which takes data from control groups and linearly regresses MRI volumes on their corresponding ICV as a covariate of interest.

As it can be noticed from the obtained results, the previously selected configuration for ADNI data is also a good choice when applied to NACC data. Moreover, both modeling performance of the proposed method and the state-of-theart model of Jedynak et al. (2015) significantly improve (p < 0.001) by applying the ADNI-trained model to the NACC test set by average MMAEs of 0.0053 and 0.0045, respectively. That is, not only does the ADNI-trained model generalize across cohorts, it also improves the performance compared to using the NACC-trained model. One reason for the improvement could be the relatively larger size of the ADNI data and its additional biomarkers providing a better foundation for robust modeling of biomarkers. The results also show that the proposed model significantly outperforms (p < 0.001) the state-of-the-art model of Jedynak et al. (2015) in all cases.\nAdditionally, we apply the ADNI and NACC trained models to the estimated test NACC DPSs to predict clinical status per subject per visit. The proposed model achieves MAUCs of 0.83 \u00b1 0.05 and 0.84 \u00b1 0.01 in predicting clinical status of the test NACC subjects per visit when the trained NACC and trained ADNI models are applied, respectively. This also reveals that the diagnostic performance improves by applying the ADNI-trained model to the NACC test set."}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "text": "In this paper, a robust parametric model of Alzheimer's disease progression was proposed based on alternating M-estimation using the modified Huber loss that linearly transformed individuals' chronological ages to disease progression scores and fitted a novel generalized logistic function to the longitudinal dynamic of each biomarker. The estimated parameters were then used to temporally order the biomarkers in the disease course and to predict the test biomarker values as well as the clinical status per subject visit. The obtained results showed the superiority of the proposed method over the analogous state-of-the-art model proposed by Jedynak et al. (2015) in terms of prediction performance and generalizability.\nThe proposed approach can be applied to different timeseries data including missing points and labels, or to biomarkers with other characteristics than the monotonic behavior that one typically encounters in MRI-based neurodegenerative disease progression modeling as long as suitable functions are used for the biomarker modeling. Moreover, as an alternative to using M-estimators, resistant estimators such as the least trimmed sum of squares and least median of squares (Rousseeuw and Leroy, 1987) with higher breakdown points can be used instead in the algorithm to fit biomarkers. However, this will result in an additional parameter to be optimized for the coverage (range) needed for trimming the residuals."}]
