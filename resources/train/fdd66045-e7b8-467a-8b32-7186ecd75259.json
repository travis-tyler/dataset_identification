Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 20 AD risk genes. The precise mechanism through which many of these genes are associated with AD remains unknown. \nThe study tested the association of AD risk allele carrier status (exposure) with florbetapir mean standard uptake value ratio (outcome) using stepwise multivariable linear regression while controlling for age, sex, and apolipoprotein E \u03b54 genotype.

The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) gene had the strongest association with amyloid deposition (\u03c7 2 = 8.38, false discovery rate-corrected P < .001), after apolioprotein E \u03b54. Significant associations were found between ABCA7 in the asymptomatic and early symptomatic disease stages, suggesting an association with rapid amyloid accumulation. The fermitin family homolog 2 (FERMT2) gene had a stage-dependent association with brain amyloidosis (FERMT2 \u00d7 diagnosis \u03c7 2 = 3.53, false discovery rate-corrected P = .05), which was most pronounced in the mild cognitive impairment stage.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found an association of several AD risk variants with brain amyloidosis. The data also suggest that AD genes might differentially regulate AD pathologic findings across the disease stages."}, {"section_title": "", "text": "S poradic Alzheimer disease (AD) is 70% to 80% heritable. 1, 2 The strongest genetic risk factor for AD is the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene (OMIM 107741) . The APOE \u03b54 allele carries the greatest risk through the reduction of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) clearance. [3] [4] [5] APOE \u03b54 carriers have a significantly higher prevalence of Pittsburgh compound B uptake than noncarriers across all disease stages, 6 including presymptomatic amyloidosis in cognitively normal control individuals. 7 Peripheral blood apoE protein levels correlate with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) binding. 8, 9 These data indicate that imaging phenotypes can provide meaningful information related to gene function and pathophysiologic findings. Previous large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] have identified and validated 20 novel AD genetic risk loci. Few of these loci are in or near genes associated with A\u03b2 aggregation and clearance and are thought to influence amyloid deposition. 15, 16 For the remainder, the precise disease-associated mechanism remains unknown. Several imaging genetics studies [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] have reported associations of some of the AD risk genes with brain amyloidosis or neurodegeneration. Phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) (OMIM 603025) rs3851179, bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) (OMIM 601248) rs7561528, complement component receptor 1 (CR1) rs1408077 (OMIM 120620), adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily A member7(ABCA7) (OMIM 605414) rs3764650, and membranespanning 4-domains, subfamily A, member 6a (MS4A6A) (OMIM 606548) rs610932 are associated with cortical and hippocampal atrophy. 21,22 ABCA7 rs3764650 and rs3752246; BIN1 rs744373; CR1 rs6701713, rs3818361, and rs6656401; and clusterin (CLU) rs3818361 (OMIM 185430) are associated with amyloid deposition. Although these studies enrich the imaging genetics field, they also have significant shortcomings. Many of these research studies have focused on a single variant 19 or a few variants [16] [17] [18] [22] [23] [24] [25] while ignoring the complex polygenic disease background. In addition, all analyses of geneendophenotype associations to date have largely used averaged phenotypic records across all disease stages. Such an approach is justified if the risk variant has a static or conserved effect during the disease course. However, considering the complicated and constantly evolving disease pathophysiologic process with early amyloid deposition, later onset of neuronal degeneration, and variable degree of inflammation, we considered stage-dependent genetic associations. Furthermore, improved understanding of the polygenetic risk factors for AD could enable personalized risk assessment, whereas an indepth characterization of disease-associated mechanism could lead to new therapeutic avenues.\nWe report a comprehensive analysis of the associations of all well-validated AD risk variants with brain amyloidosis. Our goal was to establish their relative contribution to the amyloid burden. We hypothesized that our multivariable analytic approach would help us more accurately model the probability distribution of our imaging outcome measure and that we would detect several genetic variants in addition to APOE \u03b54 that are associated with brain amyloidosis. In addition, we hypothesized that we might also find stage-dependent associations with amyloid accumulation."}, {"section_title": "Methods", "text": ""}, {"section_title": "Participants", "text": "Data used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (http://adni .loni.usc.edu).

Several genes had associations with brain amyloidosis.

Another strength of the study is the fairly large sample size that allowed us to achieve enough statistical power to test the associations of 27 AD-associated risk variants using a polygenic model. A major limitation of our study is that we only report crosssectional analyses; thus, we cannot make definitive conclusions regarding genetic effects on amyloid deposition over time. From our cross-sectional observations across the disease continuum, we drew conclusions about early vs late genetic influences on brain amyloidosis that will need to be further tested using a longitudinal design, which is what we plan to do next. Another limitation of our work is that the sample size was not big enough to allow us to test for gene-gene and geneenvironment interactions.
