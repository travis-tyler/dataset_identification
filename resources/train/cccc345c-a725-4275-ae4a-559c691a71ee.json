[{"section_title": "OBJECTIVES:", "text": "To evaluate the prevalence of smoking behavior among university students in Pakistan. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted in two provinces, KPK and Punjab of Pakistan. Only smoking students' population of the universities were included. Six univerties were included in the study from four cities of these two provinces. These cities were selected for study as they can provide ethnic mix of student response residing in these areas. A total of 750 questionnaires were administered out of which 524 questionnaire were received giving the response rate of 69.8% of which 419 were males and 105 were females from different universities. RESULTS: Among 524 respondents, 419 were male and 105 were female students. Students were recruited regarding socio-demographic factors, smoking history of students, their families, friends and class fellows/roommates and place of residence. Students having family history of smoking (23.87% of males; 34.29% of females), roommates (21% of males; 5.71% females), close friends (57.51% of males; 54.28% of females) and class fellows (37.23% of males; F\u03ed36.19% of females) were significantly associated with smoking. Public health awareness on media and warnings printed on tobacco products (cigarettes and flavors) had no statistically significant association with respondents' continuation, and cessation status. CONCLUSIONS: The Shisha smokers thought that shisha smoking is less harmful than cigarette smoking. It is suggested that the factors which influence Pakistani students to smoke may not be significantly different from counties with a broader evidence base. There is a need to adopt the provisions of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) with respect to smoke free places, public education and treatment for tobacco cessation. Steps should betaken by the government to increase people's awareness on the health hazards of tobacco smoking (Shisha and cigerretes) and to prevent young generation from smoking. \nThe study evaluated predictors of willingness to quit smoking among cigarette smokers in India. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted in a cohort of adults aged \u054618 years in India. The outcome variable, willingness to quit smoking was dichotomized. Indepen-dent variables included socio-demographic characteristics, behavioral and environmental determinants of smoking like past quit attempts, smoking status of peers and social pressure. SAS(9.2v) was used to determine frequencies and chisquare analyses followed by Fisher's exact test and stepwise logistic regression to determine predictors of willingness to quit. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 456 smokers (response rate 41.3%) among which 253 (54%) were willing to quit smoking. Almost 60% of smokers willing to quit were males, 53.3% had a bachelor's degree, 81.4% were married, 46.6% belonged to the \u03fe$10,000/yr-\u0545$20,000/yr income category and 43.8% to 30-39 years age category. More than 50% had nonsmoking peers. Majority (88.8%) had very low addiction levels and 40% attempted to quit at least once in their lifetime. Bivariate analysis indicated that age (p\u03ed0.002), education (p\u03ed0.009), siblings' smoking status (p\u03fd0.0001), number of smoking friends (p\u03fd0.0001), age of initiation (p\u03ed0.03), past quit attempts (p\u03fd0.0001) and social pressure (p\u03ed0.006) were associated with willingness to quit. Fisher's exact test demonstrated that past quit attempts of 3 (p\u03fd0.0001; OR\u03ed2.55; 95%CI\u03ed1.59-4.06) or \u05464 (p\u03fd0.0001; OR\u03ed33.14; 95%CI\u03ed7.87-139.63), close friends (p\u03ed0.002; OR\u03ed1.86; 95%CI\u03ed1.24-2.75), siblings being non-smokers (p\u03fd0.001; OR\u03ed3.05; 95%CI\u03ed2.07-4.45), and few smoking friends (p\u03fd0.001; OR\u03ed2.81; 95%CI\u03ed1.73-4.56) were predictors of willingness to quit. Logistic regression indicated that smokers aged 40-49 (p\u03ed0.02; OR\u03ed2.06; 95%CI\u03ed1.13-3.75), 50-59 years (p\u03ed0.02; OR\u03ed9.43; 95%CI\u03ed1.13-79.87), and faced with social pressure (p\u03ed0.02; OR\u03ed2.05; 95%CI\u03ed1.07-3.9) were willing to quit. CONCLUSIONS: Research on interventions targeting smokers willing to quit such as those facing social pressure or older smokers, would prove beneficial for them to permanently quit smoking.\nThe objectives of this study were to examine the trends of child obesity and changes in BMI over time and to analyze the effect of child obesity on asthma. METHODS: The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) data from the U.S. Department of Education identified 14,188 children in the 3rd grade who were followed through 3 waves (3rd, 5th and 8th grade). Dichotomized weight group (obese vs. non-obese), based on body mass index (BMI) using the 2000 sex-specific CDC growth charts for the United States, was included in the sample weight-adjusted cross-sectional logistic analyses and a panel fixed effects (FE) model for having asthma. RESULTS: We detected a gradual increase in the mean BMI and prevalence of obesity over time. Significant differences were observed for obesity and asthma rate among male and female groups in the 3rd grade (p\u03fd0.05). In cross-sectional analyses, obesity and gender were significantly associated with having asthma for each grade level while adjusting for other demographic covariates (all p\u03fd0.05), indicating that children who are obese or male were more likely to have asthma. Approximately 70% of children stayed within the same weight category from 3rd to 8th grade. FE model showed a significant time effect where odds of having asthma increased 3.31 times from 3rd to 5th grade while controlling for child obesity (95% CI: 2.89-3.80). Child obesity and the interaction term between time effect and child obesity had no significant effect on asthma although the sign of estimate for child obesity indicated an increase in risk for asthma. CONCLUSIONS: We found a risk association between child obesity and asthma in cross-sectional analyses but the effect of obesity on asthma was not significant in a panel data FE model. Future research with a model using an instrumental variable is warranted to control for endogeneity associated with obesity. Pharmaceuticals,Inc.,Marlborough,MA,USA,2 Premier Healthcare Alliance,Charlotte,NC,USA,3 Mount Sinai Hospital,New York,NY,USA OBJECTIVES: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a major public health issue and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. High frequency of exacerbations can lead to rapid decline in lung function in COPD patients. The study objective was to evaluate 30-day readmission rates among COPD patients who received arformoterol, a nebulized long-acting beta agonist, or nebulized short-acting beta agonists (neb-SABA) during an inpatient stay. METHODS: Data from the Premier Database, a US nationally representative hospital database, were used. The study included adult inpatients aged 40 and older, discharged between January 2006 and March 2010, having a principal diagnosis code for COPD 492.xx,496) or secondary COPD diagnosis with a principal respiratory diagnosis. Patients receiving arformoterol daily on \u054680% of days following initiation were compared to patients receiving only neb-SABA during hospitalization. Arformoterol patients were matched 1:2 with Neb-SABA patients on age, gender, severity of illness, and principal/secondary COPD diagnosis. Chi-square tests were used to evaluate differences in unadjusted readmission rates. Multivariate logistic regression was performed, adjusting for age, gender, race, admission type, severity, principal/secondary COPD diagnosis, use of other respiratory drugs and respiratory therapy, oxygen use, and hospital size and teaching status. RESULTS: The final sample included 812 arformoterol patients and 1651 Neb-SABA patients who had not died during the initial COPD visit. ICU use, which was not a match criterion, was greater among arformoterol patients (35.5% vs. 19.9%, p\u03fd0.0001), possibly indicating greater disease burden.
